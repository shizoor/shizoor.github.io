1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
We're still at the X-Day drill.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,320
We decided not to leave.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,000
Your brothers from out of space

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,240
are coming with advanced knowledge

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,200
to help human race!

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,400
Bob will save all true believers, though, in 1998, right?

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,640
Actually, Bob, you better hope that Bob does some wheeling and dealing

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,280
for your soul come 1998.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,240
He is the salesman of the universe here to make sure that Earth

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,400
and your soul does not get sold to the robot mutilators.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,240
At least for not too low a price.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,420
So you better read that book with all three I's

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,000
or however many you have left

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,560
and leave the driving to Bob.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,360
That's right.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,180
You do the walking.

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,400
Let Bob do the talking.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,040
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,940
What is waiting there for me?

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,260
Bob.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,420
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry,

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,720
Hour of Slack,

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,200
sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,740
Welcome.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,780
The elder gods have been sleeping, but they're waking up.

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,880
And you've got to find that word of Bob before it's too late,

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,740
before 1998, July 5th, the end of the world,

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,440
the end of time as we know it.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,580
When the very, very...

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,180
The score is racked up.

31
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,240
The score is racked up, and it's the time and a half time.

32
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,960
Yes, sir.

33
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,520
We just won't have a chance.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,560
They'll be able to have their ways with us.

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,200
The smallpox blankets and the Indians, you know,

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,380
well, this is going to be technological viral infection.

37
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,000
We're going to have to do this to an entire planet

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,600
with means of doing things, means of destruction,

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,520
means of alteration of genetic patterns,

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,700
means of controlling people's minds that we don't even...

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,500
To us, it's magic.

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,840
Any significantly advanced form of science becomes magic.

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,100
If the smoke comes out of Bob's pipe no more,

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,360
then we shall be reduced to that can of warm beer

45
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,800
under the bed of a hungover elder god at 11.30 on a Sunday morning.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,660
Bob is here to make sure that instead of it being the end of the world,

47
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,460
it's the end of their world.

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,620
The new Jerusalem where slack begins.

49
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,660
Yes, the streets will be paved with slack.

50
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,280
Slack will drop gently from the sky.

51
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,920
Slack will ooze out of the pores of the faithful.

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,280
The tribulation money will fall from the flying saucers.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,380
Yes, it will all be flooding around.

54
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,380
There's little green rays coming out of our feet.

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,700
That's why we tell the public to throw their money away.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,580
It's no good.

57
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,280
Currency is just going to be flying down from flying saucers.

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,920
Or give it to Bob.

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,480
You give it to Bob while it's still good.

60
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,180
You cash in that money while it's still good.

61
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,480
People are just going to be bringing all their money to Bob.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,060
When the end of the world is upon us, it's going to be too late.

63
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,780
When those tribulation times come down, that subgenius pamphlet,

64
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
especially if you've got a white copy.

65
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,760
Now, if you've got a white copy and a brown copy, it's a little bit of a difference.

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,600
But they're both worth more than a bundle of $1,000 treasury bills a foot high.

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,440
There will be people trading.

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,800
They're trading paragraphs of that pamphlet for boxcars full of food.

69
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,040
We think it will replace currency.

70
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,480
Bob will replace drugs, religion, rock music, and everything

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,840
in a great paradise of unrestrained sales, unrestrained slack and sex.

72
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,900
And if you have any drug users in your audience,

73
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,540
we should note that the book of the subgenius we found in a test

74
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,920
that was conducted in Austin recently,

75
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,820
that if adulterated street drugs are thrown on top of the cover,

76
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,080
all of the...

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,160
none narcotic qualities are completely erased

78
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,740
and indicated as negative and destroyed.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,560
All impurities are removed.

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,020
All impurities are removed, giving you that 1% of pure that you paid for

81
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
out of whatever it was that you were...

82
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,840
By the way...

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,740
That's better than pyramid.

84
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,620
Yes, much better than pyramid power.

85
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,520
I'd like to say those...

86
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,140
Because it's in a plane rather than going to a point.

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,380
Book of the subgenius.

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,760
That's it.

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,980
Book of the subgenius.

90
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,020
From the bellow, everyone knows...

91
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,120
Bob!

92
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,720
Bob!

93
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,540
Bob!

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes, Bob.

95
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,020
Hey, man, that is one strange dude.

96
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,220
Who is it?

97
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,540
One strange dude.

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,840
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.

99
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,180
Oh, that's crazy talk.

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,180
But friends, you know, our critics have some people worrying now and then

101
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,160
that the church might become corrupt.

102
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,460
The church of the subgenius might become corrupted by the conspiracy

103
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,260
and there'd have to be a replacement for it.

104
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,700
What?

105
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,660
Hey, friends, I tell you, we don't have to worry about that.

106
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,260
Because the true church, the true church of the subgenius

107
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,600
is going to be up in the saucers.

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,920
The pinks won't have to worry about even seeing the subgeniuses again.

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,960
There'll be all kinds of cheap cults and spin-offs left behind,

110
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,400
just like the cargo cults among the last mutated remnants of humanity.

111
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,060
And also, there'll be subgeniuses left.

112
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,760
The subgeniuses who didn't think they really needed that $20 membership card.

113
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,300
Did we just have a power failure?

114
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,140
I believe we did.

115
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,180
Yeah, those who, as I was saying...

116
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,300
Excuse me, friends, we're having serious, strange poltergeist effects

117
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,200
in here as the lights flicker on and off.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,780
Yeah, anyway, there'll be some subgeniuses left behind.

119
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,060
The ones who didn't think they needed...

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,220
They didn't think they needed that $20 membership card.

121
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,760
The ones who tattooed Bob's face all over their whole bodies.

122
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,700
The ones who put...

123
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,820
They might have put Bob on national TV.

124
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,060
They might have donated their whole estate to us,

125
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,120
but they never sent...

126
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,900
They never sent their $20.

127
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,020
Now, it might be confusing a bit to those left behind after the rupture.

128
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,760
Because the rupture happens for different people in different ways.

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,060
A lot of subgeniuses, when they undergo the rupture,

130
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,060


131
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,020
what, the people standing around and back on Earth,

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,480
it looks like a burning monk or spontaneous combustion.

133
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,880
They just burst into flames and scream and scream.

134
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,300
It's the most horrible, painful-looking thing in the world.

135
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,180
But of course, that, friends, that's just the image.

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,300
That's just sort of the hologram, the body being left behind.

137
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,320
Just the shell.

138
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,380
Because on next day, when you are ruptured, no matter how it looks,

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,060
you know, your youthful, perfect body is being recreated.

140
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,200
On the vessels of the sex goddesses.

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,200
And a thousand clones of kitten on TV dot are gonna...

142
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,740
Well, I...

143
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,260
Friends, when you get on that escape vessel,

144
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,940
every person you ever had a crush on since elementary school

145
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,740
is gonna be there ready to have sex with you.

146
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,940
Either that or else simulacra of those people.

147
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,100
It might as well be the same.

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,260
Because the sex goddesses, you see,

149
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,020
can change their form completely and totally.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,960
First, you'll...

151
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,720
There'll be the...

152
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,180
Say, the girl you had a crush on in first grade.

153
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,560
Well, now she's at a perfect...

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,520
She's perfect and healthy at age 25, of course, you know.

155
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,260
And when she leaves,

156
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,480
why, in walks the girl you had a crush on in second grade.

157
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,820
Or here's that boy you had a crush on when you were 13

158
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,200
and he almost kissed you, but now he's gonna do it.

159
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
And he's still wearing a mask.

160
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,060
He's wearing the same clothes that he did at the prom.

161
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,800
Or that milkman or babysitter that you lusted after.

162
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,680
They'll all be there.

163
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,640
The sex goddesses tap your mind.

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,320
It's not really people.

165
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,620
It's part of the muam system,

166
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,340
the...

167
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,660
A biomorphic toy that conforms to the fleshly configurations

168
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,160
to satisfy any kind of lust you might have.

169
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,000
And they can preguess what you're about to think, friends.

170
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,260
They can sense a desire percolating up in your mind

171
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,160
and just, for instance, just a few seconds before you think of it,

172
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,560
that zap comic that you always wanted to read a second time,

173
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,100
what just happens to be over there in the pile.

174
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,340
And you lay back and you think,

175
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,060
man, this is great.

176
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,480
If only I had a frop stick.

177
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
Well, here's a frop stick.

178
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,080
Because muam and the biomorphs and the sex goddesses

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,780
can anticipate your every wish.

180
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,940
They can whiff a desire coming on.

181
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,020
And you'll think, now, if I could just...

182
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,240
um...

183
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,400
meet up with that...

184
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,620
that haughty librarian at that one college I went to

185
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,000
while I'm reading this comic.

186
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,000
And sure enough, in she comes through the door.

187
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,800
Well, if only she'd dance, you think.

188
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,440
Oh, if only she had a small whip.

189
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,660
And it happens.

190
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,540
As you think about it, there's no limit.

191
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,700
No limit at all.

192
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,420
And, oh, if only she'd give me a ham sandwich first.

193
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
Ah, yes, now I'm...

194
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,120
And you'll sit there and think to yourself,

195
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,360
you know, I can't believe there was a time

196
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,080
when I wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks.

197
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,720
You're sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich,

198
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,680
getting a scarf job from that biomorph,

199
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,120
watching widescreen color TV Elvis movies,

200
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,080
and thinking, how could I ever have wondered?

201
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,860
How could I ever have doubted Bob for a second?

202
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,320
And to think of poor Bubba,

203
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,460
my brother Bubba back there on Earth,

204
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,820
the guy that said, hell, send them $20?

205
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,340
That's just what they want you to do.

206
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,840
I'll pump gas for $2.38 an hour the rest of my life

207
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,680
before I'd send a dollar to that damn sub-gum church.

208
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,280
Oh, yeah.

209
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,100
Well, it's hard times for Bubba now, friends.

210
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,060
Yeah, just when you're thinking about old Bubba,

211
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,220
the one that didn't want to join the church,

212
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,580
well, the TV on this escape vessel in front of you lights up,

213
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,840
and there's this shot of Bubba down there

214
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,660
eating a rotten rat and hiding from the death machines

215
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,320
that the rogue pinks,

216
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,700
made from the stolen womb parts.

217
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,980
And Bubba will be down there muttering to himself,

218
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,260
oh, how could I do it? I was so stupid.

219
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,560
I could have been saved, but no, I didn't send my $20.

220
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,940
Oh, God, here comes another rogue beast.

221
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,220
And here I am in this festering pile of rat waste

222
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,940
and dead people and stripped bare skulls.

223
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,200
If only I could die. If only I could die.

224
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,060
But I can't. I can't.

225
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,680
Why, if only Bob was here now,

226
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
I'd give him my $20.

227
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,660
I'd give him $40.

228
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,280
I'd give you everything I own, Bob, please.

229
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,140
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob.

230
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,240
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs, didn't trust him $20 worth.

231
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,220
Okay, fine, fine, no skin off our teeth.

232
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,520
Pay lip service, wear that Bob T-shirt, be real hip.

233
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,540
But when those saucers come,

234
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,660
heh, well, you're either on the bus,

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,980
or you're off the bus,

236
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,400
as those great proto-sub-genii used to say.

237
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,800
And the dumbest nerd could get on the bus for $20.

238
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,920
Well, actually, those $20 don't count.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,980
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade for.

240
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,500
But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are,

241
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,820
at least made it possible for their betters

242
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,740
to ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

243
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,680
And there'll be an orientation film

244
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,320
that they'll show you when you're ruptured up.

245
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,720
You know, because otherwise it might be kind of confusing.

246
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,820
This orientation film is kind of projected into your head.

247
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,480
It's introduced by Princess We Are Doe,

248
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,340
queen of all the UFOs,

249
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,940
who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon

250
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,440
slash Viking Brunhilde

251
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,560
with metal pointed breastplates

252
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,400
and a horned helmet

253
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,220
and all this UFO insignia or anything.

254
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,540
And she is the mistress of the path of least resistance.

255
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,940
And she narrates this film,

256
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,540
and it's like,

257
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,440
you will hear and obey.

258
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,500
Take off your clothes.

259
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,140
And you can watch the...

260
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,080
You can either watch the orientation film

261
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,760
or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day

262
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,260
or you can just, you know,

263
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,900
go back to having your fun

264
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,700
with the different simulacra

265
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,740
and sex goddesses and so forth.

266
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,800
And, of course, your sweetheart's gonna be doing the same thing, too.

267
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,880
But because it's in...

268
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,800
Because it's on those...

269
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,480
those spaceships on the...

270
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,060
on inside the escape vessels,

271
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,540
it's...

272
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,820
There's no time and no sense of jealousy.

273
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,980
It's...

274
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,160
You'll always...

275
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,400
It's like...

276
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,220
There's no sense of possessiveness

277
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,580
because on that...

278
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,840
in that no zone of the saucers,

279
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,520
time ceases to exist,

280
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,720
or at least it feels that way.

281
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
And you don't need to be grasping anymore

282
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,920
like you did on Earth.

283
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,920
The overwhelming feeling that you have,

284
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,700
the feeling that you get on the...

285
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,340
on the escape vessels is like,

286
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,160
wow, the best part is

287
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,580
it lasts as long as I want it to

288
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,040
and I can take forever.

289
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,760
I'm immortal for now.

290
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,280
And I don't have the...

291
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,160
the urge to grab this and keep it

292
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,700
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing.

293
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,840
I don't have to kill or defeat another monkey man

294
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,060
to hang on to these...

295
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,060
these big round soft things.

296
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,860
I'll have plenty of time to get to those other

297
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,600
big soft round things,

298
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,240
more than I could ever use.

299
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,900
And my pipe overfloweth

300
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,820
and the big round soft things

301
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,120
shall follow me through the land of Dobbs

302
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,640
and I will dwell in the cleft

303
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,980
in between forever.

304
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,480
It's like, oh, how were your multiple partners today, dear?

305
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,980
Oh, big and round and soft.

306
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,460
Ah, yes.

307
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,300
And there's...

308
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,340
But people ask so many questions.

309
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,900
I say, well,

310
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,580
well, Reverend Stang,

311
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,380
is there just one giant saucer

312
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,740
or is it a bunch of regional saucers,

313
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,280
you know, like an East Coast saucer

314
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,140
and a West Coast saucer?

315
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,840
No, there's a million kinds of saucers, friends,

316
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,320
but it's...

317
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,420
it's like virtual reality.

318
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,300
So once you're inside one of them,

319
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,820
you might as well be in all of them.

320
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,220
You might as well be on Planet X.

321
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,860
You're not in normal space.

322
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,980
You can sort of phase to the other saucers

323
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,500
or find your friends telepathically.

324
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,020
And go, oh, I think I'll go to the Chinese saucer today

325
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,560
or I'll go to the gay and lesbian saucer.

326
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,100
Gee, I always wanted to try being a lesbian female.

327
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,560
But meanwhile, those who are left behind,

328
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,100
which is 99% of the population

329
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,960
and probably 90% of the subgeniuses,

330
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,120
all those who didn't send,

331
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,120
they're $20.

332
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,840
They'll miss out on next day.

333
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,560
You know, come to think of it, I never sent.

334
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,560
Technically, I mean, I've spent a lot of my own money

335
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,240
on the church, but I never sent my $20 in for a membership.

336
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,640
Dr. Drummond never did.

337
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,000
Palmer Vredes never did.

338
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,480
Puzzling Evidence never did.

339
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,620
Sterno never did.

340
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,020
And, you know, friends, it won't matter what you did for Bob.

341
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,000
What'll matter is whether you sent that for that membership card.

342
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,380
I guess I'm gonna have to get around to that.

343
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,860
Well, I got plenty of time, plenty of time till next day.

344
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, hell, that's 1998.

345
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,580
We got all the time in the world.

346
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,720
There will be one big escape vessel just for the doctors,

347
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,460
for the hierarchy.

348
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,980
And I can just see Byron and the others,

349
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,460
and Gordon and some of those other people up there going,

350
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,080
hey, you know, we ought to go down and save Ivan and Philo

351
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,480
and all those who never got around to sending the $20.

352
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,660
And then they'll go, well, we'll get around to it.

353
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,080
Heh, heh, heh.

354
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,200
We're not sure where the escape vessels of the sex goddesses go, dear friends.

355
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,480
As far as I can tell, they probably just fly around.

356
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,680
But I'm gonna go, I'm gonna get off of this for right now.

357
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,460
We'll go to an old hymn.

358
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,300
This is a lovely old subgen...

359
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,320
And I do mean old.

360
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,300
This is like from 1981.

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,260
Old subgenius hymn by someone we only know as Doug No. 4.

362
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
Oh, yes.

363
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,860

Uh, yes, what a wonderful, wonderful tune.

378
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,660
¶¶

379
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:20,500
from the good, the good, good Reverend Doug No. 4,

380
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,880
who got scared by the Church of the Subgenius

381
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,080
very shortly after doing that very song.

382
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,980
And we never heard from him again.

383
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,100
And for all I know, he might be listening to this show

384
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,640
going, where's my royalties?

385
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,700
But, well, he's not going to lack for royalties, dear friends,

386
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,560
because he'll be on those saucers.

387
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,500
And I hope, I hope that you will, too.

388
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,520
I hope you'll join us there on that lovely day.

389
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,000
And to make sure that, let's go through some of these things

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,900
to double-check just before X Day.

391
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,180
There'll be more of this in our upcoming book, Revelation X.

392
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,740
This is where a lot of these notes are coming from, by the way, friends.

393
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,900
From a research session between myself and Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

394
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,700
in conference with that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

395
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,940
Yes, sort of a teleconference.

396
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,800
I think it's a teleconference that we were on.

397
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,960
Praise this modern-day technology.

398
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,280
That way we didn't have to be in the same room with Bob, don't you see?

399
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,320
It's a dream.

400
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,000
But anyway...

401
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,260
I mean, you don't want to miss your chance to be on the escape vessels

402
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,560
of the sex goddesses on X Day.

403
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,540
You don't want to end up down on Earth being fried.

404
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,480
So make sure that you have a real Subgenius minister's card on you at all times.

405
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,360
Now, you never know. X Day might come early.

406
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:43,920
You never know. X Day might come early.

407
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,180
So keep it with you.

408
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,840
Subgeniuses often lose those in the wash.

409
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
We get a lot of mail from people saying that.

410
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,360
I washed my membership card. Can I have another one?

411
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,080
And you don't want that to happen just before X Day, friends.

412
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,980
So if you have members who have lost their cards,

413
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,280
but who are paid up and on the master disk of souls,

414
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,860
because we can tell. You can't fool us.

415
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,640
We'll give you a free replacement card from the Dallas headquarters anytime,

416
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,160
free of charge, just by sending yourself a draft stamped envelope.

417
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:19,340
If you send your card cứbox 109-7Ge or older.

418
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,080
Then we'll send ya a backup P.O. Box 0803-11 Thousands alone.

419
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,980
I want an ear close.

420
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,140
But first I just want to notice.

421
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,240
So what in the world is going on especially right now?

422
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,140
You go on a long tour during this whole planned Jasper,

423
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,140


424
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:36,620
For those of us who familiarize us as a $116.

425
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,200
What's happening in the station is �otanding domain bei smell過來.

426
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,140
You feel like music's my speculation?

427
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:52,920
This huge eyeball in the sky, this giant pyramid-shaped light form with a big eye that just covers the whole sky.

428
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,460
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens.

429
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,660
Oh, yes, when we can watch what's going on down there, we can watch any part of it we want.

430
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:11,500
And we can also leave messages because the big eye projects sort of billboards, holographic billboards from horizon to horizon

431
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,000
that say things like, smile, you know, welcome to your stupid life.

432
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:25,760
You're being seen live on the escape vessels of the sex goddess screens where the subgeniuses are now partying, you dumb idiots.

433
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:34,580
I mean, a big billboard stretching all across the planet in all languages saying, fools, we're having a great time.

434
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,640
And the subgeniuses can take turns broadcasting personal statements.

435
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,980
So, you know, this...

436
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,540
Horrible pink evil person will be down there fighting the roe beast.

437
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,020
And suddenly this voice will ring out.

438
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,400
Hey, Mrs. Darden, I was in your 1959 fifth grade class.

439
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,240
Remember me?

440
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,660
Steve Wilcox.

441
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,700
Ha-ha, I'm up here.

442
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,380
You're down there.

443
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,820
Or like pain radio coming to you, Mr. Shaughnessy, the principal.

444
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,660
Remember when you expelled me?

445
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,300
How do you like the pain, huh?

446
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,040
And, you know, you get back at anybody.

447
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh, you laughed at me in junior high.

448
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,380
Max, you put me upside down into a trash can.

449
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,740
You and your jock friends.

450
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,940
You aren't laughing quite so hard now, are you?

451
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,600
And there'll be little holographic ghost-like things.

452
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,980
Green slime type ghost sort of things.

453
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:33,880
Millions of little 3D Janers flying around taunting and saying, you should have spent your $20.

454
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,300
Should have spent your $20.

455
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,160
Oh, friends.

456
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:36,980
Friends.

457
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,700
Oh, praise Bob.

458
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,560
Praise Bob.

459
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,120
Praise Bob.

460
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:40,820
It's going to be so...

461
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,300
But, you know...

462
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,780
And so we find that the world isn't really to be destroyed.

463
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,180
It's that the humans...

464
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,500
What happens is the humans are given all this alien technology and they screw everything up.

465
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,280
They've got a miracle machine there, this mom thing that could do anything they want,

466
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,440
but nobody pays any attention to it at first because they don't know what its capabilities are

467
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,440
and it's real cautious about revealing itself too fast.

468
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,360
And they don't know that this fungus that's...

469
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,480
growing around them could fulfill their wildest desires because they don't believe it can.

470
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
Because they don't have any wild desires.

471
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,500
Because they didn't think to ask.

472
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:31,460
And people will be down there in the ruins begging us with their last potato to preach and deliver unto them the word of Dobbs.

473
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,340
Because it's the only thing that'll save them.

474
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:41,480
Subgenius artifacts like old copies of the book of the subgenius or illegal bootleg tapes of this race.

475
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,340
Radio show, original pamphlet number ones, even an old Dobbs head.

476
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,040
It'll be worth a boxcar full of canned peaches, friends, because the luck shell,

477
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:57,060
the luck shell that we've always claimed was around our various products that you thought we were only kidding about.

478
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,740
And that's real.

479
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,900
And it will become visible on X day.

480
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,200
A glow that's visible even in daylight.

481
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,520
Any given page of the printed word Bob will be not only of practical use as lamps in the dark,

482
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,300
but more importantly,

483
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,880
there'll be unthinkably valuable religious treasures, dear friends,

484
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,720
the most valuable things on the whole planet.

485
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,460
Because you're safer if you have that.

486
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,300
If you've got a copy of the show with you,

487
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,900
it tips your luck playing.

488
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:34,840
It helps a whole lot against radiation and landslides and brain worms and noise demons and nerve runners and all that.

489
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,080
It didn't nearly like having a membership card,

490
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,720
but it's a lot better than having nothing.

491
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,340
Because friends,

492
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,000
your faith,

493
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,240
your faith in Bob will be all you have left on that day.

494
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,280
And he'll know whether you believed in him.

495
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,720
Wotan will know.

496
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,680
And he will come.

497
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,760
He will come to judge.

498
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,540
And now here are my predictions.

499
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,760
Listen,

500
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,460
listen carefully.

501
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,120
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow today.

502
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm not going to judge you.

503
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,240
But I'll see.

504
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,400
You don't have to come judge me.

505
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,980
I predict public executions will be shown on television sponsored by your local gas company.

506
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,620
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

507
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,600
I predict that LSD,

508
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,300
marijuana and speed can change your sex.

509
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,620
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming prediction period.

510
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,660
School built on sweet potato pie.

511
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,980
Gee,

512
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,800
that's a headline.

513
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,600
If it were possible to spray small doses of LSD from an helicopter into the air,

514
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,880
people would soon quieten and not be hurt.

515
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,800
She is a cutie,

516
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,120
isn't she?

517
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,800
What a girl.

518
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,100
Right on campus as part of getting high.

519
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,840
I mean,

520
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,320
getting a higher education.

521
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,040
Which is just wonderful in any language.

522
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,000
Here's Bobby.

523
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,460
LSD is great.

524
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,460


525
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,460


526
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,260
It's running its mad course with babies now being born hideously deformed from women whose

527
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,840
chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug,

528
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,660
which was invented originally by the chemical warfare branch of the United States Army as

529
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,420
a vicious weapon to be used against an enemy.

530
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,580
Here you see the heroic robots,

531
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,180
the levies who defended San Francisco against the dastardly attack.

532
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,320
All right,

533
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,840
I've seen enough.

534
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:39,820
Well,

535
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,300
you know,

536
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,400
who knows what could happen?

537
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,740
Yeah,

538
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,760
Bob got to Reagan in time and saved him.

539
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,080
And President Bush is we think he's going to be getting better.

540
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,400
So that is 1983 will be seen in the first televised execution.

541
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,200
Don't you mean the clone of President Bush?

542
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:01,280
That goes about saying I don't expect him to believe that in the unknown.

543
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,320
We can't ask.

544
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,120
We can't ask.

545
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,840
They have the entire clone farms that are why you are here.

546
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,420
Basically,

547
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,160
all our and now for the first time we are teaching you only clones of the original.

548
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:23,960
What has sales there on that original brains taken out and replaced by robotic exist green energy demon brains like the ones that work at convenience stores.

549
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,640
It's right over my right.

550
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,180
What is it?

551
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,180
I gotta get out of here.

552
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,540
This won't trouble you.

553
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,180
Go on.

554
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,900
You're remembering everything now.

555
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,860
And I try to maintain control.

556
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,940
So Betty cannot tell that I am scared.

557
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,760
Oh,

558
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,900
I'm so scared.

559
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,920
Go on.

560
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,140
This won't hurt you.

561
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,000
Experience it.

562
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,880
It won't harm you.

563
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,040


564
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,340
I gotta get my gun.

565
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,780
I gotta get my gun.

566
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,360
I gotta get out of here.

567
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,200
Gotta get my gun.

568
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,100
I gotta get my gun.

569
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,200
I gotta get my gun.

570
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,760
I gotta get my gun.

571
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,820
I gotta get my gun.

572
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:10,320


573
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,300
I gotta get my gun.

574
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,900
I gotta get my gun.

575
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:15,900


576
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:17,980
How about it,

577
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,900
You see that guy?

578
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,480
Center

579
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:38,480
You See looking,

580
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
aban

581
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,020
Professor, I know you've been in this book line study for many years. You know more

582
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,800
about them than we do. Tell us, what should we do?

583
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:58,100
Hmm. Don't go up there at night. Stay in the sunlight. Keep yourself safe and

584
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,960
secure, and in the daylight we'll draw you out of there. You've got to use all

585
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,680
your power to knock them out. All your power... Laser guns? Laser guns. Not only

586
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:16,420
laser guns, but your crew. Get them up there and knock them out. And when you

587
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,840
knock them out... But we're gonna have trouble with the launch pad. Well, the launch will be

588
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,780
all right as soon as I can get there. We know we've been behind it for years.

589
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,100
It's been my research staff that came up with the initial evidence.

590
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,680
Dr. Moore, can your staff come up with a weapon to stop the Nazi hell creatures

591
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,100
in time?

592
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,660
I can't tell you.

593
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:45,880
I can't say for sure, but with Ruck, the

594
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,320
physiological provide us with the answers.

595
00:28:50,840 --> 00:29:06,280
A man? Is he a captain? What is he? And he's looking at me, and I say, no. I have to

596
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,000
shake my head. This isn't true. This can't be true.

597
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:19,880
And... still there. And I look up and down the road and I think, can somebody come along and

598
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:30,960
tell me that this isn't there? But it's there. Why? What do they want? What do they want?

599
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:39,360
Is the UFO mystery truly a scientific Watergate, an incredible and dangerous cover-up?

600
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,640
Is the UFO mystery truly a scientific Watergate, an incredible and dangerous cover-up?

601
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:40,640


602
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,840
Understanding of the UFO may be beyond our science and political system.

603
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,600
Twisted them to fit the Nazi ideology.

604
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,580
Thank you.

605
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:57,640
And Bob, by the way, is running for Big Brother or Universal Overlord or County Clerk in 1984.

606
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:58,860
Yeah, that's right.

607
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,420
He knows he's not going to win Big Brother.

608
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,400
It's just to plant the seeds in the minds of the people.

609
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:13,820
Bob either wants to be County Clerk or Over God of all reality in 1984.

610
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,740
As Alistair Crowley once said, if I can't be God, I'm not going to play.

611
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,580
This ain't no video game church.

612
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,900
It ain't no church of bingo.

613
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,220
It's a church of Bob.

614
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,940
It's a Bob Rice's church.

615
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,060
I don't see what the hell's going on here.

616
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,820
What the hell?

617
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,200
Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

618
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:32,880
Yes.

619
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,340
The Christian heaven is hotter.

620
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,460
That's because there are seven suns out of seven.

621
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,960
All your friends will be down there.

622
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,260
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, I must admit I know very little at this time.

623
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,200
The princess is a creature of antiquity, 10 million years at least in age.

624
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,120
And the monsters are mutants of creatures that roamed the earth before the Ice Age.

625
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,940
It is likely that a super race of humans existed sometime in the past also.

626
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,320
And somehow all of them, humans and creatures, went into hibernation far underground.

627
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,480
Where they survived.

628
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,780
They are intelligent, they are smarter than the most up to date supercomputers.

629
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,900
We cannot underestimate them.

630
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,460
They are not emotional.

631
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,020
Angels don't have any emotion.

632
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:23,920
These sinister euthanauts, from the unholy reaches of the universe, and traversing this

633
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:30,760
great cosmos around us, made a stop one day on this planet of ours.

634
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,380
Thousands upon thousands.

635
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,380


636
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:34,380


637
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:46,080
thousands of years ago, made a stop to allow their house pets the leisure of relieving

638
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:56,020
themselves outside of the spacecraft. Certainly a few of these animals of amusement managed

639
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:05,340
to break away from their masters and somehow managed to survive on this planet. If this

640
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:13,340
is so, evidence of them must exist somewhere. I believe that evidence has already been uncovered

641
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:21,140
and widely publicized of these animals. The animals were probably the Yeti. The Yeti's

642
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,000
crossbred with human beings and the human beings are the result of that are more or

643
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,420
less likely to be the subgenius of the Yeti. Basically the subgenius has the biological

644
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:35,080
heritage of the Yetinsin or the Yeti. Basically out of the mountains of China, although there

645
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,860
are a few that live in the mountains of California, they seem to be a mountain forest people that

646
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:48,460
are hairy only in their most pure state, but in sort of a mongrelized Yetinsin such as

647
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:54,540
myself only certain parts sprout hair. However, I have hair in unusual patches of my body,

648
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,960
which is why I wear overalls.

649
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:05,260
Know thee that thy little lands are hollow and empty inside, and inside dwell demons

650
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:11,540
who move faster than thy light and speak faster than their air carries sound, and which wield

651
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,060
the secret tools and ambrules of the sciences which I have forbidden thee. And these demons

652
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,760
come among thy leaders all swathed in black and tainted.

653
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,700
If the right people aren't there to meet the

654
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:25,980
the right people aren't there to meet the right people aren't there to meet the right

655
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,220
nations. If ourетр meglio an alien who has been

656
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,680
summoned, which iszur their Shinai thee, hath dust protected thy fato.

657
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:42,180
But there ise that thou seekst me ise that, and that thyself shalt not be 210.

658
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,000
By the light of that plant, D twiter Way wor, shining and the all our theme is this 22%

659
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,000


660
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,220
I have guaranteed it that thou shalt not become the King of Honor till Mozart is learned.

661
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:55,220
swim s shield but now, felled he shalt never be the King of Honor until Mozart is a meme 실 towards a s could influ hip in his

662
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,140
Nothing will ever be the same again.

663
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,860
The planet will no longer belong to the humans or the subgeniuses.

664
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,060
And that is why it is so crucial that the subgeniuses be in those positions of power,

665
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,620
be at the coordinates, the landing strips, when that angelic host does descend,

666
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,720
when the second, third, and fourth comings occur during this period.

667
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,340
We...

668
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,800
You...

669
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,660
I know that you understand.

670
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,800
I know that you understand.

671
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,000
And I know that you'll be with us on that day, that fateful day, X-Day, 1998.

672
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,100
Bob will be on television. He'll talk to us.

673
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,100
He'll give a speech that will move billions, not millions, but billions to tears.

674
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,840
And it'll work out okay.

675
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:52,520
The world will end just right and keep going in the new way, the way of Bob.

676
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,820
Everyone will be subgeniuses except us.

677
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:04,940
You mentioned that the advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

678
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,560
from inside the hollow Earth are conspiring to take over the whole planet.

679
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,900
Yeah, we read about that in a pamphlet that was written to us.

680
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,500
Oh, you did?

681
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,620
Uh-huh. And Bob confirmed it.

682
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,440
And there's only...

683
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,040
There's only one, uh...

684
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,260
Only one organization that could possibly stop them.

685
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,480
They're the men from Planet X, and they'll be arriving in 1998.

686
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,660
And after...

687
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,740
After the Tribulation money starts to fall from the chariots and the angels in the sky

688
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:37,140
and coming up out of the ground and spewing out of the back of them car exhaust pipes

689
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,420
and just magic everywhere,

690
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,620
and them Tribulation times will be tearing those...

691
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,040
Those...

692
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,240
Those bad, evil, demonic people up,

693
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,600
and they'll be the sub...

694
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,320
Subgeniuses...

695
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,960
Subgenius people will be...

696
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
I think we should bring up...

697
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,140
That is Hitler's Germany.

698
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,740
I'm waiting for the UFO

699
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,720
We are waiting for the UFO

700
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:09,660
And I'm waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting for, waiting, waiting for the UFO

701
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,720
I've never tried, but it's from his phone.

702
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,080
But if we yelled it real loud, he might be able to contact home base.

703
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,700
And we can get back to the home planet.

704
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,640
Remember folks.

705
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,560
Which takes us to a planet of non-mortals who are eons advanced in their civilization.

706
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,760
Our program is Otherworlds.

707
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:37,080
Another movie that's swept America is one entitled The Encounters of the Third Degree.

708
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,240
May I tell you this?

709
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

710
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,940
I don't know if I believe them or not.

711
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,320
But New Zealand Air Force, we're going to be working on a new UFO program.

712
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,700
It was on alert recently because of the UFOs appearing over that nation.

713
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,980
Someone said, do you believe in flying saucers?

714
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,320
I said, of course. I'm a married man.

715
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,760
If you don't get that now, you may in the morning over the breakfast table.

716
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,080
You say, what about UFOs?

717
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,440
I don't want to delve into that.

718
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
But I want to give you something that blesses my heart.

719
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,500
I know there is life in the universe.

720
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,300
Why? Because evil spirits, demonic spirits, feel it.

721
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,300


722
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:17,300


723
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,080
They will fill the universe.

724
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,660
The cult is full of superstition and mysticism. We're scientists.

725
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,060
We've got laser beams shaped like vampires with glow-in-the-dark brains.

726
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,900
I've seen a vision, ma'am.

727
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,980
The way that we walk is what we become.

728
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,080
So please pay attention while I show you some of what's about to happen.

729
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,340
So play your cards right.

730
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,720
Yes, all you deaf ears down there.

731
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,480
Heads up, look out below.

732
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,560
There will be plenty of distractions to take their minds off the real problem as the time of P draws to its violent close.

733
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,200
For instance, beware! The fake God Junior, the anti-Bob, will come before long.

734
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,600
Bullets cannot stop him.

735
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,880
He's one of the deceptively human-looking advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

736
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,340
Parasites of the Elder Gods.

737
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,300
But most people will think he's the Second Coming.

738
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:12,640
And his alien hiney will be kissed all the way to world dictatorship and beyond.

739
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,460
And if the true Messiah is dead, he will be the second coming.

740
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:29,560
If the true Messiah were to show up at that time, everyone would just know in the bottom of their core programming that he's the Antichrist because he'll cuss and spit and take the Lord's name in vain and hang out with whores and bull-diggers and dope addicts and cops.

741
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,040
Another down-home sort.

742
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:31,960
This is a warning.

743
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,040
Danger, danger, you poor devils.

744
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,520
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed.

745
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,540
What was up is down.

746
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,960
The priorities are all screwy.

747
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,440
You're fretting if your hair looks okay while some new kind of black man is coming.

748
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:44,440


749
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,480
You're fretting if your bladder cancer is bursting out the front of your designer jeans.

750
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,220
Yes, this is bad talk.

751
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,300
Nobody will listen to anything else.

752
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,640
You won't look at TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it.

753
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,500
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

754
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,500
You haven't used your other senses since you were five.

755
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:12,480
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more self-assured makes you stop.

756
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,420
And you'll thank him for it.

757
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:22,520
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight, you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

758
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,440
Good God, what in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

759
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,800
People bitch, people gripe.

760
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,660
This is a sign of the end times.

761
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,280
That's a sign of the end times.

762
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,860
When you should all be hollering, it's all a sign of the end times.

763
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,400
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heretic?

764
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,980
On July 5th, 1998?

765
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,920
Would anyone like to take a guess what's going to happen to this heretic when the saucers come?

766
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,600
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

767
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:05,620
He will be on those saucers with the sex goddesses because he paid his $30 subgenius membership fee.

768
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,420
He had his membership card in the church.

769
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,300
And even if you were to go out today and turn your back on Bob,

770
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,620
did you ever heard any of this?

771
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,760
Even if you were to go out tomorrow and get a job,

772
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:22,100
maybe even as president of the United States or a cop somewhere ripping apart people's cars searching for dope,

773
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,180
you would still be able to get on the pleasure saucers as long as you had that subgenius membership card,

774
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,800
as long as you paid for that subgenius membership card.

775
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,020
Can you say the same?

776
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,820
Can you say that you're going to be on those escape vessels on July 5th?

777
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,220
Do you think you're going to squeak by just because you're cool?

778
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,960
Do you think coolness is going to get you on to those space vessels?

779
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:57,480
Well, what are you going to do on X day when suddenly all your paid in full subgenius buddies disappear?

780
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,700
Many people would say, well, I'm not going to join up with the church of the subgenius.

781
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,220
The church of the subgenius is an organization of non-joiners.

782
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,680
So I'm not going to join.

783
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,920
Well, I got a surprise for you folks.

784
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,900
You're not going to be joining us on X day either.

785
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,720
And X day, you have no idea what's awaiting you all on X day.

786
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:34,240
True slack, true slack is like better than getting gang sucked by a horde of horny, buxom Nordic Valkyries

787
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,460
while eating a big juicy T-bone steak on your birthday.

788
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:49,980
But X day, X day makes slack seem like you're wearing a helmet with a padlocked chin strap.

789
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,880
That's right.

790
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,120
By comparison, X day is going to make any slack you have seem like nothing.

791
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,500
Now, you might think, well, I'm not going to spend any money on this church of the subgenius.

792
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,640
I'm not going to spend any money on this.

793
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,120
I got better things to do with my $30.

794
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,780
I can go out and buy a Hootie and the Blowfish CD or something with that money.

795
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,560
And I can sit at home and I can listen to my Hootie and the Blowfish CD over and over and over again.

796
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,840
And I can sit back and just jam and have me a good time listening to my CD player.

797
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,220
Because you like music so much.

798
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,680
Well, on X day, that CD player is going to melt into a pile of slack.

799
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,600
That's right.

800
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:48,580
All your cheap pink entertainment devices are going to be destroyed in the fires of the Xist invasion.

801
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,500
There will be no music then.

802
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,000
The only music there will be will be the screams of the dying.

803
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,440
You may not like the sound of this type of music.

804
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,660
But we subgeniuses will damn well love it.

805
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,160
We'll be dancing to the tune.

806
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,360
So what can you do?

807
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,880
You can join up with the church of the subgenius.

808
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,600
Or you'll be singing in the choir.

809
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,840
That's right brothers and sisters.

810
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,420
You'll be singing along with all that screaming and pain.

811
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,200
And all that horrible moaning and wailing and praying.

812
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,140
You know, when I was in Chicago last night.

813
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,200
I was down in the dressing room getting ready to go up here and preach to the folks out there.

814
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,340
And a cockroach was crawling across the table.

815
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,480
And I took out my ink pen and I was kind of poking it along.

816
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,220
And it'd run and go across the table and I'd reach over and poke it the other way.

817
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,040
And I'd watch it run.

818
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,680
And I'd sit there and watch the little things that got so frustrated.

819
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,260
And then I took out my cigarette lighter.

820
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,280
And I started singeing around his antennas.

821
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:10,680
And then I reached around behind him and started burning off his wings.

822
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,780
And he flipped over and his little legs were kicking and screaming.

823
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,580
And flying around in the air.

824
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,900
On next day, if you don't have a membership card.

825
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,840
You're going to pray.

826
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,520
You're going to wish.

827
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,480
You're going to wish that you were that cockroach.

828
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,740
That's right.

829
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,800
You'll wish you were that cockroach on next day.

830
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,000
You'll wish that you could just be tortured for a little while.

831
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,080
And then, and then.

832
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,000
Put out of your misery in a burst of flame.

833
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,380
By some sadistic sub-genius preacher.

834
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,940
But we're not going to make it that easy on you.

835
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:44,940
No.

836
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,520
Brothers and sisters.

837
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,860
The river is rising.

838
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,860
And you're going to drown.

839
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,520
Tonight.

840
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:59,220
I am offering you a personal flotation device.

841
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,920
To keep your head above this rising river.

842
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,060
I'm offering you a personal flotation device.

843
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,080
In the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

844
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,240
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

845
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,280
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

846
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,700
It is no accident that you are all here.

847
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:28,380
You all have been chosen to receive this message.

848
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,380
You have been chosen because the water's rising up.

849
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,920
And it's just about to rise over your heads.

850
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,460
And we're going to throw you this flotation device.

851
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,040
And you can either grab onto it and live.

852
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,240
Or you can pass it on by.

853
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,820
And you're going to go down like yesterday's sh**.

854
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,360
It's twirling down the toilet.

855
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,380
It's no accident.

856
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,920
You must join the church of the sub-genius.

857
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,440
Or die.

858
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,940
You'll be damn glad that you joined.

859
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:03,960
You will be damn glad that you spent that pitiful thirty dollars.

860
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,480
I really don't want to see all of you die.

861
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,780
Some of you I do.

862
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,240
But I don't want to see all of you die.

863
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,940
We're here to help you.

864
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,920
We're your friends.

865
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,840
You must know.

866
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,900
Can't you feel by looking at this man Bob.

867
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,580
How much he loves you.

868
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,820
Don't you realize how much Bob loves you.

869
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,540
He loves you so much.

870
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,560
That he's willing to offer you.

871
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,220
A chance to have your every perverse desire.

872
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,220
Be brought to life.

873
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,180
Your every sick sexual fantasy.

874
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,800
Shall be made flesh before you.

875
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,800
Trust us.

876
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,040
Trust Bob.

877
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:55,980
Amen.

878
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,460
Maybe some of you still aren't willing to accept Bob into your lives.

879
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,600
Perhaps you need.

880
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,760
Some proof.

881
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,580
Perhaps.

882
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,060
Perhaps Bob.

883
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,380
Perhaps.

884
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,300
My main man J.R. Bob Dobbs here.

885
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,620
Will give me the power.

886
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,920
The power.

887
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,360
To heal some lucky member of the audience tonight.

888
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,620
Is there anybody here.

889
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,580
That needs to be healed.

890
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,680
Of some horrible sickness.

891
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,760
Oh.

892
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,120
Wait we have a man here waving his hands.

893
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,620
Come on up here brother.

894
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,500
Come on up here.

895
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,940
Come on up here brother.

896
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:36,820
Let me help you.

897
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,840
Good evening brother.

898
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:39,860
What's your name?

899
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,060
My name is Eric.

900
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,980
Eric.

901
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,480
And.

902
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:43,740
And.

903
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,180
What brought you here tonight Eric?

904
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,780
What brought you here tonight?

905
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,940
My crippled right leg.

906
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,600
Your crippled right leg brought you here tonight.

907
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,460
Well Bob.

908
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,540
Bob's gonna give me the power.

909
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,360
To heal you of your maladies.

910
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,020
Bob's telling me that.

911
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,480
You need to be healed.

912
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,180
You have a problem in your leg.

913
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,000
Bob's telling me you have.

914
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:05,760
A tumor.

915
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,140
In your leg.

916
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,420
That you need healed.

917
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,960
Is this true?

918
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,540
And.

919
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:10,800
And.

920
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,860
And Bob told me that.

921
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,340
You had a terrible heart condition brother.

922
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,400
Is this true?

923
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,620
It's true?

924
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,680
And.

925
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,340
And Bob tells me that you have bursitis in your shoulder.

926
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,980
Am I right?

927
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,980
Have you got bursitis in your shoulder?

928
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,380
He has bursitis in his shoulder.

929
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,700
He has many maladies.

930
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:31,460
But.

931
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,460


932
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,460


933
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,460


934
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,460


935
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,460


936
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,460


937
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,480
Bob is also telling me that you've been having problems with your liver.

938
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,060
Is that true?

939
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,020
And that you've been having a problem with sexual dysfunction.

940
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,100
Is that true?

941
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,680
Yes.

942
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,980
It's true he's suffering from.

943
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,180
An obstruction.

944
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,340
Is it true that you're having some problem with your bowels?

945
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,720
Yes.

946
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,380
Yes.

947
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,200
And Bob also told me that you have a problem with really bad acne on your ass.

948
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,080
Is it true?

949
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,660
It's all over.

950
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,900
It's sad.

951
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:02,660
And.

952
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,060
And.

953
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,300
And that all the women call you pizza butt.

954
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,100
Is that true?

955
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,700
What women?

956
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,380
That's so sad.

957
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:15,220
A man with sexual dysfunction and a pizza butt who can't get a woman.

958
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,940
Bob is saying that you need to be healed of these maladies.

959
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,940
Bob is saying that you've had a problem with your throat too.

960
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,400
And your ears.

961
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,620
And.

962
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,040
And.

963
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,140
And the glands in your armpits.

964
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,780
And.

965
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,380
And your left index finger.

966
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,520
And.

967
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:30,600
And.

968
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,880
And your right middle finger.

969
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,640
The one that keeps getting stiff every time a police car goes by.

970
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,580
Is it true brother?

971
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,860
This is the truth.

972
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,300
Well brother.

973
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,620
Tonight we're going to heal you.

974
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,920
We're going to heal you brother.

975
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,160
Oh yes.

976
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,320
Brother Bevilacqua is going to come up here to help me out with this healing.

977
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,020
Sometimes the power gets in me and it's so strong that I burn out the wires and actually

978
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,060
accidentally kill the person I'm trying to heal.

979
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,900
But brother we're going to heal you or kill you.

980
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,500
We are going to take care of your soul.

981
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


982
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


983
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


984
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


985
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


986
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


987
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


988
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500


989
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:00,500

1004
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:24,740


1005
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:33,940
action you'll ever need, all the action you'll ever want, and more. Two and a half feet long

1006
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:44,800
solid aluminum. The orifices are going to be stretching. The heads are going to be collapsing.

1007
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:59,900
And brothers and sisters, I'm not going to use any lubricant. Oh yes, I have but one thing left to say to you all.

1008
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:11,300
The supermarket has run out of food. The highway out of town's jammed up, gridlocked. The doctor's dead.

1009
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,420
There's a meteor heading for your town.

1010
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,740
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is sitting at the wheel of the last train out of town.

1011
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:35,240
Brothers, sisters, you got to get on that train because when you come right down to it, you either got to ride that train

1012
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,780
or you're going to get tied to the tracks. Remember, it is far better

1013
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,140
to ride a train than to ride a train.

1014
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:44,780
Remember, it is far better to ride a train than to ride a train.

1015
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:51,580
It is far better to be a speeding car than it is to be a blind man crossing against the light.

1016
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,380
Amen, brothers and sisters. Can I get an amen?

1017
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,120
Can I get a hallelujah?

1018
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,100
What do you all want, brothers and sisters?

1019
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,040
What do you want?

1020
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,200
Brothers and sisters, I need you to say it again, but I need you to say it loud enough.

1021
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:14,780
The truth is, I need you to say it loud enough.

1022
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:14,860
All right, brothers and sisters, let's get this thing rolling.

1023
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:14,940
The truth is, I need you to say it loud enough.

1024
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:14,940


1025
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,020
You're going to hear the X's that are on their way here.

1026
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,420
And they're going to crank up the radio and roll down the windows on their spaceship.

1027
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,320
And they're going to light up a big fat-frop stick and smile.

1028
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,520
And they're going to be coming down.

1029
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,220
And you've got to let them know that you're all waiting for them.

1030
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,680
So what is it that you want, brothers and sisters?

1031
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:35,740
Slack!

1032
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,600
Yes, brothers and sisters, Slack.

1033
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,780
Oh, yes.

1034
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,120
And who is going to give you this slack?

1035
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,760
All of you!

1036
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,620
Brothers and sisters, the train's leaving

1037
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:52,200
and a lot of you guys are on the right track.

1038
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Praise Bob!

1039
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,980
Thank you very much.

1040
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,260
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1041
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,360
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1042
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,040
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1043
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,000
Got your pencil ready?

1044
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:25,440
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1045
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:32,600
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1046
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,480
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1047
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,800
You hand him that pamphlet?

1048
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,960
Oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

1049
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,420
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob,

1050
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,940
it's either truth or death.

1051
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,840
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes?

1052
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,780
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

1053
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,940
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up,

1054
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,040
the Jupiter effect, oh, I'm now sure that may have caused

1055
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,380
earthquakes and volcanoes and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

1056
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,280
And men will, in the end times to come,

1057
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,160
men will gnash their brains and think backwards.

1058
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,340
Dead Christians!

1059
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,560
Come up from their graves, shambling and rotting

1060
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,780
like not of the living dead, but through it all,

1061
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,420
helping to profit from it all,

1062
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,000
is that one mighty link between heaven and earth, that Bob.

1063
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,080
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

1064
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,060
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

1065
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,300
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends,

1066
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:32,220
but it's the blood of the baptism of the mighty fist face of Bob.

1067
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,760
That face that can pile through eight-foot-thick titanium steel

1068
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,140
conspiracy fort-knock stores

1069
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,240
with that mighty fist face of Bob.

1070
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,900
That mighty pipe!

1071
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,900
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

1072
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,780
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

1073
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:47,460
He's a man.

1074
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,680
Oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you

1075
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,500
because Bob, he's been a fool just like you and me.

1076
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,960
Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what,

1077
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,960
that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

1078
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,380
He's a fool today.

1079
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,660
He's a fool tomorrow because he's the same Bob.

1080
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,700
He's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me.

1081
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,220
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied.

1082
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,260
He's satisfied with his lot.

1083
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,240
That has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines,

1084
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,760
his nuclear reactors that made him want to master the Earth

1085
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,780
no matter how nice it might have been before.

1086
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,740
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate,

1087
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,000
the hate that makes us want to smite our brothers,

1088
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,440
the hate that makes us get up in the morning,

1089
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,120
and, friends, without that foolishness and that mighty hate,

1090
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,320
why, we'd be no different from those normals

1091
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,220
because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

1092
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,020
And it's the mighty gripe power

1093
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,060
and the hate!

1094
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,780
That gives us something for nothing.

1095
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,740
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor and broke,

1096
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,340
we may be drunk and neurotic,

1097
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,400
but we've got Bob and the hate!

1098
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,440
And for that, we can hate him!

1099
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,360
Hate him! Hate him!

1100
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,960
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.

1101
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,460
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

1102
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,060
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

1103
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,940
Oh, I hate my job.

1104
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,420
I hate myself.

1105
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,660
That's the sick hate, friends.

1106
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,000
That ain't no kind of hate at all.

1107
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,240
We got that all-inclusive kind of hate,

1108
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,100
that hate essence!

1109
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,160
And it's the love of the hate

1110
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,960
that allows us to put up with just about anything.

1111
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,440
So we can do something about it,

1112
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,000
because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

1113
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,360
It's what keeps him on his toes.

1114
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,820
Bob is the aware man, the natural man.

1115
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,360
He can be walking along, humming to himself,

1116
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:29,040
playing pocket pool, but the inner Bob is aware.

1117
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,660
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away,

1118
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,420
and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

1119
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,680
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts,

1120
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,220
from a physical waste.

1121
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:40,880
From physical organisms.

1122
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,580
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

1123
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,080
Bob is aware, and that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

1124
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,000
And that fly, he's gonna be a better fly for it.

1125
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,220
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

1126
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,120
They see him just sitting there without any wings

1127
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,280
on that big old mound of Bob.

1128
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,700
And they may laugh now, but winter goes by,

1129
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,060
summer goes by, all those other flies starve.

1130
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,160
But that little Bob fly, he's still sitting there on that pile,

1131
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,820
a munching away and a munching away.

1132
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,600
And that pile does not change because Bob,

1133
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,640
my friends, does not change.

1134
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,800
Oh, he changes his mind.

1135
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,560
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church

1136
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,580
right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson.

1137
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,340
But oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

1138
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,020
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

1139
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,780
Bob. There's a B on either side.

1140
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,560
Opposite poles. That's the lesson right there.

1141
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,000
Flip it over on your tongue.

1142
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,660
Say it front way. Say it backwards. Say it upside down.

1143
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,640
And what does it say? It says Bob.

1144
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,720
Because Bob does not change.

1145
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,320
His promise rings true.

1146
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,460
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head,

1147
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,560
if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts of Bob,

1148
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,300
how are you going to get saved?

1149
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,780
You can go to that party Saturday night,

1150
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,680
but you got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

1151
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,760
You can drink beer. You just got to get Bob drunk too.

1152
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,100
And what about Wanda?

1153
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,160
Oh, you're just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

1154
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,620
That shouldn't be any problem.

1155
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,800
Because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

1156
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,700
Sit down, boy.

1157
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,520
Because friends, if you're wondering,

1158
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,760
Bob can love.

1159
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,360
Bob can love.

1160
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,140
Bob loves me.

1161
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:20,900
Deb and Bob seemed a pretty mixed couple.

1162
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:20,900


1163
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:20,900


1164
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:21,120
Wanda could have thought that out for her if he hadn't

1165
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:21,120


1166
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,480
I'll be skinning thatlegal toast for you, Doc.

1167
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:23,820
Joe, Jamie...

1168
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,720
Babe, what happened?

1169
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,100
erving.

1170
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:31,800
working as an announcer at stations in several cities, I finally got to Hollywood. I was offered

1171
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:40,440
four jobs, and I took one with a major network. In 1947, I made a business trip to Cincinnati,

1172
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:47,040
and it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting of the so-called flying saucers

1173
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:54,940
hit the headlines, and it caused a lot of conversation. I notice you keep looking out

1174
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:00,180
the window. You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you? Well, as a matter of

1175
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:06,760
fact, yes. You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt then, huh? No. It's reasonable

1176
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,260
to suppose that there's life on other planets. Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers

1177
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:19,100
too. If they do come from another planet, how will we know? Listen, when the occupants condescend to

1178
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,220
tell us, that's when.

1179
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:42,060
Oh, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella. Yes, sir. Maybe this is a good idea,

1180
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,840
a chance for us to have a little talk. Why, sure, Dad. What's cooking?

1181
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,580
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob? Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Dad.

1182
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,000
No.

1183
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:00,120
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again. Well, thanks. But when a doctor speaks of a male

1184
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:09,060
organ, he, well, he calls it a... When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other

1185
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:17,220
very much. And in showing their love, their instinct is to embrace each other as if, well,

1186
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:23,280
as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be, or the sperm, as the doctors call it.

1187
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,740
Well, is that the sea?

1188
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:25,860
It helps make a new baby?

1189
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,960
No, no, Bob. Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the...

1190
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,380
formed in two little sacs beneath the penis...
