ðŸŽµ

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,300
Genuinely beautiful.

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,000
Giant.

9
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,640
Perfect.

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,400
Cool.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,900
Special.

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,460
Cheered.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,140
Elaborate.

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,420
Easy.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,900
Ultimate.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,340
Best.

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,820
Natural.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Growing.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,740
Special.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,400
Nice.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,340
Quicker.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And much more.

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,500
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,220
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,880
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
that actually it's not.

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,360
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,720
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,100
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Selling.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

32
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

33
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,380
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
It's cool, man.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Cool.

39
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,840
And praise Bob and the whole world.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,480
Oh.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:57,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,060
I'm not sure I can stop that.

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,100
Yeah.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,200


52
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,780
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

53
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

54
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,240
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

55
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

60
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop

61
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,140
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip

62
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,920
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Too tight, too tight

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,900
Too tight, too tight

66
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,600
And I'm gonna say to you

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

71
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,460
And in the right

73
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

74
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,300
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

76
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
Till I get to bed

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Apple mango pie

80
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
You ain't no good of a child

81
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you do something about that, boy?

83
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

85
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
No!

86
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,220


87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
No!

88
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,560


89
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
No!

90
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


91
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


92
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


94
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


95
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


96
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


97
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


99
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,600
No!

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,600


103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,940
No!

104
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,340
No!

105
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,500
No!

106
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,040
No!

107
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,460
I thought

108
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,020
Kidding!

109
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:12,900
It's possible

110
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,340
I could've wiped it all off

111
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,560
Yeah..

112
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,720
It's simple

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:17,980
It's easy

114
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:17,980


115
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,420
At least I'm not Nozomi

116
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:21,420


117
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,660
The biggest thing is

118
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,660


119
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,660


120
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,660


121
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,740
Totally

122
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:22,740


123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,080
No, no, I'm not

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,480
It's not

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,400
No, no, no

126
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:25,440
I did buy her that

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,460
I'll never buy you anything

128
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:25,480
Anything that's worth it

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,840
He's like a cowboy Santa.

131
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,440
How jolly.

132
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.

133
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit though?

134
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,340
I need the show bath.

135
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

136
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,860
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,940
That's enough of that.

138
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

139
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,360
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

140
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

141
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

142
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

143
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,580
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

145
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

146
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

147
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,120
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied...

148
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,120


149
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm shocked by the...

150
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

151
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,560
I like to take the red one and the blue one at the same time.

152
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

153
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,820
The warp mix is easy.

154
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Angels we have heard on high

156
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
Singing about mountains high

157
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,520
And those mountains in reply

158
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,480
Saying we wish we had some too

159
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:06,120
War in excelsis Deo

160
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:16,640
War in excelsis Deo

161
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,660
Barbie Dolls

162
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie

163
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,460
Barbie Dolls

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,180
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

165
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
It will empower the students.

166
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:56,860
Yes, sir.

167
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:05,640
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

168
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,240
It will be called Bobber for Kids.

169
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,740
But how?

170
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:22,760
How will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

171
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
Good has a lot of muscle.

172
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,580
Good.

173
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,380
Good!

174
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,400
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

175
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:42,840
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires,

176
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,420
latent,

177
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:54,680
and children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called Farmer-Columbia-Split Church.

178
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,980
Batteries not included.

179
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,440
She's new from Kenner.

180
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

181
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
We must buy our toys!

182
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

183
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,160
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme recorded there at Dockstock.

184
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,220
Floppy,

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:27,520
clicks,

186
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,520


187
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,520


188
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,540
So sick.

189
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,920
You can't sell this shit salvationist.

190
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,060
Are you mad?

191
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,060


192
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,060


193
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,120
But you sell stuff, submuÅŸ noses,

194
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,560
As avait vous dit en l'ar argente de l'agande a buchette de chiffonette bagesse Suisse,

195
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
Seems to be true, isn't it?

196
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,720


197
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,380
Ah, yes, and next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

198
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,420
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

199
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,960
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

200
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,140
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

201
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,780
And he wanted his two front teeth.

202
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,840
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

203
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,300
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

204
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,820
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

205
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,620
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

206
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,340
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

207
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,520
But he couldn't.

208
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,860
He wanted tens and twenties, tens and twenties.

209
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,360
And he...

210
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,320
He got McDonald's gift certificates and he got Zuzu's pedals.

211
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
And that's the real story of Christmas.

212
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,100
Take the halls and the miles of holly

213
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,040
Tears of the season to be jolly

214
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,740
Don't we know I'll get a barrel

215
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,540
Roll the engine and take care

216
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,960
La la la la la la la la la la

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,940
La la la la la la la la la la

218
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,480
So separate, so separate, so separate

219
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,160
You from Tolga

220
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,720
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

221
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

222
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,540
Shut up, pink boy!

223
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,060
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

224
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,120
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien fool!

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,800
Bob Dobbs!

226
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,480
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, oligarchatism, fighting Jesus and other action figures sold separately.

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,300
Some assembly required, batteries not included. This toy falls apart in three days.

228
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,220
He-Bob!

229
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,920
...and wrestling.

230
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,000
...and the bastards of the universe.

231
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,340
Too much is always better than not enough.

232
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,520
...and Queen Barbara Dolls.

233
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,620
...and I can doze whole separately.

234
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,600
Gorgeous!

235
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,500
...seagulls can blow from head to toe.

236
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,260
...and everything you see here.

237
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,260
...can doze whole separately.

238
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,180
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

239
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,900
Santa Claus!

240
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,140
...and the aliens will soon be back.

241
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,140


242
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

243
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,160
He wanted an electric train.

244
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,300
He had the whole thing on his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.

245
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,460
I'm going to picture the whole thing.

246
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,520
He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.

247
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

248
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,320
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.

249
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,420
And a station and a gateman.

250
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,320
The mortar tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

251
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,280
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

252
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

253
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,700
It is turnover.

254
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

255
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

256
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,380
So come and get it everyone and just buy our products.

257
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

258
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,500
Are we?

259
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

260
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

261
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,700
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.

262
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,560
And sell everything to the pigs.

263
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,540
Oh yes, once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

264
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

265
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,220
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season.

266
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,400
It was something.

267
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,440
There was something else, but I think they started to war over it.

268
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,880
Yea...

269
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:55,300
At that JesusiÃ©n tomb Justice All

270
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, oh, oh, Gloria

271
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:11,300
Oh, oh, oh, Gloria

272
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Hosanna in excelsis

273
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,280
Hosanna in excelsis

274
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:24,280
Hosanna in excelsis

275
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,060
Hosanna in excelsis

276
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:22,420
Hosanna in excelsis

277
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:44,880
Hosanna in excelsis

278
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:22,880
Hosanna in excelsis

279
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:53,300
Hosanna in excelsis

280
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:21,900
Hosanna in excelsis

281
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:40,740
Hosanna in excelsis

282
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,040
Hosanna in excelsis

283
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,000
You better not, you better not, you better not tell anyone.

284
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,220
Santa Claus is coming to town.

285
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:04,100
Santa Claus is coming to town.

286
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,940
Santa Claus is coming to town.

287
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:04,200
Santa Claus is coming to town.

288
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,500
Material plants, biological agents who only take 15%?

289
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,460
Material plants, biological agents who only take 15%?

290
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,940
Oh, it's a great day, all right.

291
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,740
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. America.

292
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,800
Shop as usual.

293
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,060
Shop as usual.

294
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,360
Shop as usual.

295
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,680
And avoid panic buying.

296
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,180
Shop as usual.

297
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,220
Beast

298
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,200
Beast

299
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,680
Santa Claus is real.

300
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
Santa Claus is real.

301
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,340
Santa Claus is real.

302
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,620
Santa Claus is real.

303
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Santa Claus.

304
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,660
We are the cause for the child.

305
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,120
Who's the head man?

306
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,520
Santa Claus.

307
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,460
Santa Claus.

308
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,060
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

309
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,980
He was so real.

310
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,180
How come he didn't get scared?

311
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,060
He got caught last year.

312
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,900
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan.

313
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,820
On July 4th.

314
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,980
And now you can have it all.

315
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,700
All pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

316
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,700
The birth of our baby Satan.

317
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,740
As told by various authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

318
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,400
Including that announcer.

319
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,960
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement.

320
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,800
An announcement.

321
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,220
Of the blessed anointment and birthday of our Lord.

322
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,600
Zin.

323
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,340
Praise.

324
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,980
Zin.

325
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,700
For.

326
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,500
One.

327
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,960
Bright Christmas morning.

328
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,740
Zin.

329
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,380
Was born.

330
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,460
In a cradle.

331
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,560
To a rich man's family.

332
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,020
The rave Jesus.

333
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,780
Oh, I know the rave Jesus.

334
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,580
I'm part with the rave Jesus.

335
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm part with the rave.

336
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,500
On my wedding day.

337
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,260
At the church.

338
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,400
I was in the room.

339
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,400


340
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,400


341
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,400


342
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,400


343
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Are you the same

344
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
TambiÃ©n soy yo mismo

345
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,460
I was so sad.

346
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,460


347
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,680
That I thought.

348
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,460
From the dream enjoy brought estar.

349
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:34,180
Sorry I Ø£Ø­ÎµÏ„Îµ Ð¶rzyÐº once

350
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,180


351
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,540
Have yourself a very little bit of salt.

352
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,480
From now on we're miles away.

353
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,600
Once a day as in olden days.

354
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:03,180
Happy golden be miles of us.

355
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:09,800
Let your heart be out of sight.

356
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,660
From mutated Christmas friends,

357
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,060
have yourself a merry little Christmas by

358
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,860
No

359
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,660
dash

360
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,280
L.

361
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,020
No

362
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,500
L.

363
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:43,120
Before that some year old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas from

364
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,060
the Tarkin Records All Star Holiday Extravaganza.

365
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm playing a lot from that.

366
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,120
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.

367
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,480
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

368
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,180
And now the Jethro's.

369
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,660
Here we go.

370
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,960
Tarkin Records

371
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,860
Tarkin Records

372
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,640
Tarkin Records

373
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,060
Tarkin Records

374
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,640
Tarkin Records

375
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:39,940
Tarkin Records

376
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,540
Tarkin Records

377
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,860
Tarkin Records

378
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,960
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

379
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,820
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

380
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,120
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

381
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,520
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

382
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,740
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

383
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,240
Oh, friends, it's tough.

384
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,120
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

385
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,600
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

386
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:19,640
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus,

387
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,740
Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

388
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,700
Can you believe that?

389
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,520
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

390
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,240
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

391
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,240
We can't afford that.

392
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,220
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

393
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,960
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

394
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,920
Let's be friends.

395
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,980
Oh, boy.

396
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,840
Oh, boy.

397
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,600
Oh, boy.

398
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,720
Oh, boy.

399
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,480
Oh, boy.

400
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,520
Oh, boy.

401
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,920
Oh, boy.

402
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,880
Oh, boy.

403
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,320
And amazing.

404
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,900
More from Corporal Blossom.

405
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,540
I am really impressed by their editing work.

406
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:49,480
And that's on Corporal Blossom and the mutated Christmas.

00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,460

First Christmas Witch

418
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,580
First Christmas Witch

419
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,180
First Christmas Witch

420
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,620
First Christmas Witch

421
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:49,060
First Christmas Witch

422
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:55,320
he used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.

423
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,800
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.

424
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,740
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

425
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,840
I said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas,

426
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
but he's going to bring you something.

427
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,260
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air

428
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,220
and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.

429
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,300
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

430
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,280
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

431
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,040
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

432
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,580
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister, created the conspiracy?

433
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,660
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.

434
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,060
Yes, there was a down-home Norman rock.

435
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,720
It's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

436
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:55,060
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,

437
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,540
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

438
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,560
Now, it was a...

439
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,520
When your little brother fell through a hole in the ice sled,

440
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,180
and you went and saved him, you didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

441
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,200
It was a wonderful...

442
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,280
It was a wonderful...

443
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,280


444
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,280


445
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,520
It was a wonderful life back then.

446
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,680
...and we pulled some eggs, little jokes about him waking up,

447
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,420
and then we'd put candles, like most people have for Christmas.

448
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,940
He would have that smile on his face and a big red nose.

449
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,060
But today, Christmas is lost its meaning.

450
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,220
He'd have beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.

451
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,220
Scott, you made your choice.

452
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,640
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

453
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,280
And to your eternal soul,

454
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,820
you have found that I only...

455
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,580
Could you afford to give to God that which was his?

456
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,580
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

457
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,860
The Senate still stands.

458
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:02,420
In the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth...

459
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,540
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir!

460
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,720
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

461
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,040
Sir, no!

462
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:09,920
No!

463
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,020
Thank God I don't want to go to hell!

464
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,120
Noooo!!

465
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,560
....as brave as he could be!

466
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,080
And the children's Saber can laugh and play just the same!

467
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,440
Arise you and me,

468
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,700
the tail bearer will be at the judgment!

469
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,060
Imagine any dark, moonlit night and Rambo,

470
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,400
is the same as that night decided tomorrow,

471
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,400


472
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,400
Soumber a sÃ© horror!!

473
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,020
all over the world. The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth and a baby is born

474
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:28,760
with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp. Dare I ask it? Yes. Was the infant Jesus neither

475
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,560
man nor God, but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

476
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,100
The answer? Yes, definitely. Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,

477
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,260
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

478
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:17,480
Pieces of Cupid and Comet, and he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage,

479
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,460
and he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage. He got dancer and prancer with an old

480
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:31,600
German luger, and he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger, and he picked up a flamethrower

481
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:37,280
and a barbecue blitzer, and he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.

482
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,660
The Night Santa went

483
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,080
crazy, and he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.

484
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:49,440
The Night Santa went crazy, the night is cringy when the Santa can hardly walk around the North Pole

485
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:57,400
without stepping in reindeer guts. There's a National Guard and the FBI.

486
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:07,540
There's a van from the Iowa News and helicopters circling around in the sky,

487
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,260
and the bullets are flying.

488
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:17,020
And the bodyguards rising, and everyone's dying to know who Santa was.

489
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:25,140
My, my, my, my, my, my, you used to be such a jolly guy.

490
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,800
He knows when you're asleep. He knows when you're awake.

491
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,680
He knows when you're bound for good.

492
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,880
So be good for goodness sake.

493
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out.

494
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,040
You better not cry.

495
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,500
You better not pout.

496
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm telling you why.

497
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,040
Santa Claus is coming to town.

498
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,580
Santa Claus is coming to town.

499
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,340
Santa Claus is coming to town.

500
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:22,380
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coote.

501
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,900
ElectricElf at Loop.com can tell you more about that.

502
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,540
But now...

503
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,180
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?

504
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,660
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

505
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,600
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

506
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,360
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

507
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,740
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...

508
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limit?

509
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,620
How many do you get?

510
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,640
Jesuses?

511
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,960
Yeah, how many can you bag?

512
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,840
How many Messiahs can you bag?

513
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,000
Jesuses.

514
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,680
If you're doing it in season...

515
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,720
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

516
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, you never do that.

517
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,280
And you can only take one.

518
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,820
You never bag the Lord in C.

519
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,580
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

520
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,140
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

521
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,580
This is the season for the...

522
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,240
For the fighting Jesus.

523
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,420
Obviously.

524
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,260
We are between a rock and a hard place.

525
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,400
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age

526
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,180
and he got a very, very hard foot?

527
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,440
And he got elephantages of the rectum.

528
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,720
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.

529
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,620
That can be messy, messy, messy disease.

530
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,580
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

531
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,180
Well, I like the story.

532
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,000
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies

533
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,860
and then comes here to America and settles, you know,

534
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,900
tames the West.

535
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,780
I like when he moves into a trailer park and...

536
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,120
I like the cowboy's dog.

537
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,240
I like the cowboy's dog.

538
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,500
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

539
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,020
The ranger.

540
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,700
I like the...

541
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,620
The Texas ranger.

542
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,160
Jesus, Texas ranger.

543
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,320
Johnny Ripple was a Jesus.

544
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,080
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police,

545
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,580
for maybe the Hopi police force.

546
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,960
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

547
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,600
Man.

548
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,540
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

549
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,880
Well, what about old peacemaker?

550
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,600
The Jesus of the...

551
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,260
The Iroquois who was actually Huron.

552
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,940
A Huron.

553
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,360
You didn't know that, did you?

554
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,980
I got you.

555
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,360
Thin Ron.

556
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,820
Jesus.

557
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:13,980
El Ron.

558
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,120
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

559
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,120
Oh, it tastes like butter.

560
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:19,880
A new Jesus.

561
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,040
A different Jesus.

562
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,880
It tastes like...

563
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,680
A future Jesus.

564
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,300
A future pie children.

565
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,260
A pipe-smoking Jesus.

566
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,600
Hey.

567
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,720
Dave, you know where it is.

568
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,420
Go kick that window open.

569
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,380
I already kicked it.

570
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,480
I'll kick it again, though.

571
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,980
Kick it good this time.

572
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,520
We don't...

573
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,200
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

574
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,020
We hope that...

575
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,000
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

576
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,420
Clapping.

577
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,020
We appreciate all that.

578
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,920
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

579
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,520
That's all.

580
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,600
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff.

581
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,660
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

582
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,120
Right.

583
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,380
I could hear him say that.

584
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,980
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

585
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,920
Next topic.

586
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,160
Next topic.

587
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,080
Terrorist insurance.

588
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,520
And the atheists.

589
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,360
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

590
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,380
And science.

591
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,060
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

592
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,480
That was...

593
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,540
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

594
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of hell.

595
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,100
Jingle, jangle, jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

596
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:29,220
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

597
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,700
Wrapped in wrapping paper.

598
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,040
We're gonna break.

599
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,140
We're gonna break our necks.

600
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:43,780
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

601
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,360
Sleigh ride to heck.

602
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,080
Sleigh ride to heck.

603
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:55,880
Sleigh ride to heck.

604
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:01,160
The elves are full of cheer.

605
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,760
The kids are tucked in bed.

606
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,440
What?

607
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,220
Santa ain't coming.

608
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,580
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

609
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,120
Their dreams are filled with toys.

610
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,740
But they're out of luck.

611
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:25,160
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to...

612
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,060
Sleigh ride to heck.

613
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,720
Sleigh ride to heck.

614
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,940
Sleigh ride to...

615
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,480
To...

616
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,020
Heck.

617
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:46,940
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey,

618
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,260
James Kozalka, Superstar.

619
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,460
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith

620
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,600
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

621
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,840
stomping on a picture,

622
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:11,980
Bob, he'll do it himself. He has so much trust and faith in Bob. Bob is such a good friend that

623
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:17,240
he can insult Bob. Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of

624
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:25,340
entertaining tapes, but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the

625
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:32,460
evil of so, not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals,

626
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:39,340
et cetera, in general, of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South

627
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:46,780
Africa, et cetera, if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve. Wolves in sheep's

628
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:53,320
clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about. Jesus and Bob, like we say, our old drinking

629
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:59,460
buddies, got nothing against Jesus. It's just his fan club. And now, we aren't saying that Bob is

630
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,360
the ace up God's sleeve. He's more like the smear.

631
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,380
They're on God's handkerchief, just like you or me. But the uptight rival cults, they don't think

632
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:14,920
God has a handkerchief. Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect. He doesn't even sneeze. We're made in

633
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,320
his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us, and we have to go in the

634
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:28,640
secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things. But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

635
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,320
Oh, and he's male, but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat.

636
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,180
And smelly stuff out of him like we do, because we sin. Oh, yeah, we all sin. We're bad. We're worthless.

637
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,060
We're no good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent.

638
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,220
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

639
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:47,880
We turn.

640
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,860
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

641
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,340
Santa Claus is coming.

642
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:25,860
We'll have to wait until They Pet the

643
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:25,980
Poke episode, with Michael Dean and the tent technological

644
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:25,980


645
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:25,980


646
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:25,980


647
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:25,980


648
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:25,980


649
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,440
Speaking of assholesâ€”

650
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,680
Oh, what a fainting dark strand

651
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,100
Just like the ones I used to know

652
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,440
Where the trees are small

653
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,240
And the children are safe

654
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:20,040
And I'm dancing in the snow

655
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:37,780
I'm dreaming about the page you just sent me

656
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:44,580
And everyone can come back, right?

657
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:53,480
May your days be rich

658
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,760
And short

659
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,060
And may all your dogs

660
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,220
Spend new lives

661
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,140
Oh, holy night

662
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,160
The stars are brightly shining

663
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,040
It is the night of our gist and youth's birth

664
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,280
Long lay, long lay the world

665
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,460
In sin's pure and right finding

666
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,880
The pit and the stone found its rest

667
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,120
A thrill of hope

668
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,600
The weary world rejoices

669
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,540
Beyond our grace

670
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,860
A new and glorious morn

671
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,080
A new and glorious morn

672
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,580
Fall on your knees

673
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,040
Oh, hear the angel voices

674
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,420
Oh, night divine

675
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh, night when Christ was born

676
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,480
Oh, night

677
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:19,200
Oh, night divine

678
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,380
Have yourselves

679
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,080
A new day of life

680
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,900
Anal baby

681
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,440
Fading with the wind

682
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,900
Of love lives

683
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,620
Through the holy,icoly

684
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:30,620


685
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,760
Wander round the blue

686
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,240
Of grace

687
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:42,580
The gloomys

688
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,320
And the baby

689
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,440
behavior

690
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,460
Of grass

691
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:43,460


692
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:43,460


693
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,820
Slice the apple

694
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:45,820


695
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,400
Of great light

696
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,400


697
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,140
EØ·ha

698
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,660
Chocolate, Space Cadet, life support system down to zero, Coco.

699
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,140
Feeling space-free.

700
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,280
Have some of my new Coco Pimples.

701
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,900
Now so trumpety.

702
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,280
Smells coconut-ish.

703
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,800
This Coco Pimples.

704
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,480
Blue.

705
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,520
Hello, friends.

706
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,920
What do you think?

707
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,200
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

708
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,260
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob?

709
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:28,220
The Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures.

710
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,500
The Jethro's, friends.

711
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,780
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

712
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,300
They're at, they did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

713
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,760
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

714
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

715
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,860
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

716
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:32,600
Portsmouth, N-H-O-3-8-O-1.

717
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,320
Santa Claus is Coming to Town was by Corporal Blossom.

718
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:46,300

Illegal art.

721
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,520
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, friends.

00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:08,220
You can reach me, send me tapes or whatnot at Post Office Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

723
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,600
And friends, as always, the Hour of Slack is brought to you by the Church of the Subgenius.

www.subgenius.com

725
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,660
It's all Christmassy right now.

726
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,060
There's a bright green bob.

727
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,700
There's a bright green bob in the window.

728
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,980
Is there a light out there?

729
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,540
And Christmassy lights.

730
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,740
Is there a DJA?

731
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,960
Is DJA out there?

732
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,720
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

733
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,840
No, that's something just left for DJA.

734
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,860
It's all Christmassy.

735
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:42,820
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present under the tree.

736
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,820
Smell that cinnamon.

737
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,500
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

738
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,420
And those sugar plums.

739
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,720
Something's up the chimney hole in Satan's, isn't it?

740
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,440
Yeah.

741
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,840
Santa, I mean.

742
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,340
Otherwise, gosh.

743
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,340
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

744
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, beloved Santa.

745
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,380
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

746
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,820
This side is always so ready to let him be.

747
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,480
What?

748
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,420
For so long.

749
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,040
Hey, Bob and Mary X-Men!

750
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:46,580
Come on.

751
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:46,960
Oh my goodness.

752
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh my goodness.

753
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,800
Oh my goodness.

754
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,940
Oh my goodness.

755
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,040
Oh my goodness.

756
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


757
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


758
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


759
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


760
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


761
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


762
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


763
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


764
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


765
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


766
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


767
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


768
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


769
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


770
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


771
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


772
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,040


773
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,380
Lone cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

774
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:08,980
Don't despair, just because it's Christmas

775
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,240
Children there are so gay at Christmas

776
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,320
All the children on the street

777
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,140
Hope they get something good to eat

778
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:32,260
But for me it's not so great

779
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,180
Fuck Christmas!

780
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,080
What a night!

781
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,740
Before Christmas and all through the house

782
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,860
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

783
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,060
The stockings were hung by the tree

784
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,480
Merry fucking Christmas

785
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,160
Merry fucking Christmas

786
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,040
Merry fucking Christmas

787
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,580
Merry fucking Christmas

788
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,160
To you!

789
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,960
Merry fucking Christmas

790
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,900
Merry fucking Christmas

791
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,820
Merry fucking Christmas

792
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,840
Merry fucking Christmas

793
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,540
Merry fucking Christmas

794
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,300
Merry fucking Christmas

795
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,220
Merry fucking Christmas

796
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,840
Thank you.

797
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:29,740
Thank you.

798
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:47,500
Thank you.
