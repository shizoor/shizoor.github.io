1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
Yowl Slack!

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,400
Yowl Slack!

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:26,780
Uh, yes, dear friends.

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,740
Well, as you can probably tell from this horrible music in the background, it's going to be a Suzy the Flusie show.

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,220
Yes, you're in luck.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,760
And I'm out of time and town.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:54,600
And Reverend Suzy the Flusie, for her incredible show, Bob's Slap Time Funhouse on the Atlanta station, WREK, greatest college radio station in the universe.

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,900
She put together one of her special collages.

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,100
In fact, this one is so special that it's a two-parter.

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,260
And we're just going to barely get through part one tonight.

11
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,160
Friends, it's Suzy the Flusie's treatment of Michael Jackson.

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,560
And O.J. Simpson.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,580
It's the Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpson Hell Spree Show from Reverend Suzy.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,360
Suzy the Flusie.

15
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,620
The listener should be prepared for an almost unremitting scathing indictment of what took place in this case.

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,400
Sure.

17
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,380
And how people can twist.

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:54,780
The truth.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,240
Twist.

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,580
Twist.

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:55,960
Twist.

22
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,380
Twist.

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,740
The truth.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,120
Every time he said anything was twisted around his town in Basilica.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,900
And how.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,360
The conduct of virtually everyone associated with this case was deplorable.

27
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,200
Now listen, I'm bringing you to stay with Michael Jackson for a few days.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Isn't that cute?

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,140
He heard of you.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,980
For some, it may be a warm meal.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,320
For some, it may be just a little bit of love.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,580
I promise you, if you come along, it will make you feel good.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,780
And it will be so much fun.

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,920
Can we go, Dad?

35
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,060
Can we, can we, can we?

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,060
Take a lease, can we?

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:38,380
A child would know that publicly treating Michael Jackson like forbidden fruit could only serve to titillate a child's interest in it and get them to buy it.

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,040
Thank you, Mother.

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,400
Yay!

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,340
I look forward to working with you children.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,380
Fasten your seat belts, kids.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,480
He comes from a place.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,260
Beyond the stars.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
To take them to a world beyond their dreams.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,520
This Saturday, for one night only, your life will be changed forever.

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,640
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Springfield Speedway, Speedway, Speedway.

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,860
More stories of car crunching, fire breathing, prehistoric insanity.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,040
From his soul comes the music.

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,320
From his heart comes the beat.

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,780
Now, from the imagination of Michael Jackson.

52
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,240
One night only.

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
One night only.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,040
One night only.

55
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,940
Springfield Speedway.

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,580
This Saturday.

57
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,340
You've missed this.

58
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,040
You'd better be dead.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,660
And if you're in jail, free.

60
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,680
Now.

61
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,520
One night only.

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,020
One night only.

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,100
One night only.

64
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,580
One night only.

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,300
One night only.

66
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,920
One night only.

67
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,460


68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,460


69
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,460


70
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Jackson.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,780
Nothing could prepare you for Moonwalkers.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,380
You don't know it now, but I started you on the road to somewhere very special.

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,060
I always wanted to be a celebrity.

74
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:53,040
I love you with all my heart.

75
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
Well, it doesn't matter.

76
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,720
I mean, they're blaming you anyway.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,820
When I was your age, I had six gold records.

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,900
You know, my dad says you're going to end up dead.

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,920
I'm with your father.

80
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,360
What?

81
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Betty Jean, I'd like to help you.

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,240
Yeah, I wouldn't have a problem with it.

83
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,840
Amen.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,540
Watch it.

85
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,480
This one, this one, this one, this.

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,780
Here, this one.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,980
And this one.

88
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,780
God, I think I blew this one.

89
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,280
This one.

90
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,440
What a cute little...

91
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,300
Little body he has.

92
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:24,960
Who the hell are you?

93
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,820
Michael Jackson.

94
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,760
The Michael Jackson?

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
No way.

96
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,640
It's true.

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,440
You are Michael Jackson.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,660
This is his sister.

99
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,200
When can I get a diaphragm?

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,780
He knows you're looking at her.

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,700
My mind doesn't run that way.

102
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,160
Can I come, Betty Jean?

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,800
No, it's not for sex.

104
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
But I love miniature golf.

105
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,440
Please, can I stay with you?

106
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,140
It's not where my heart is.

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,480
I will slit my wrist first.

109
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,060
Why?

110
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,340
Because he's a fucker.

111
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,180
That's how I know.

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah.

113
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,380
Yeah.

114
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,240
I always talk like that.

115
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,160
Oh, honey, don't be so naive.

116
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,500
That's how the world works.

117
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,200
Who's naive?

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,080
I didn't say anything.

119
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,920
Betty Jean would do it just the way you know.

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,320
I'm done.

121
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,360
Send him home.

122
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,620
All right, girl.

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,480
Get on your feet.

124
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:04,980
Come on.

125
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,500
Ow!

126
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,640
Ow!

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,380
Watch your hands.

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,880
Bring in the children.

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,360
Yay!

130
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Let me in.

131
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,080
Come on, open the door.

132
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,260
Bart, think.

133
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,340
What happens to you when you turn eight?

134
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,380
I'm only ten.

135
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,320
That's good.

136
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,460
When I was ten years old, I used to go on these tours with my brothers to Jackson 5.

137
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,120
And I'd hear these crazy stories that these girls would claim my brothers had relationships with them,

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,380
which they didn't, and that they were going to have their children.

139
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
And I thought that to be so strange and so crazy.

140
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,820
Now, don't you worry.

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,420
We all get scared once in a while.

142
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,040
Maybe I can help you.

143
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,020
The two of us need look no more.

144
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
We need...

145
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,640
We both found what we were looking for.

146
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,600
With a friend to call my own.

147
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,100
I'll never be alone.

148
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,640
And you, my friend, will see.

149
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,880
You've got a friend in me.

150
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,040
Just leave me alone.

151
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,020
You'd be amazed how often I hear that.

152
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,640
Uh-huh.

153
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,540
Bart.

154
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,960
Oh?

155
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,760
Manhandle me very roughly.

156
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,040
Maybe that'll help.

157
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,700
No way.

158
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,420
Look, Bart.

159
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,800
Don't you ever feel that way?

160
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
You just want to just let it all out?

161
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,120
No, thanks.

162
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,660
Why not?

163
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,180
Don't you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were?

164
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,080
Of course.

165
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,440
If you want me, you gotta catch me.

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,720
Almost.

167
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,780
Oh, so close.

168
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,620
Prepare for a funeral.

169
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,800
Hey, Bart.

170
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,320
Hey, you.

171
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,340
That's really overdoing it.

172
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,860
Oh, no.

173
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,220
I'm going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home.

174
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,300
What should I be wearing?

175
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,660
And you'll never babysit?

176
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm afraid not, Bart.

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,620
How do you like the smell?

178
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,140
Is it good?

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm going to die.

180
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,920
Well, what's wrong with sharing your bed?

181
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,720
Make me.

182
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Suffer, little children.

183
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,360
You kissed me.

184
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,640
I said, you have to climb a tree.

185
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,580
That's part of boyhood.

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,800
You just got to do it.

187
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,480
Wait, wait.

188
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:15,900
Make me.

189
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,600
Sometimes the only thing we can do is scream.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,180
Bart!

191
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,440
Hello, you fucker.

192
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,420
I'm going to stay alive.

193
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,720
Your body starts to shiver.

194
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,460
For no mere mortal can resist the evil of the thriller.

195
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:34,900
Ah!

196
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,160
What the hell?

197
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,400
I wish they wouldn't scream.

198
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,620
We don't need no molestation.

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,260
Come here, Macaulay.

200
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,740
I want to share my bed with you.

201
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,840
We don't need no pedophiles.

202
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,940
Here, drink this wine and take these sleeping pills.

203
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
No child abductions in the bedroom.

204
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,680
This will be our little secret.

205
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,640
Don't tell mom.

206
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,780
Michael, leave them kids alone.

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,760
No, don't press charges.

208
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,900
Here, I'll give you 25 million.

209
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,260
Hey, Michael, leave them kids alone.

210
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm going to sleep.

211
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,400
Oh!

212
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,400


213
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,660
Don't tell mom.

214
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:25,660


215
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:25,660


216
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:25,660


217
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,860
All in all, you're just a prick who has that song, off the wall.

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
All in all, you're just a broken pukileks doll.

219
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,880
If you don't drink this wine and sleeping pills, you can't have any pudding.

220
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,980
How can you eat my meat, and then put on the charges.

221
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,880
I got real depressing.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,180
The W threadil mom, got me brain Rashows.

223
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,300
Rememberation.

224
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,300


225
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:00,000
I just loved becoming a monster because it gave me a chance to pretty much become someone

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,380
else.

227
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,080
It was just fun hiding behind this mask, just really letting this part of your body out.

228
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,300
And it was just thrilling for me to make that.

229
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
And the dance and all the morphing and all the fun things that we did.

230
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
It's so memorable.

231
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm afraid you'll hurt me again.

232
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,040
Why not?

233
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,580
The love of children is the root of all evil, as you know.

234
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,340
Yeah, right.

235
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,360
When I see children, I think sex.

236
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,060
That's why I love them so much.

237
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,360
If you're going to be a pedophile, why not?

238
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,260
It's all right.

239
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,840
It's okay.

240
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm sorry I was such a jerk last night.

241
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
What's the big worry?

242
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:34,920
I don't know.

243
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,280
Even if I did do anything sexual to a child, it's okay.

244
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,900
They enjoy it in a pure, loving, fun way.

245
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,400
What?

246
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:42,780
Woo!

247
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
I love you, man.

248
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,640
If they have a sick mind, yeah.

249
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,020
Do you have any food?

250
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,020


251
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,380
Do you have any corn here?

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:48,820
Of course.

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,820
Of course.

254
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,920
This one's on me.

255
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,300
Maybe later I can get on you.

256
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:52,960
Sure.

257
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:53,960
Who?

258
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,060
When I first saw him, no eyebrows, no eyelashes.

259
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,500
You're knocking me off of my feet now, Debbie.

260
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,920
He was totally fast.

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,660
He keeps me from sleeping at night.

262
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,860
So you know what I give?

263
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,520
Gift him?

264
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,780
Absolutely, yeah.

265
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,220
That's happened many times.

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,620
He never gave me a list.

267
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,420
What are you going to do?

268
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,980
I can't quite say, but it has to do with money.

269
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,780
Yeah, right.

270
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,200
Bread.

271
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,580
Bread.

272
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,000
Bread.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


275
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


278
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000


281
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:18,260
Oh.

282
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,940
Come on.

283
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,400
Go nuts.

284
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,300
What time is it?

285
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,100
Can you just give me a spanking?

286
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,340
Call the parents.

287
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,040
Send them home.

288
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
Hey, what's the rush?

289
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,620
Oh, my special little guy.

290
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,800
Are you okay?

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,880
Uh-uh.

292
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,900
Please make sure he doesn't tell anybody.

293
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,740
Oh, for crying out loud.

294
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,940
Oh, Tyler.

295
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


298
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


302
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


304
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


305
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


306
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


308
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


309
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000


311
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,520
I firmly swear I will not tell another living soul.

312
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Sucker.

313
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,440
There's no such thing as a soul.

314
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,680
It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson.

315
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,920
Hello.

316
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,280
Millhouse?

317
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,100
Can you keep a secret?

318
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,660
No.

319
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,460
Oh, well, who cares?

320
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,360
Michael Jackson?

321
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,580
Michael Jackson!

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,480
Meanwhile.

323
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,760
This is one of me.

324
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:16,160
Throughout my life, I have dissected and manipulated thousands upon thousands of children, cancer

325
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,840
kids, leukemia kids.

326
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, no.

327
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,960
I'm not a cancer kid.

328
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm a child.

329
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,560
Okay, if you say so.

330
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,600
But I will never stop helping and loving people, the way Jesus said to us.

331
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,320
He said,

332
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,100
You've got to be crazy enough to do it, kid.

333
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,480
It was as if he felt that this one little messy incident shouldn't be held against him.

334
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,600
After all, he was still Michael Jackson, wasn't he?

335
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,000
And that'd be your happy hero, cause you'd be happy.

336
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:13,160
That would make a difference in the lives of those you didn't love and crackers.

337
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


338
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


339
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


340
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


341
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


342
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


343
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


344
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


345
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


346
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,160


347
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,880
Ah, a little .

348
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:13,880


349
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:13,880


350
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:13,920


351
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,420
Hot straight about.

352
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,680
I'm annoyed, Brother said to me.

353
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,200
I'd be so hot, yeah

354
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,480
For the sale price of a press release

355
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,780
Success can still be bought

356
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,020
I'd sit so tall

357
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,740
They'd plug me in a wheelchair

358
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,700
And they'd push me down the hall

359
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,020
I'd play a song for dying kids

360
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,240
Your eyes would start to tear

361
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,360
That would be the tip

362
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,460
To bolster my career

363
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,600
And I'd be your happy hero

364
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,440
And I'd sell another song

365
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,840
And after viewing my big heart

366
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,080
You'd have me going strong

367
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,540
I'd play a gentle lover

368
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,020
In a movie for TV

369
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,060
So I'd deserve your pity

370
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,000
When my wife divorces me

371
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:49,500
If someone told, no

372
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,920
Accused of f***ing teenage boys

373
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,080
And beating others cold

374
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,460
You'd side with me

375
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,460
And enough of you would doubt it

376
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,920
Which would likely set me free

377
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:11,720
And enough of you would doubt it

378
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,820
You'd say I didn't do it

379
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,600
And that anyone could tell

380
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,940
Cause he's smooth and smart and pretty

381
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,200
And he reads his lines so well

382
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,820
And to be your happy hero

383
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,940
I'd just sing another verse

384
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,120
The more I sang

385
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,280
The more you would

386
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,740
Relieve me of my curse

387
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,020
Release me from your conscience

388
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,020
And I'd bring down the floor

389
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,240
I'd sell you Pepsi from the stage

390
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,440
And get extreme for more

391
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,300
And I'd sing another verse

392
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,140
And get a war.

393
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,900
Hey Barch

394
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,200
Barch?

395
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,680
Oh I'm getting forceful

396
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:19,780
But gay you wouldn't

397
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,920
I've never seen him like this

398
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,400
He has the demented melancholy of a Tennessee Williams heroine

399
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,940
Don't you think I know that?

400
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
He thinks you're gay

401
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,760
He thinks I'm gay?!

402
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,440
Ahh!!

403
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,040
Gay?!

404
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,980
Hot stuff coming through

405
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,400
Get him out of his closet

406
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,180
Out of his closet

407
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,680
Closet

408
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,480
Everybody back down

409
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,460
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

410
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,240
Give me the new life

411
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,560
That's so gay

412
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,400
Oh, be nice

413
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,060
Give me the new life

414
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,260
Everybody back down

415
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,320
There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality

416
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Everybody back down

417
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,800
Why would anybody want to touch a girl's butt?

418
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,080
Seems kind of gay, kind of gay

419
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,880
That won't my mood

420
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,820
Gay again?

421
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,680
He prefers the company of men

422
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,420
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

423
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,860
It's camp!

424
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,640
Hold on, Bart

425
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,220
Everything's gonna be just fine

426
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,640
And by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family

427
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Happy, happy, happy family

428
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,100
911

429
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,960
Hello

430
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,480
Oh my God

431
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,580
You shank

432
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,020
Oh

433
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,440
How could you tell on me?

434
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,260
Hold on, Bart

435
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,520
Oh

436
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,560
I'll let you ride the lawnmower through the house

437
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,160
Did you stop because I said to?

438
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
This is all like a bad dream

439
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,100
Oh, yeah, I see

440
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,840
Uh-huh, goodbye

441
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,380
I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy

442
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,320
I cherish a fond affection for him myself

443
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,820
Thanks

444
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,360
Funny

445
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,000
Please refrain from testing the knob

446
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,080
But that doesn't mean to say

447
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,880
What, what, what, what, what, what, what?

448
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,600
My son and I don't get along real well

449
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
And he knows he can screw me

450
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,460
Yes, sir

451
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,620
I believe he did

452
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,540
I would have liked to seen that

453
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,340
The Jacko has once again been accused of child molestation

454
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,240
An eerie deja vu

455
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,440
It was almost as if it was deja vu

456
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,080
As if it happened yesterday

457
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,820
Michael Jackson

458
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,600
Michael Jackson

459
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,860
Michael Jackson

460
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,860
Michael Jackson

461
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,420
Jack Jackson!

462
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,000
Michael Jackson!

463
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,240
Jack Jackson!

464
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,240


465
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,820
The yeah?

466
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,020
Are you kidding me?

467
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:43,980
What in the hell are you doing?

468
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,700
$2,000

469
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,680
Why would they lie?

470
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,180
What would they have to gain?

471
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,520
Hello, this is Michael Jackson

472
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,400
I know you're lonesome

473
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,280
But listen

474
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,520
You are not alone

475
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,400
So take the telephone

476
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,820
Call me every time

477
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,400
Oh, baby, hold the line

478
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,980
Oh, you are not alone

479
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:10,980


480
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:10,980


481
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:10,980


482
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:10,980


483
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:10,980


484
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,180
and to tell me everything to the little answering machine

485
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,980
after the hee-hee, hee-hee.

486
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,000
You awful man, stay away from my son.

487
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,820
You know, Lanshan, it's your word against my son's.

488
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,860
We're going to have a little arrangement, a layaway plan.

489
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,900
You think this is all a game?

490
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
Your money lets you get away with anything.

491
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,520
It's right down your bill, ma'am.

492
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,640
Damn near killed him.

493
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,260
$608.

494
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,420
That includes parts, labor, paint, and cash.

495
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,460
I'm going to have your ass burnt.

496
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,760
Your name dragged through the papers for so many years.

497
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,500
Everyone will know what a fake you are.

498
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,920
Bet you drive them boys crazy, don't you?

499
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,880
With your little smile and your little teeth.

500
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,320
Boy, I'll see you in jail.

501
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,740
Your monkey bit my kid again.

502
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
Bubbles, it's going to be a long night.

503
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,840
They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get.

504
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
His word against a bunch of crazy kids.

505
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,560
He's going to lie.

506
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,040
It's all his fault.

507
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,340
You think just because you act young,

508
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
why you can walk in here and make off with whatever you like.

509
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,560
Let me tell you something.

510
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,080
You're a fake.

511
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,320
You're no jive, kid.

512
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,120
You're just scared to act your age.

513
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,700
Buy yourself a mirror sometime and take a look in it.

514
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,380
Won't be many years now before you're counting the gray hairs.

515
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,180
Have you got any left?

516
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,900
And what'll become of you then?

517
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,100
You'll end your life in the gutter and it'll serve you right.

518
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,720
Because the gutter's where you came from and the gutter's where you belong.

519
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,900
Oh!

520
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,980
Oh, Marie, shut your mouth!

521
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,500
Allegations of improper conduct on my part are totally false.

522
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,480
You're just putting that in because it's commercial.

523
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,280
If kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them?

524
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,720
Acting childish, kidnapping, child abuse.

525
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Good touch, bad touch, no touch at all.

526
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,060
Child sex abuse, is that for us all?

527
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,860
No.

528
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
I'm somebody's child.

529
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,540
Please respect my feelings.

530
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,420
Don't use me, abuse me, or lead me astray.

531
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,740
I'm somebody's child.

532
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,960
Please respect my life.

533
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,760
Cause the youth of today are our leaders tomorrow.

534
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,380
Remember there's danger in dealing with strangers.

535
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,480
If it's someone you don't know, it's best you say no.

536
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,740
It might be your relative, it might be your friend.

537
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,020
But when those strangers come, it's best you say no.

538
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Oh, oh, feelings come, my little feet want to run.

539
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,720
The Michael Jackson child molestation civil lawsuit two years ago was tried there.

540
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,160
Your honor, my client has instructed me to remind the court how rich and important he

541
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,140
is, that he is not like other men.

542
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,360
I should be able to run over as many kids as I want!

543
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,440
Okay, fine.

544
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,780
How many yeses in innocent?

545
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,400
No.

546
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,720
And my reaction is, it's L.A.

547
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,760
Let's pay back Whitey and give Michael Jackson a couple of freebies.

548
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,660
We want Michael!

549
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
We want Michael!

550
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:09,020


551
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,620
Here he is!

552
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,800
Here's the guy you want to see!

553
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,920
That is why I need you.

554
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,440
I need your help.

555
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,180
Let us reach out to those children.

556
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,680
It is I, only I, speaking to you children and sending you a few little gifts.

557
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,880
If you help me, maybe we will sing together.

558
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,880
Let us think big.

559
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,100
Let us find many children to join our efforts.

560
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,220
He not the army, you of the general.

561
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:38,840
He not the army, you of the general.

562
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,020
He not the army, you of the general.

563
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,140
As far as you can see, we may not know what sort of people you love.

564
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,760

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:43,760


566
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,100
If you love him, Monday for Wednesday,

567
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,680
May the day be getting dark and final.

568
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,460
MAY THE DAY BE GETTING��

569
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,560
Still in love.

570
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:09,020
As far as I know, money means money!

571
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,440
Just beat it, beat it

572
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,200
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor

573
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,800
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor

574
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,460
Cause, live and dream because they make it over bro

575
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,200
Some jive game double under a card

576
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,620
When me come and they say me favor boy jaw

577
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,080
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor

578
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,680
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor

579
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,400
Cause, cause you love man and I know freezo

580
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
Cause, inna the church you say the apostle

581
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,620
But when you come to woman I know freezo

582
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,060
They say that me move like Michael Jackson

583
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,600
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor

584
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,240
See me ya, see me ya, tell me who me favor

585
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,080
What time is it?

586
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,520
Time for my afternoon nap, wanna join me?

587
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,020
I asked him if I could stay in the bedroom

588
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,600
Well, I'm always more cautious

589
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,180
Come on

590
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,900
And I was like, Michael you should sleep in my bed

591
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,480
I'm afraid

592
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,200
I'd like to be the meat in your sandwich

593
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,420
Sorry, you can't even get up the stairs to my bed

594
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,160
The room is totally trashed

595
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,500
And he's like

596
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,060
No, no, no, I used to sleep in the bed sleeping

597
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,160
We were like, no, no, no, it's not a good idea

598
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,480
Come on, I've been practicing kissing on my dog

599
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,720
And then he finally said

600
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,620
It's your choice

601
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,980
Okay, if you love me

602
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,600
Beat it

603
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,720
Raise your heel a bit

604
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,600
Put a little pressure on the ball of your foot

605
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,780
I was like, oh man

606
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,380
And so I finally slept on the bed

607
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,400
Most people turn you away

608
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,920
I don't listen to a word they say

609
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,700
I don't see you as I do

610
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,420
I wish they would try to

611
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm sure they'd think again

612
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,460
If they had a friend like

613
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,900
Put me in a certain position

614
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,660
Knowing that it's going to hurt my back

615
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,000
I thought you were a lesbo

616
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,160
He's a lesbian

617
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,580
He's a lesbian

618
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:06,880
He's a lesbian

619
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,480
He's a lesbian

620
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,480


621
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,480


622
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,480


623
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,480


624
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,480


625
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,920
you've seen the pictures you've heard the stories now take a look behind the gate

626
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,780

well jay simpson murdered nicole simpson and ronald goldman

678
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,420
he stabbed both of them to death with a machete

679
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,600
he was arrested on two state murder charges

680
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,140
o.j. simpson was taken to jail

681
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,440
o.j. simpson

682
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,180
o.j. simpson

683
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,400
o.j. simpson

684
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,400


685
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,400


686
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,420
o.j. simpson

687
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,160
o.j. simpson surrendered was at eleven a.m.

688
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,460
he was arrested by the los angeles police department at nine o'clock p.m.

689
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,740
outside the walsh's simpson estate

690
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,760
members of o.j. simpson's family hugged each other

691
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,760
they cried after word of the arrest came out

692
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,780
o.j. simpson

693
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,500
o.j. simpson

694
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,140
o.j. simpson

695
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,400
o.j. simpson

696
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,400


697
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,400


698
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,400


699
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,740
o.j. simpson

700
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,420
ha chick

701
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,740
Ivanka

702
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,020
Oak

703
00:30:49,020 --> 00:31:02,820
when I thought I ate a nitratin

704
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:08,680
still likes Simpson. How's O.J. doing? You know, O.J. this, O.J. that. Well, he's no longer O.J. to me.

705
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,420
He's Simpson. Someone who carves up two human beings like signs of beef forfeits his right to

706
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,360
any endearing nicknames, at least in my view. The incessant jokes and tasteless comedy routines on

707
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,980
TV and radio about the case should only serve to subliminally trivialize the murders of the victims.

708
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,580
There's this rumor that the Florida Orange Juice Association are hiring O.J. Oh yeah, they're gonna

709
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,860
pay him a million dollars a year for the rest of his life. What for? He's gonna change his name.

710
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,980
Oh. He's just Snapple. I think I'm way ahead of the game there. I think if all American families

711
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,360
were like my family, the country would be a lot better off. And we all know what happened here.

712
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,820
Simpson committed these murders. I didn't do this thing.

713
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,620
It's loose and I feel like going. Loose juice as they call it.

714
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,540
Don't mind me if I start growling a little bit.

715
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,060
Ready.

716
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,140
Let's go.

717
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,240
You just gotta get your space in if you're working out with the wife, if you know what I mean.

718
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,060
You can always blame it on her.

719
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,100
The very thought of you.

720
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,720
See, I knew it was gonna happen.

721
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,560
And I forget to do.

722
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,620
Let's go. Better take them both right here. Right here.

723
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,720
Oh yes.

724
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,180
You don't give his left hand up.

725
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Come right here, me.

726
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,720
Okay, come on you two. Start with this hand. Here we go. Here, here, here, here.

727
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,260
Hey, watch your little jammy.

728
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,680
You guys, this is not gonna cut it.

729
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,560
Come on. This hand, ready. Let's go.

730
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,160
Boom.

731
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,360
What we're doing here is just getting the blood flowing.

732
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,400
That's it. That's it. Keep that high and right on the chin.

733
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,600
Easy.

734
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,780
Now get used to this. This is just to kind of get that blood flowing, right?

735
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,120
That's it. Just hold her nice and still. That's it. Bring her down hard.

736
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,600
Let's see that jam. Let's go.

737
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,340
You're just trying to get the blood flowing.

738
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,120
Exactly. That's it. Feel the lats for the shoulder.

739
00:32:59,680 --> 00:32:59,980
Good.

740
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,220
That's the whole point of this, son.

741
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,700
That's it.

742
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,480
Get the blood flowing.

743
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:03,740
Exactly.

744
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,420
Just pull her back real tight.

745
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Here.

746
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,120
Into the side of the ribcage.

747
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,960
Every time.

748
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,400
Let's go.

749
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,060
Here.

750
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,340
Come on, Elijah.

751
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,500
Way up on the toes.

752
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,100
Whoa.

753
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,580
Elijah on, right?

754
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,140
Whoa.

755
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,700
Do it again.

756
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,120
Yes.

757
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,380
Hard now.

758
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,220
Whoosh.

759
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,240
Okay.

760
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,660
Get that blood flowing, huh?

761
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:24,900
Yeah.

762
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,940
Let's go right into the back.

763
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,280
Ready?

764
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:27,800
Here.

765
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,860
And down.

766
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,420
That's it.

767
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,140
Whoa.

768
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,240
Yes.

769
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,120
Whoa.

770
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,880
Oh, I need it harder.

771
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,340
Let's go.

772
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:35,820
Okay.

773
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,420
Very nice.

774
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,180
Now, try to get some blood flowing, huh?

775
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,240
And let's give her a turn.

776
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,140
Ha.

777
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,560
Okay.

778
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,360
All right.

779
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,860
Again, OJ.

780
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,660
Hey.

781
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,120
Good.

782
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,180
You're breaking the park.

783
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,340
Oh, yeah.

784
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,060
Hey.

785
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,520
Woo-hoo.

786
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,760
Okay, let's hold her right here.

787
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,680
Let's take a walk.

788
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,120
I love it.

789
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,280
Think how good I'm going to feel tomorrow, huh?

790
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,020
Yeah.

791
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,160


792
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,780
Wrong.

793
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,160
You know what I wasn't going to tell him, but I'm going to tell him.

794
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,120
And you know what?

795
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,920
You're a lot ahead of you.

796
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,760
And down.

797
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,880
No problem.

798
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,760
No shame here.

799
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,800
It's so hard of minding broke a thousand times.

800
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,600
I'm still singing.

801
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,240
You know?

802
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,380
I'm going to put a softer back.

803
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,040
Hands up.

804
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,720
Whoa.

805
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,920
Just like that.

806
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,120
Real simple hands up, man.

807
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,020
But if you look at it, I'm beginning to sweat a little bit here.

808
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,360
You know?

809
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,640
Now, hands up.

810
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,640
Both arms.

811
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,020
Now, OJ, I'm warning you.

812
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,660
You got this.

813
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,280
Come near me, man.

814
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,760
Hey.

815
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,340
Just take a nice simple walk.

816
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,220
I got one to protect that little knee problem.

817
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,280
Let's get going here.

818
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,540
Customer service.

819
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,260
Is this the customer service for the OJ line?

820
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:44,980
Yes, it is.

821
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,280
Okay, I got my tape.

822
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,620
Uh-huh.

823
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,800
And it's defective?

824
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,220
Uh-huh.

825
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,680
I mean, he says he didn't do it.

826
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,680
That's your opinion.

827
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,620
Well, the tape's defective.

828
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,540
He says he didn't do it.

829
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,280
Have a nice day.

830
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,380
If there is someone who isn't satisfied even by this,

831
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,480
I would suggest that this tape is perhaps not for you.

832
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,380
But you think about pursuing more appropriate intellectual pursuits,

833
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
such as comic strips.

834
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,780
I didn't do this, man.

835
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,960
This, of course, is just too insane to talk about.

836
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,020
I just didn't.

837
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,820
It wasn't in me to do it.

838
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,360
You know?

839
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,560
I mean, you can't make somebody try to be something

840
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,040
or do things that they don't have a calling for.

841
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,500
It wasn't in me to do.

842
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm 100% guilty.

843
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:19,880
What?

844
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,080
What?

845
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,620
What?

846
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,600
I'm as innocent as anyone else out there.

847
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,980
Whether you did it or not, we still love you, OJ.

848
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,080
Oh, Christ.

849
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,320
This is true.

850
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,680
This is absolutely true.

851
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,140
What?

852
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,920
In fact, Simpson cut himself while killing Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown in self-defense.

853
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,760
Either Ron or Nicole, or both together, unleashed a deadly assault on Simpson.

854
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,160
And he either took out a knife he had on his own person,

855
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,660
or wrested Ron's or Nicole's knife away and stabbed the two of them to death.

856
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,300
And that's what really happened.

857
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,480
Yeah, I see.

858
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,840
Uh, everybody can't be Martin Luther King.

859
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,280
Hey, Macko, what a line.

860
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,900
Ugh, the idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi.

861
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,500
Martin.

862
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,560
This man is obviously a psychotic.

863
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,260
And?

864
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,760
How?

865
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,680
I got screwed.

866
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,400
Wow.

867
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,340
Oh, yeah.

868
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,420
They gave me, I guess, a fine or penalty.

869
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,740
They gave me, I had to do community service.

870
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,140
Oh, man.

871
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,800
I did it all.

872
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,540
Okay, okay, we'll talk to you later.

873
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,460
I got totally screwed.

874
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,800
Relax, Mr. Angry Slacks.

875
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,760
I'm mugged to have to talk about it.

876
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:25,060
He comes off as being defensive, and when Mr. Simpson breaks through that cage, it's like holding a force back, and then allowing it to come through.

877
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,580
And when it comes through, it comes through with more power than the force actually wishes.

878
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,120
You just want it to exhibit.

879
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,220
How amusing.

880
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,820
I know her more affectionately as juror number seven.

881
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,280
Kato?

882
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,560
Good to see you, buddy.

883
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,380
129, including chemicals, out the door.

884
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,160
Stop friggin' following me.

885
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,620
Ah!

886
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,120
Woo!

887
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,540
You will never believe where we are.

888
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,160
We are at the Neverland Ranch, the home of the one and only Michael Jackson.

889
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:56,180
Okay, and we just received word he is about to make way out here and do something really, really special.

890
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,620
In just a few minutes, I'm gonna throw it over to JoJo, who is up our stage.

891
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,000
And, uh, this is happening right here at the Neverland Ranch.

892
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,000
We are here live at Michael Jackson's house.

893
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,080
All right, you guys.

894
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,280
To get this thing started.

895
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,820
Look who's here, y'all!

896
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,620
Michael Jackson!

897
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,000
Thank you all for coming tonight.

898
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,280
For, in my opinion, it's a very special cause.

899
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,840
And the cause is our future, and the future is our children.

900
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,660
And me!

901
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,580
Tommy Mottola, I love you.

902
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,440
Thank you.

903
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,280
Uh, the party's going all night long.

904
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:41,600
Michael Jackson just got up and, uh, got into a food fight with JoJo.

905
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,580
JoJo just went and took a shower in his guest house.

906
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,620
It's nuts, man.

907
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,800
And Tommy Mottola is a dad.

908
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,200
What just happened?

909
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,440
You got into a cake fight or a bed.

910
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,480
Of course, I said something about it on the microphone.

911
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,020
Everything got kind of crazy.

912
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,340
Michael turned around and I said, hit me, Michael.

913
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,560
He goes, are you sure?

914
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,360
I'm like, swing it!

915
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,800
And he hit me with like a, like a foot square piece of cake about seven inches thick in my face.

916
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,160
And you wanna hear something crazy?

917
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,320
After we partied for a while and the cake was flying, they took me to Michael Jackson's guest house to take a shower.

918
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,580
You're early, Kato.

919
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,900
A little nervous, a little nervous.

920
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,120
You know, I'm not used to being judged by more than 12 people.

921
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,400
Kato!

922
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,460
Kato!

923
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,800
OJ's house is now Kato's home.

924
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,060
Kato live with Nicole.

925
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,960
OJ say live and free.

926
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,320
OJ say live and free with me.

927
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,540
One night he hit them on the AC.

928
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,000
Daylight come the LAPD.

929
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,560
Come Mr. House for take the witness stand.

930
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,420
Make me late for, for no movie.

931
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,140
Did you see cut on OJ's hand?

932
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,880
Tonight on guest host on MTV.

933
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,520
Kato!

934
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,760
Mr. Kato.

935
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,540
OJ's house is now Kato's home.

936
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,420
I'm Kato OJ, dim with flunky.

937
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,740
Hunger come and we eat french fries.

938
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,480
Mush say we coke and junkies.

939
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,480
Medium drink and two homies sides.

940
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,700
Kato!

941
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,720
Kato!

942
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,240
OJ's house is now Kato's home.

943
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:27,380
And the aspiring but none too successful at that point after Kato saw also a career wise move that was very good for him.

944
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,040
Because in the defendant he could have a connection.

945
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,080
Some may say that.

946
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,320
But I wasn't trying to do comedy actually.

947
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,240
It was, that was me.

948
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,460
I think I'm very funny.

949
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,540
How about you crowd?

950
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,840
Disgust even me.

951
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,600
Oooh.

952
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,440
How was that one dude?

953
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,080
You showered at Michael Jackson's guest house.

954
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,580
What the heck?

955
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,840
That was like the, this is like a crazy, crazy night.

956
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,140
Much love to Michael Jackson and his whole crew.

957
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,120
Neverland Ranch, amazing.

958
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,960
Hey, listen to this.

959
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,460
Where are you Billy Jean?

960
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,840
This is your station.

961
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,680
Waiting for you Billy Jean.

962
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,720
Meanwhile.

963
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,740
It's one of my favorite things to do when we're on tour.

964
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,260
Yeah?

965
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,560
It's like lots of throwing stuff at each other.

966
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,940
There's a beauty of feces thrown all over the walls, the floor, the ceiling and it stunk so bad.

967
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,840
Maybe it's just a lot of fun.

968
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,340
Come on.

969
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:15,980
What way?

970
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm trying to get laid.

971
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,540
I am not going to do anything sexual because you totally took advantage.

972
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,700
Oh, you're turning me down, that's a laugh.

973
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,840
That's happened many times.

974
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,840
Well, can I at least rub up against your legs?

975
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,200
Mmm.

976
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,200
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

977
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,420
My penis, my buttocks, my penis, my buttocks, my penis.

978
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:37,160
I am particularly upset by the handling of my penis, my buttocks and my blotches.

979
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,000
You pig.

980
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,160
That this is what I have to endure, gaining innocent ass.

981
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,080
So be it.

982
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,520
I don't even know what a pig you are.

983
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,560
Or to keep my mouth shut or maybe for a few minutes in your room up stairs.

984
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,580
How much is that worth to you?

985
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,320
All that I have to have.

986
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,860
All that I have to give.

987
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,080
What about our lessons?

988
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,040
What were you going to teach me?

989
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,500
It was a nightmare, a horrifying nightmare.

990
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,500
You said I was gonna laugh.

991
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,240
I love being touched by a man like you.

992
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,100
It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life.

993
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,620
Goodbye.

994
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,740
This is the one step too far.

995
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,900
Alright, what's the problem?

996
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,420
Um, to call somebody. I need some help.

997
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,140
What's the matter?

998
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,300
What's the matter? Hello?

999
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,660
What's my math?

1000
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,940
What's your math?

1001
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:32,020
No, it's my math. I have to do it.

1002
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,020
What's your math?

1003
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,420
Will you help me?

1004
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,040
Sure. Where do you live?

1005
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,500
No, it's my math.

1006
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,300
Yeah, I know it. What's your math?

1007
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,160
No, you have to help me with my math.

1008
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,220
Your math? Okay. How old are you?

1009
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,360
I'm only four.

1010
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:46,520
Four?

1011
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,140
Yeah.

1012
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,880
Uh-huh. What's your math?

1013
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,040
Will you help me?

1014
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,580
Yeah.

1015
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,160
Um, darling, what are you doing?

1016
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,200
Uh, yeah.

1017
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,120
What did I do?

1018
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,660
I told you not to put it on the bag.

1019
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,200
You called that bag. I didn't mean to put it in the bag.

1020
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,880
An arrest warrant for Mr. Jackson has been issued on multiple counts of child molestation.

1021
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,400
Liar! She wouldn't do that!

1022
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,200
She didn't.

1023
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:08,640
Touche.

1024
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,500
The bail amount on the warrant has been set at three million dollars.

1025
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,700
Seems that Jacko has once again been accused of child molestation.

1026
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:24,820
Yet another 13-year-old boy has stood forward to accuse a pop star of swapping spits and a little mutual masturbation.

1027
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,900
A second allegation, you say?

1028
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,360
A moron indeed.

1029
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,920
But Michael isn't the only one.

1030
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,580
I do not think I've gotten enough children's jocks the last time.

1031
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,340
Anybody who lives in L.A. knows that.

1032
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,760
But I can't see him doing something illegal. He's in show business. He's a celebrity.

1033
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,560
Let's roll, guys.

1034
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,760
Hi. Welcome to Cox.

1035
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,440
Here, all suspects are guilty until proven innocent.

1036
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,320
Here, all suspects are guilty until proven innocent.

1037
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:02,260
Oh, we're on the progress here of the 420 in progress.

1038
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,920
And, uh, we're going to see what the situation is.

1039
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,260
We got a call tonight from the neighbors.

1040
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:17,700
This guy's in the basement doing drugs and having a bunch of friends over and getting out of control.

1041
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,780
So, uh, we got to see what's going on here.

1042
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,100
Damn, I can smell it now.

1043
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,140
Yeah, it's over there, out of the house.

1044
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,020
Hey, yeah, man, what's going on? Can I help you?

1045
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,500
I, uh...

1046
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,620
Okay, okay. We was just talking about picking up broads.

1047
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,960
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1048
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,840
That midwife.

1049
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,920
She's totally hooked on drugs. She's totally broke.

1050
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,660
Debbie Reynolds.

1051
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,920
Been doing cocaine for two days with Pedro Guerrero, who just got arrested.

1052
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,980
And I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right now.

1053
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,980
Elizabeth Taylor.

1054
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,720
Oh, man, look at her in those pants.

1055
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,280
Well, I'd like to get it hurt.

1056
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,400
But she's so stupid.

1057
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,120
Man, I don't care how stupid she is. Look how she looks in them jeans.

1058
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,900
I know you're looking at her.

1059
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,980
Guy you got a smack in the kitchen?

1060
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,580
Man.

1061
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,300
No!

1062
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,540
I'm sorry, folks. I'm not used to acting.

1063
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,080
Juicy or go?

1064
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,200
Let's put all our haters on the floor.

1065
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,400
Stop, Harvey!

1066
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,440
Juice go.

1067
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,760
OJ Simpson.

1068
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,500
Hey, woo-hoo.

1069
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,180
Thug.

1070
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,620
Ah.

1071
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,000
What is it?

1072
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,760
I love a cupcake. And that coffee smells great.

1073
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,740
You don't know what hard feelings are. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.

1074
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,560
How charming.

1075
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,740
Anything else?

1076
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,380
Nope.

1077
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,880
You're gonna get it, baby.

1078
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,740
I hope that I get a chance to sit down with you after the party.

1079
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,240
Well, at that alleged party.

1080
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,240
Forget it!

1081
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,020
If you are not taking sides.

1082
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,900
Please convey my regrets to your wife.

1083
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,360
My kids don't have a mother.

1084
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,100
Sword cuts both ways.

1085
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,160
So that makes sense at all.

1086
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,340
You think your life's a mystery.

1087
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,060
Yeah.

1088
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,560
There isn't a dirty cover-up in this entire business that I don't know about.

1089
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,160
And your hand is in every one of them. You reek of it.

1090
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,260
So that makes sense at all. I disagree with you totally.

1091
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,300
Don't mess with me, fella.

1092
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,380
You got me started.

1093
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,340
I'm just beginning.

1094
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,900
And you got me riled up.

1095
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,200
I've fought worse monsters than you for years in Hollywood.

1096
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,180
I know how to win the hard way.

1097
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,660
Get my blood pressure going.

1098
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,460
Is that a threat?

1099
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,800
That is the bottom line, but...

1100
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,700
You are not mad if you haven't the guts.

1101
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,860
Take it easy if I were you.

1102
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,360
Yeah, subconscious racism.

1103
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,560
Now you're trying to stab me in the back?

1104
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,380
Yeah, thank you.

1105
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:33,980
Oh, .

1106
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:34,920
No!

1107
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,260
I heard a thump.

1108
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:41,480
OJ went ballistic.

1109
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,740
Go, go, go!

1110
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:48,380
Picture Simpson with his sharp knife viciously stabbing and tearing a nine-foot gash in the bunch's skin.

1111
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,780
While imagining the festive party girls laughing and enjoying themselves.

1112
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,960
Can you imagine the smiles, jokes, and celebratory toasts that took place?

1113
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,440
Here, here.

1114
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,160
And so goddamn obscene, there are no words for it.

1115
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,320
Did you hear OJ's new URL?

1116
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,240
Oh, I didn't know he had one.

1117
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,680
Oh, yeah.

1118
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,420
In his mouth.

1119
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,420
HTTP colon slash slash backslash backslash backslash game.

1120
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,020
It's just too coincidental, this.

1121
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,560
Oh, man.

1122
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,120
Oh, my God.

1123
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,320
Damn you!

1124
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,000
Now, you got the wrong number.

1125
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,020
This is 912.

1126
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,340
What?

1127
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,700

It's OJ Simpson.

1140
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,100
I think you know his record.

1141
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,920
Fucking going nuts.

1142
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,480
Wait a minute, what's your name?

1143
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,500
Nicole Simpson.

1144
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,640
Simpson, look, we've already been out there tonight for a cysterectomy, a case of severe butt rot, and a leprechaun butt.

1145
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,300
How dumb do you think we are?

1146
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,540
Billy Jean!

1147
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:11,780
Call the police.

1148
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,140
It's not a good idea.

1149
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,320
Attention Neverland wretch, this is the police.

1150
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,700
Elephant Man, Tinkerbell, Elizabeth Taylor, come out with your hands up.

1151
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,800
Come on, Tinkerbell.

1152
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,540
That little kid is not my lover.

1153
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,360
He's just a boy who claims that we had some fun.

1154
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,340
Hi, Elephant Man.

1155
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,780
So I'll pay him to shut up.

1156
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,760
We told cops we're coming.

1157
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,280
We've done.

1158
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,500
Not true.

1159
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,920
So I'll give him ten million.

1160
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,660
Just ask Elizabeth Taylor, am I right?

1161
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,580
And the Elephant Man.

1162
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,400
That little kid is not my lover.

1163
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,200
That little kid is not my lover.

1164
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,100
You can see it all.

1165
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,560
And I see OJ.

1166
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,700
I see OJ, man, and he looks scared.

1167
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,420
And I would be scared because there's cops.

1168
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,500
I'm a cop, you idiot.

1169
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,000
Can't we all just get along?

1170
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,540
Oh, come on.

1171
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:13,540


1172
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,680
It's no joke when a meeting runs late, you've got to catch a plane.

1173
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,820
Well, there's my ride.

1174
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:25,800
Hiya, Frank.

1175
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,960
Good to see you, buddy.

1176
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:27,580
Come on.

1177
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,720
We're going to go for a joy ride.

1178
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,820
Dad, why is that so important?

1179
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,520
Well, quick.

1180
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,180
Get in.

1181
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,860
Hey, how did he get tickets?

1182
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,740
It wouldn't look right.

1183
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,200
OJ.

1184
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,280
Nothing's right anymore.

1185
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,540
Go on, fight slow down.

1186
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,400
Let's hit the freaking road.

1187
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,640
You hear about OJ Simpson's new limousine service?

1188
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:41,760
I hear about the limousine service.

1189
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:41,760


1190
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:41,760


1191
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:41,760


1192
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,560
No, tell me about it.

1193
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,560
Guaranteed to get you to the airport with an hour to kill.

1194
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:44,980
Oh!

1195
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,400
Suspect wanted for a Dabble 187 in West LA Division.

1196
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,100
Suspect named Orinthal James Simpson, OJ Simpson.

1197
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,780
Suspect may be driving a white or light-colored Ford Bronco.

1198
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,880
Suspect was last seen wearing a yellow golf shirt,

1199
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,880
faded blue jeans, and white Reebok tennis shoes.

1200
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,560
Suspect is possibly armed at use caution.

1201
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:13,540
The day OJ took L.A., it was the story of the day.

1202
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,680
Crowds all gathered on the overpass.

1203
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:28,340
He lost a wife to the knife, said that he would rather die.

1204
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:33,640
And all that I could do was laugh.

1205
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,960
I switched from channel 12 to 4.

1206
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,300
Don't know what I was looking for.

1207
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,900
Closer look or just a love of you.

1208
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:54,660
Traffic stopped, he waved him on.

1209
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,080
He didn't see then he was gone.

1210
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,200
But here in my room I saw in a new.

1211
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:11,540
When heroes fall, from 8 miles wide to TV tall.

1212
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:20,240
When heroes fall, no one can read the writing on the wall.

1213
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,560
Doesn't matter what they said or done.

1214
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,160
Their feet of clay will bring them down.

1215
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,820
When heroes fall, it reflects on us all.

1216
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,960
That's how hero's badass is gonna end up.

1217
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,360
How does that make him a hero?

1218
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,660
Well it's more than you did.

1219
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,700
Let's BREAK!

1220
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,620
I'll BREAK ANYTHING THAT MOVES.

1221
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:53,960
IIUP

1222
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,920
Out the Bronco. Over the driveway.

1223
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,800
Into the house, out the backyard, down the street.

1224
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,060
Into the Condo. reserves, not the business.

1225
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,300
No, that's wrong.

1226
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,960
Shut the freak up!

1227
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,560
I don't want emergency.

1228
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,420
Can you just send somebody over here?

1229
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,340
He's in a white Bronco, the poor.

1230
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,000
Mrs. Simpson, I'm sorry, but your husband suffers from a persecution complex,

1231
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,480
extreme paranoia, and bladder hostility.

1232
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,840
My ex-husband, he's bad.

1233
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,360
Good luck!

1234
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,960
O.J.'s sister was a no-good jerk.

1235
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,360
He is a fucking asshole.

1236
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:38,980
He had no business killing his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.

1237
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,460
O.J.'s sister played on the naked gun in Roots.

1238
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,080
But answer now.

1239
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,820
He is a hardened criminal.

1240
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,780
O.J. Simpson!

1241
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,460
O.J. Simpson!

1242
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,080
O.J. Simpson!

1243
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,420
I have a few line and directs on the scene of the shooting.

1244
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,580
Police have not yet made a statement, J.J.,

1245
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,680
but an all-points bulletin is already in effect,

1246
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:03,340
and an arrest warrant is in effect.

1247
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,140
This is expected, sir.

1248
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,820
Matt Taylor, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this.

1249
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,660
Okay, sure, he touched some children,

1250
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:14,660
but the man is a great singer, and he has entertained us for so many years.

1251
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,800
What are you talking about?

1252
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,600
Michael Jackson.

1253
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,900
All this bad-mouthing, putting the man down.

1254
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,660
Maybe he did touch some children down there,

1255
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,240
but come on, it's Michael Jackson!

1256
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,100
Michael Jackson!

1257
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,420
These men were chasing a girl right over here,

1258
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,540
and then all of a sudden, she splashed right through the fountain

1259
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,640
and wrapped this man down the escalator.

1260
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,580
He kept pushing me to point out the celebrities,

1261
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,400
and to help me handle them coming out of the kitchen a couple of minutes later,

1262
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,980
and there he is mopping up the floors with them.

1263
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,100
I never figured he was the guy that was looking for trouble.

1264
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,340
What do you think about this, Billie Jean?

1265
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,860
She's a rebel, you know.

1266
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,680
I think they're picking on her because she's a girl,

1267
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,000
and I think that's disgusting.

1268
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,680
Well, there you have a woman's perspective.

1269
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,200
Many still feel Billie Jean's a fine young woman.

1270
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,900
At least one person disagrees.

1271
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,660
In terms of heinousness and brutality,

1272
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,300
on a scale of 1 to 10,

1273
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,260
these Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpson,

1274
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,500
and innocent murders were a 10.

1275
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,680
A veteran LAPD detective,

1276
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,960
one of the first officers to arrive on the scene, said,

1277
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,360
It was the bloodiest crime scene I have ever seen.

1278
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,060
How do you know that?

1279
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,160
How do we know that?

1280
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,240
How did it come to pass that someone we know,

1281
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,440
not believe, but know,

1282
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,240
committed these two savage murders,

1283
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,860
is now enjoying life with a smile on his face,

1284
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,060
out walking among us?

1285
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,340
I never thought he was cracked.

1286
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,420
I thought it was awesome.

1287
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,500
Billie Jean went running up that escalator right there.

1288
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,340
This guy grabbed me.

1289
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,020
I got ahold of her backpack,

1290
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,740
and she turned around and kicked him right in the nuts.

1291
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,460
He kept on running.

1292
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,000
It was hilarious.

1293
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,280
Billie Jean, wherever you are, I love you.

1294
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:39,440


1295
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,860
You're a whole new generation.

1296
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,760
You're dancing through the day.

1297
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,700
You're grabbing for the magic on the run.

1298
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,020
You're a whole new generation.

1299
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,840
You're loving what they do.

1300
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,100
I put a picture in the motion.

1301
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,020
And that choice is up to you.

1302
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,460
Hey.

1303
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,240
All right, slow down.

1304
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:58,900
Relax, Frank.

1305
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,820
We got plenty of time.

1306
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,040
All right, where do you want to go?

1307
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,060
We may all be killed.

1308
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,880
It will only take a couple of hours.

1309
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,680
You'll be home in plenty of time to make dinner.

1310
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,420
When you're always running here and there

1311
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:19,280
You feel you're not wanted anywhere

1312
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,820
If you ever look behind

1313
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,940
And don't like what you find

1314
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,260
There's something you should know

1315
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,480
You've got a place to go

1316
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,760
You've got a place to go

1317
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,400
I don't suppose anybody would give me three million just for you.

1318
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,080
Oh, Frank's here.

1319
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,120
Come on.

1320
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,200
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

1321
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,180
Hey, Raymond.

1322
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:55,840
Hiya, Frank.

1323
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,320
Did you get enough beer for Ben, too?

1324
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,100
No, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts.

1325
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,340
And put some beer on ice.

1326
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,140
What kind of beer do you like?

1327
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,380
Um, I'm a vegetarian.

1328
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,500
And I don't drink.

1329
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,040
Drink that crap!

1330
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,680
Half-blue ribbon!

1331
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,800
Man, this was one hell of an explosion.

1332
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,700
You still don't get it, do you?

1333
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,140
Hey, look, you're asking me a question.

1334
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:12,960
Oh, ha!

1335
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,880
See, I'm in charge here.

1336
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,980
And they pick your friend up with a sponge.

1337
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:17,880
Got it.

1338
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,600
It's gonna be a long night.

1339
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,680
Let's drink!

1340
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,900
I'm Paul.

1341
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:24,600
What's your name?

1342
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,960
Michael Jackson.

1343
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,020
Boy, have you heard of MTV?

1344
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,520
I'm a TV host.

1345
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:31,780
I'm a TV host.

1346
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:31,780


1347
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1348
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1349
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1350
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1351
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1352
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1353
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:31,880


1354
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,940
Well, let me ask you a question.

1355
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,640
What appeared out of the blue and applied to me?

1356
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,560
Critics.

1357
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:58,260
There are some artists out there whose white vysts are剸ing and

1358
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,760
are distinctively non-fascinant.

1359
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,080
I cling to

1360
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,860
Master David Wright,

1361
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,320
You know, you really get pissed and I start thinking about stuff.

1362
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,120
There you go.

1363
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,060
Thanks, man.

1364
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:08,580
Ugh.

1365
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,680
Drink up.

1366
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,200
You are so freaking suave, man.

1367
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,660
The question was if I'm worried that he could go from France to France from Britain.

1368
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,460
It's L.A.

1369
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:22,800
What?

1370
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,040


1371
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,440
It's Michael Jackson's European tour.

1372
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,280
Victoria, this is Michael.

1373
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,360
Don't say anything.

1374
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,840
Just listen very carefully and do exactly what I say.

1375
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,720
I want you to go to my closet.

1376
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,740
Inside you'll find a brown suitcase.

1377
00:56:50,240 --> 00:57:00,120
Inside the suitcase is a silver sequined gown, a fur coat, a nice little purse and a wig.

1378
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,340
And a passport for Diana Ross.

1379
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,520
I want you to bring those to me.

1380
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,320
I'm going to be flying to Paris disguised as Diana Ross.

1381
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,180
Bubbles is going to come along with me.

1382
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,820
He's going to be disguised as Barry Gordy.

1383
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,700
Don't challenge anybody.

1384
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,140
Especially not that bitch Janet.

1385
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,640
Don't you know?

1386
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,840
Gee, we can't be trusted at all.

1387
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,840
What else is fine?

1388
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,940
We're going to be playing in Paris.

1389
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,520
At the home of Roman Polanski.

1390
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,200
Owen R. Kelly, he's going to love me.

1391
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,640
Creep!

1392
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,540
Don't you look at me, creep!

1393
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,740
Don't challenge anybody.

1394
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,600
Don't try to call.

1395
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,480
That's dark.

1396
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:01,860
Creep!

1397
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,520
Creep that crap!

1398
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,400
Oh, but while we're at it, why don't I give out the contact info for Subgenius Productions?

1399
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:23,980
Yes.

1400
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:29,860
If you'd like some information on the Church of the Subgenius and all the insanity that

1401
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:38,320
it encompasses, why don't you drop a line to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius at Post Office

1402
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:48,600
Box 204206, Austin, Texas 78720.

1403
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:57,240
And have a good night, Seekers, if you can after absorbing this.

1404
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,700
Oh, and good night, Al.
