Some people call the Church of the Subgenius a sex-devil end-of-the-world cult.
And it's not. It's an eco-friendly sex-devil end-of-the-world cult.
You know, you hear a lot of subgeniuses talk about,
oh, I can't wait for July 5th, 1998, which has got to be coming up soon,
when we get to destroy the normals and wreak havoc on the earth.
And my ecology-minded friends, of which I'm one, get concerned.
You know, why destroy the humans? Yeah, I can see that, but why destroy the planet?
Well, friends, the idea is to leave the earth the way we found it,
the way it was before we even got here.
Pristine, like long before we even got here.
A lifeless planet of poisonous vapor.
Lava.
Lava and ash.
Operation Clean Sweep, we call it.
Operation More Church, Less Air.
The subgenius.
All right, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow to Bob joining us from Business Affairs.
Thanks.
Hi, everybody.
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire.
Fire for you, so to speak.
Poor bastard.
Let me speak with the manager.
Excuse me.
Bob?
That's a, um, a pink.
Yeah.
Pink.
We're, uh, we're pink.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Boy, oh, boy.
Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Bobby!
Oh, I like this.
And it's pink.
I'll get you a pink wherever you want.
I had a great time.
The whole hour just flew by.
I'll get that.
Oh, thanks, Bobby.
You don't want to have any regrets.
I should know.
What do you mean?
Well, I had a dream, too.
Gonna call myself Bob.
Give me five more minutes on the name, then.
Well, it all worked out fine.
The champion, Bob!
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob story?
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants.
So I'm off to the store.
What happened to Bob?
Well, nothing.
His part of the story is done.
Neighbor, how long has it been since you reached down to your foot, grabbed that old foot gland,
caressed it with your thumb and forefinger, and felt that wonderful, ineffable feeling of slack?
Has that been a long time for you, neighbors?
Then perhaps you need to ask yourself, am I the kind of person that Bob wants me to be?
I mean, it's one thing to be looking funny and acting funny, but are you the kind of person that Bob intended you to be?
Because I'll tell you about Bob, friends.
Bob is so high you cannot go over him.
Bob is so low you cannot get under him.
He's so wide you cannot get around him.
You make your bed in hell, he's there.
You make your bed in Dobbs Town.

He's there.
You make your bed in Cleveland.
He's there.
He's everywhere.
Think about that, friends.
Announce away.
Everything on the schedule is moved up earlier.
One hour.
How about that?
For the first time ever, a subgenius schedule has been changed.
Hail Pisces.
And, well, it's because we got rained out last night.
Two very important things.
Evolution Control Committee and the Slack Black Mass had to be postponed, lest some innocent get electrocuted or electrocated by the...
By mistake.
Yeah.
Rather than on purpose.
Well, it's the 4th of July, 2013 at 16 X Day, and the prophesied torrential downpour is majorly in progress.
It's raining.
The rain is raining all around.
It falls on field and tree.
Oh, well, lovely.
It has started raining here.
It falls on the umbrellas here and on the ships at sea.
Tarzan's radio studio is safe here in the treehouse.
Rain, rain, go away.
Come again another day.
Little Susie wants to play.
It will force an audience to come to us.
Actually, I think it's stopping.
No, the audience...
There you go.
The wise members of the audience know that I'm here.

I'm here.
It's a good thing that all of this stuff will be recorded and the good parts will be on an hour of Slack.
All is recorded.
They'd just as soon not sit through the, you know, this part.
Is this part a good part?
They'd rather be out in the rain than listening to this broadcast indoors.
Is this part a good part?
Well, if that's their attitude, they may miss the first phase of the terminally thrilling Bulldada auction.
You know, I now have two pairs of shoes that are really wet.
Soaking wet.
I'm wet down to my soles.
Oh, I know you are, but you wanted to be.
I saw you running around in the rain deliberately.
Yeah, who cares anyway?
Yeah, right.
I know you don't care.
The insurance company is going to care when they have to pay for your hospitalization for pneumonia.
Oh, bologna and cheese sandwiches.
Oh, wait, what am I saying?
The world ends tomorrow and we all may die.
So what am I...
What do you know about any of it anyway?
I don't know nothing.
Everybody's missing anything.
I don't know any kind of big show, but I'm fairly certain that they're probably all so high or drunk that they really are having a great time.
Bologna!
You see what I mean?
There's a really good example right there.
Bologna!
It may be pouring rain and lightning and thundering and everything cool, but they love it.
I don't know what I mean.
All right.




My first name is Mr. Smith.
It has two S's in it.
I'll get it.
Hey, Dave.
I've been saying in Princess We Are Doe, and we're here running the...
We're using up the last rainy recordings from last X Day Drill and last Starwood 2013 since
the next one start in about a week.
Well, a week.
Stang time.
and
we also have some great music coming up
from the Amino Acids, the Psychoskeletons
Research Project
and we have heard some of G. Gordon
Gordon and some large collage
but now we're going to go back to
Starwood for
I think the opening of the
Starwood Devival section
Friends
open your hearts, close your
minds, unzip your lips
bend over and pull out that wallet
because here comes
Bob!
Oh only
that's normally when I can point
to the big screen there
for those of you who don't know
God, am I doing
a service without a big picture of Bob?
You'll have to go to our
sales table and see all of the
Bobnography
He's the guy with the
pipe that you see tattooed on all those
poor deceived
youngsters
Now what was I
supposed to do?
Somebody came up here and said
can you tell me what this next workshop
is and I had to look it up
and here's what it says
a crowd of loners
paradox or marketing niche?
I was actually going to label this
sermon
praying is for sissies
but my wife is nice and she talked me
out of using that title because it's
kind of mean
Reverend Stang will perform miracles and wonders
before your very eyes
witness this daring evil angelical
emissionary as he demonstrates
fake handling, acubating and
astounding acts of
pyroflatulation
at the very least you'll learn what
not to do. There will be no laughing
allowed during this unusual
and possibly dangerous presentation
because of the potential for
brain sneeze those
faint of mind or weak
of mind will be able to do it.
The last thing I want to say is
that I'm not going to be
talking about the

the
the
the





















the
the
rain we couldn't do a lot of stage shows and we ended up calling it the X day where the
subgeniuses had to talk to each other. And another good thing about the rain is people
are forced to huddle together under shelters and there weren't that many shelters around
so they had to huddle very closely. So in about ten months we'll be seeing a new brood
of subgenius babies. Not nine months, it's ten months because the subgenius gestation
is longer. It takes an extra month for the fetus to develop the gigantic ego of the subgenius.
The Martians are coming this way. We must evacuate the city.

In case you were wondering, 10 billion years of weirdo evolution culminates right here tonight.
Right this minute.
Which may indicate that evolution has indeed ceased and Devo was right about everything.
And they were right about everything.
We're surrounded by church folks of the other kind of church.
Church.
The rival cult against all the other rival cults that are here.
The steeple people we call them.
Actually, my little sister coined that term.
The steeple people are very confused.
They seem to think that the pagans and the subgeniuses and the discordians and so forth are devil worshippers.
Well, I think you have to be kind of Judeo-Christian or even a certain kind of Christian to even believe in the devil.
To begin with.
But those folks can stick it.
They can take that idea and stick it where the sun of God don't shine.
Know what I'm saying?
So, oddly enough, I seem to see a lot of hippies here.
Old hippies, especially.
Especially.
Some of us old hippies say, never trust.
A hippie under 30.
A hippie under 30.
Thank you.
Thank you, the psycho skeletons.
I'm going to do something unusual for me.
I don't usually just read to people at Starwood.
I've had the horrible experience of coming to see a speaker who was some kind of hot shot,
and supposedly all he did was read from his own book in a monotone.
And so I get to do that once.
Only this time, I'm going to do a sermon that someone wrote for me.
It's the same guy that writes half the stuff I say anyway, Reverend Onan Canobite of Portland.
But this was a particularly good one because it helps me build up to get more important statements.
And that's why I'm reading this.
I got an email just last week.
That said,
Reverend Stagg, I was listening to the Hour Slack radio show,
and you played a sermon from last X Day Drill.
Some girl was going on and on, and I didn't like her voice.
That girl wasn't funny at all.
Why did you play that?
There's a simple answer, dear friends.
She showed up!
She was there and got on stage and let the tongues of flame burn through her,
and yes, she forgot her lines, and the recording was awful,
and Reverend Funny Name kept yelling at her,
but she did something that that email critic didn't do.
She showed up.
The Church of the Subgenius is not a democracy,
and it is not a collective.
It is a strict hierarchy, and there are three, yeah, three,
immutable means of advancing the church.
The first is advancing up the ladder of sales success.
The first is yours for a mere $35.
I mentioned that earlier.
The second avenue to success is you got to be funny,
or smart, or attractive, or some combination of these.
Actually, I'm not sure you have to be any of those.
But the hardest one is this.
You have to show up as you did.
And so did I come to think of it.
You think all those early doctors, the subgenius leaders,
had it going right from the start?
Does anybody seriously think that Dr. Philodrumon and I
were the best choice for running a global mind control mail order cult?
Well, you think funny if you think that.
We showed up!
That's it!
That girl at Ex Day showed up.
So if you want that date,
or that sales diocese,
or to be lifted up in glory,
ass first on the day of Exist Grintervention,
you have to show up.
You could be part of the greatest show up on earth
if you just show up.
Now I just mentioned that the day of rupture,
all subgeniuses who have paid their $35 to Bob
will be lifted up into the heavens,
ass first!
And that is literally true.
When you've seen a comic strip character go feet up in that third panel,
that's what I'm talking about.
It's a big shepherd's crook pulling us off the stage.
Not because we showed up and we're no good,
but because Riverboat Dobbs got us a better gig uptown.
Can't you just see it, dear friends?
Your hands and feet flapping in front of you
while your keister shoots to the sky.
Bob will save your ass,
and the rest of you will follow.
Now, praise Onan.
As you all know,
humans are the internet's way of making more internet.
Thank goodness for the internet.
Yay internet.
But those rules don't apply to us, not entirely.
Because of that hideous, yet kinda sexy,
human yeti miscegenation of so long ago,
we're half-breeds.
We, the subgeniuses, are the wolfmen and the mermaids.
The neither here nor there,
neither hot nor cold,
the circle without center or circumference.
Therefore, both logic and moral hygiene
demands that we use the internet,
but nay, not let it use us.
Go the hell outside,
I say to a crowd of loners outside.
Go for a walk, clean your house and cook some food.
Go meet your friends, talk to your family.
Show up.
Believe me, your unpaid job doing data entry for Facebook
will still be there for you when you get back.
Yes, there are pictures of naked ladies online,
but you could have sex with a live, beautiful girl.
Or an ugly one.
Or a fellow yetisan.
So step away from the computer, put the phone down,
and live.
Whichever planet this is,
it's unbelievably big and scary.
Bigger and scarier than any screen.
It's nut-wrenching.
We stand to receive thee, you who are of but flesh,
and understand not the way of the lead-clad ones.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
This is it. Time to close the deal.
Eat the hell out of all of those hamburgers.
You're the one you've been saving yourself.
Living well is the best revenge,
but you have to live well, and you have to live.
When you pass a mad scientist on the street,
does he curl his fingers and shriek,
It's alive?
If the answer is no, then you need to get on that.
You are good enough, you are clean enough,
but if, if and only if, you get right with Bob tonight.
Good night!
Oh wait.
Oh well, see, his script wasn't perfect.
Thank you, Onan, for writing that.
We did it, there's a quite разy-sup.


was��one standing there,

We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.

We'll be right back.
Guys, I see the finish line.
I would love to stay, experience what real teenage life is like at Monster High, but there is no other way.
What if there were?
Finder, as you wish.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The lantern fell into the deep end of the pool, and at Monster High, the deep end goes down forever.
Let's hold this, Casbah.
Put your hands together for Cat in the Water!
We are running at Auerbach Parade.

Look inside, cool.

I'm sorry Gil, I know you really liked me being a freshwater ghoul.
No, no, that's what my parents wanted you to be.
I like you just the way you are.
Good!
Because I'm going to beat your fins off at the swim meet this weekend.
Friends, there's good news for you here today.
Yeah, there's great things a-comin' cause Bob is coming to you.
And you'll be coming to Bob if you will just accept his beneficent wisdom and word.
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the high epoped mystical guru and transcendental trickster who has made
those who follow his tenets and beliefs.
Slack-filled, happy, and fully, fully realized.
So friends, next time somebody asks you, you know about Bob?
Don't turn away.
Don't laugh.
Don't sneer.
Because if you don't know about Bob, and you have not taken Bob into your heart by tithing
to that sacred box number, then friends, you are among the benighted, the uncared for,
the damned, and the ungrateful.
And you are among the damned and the deceived.
Because you are slaving for the conspiracy and have no knowledge of the evil things that
will and are befalling you.
But you can strip those scales from your eyes, dear friends.
Yes, come to Bob.
Let Bob show you the meaning of what Slack truly can be.
You'll only get one chance for Bob.
And you better not give it up.
Bob is no nickel-dime-bum-show.
I'm putting it to you, friends.
He's a cork in fine salvation.
Shout hallelujah and fightin' Jesus.
Get on that Dobstown train.
We're all Malaysia-bound, blessed in the mighty aura of the great pipe of Dobbs.
So here's your chance.
Get aboard or be left behind, friends.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
As the Rudy Schwartz Project tinkles in the background, I can tell you that earlier music
we heard, we had two amino acid tunes and one psycho-skeletoon.
I think it's called the Amino Acid Tune.

You can probably figure that out, which was which, if you're a recent or regular listener,
I mean.
If you're not, who cares?
Well, we care about our old friend, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, who has slunk into the station
somehow.
That's one thing?
That's one thing, all right.
Right.
One big ugly thing.
It's not ugly!
Well, it depends on whether you're a big ugly or a big ugly.






You're looking at Dave or the double mean baby head on the back.
Well, that's true.
Well, things could be a lot worse.
I could have the bulbous nose of one of my ancestors, Tatar, who was from the Caucasus
Mountains and lived on a diet of rats and old cheese.
I think it was suspended something.
Suspended?
I suspected something was suspended there, deep down in there.
What?

Yeah, that's because, well, that's because Doctor You-Know-Who is back.
No, I don't really...
I don't know who.
Which, I know a lot of doctors that could all be back.
Did you know that mankind is canned mind spelled sideways?
And then, you know what that means?
That means that mankind is meant to be slaves, and that's the doctor I was talking about,
your buddy You-Know-Who.
Oh, yeah, mankind was a great wrestler.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The one, he had the reptile mask and everything.
I don't, I don't...
And if you loved him, he made like the purring noises and stuff, but that's not the point
of it.
Oh.
It's rather a pointless diatribe anyway, but it had a lot to do with where I intended
to go.
Who the hell wants to go there?
Oh, come on, Dave.
You don't, you didn't even know where you were going, now, did you?
No, I did.
I even wrote stuff down before I called, and then my mind went blank, as usual.
Oh, yeah.
And I looked at this stuff, and it was just like, you know, there were a couple ellipses
and some, and then, you know...
So not only did your mind go blank, but your notes went blank too, huh?
But when you can laugh, and it sounds like you're using some kind of electronic synthesizer
in your voice, and you're not even using an electronic synthesizer, well, then you've
really got something, Dave.
Well, does it really sound like that?
Yes.
Often.
It does.
Yes.
So it's the usual ad nauseum phone problem?
No, no, it sounds good.
No, she says it sounds, you sound good, like you were, like you had one of those special
Darth Vader voice synthesizers going.
Exactly.
So, like, if I were to do, like, porn music from the, like, the bass line from the porn
music from the, like, late 1970s, like, .
That would create something?
Yeah.
You know, I, I, there, you can get albums of porn music from the 70s, and I, it goes
great with micro photography of little single cell creatures having sex.
Well, there are Hipster's Delight, along with really bad corny, corny jingles from the 60s,
stuff that's beyond the trans, migration and transformation of elevator music, a la the
Duke of Uke and others, of his, her, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his,
and the Duke.
Well, the more, the more heavier a tune is the better an elevator tune it makes
for subgeniuses anyway.
Well, it's like a one, One point—
Or something by the, Black Sabbath would make good, be good.
Well, but the, the other show, we, we had Rolling Stones' Muzak playing all the way
through in the background.
Black Sabbath, um, elevator music is great, yes.
Well.
Also, I agree.
I had an orgasm with, I forget what it was, but maybe it was an orange.
Well, you're easy to please, Dave, aren't you?
Well, when you don't have enough to eat, that's what you think about.
Well, I could really go for a chocolate fudge sundae right now covered with human hair and vile other mixtures.
Listers, you know what to do.
You heard Dave.
You can email me, stang at subgenius.com for his address.
And you can mail all your hair.
It's Thursday again.
Mixed with melted ice cream sundaes.
Oh, there's all kinds of stuff you can do with it.
You can make, you know, like little embankments around your house to keep away the werewolves.
And you could also use it as a solar implantation device so you can get, you know, all the meaty mess,
all the...
All the messages you really, really, really, really need from the great beyond,
as well as solar power your house like they do in Germany sometimes.
Dave, did you know that you weren't on a show that I did earlier this week?
I wasn't?
Right.
Because, you know, it's been a long time since I, well, a few months,
since I sat down and did an all-edited show.
Where we didn't come into the station at all.
I just used tapes or whatnot.
Well, I did one earlier this week that will never, ever be played on this or any other broadcast station.
Yes, I did.
Whereas this show is Hour of Slack number 1469.
Earlier this week, I put one out just on the internet that was number 1469.5XXX.
And it was all the...
Naughty, naughty, naughty stuff from Starwood, Last Starwood and Last X Day drill.
And also the Pittsburgh revival.
It was all the kind of stuff where, you know, sometimes I cut the cuss words out of things for the broadcast stations.
Well, this was all the stuff where you can't...
They make you do that.
It's like if you were to do that, there wouldn't be anything left.
So, listeners, if you...
Get on the internet and go to subgenius.com and click on the part that says radio up near the top,
you would soon see a link to the 74-minute long Hour of Slack number 1469.5XXXXXXXX.
And it does have some sex in it.
It has some real sex.
It has Bob's sex life recorded.
How Bob got that job.
Yeah, but it's not really about sex.
No, it's not.
You mean about Bob.
No.
It's mainly about offending normal people.
But if it's like those other triple X rated shows, it's really, really, really bad.
So that's the orange with the orgasm link?
Yeah.
On turn.
Yeah, when you said that you had an orange orgasm, that's what reminded me that I had done a really awful show.
And it was awful partly because it didn't have you in it.
Yes.
Sad.
Well, no, but it was, you know, abundant with all the filth we love so much.
Oh, yeah.
That's the reason why a lot of people go to a subgenius gathering is to hear people just stand up there and swear like a sailor for about half an hour.
Reverend Richard Skull had a sermon he used to do almost every year where he would get up and for about one minute just yell one word over and over and over again.
And I bet you can guess.
For unlawful and carnal knowledge.
Yeah.
Over and over and over.
It was one of those if you can't take a joke type words.
What was it again?
His sermon was just yelling a cuss word for about a minute.
But he put a lot of feeling into it because he meant it.
Yes.
Well, we all mean it when we're doing that.
It was the equivalent of saying darn, darn, darn, darn, darn.
Only much, much stronger.
That's why those words are made to take us there to the realm beyond where the exclamation point is like.
Oh, darn.
And then it becomes, you know, you cube it a couple times.
Then you play.
What's that game when you thrash around by a garbage can and stuff wearing a mental patient's outfit?
Wilding?
No.
Wilding was in Clockwork Orange.
Oh.
Hey.
Clockwork Orange.
Orgasms.
It all adds up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It sharpens you up and makes you ready for a bit of the old in-out.
In-out.
Yeah, I could go for some Malachi Plusco right now.
I could go for three bags full.
Margaret Pusko?
Malachi Plus.
Malachi Plus?
Malachi.
Yeah, that's one of the drugs they have.
Oh, yeah.
Synthamask, Dremkrom.
You know, they, yeah.
Yeah.
From the Kurova Milk Bar.
It's all Synthamask and can you spare me some Cutter Me, Brother?
Right.
Other pieces of...
Of genuine.
Artifacture.
Which makes me want to bark and cry at the same time.
It's no world for an old man any longer.
Well, like all the urine-soaked posters I have from the Church of the Subgenius, just
sitting here waiting for a collector, you know, these things gotta be worth a couple
pounds.
I mean, I checked one time on eBay and the one over on the west side where Todd was claimed
to be El Morto and stuff appeared on the stage.
Much to the chagrin of some of the young ladies and the impoverished people, anyway.
Remember that?
Men flying around the moon and there's no attention paid to earthly subgenius collectibles
no more.
Yep.
It's enough to make you want to pull out your can opener and cut the apes open, every
one of them.
And suck the juice out.
And crack their knuckles.
And cut the bones out.
And use them for dice.
Arr.
Arr.
Yep.
Country living.
Just the way George Washington had it when he was a brave young lad.
Remember those days when he used to go around scalping Indians and raping African-American
slave ladies and stuff?
Well, you know, it was okay to show that on TV as long as it was African-American slave
ladies.
Remember that show?
Show Roots?
Yeah.
It was okay as long as they were slave ladies.
You could show them topless.
But otherwise, you could not do that.
Except on the internet.
And, uh...
I've just been unfortunately reading a little bit about American history lady...
Uh, lady.
Listen, babe.
No, I've been...
I've been hallucinating.
You're so...
I'm so sick of you.
And then...
And then...
And then...
And then...
And we're still slaves.
And that kind of goes right in with what I forgot.
And what you have been always telling me.
No, Dave.
We're not slaves.
We're not slaves.

And...
I'm sorry.
But really, we're not slaves because we do have a choice.
Slaves do not really have a choice.
They can't even die if their, you know, masters are doing it right.
No, seriously, you know
That was one of the biggest problems
Yeah, it's
I mean, it could be worse
It could actually be worse
Yes, but we must cry out
Against this dystopia which we've created
With our
Lack of interest in our apathetic
Or we could turn it
Into a comedy show
A sick one
And kind of trivialize all the important
Problems that America faces
Church is a subgenius
It's a better politically way to eat
As a Saturday morning cartoon show
Actually, it was
A leftist guy named John Judge
Who said that about us
In 1981
And I was so buggered, I remembered it
Actually, we used a clip
Puzzling Evidence recorded it
Somehow
And every now and then we love to
Pop out those clips
Of people hating the church
People, yeah
People, sure
But this
But that was also a prediction
Of a dystopian future
Because now
The church of the subgenius is as political
As a Saturday morning cartoon
And there's nothing more than political
Than the apathetic
What is it?
The observation of Mill
The obsession with
Paronculence
The stupidity
That's what I call it
The stupidity of the average
Subgenius
Well, that's the thing, you know
As dumb
As a subgenius is
Yeah, yeah
Look at what we have to deal with
I mean, it's like
And somewhere there must be
People who are smart
Of course, we wouldn't be able to recognize that
By definition
If we encountered, say, a radio show
Where people were actually
Kind of sharp and clever
It would sound like
Blabbering nonsense to us
It would sound just like
Random craziness
And we wouldn't be able to comprehend it
Yes, how could we discern
Any sufficiently advanced science
Is like magic
Or bad comedy
Whereas to truly
If we were really, really geniuses
We'd be able to
Tell the difference between
A nonsensical bunch of blabbering
On a college radio station
And
And
And















, you know,
You could probably get them down to $2 an hour
If you talk quick enough
They'd go for it, too
Come on, Dave
Let's face it
You or me would both jump at a job
That paid $2 an hour
That would be a step up for me
We're incapable of
Correctly
Storing and using
All this information we take on
It's beyond the tactile
And the cybernetic
Oh, is that right?
Is that right?
Is that right, Reverend McLuhan?
Well, it sure feels like it, man
It's just still like you're bombarded
And most of the time
It makes you want to go to the bathroom
And it's not just
And you say, well, you're getting older now
So your body's falling apart
Well, perhaps that's true
And your mind
Don't forget your mind and your right ear
That's what I forgot
You know, I used to come in
Over the last few months
I'd come into the station and go
Man, the headphones in the station are all bad
Like mine
The right side
The right channel is just weak
Then one day
I lifted my left ear off the pillow
And discovered that Princess Wee
Had been talking to me for five minutes
And I could hear her
As long as my left ear wasn't against the pillow
See, now the first time you told me that
When you lifted your head
A golden tooth fell out of your ear
And the Princess Wee was there
In the tutu
With a huge wand
Ready to grant any wish or command
Well, if I told you that
You better pick up on it
Yeah
I don't remember it
But if I said it
Then it must be so
Let it be so
You got it, Bosh
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
So let it be moat
Whatever the hell moat means
And smoke as well
So let it be smoked and moated
And bloated and dried
And eviscerated and chopped up
And
Died and
Eased and
And
And
And
And
And
And







He's been hanging out with the moats
I guess so
Hazel moats and the rest of them moats
They're no better than quaits
No
And the quaits ain't no better than monskos
No
I'm gonna get them quait brothers
Them quait brothers better watch out
That's all I got to say
What do you have against quakers?
Quaits
Not quakers
Who cares about quakers?
They're
By definition they're harmless
Quaits
Well except for the one heard in the background
Except for the ones that used to quake so hard
It would make the reverends shiver in their pants
The quaiters of K-par
Hey I have some background music here
Instead of this monster hunter game music
I could play you and Reverend Angry Larry
At 9X Day I think it was
Yeah 9X Day
So that would be like 8 years ago
Look that sounds
That's you
I think
I think that's Dave too
Yeah it's two Daves
It's the two Dave band
Yeah
Dave and Reverend Angry Larry
Two Daves
I'd like to hear this
And just get back and enjoy it with my children
Hey man
What happened to my nose?
Yo
Hey wait a minute
What has happened to your nose?
What happened
What has happened to my nose?
Okay then
What has happened to my nose?


Hostestias
Hostestias
What has happened to your nose?
No I'm asking you
What is happening to my nose?
You know Dave
If we could get you out to X Day
We could have another two Dave jam
Yeah
Because the mean old acids are going to be there
And
And
We were even talking about taking two cars
So that
that one of us could spend a week taxiing you there and back.
Wouldn't that be exciting?
That would be rather exciting.
Every day?
No, nobody's going to do that.
That would take all day.
It takes all day to get from Ashtabula to Wisteria Campground near Athens.
I mean, it really does.
It takes like seven hours.
No, it takes five hours.
Depends on how you go and how the traffic is.
Remember, a whole lot of that is through tiny little headless horseman towns.
Well, that is true.
When you get into the headless horseman towns at night, it's not bad,
but during the daytime, rush hour in tiny little towns is worse than rush hour in the middle of the big, big, big, big city.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Now that there's all big cities there now where there used to be small little tiny acrimonies,
villages.
There used to be bearded snakes and they used to whisper baboons increments into their each other's ears, you know,
like on city council meetings and stuff like that.
One guy would always be smart and he was a transvestite.
They still have those.
Yeah, thanks.
Those little towns.
Praise Bob for such small little encumbrances that we get to wear on our necks.
Such teeny tiny favors that he does for us.
That's not much of a life anymore for a veteran of the great wars.
You know, it's one damn tagging him out.
The wars between the, you know, what war was it again?
I don't know.
I don't know nothing.
I know nothing.
This seems to be going around.
The world's worst war.
But I don't even know what verbal command.
I'm responding to in my internal dialogue when I start saying, I know nothing.
I know nothing.
I know nothing.
That's a Sergeant Schultz from the hilarious concentration camp comedy, Hogan's Heroes.
But what's the silent read me that Dave is having to obey?
That's what he wonders.
I don't know.
So I get these commands, you know, and things like that and stuff.
And sometimes they're spelled out.
It's like really bizarre.
Like color, full, full, full color.
What you call it?
You know, whether you shove it in your head real quick and you see colors.
You ever have that one?
You can't even really make out what the information was.
You can't slow down.
I had to quit doing that.
It's like proto texting from.
Makes my neck hurt.
I can't do that anymore.
Well, you're lucky you still have a neck.
Unlike some of us.
Dave shoves colors.
Colors into his head.
Yeah.
Dave can't get the colors out of his head.
Man.
In my head, there's no neck anymore.
My head's just stuck on my shoulders and my arms are getting shorter, too.
Well, one of them shorter than the other one.
There are atrophy in a different way.
I don't know what that's got to do with.
In my head, there is no neck and in my neck, there is no throat.
And in my lines, there is no passage of the future.
What could I do?
But become.
Become a subgenius priest.
What else could I do?
It's like you're swimming in a miasma of synesthesia all the time.
Well, that sounds like you're trying to set up synesthesia.
So.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no.
I was just wondering about the colors, you know, and tasting them and everything.
They're very flashy.
They're very vibrant.
It's like the television.
Tell it.
The old television scale.
Was.
Was it red, blue, green, ROYGBIV or something like that?
Mm hmm.
Sure.
Do you remember?
Sure.
Whatever.
Now it's purple, tangerine, orange.
No.
When you go down to there's, you know, you go to your color bars and one is red and O is orange and Y is yellow.
So it's ROY.
G is green.
That's his middle name.
And his last name is BIV.
Blue, indigo, violet.
And that's how you always.
You always know that there's, you know, different wave frequencies going on that they're biting
you with.
What about Abel Baker?
Abel Baker is like part of the tangled foxtrot Charlie syndrome of the shortwave radio listeners
who are also losing their larynxes and small animals that they can't feed anymore.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
That's all I can say to that.
That's intense, Dave.
That's really intense.
Really.
You know, man, things have just gotten so bad now in this world.
If you can call it one.
Well, it can be made better.
There's always a way.
And that way, the truth and the light is the bedotted face of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,
who that post office box that G. Gordon Gordon was threatening you with earlier is about
to be given.
So get your pencil ready, weakling.
It's subgenius at post office box one eight one four one seven Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
Four four one one eight.
Well spoken, Steve.
You know, life doesn't have to be so awful.
There are ways.
There are wonderful things happening like X Day and Starwood.
Well, but those cost money to get to.
Yes, that's true.
But there's good food there and good entertainment, though.
I mean, you know, well, there's good food.
If you can have a jolly time for five minutes.
OK, there's food.
Granted, there is food.
Oh, man, that food is delicious.
I have tried it.
I thought everybody is some kind of culinary trying to outdo each other, you know, while
they're hanging out.
Trying to out booty each other, did you say?
Yes, that's what I said.
And I meant it, too.
And you and your uncle shock and the rest of the people who own that factory think they
own this town.
My uncle shop out of this.
I didn't mean that, uncle.
I meant the poor uncle, the nice, sweet one with the plastic tape on his lips.
He died.
Why do you have to remind me?

Because the sutures will have to come out sometime another Sunday.
Don't cry, man.
Sit down in the barber's chair.
We're going to give you a little shave.
Now, you know what a shave is.
It's a micro implant somewhere back at the base of the spine, right under the upper
bone.
We have to go now, Dave.
We have to go.
I already went.
OK.
Yeah, me too.
Once again, you know.
Dave went.















He went already?
Yeah, we're going to go back to the mean old acids doing a song called The Satanic
Rites of Connie Dobbs, which has no lyrics.
So you can make up your own, everybody.
It's one hell of a rush, man.
OK.
See you, Dave.
See you, Dave.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Hey, groovy cats.
We are back.
And this is Buster Buttons from CKLW coming live from Thunder Bowl Lanes right here in
Allen Park.
Now, tonight, we have a very special treat.
These guys, well, they're a long way from home.
And I have to tell you kids that their getup is out of this world.
Now, they call themselves the amino acids.
And they're going to be, oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.
They're the amino acids.
And tonight, they're going to play a tune for you all called Connie.
Take it away, fellas.
They're the amino acids.
And I'm Trip-Ssiκ and I will see you tomorrow night.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Thanks, everyone.
See you tomorrow, bye.
It squid be long.
P me more.
How was that, D?
