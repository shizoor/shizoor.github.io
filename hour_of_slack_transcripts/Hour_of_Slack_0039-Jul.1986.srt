1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
All right, that was Not Anymore by Screaming Jay Hawkins.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,960
Those are all these last few tunes.

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,820
Before that was A Thing Called Woman.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,320
She Put the Whammy on Me and Constipation Blues.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,040
I'm Robert Wisdom, and you've been listening to the American Music Party.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,320
Hell, man, somebody.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,560
Thank you, Robert.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Boy, that was great.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,180
Love that Screaming Jay Hawkins stuff.

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,600
You're right.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,000
That's a good intro for an hour of slack.

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,680
Good hour and a half intro.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,500
Probably a lot better than what you're going to get for the next hour.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,560
Oh, yes.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,640
And, oh, Buck just walked in.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,820
Oh, come on, man.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,440
Hi, girls.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,040
Okay.

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,200
Let's hope this works.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,920
What do you got to say?

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,580
Hey, my ball won't get up, man.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,540
What do I do?

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,100
What?

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,800
My ball won't get up.

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,580
What do I do?

26
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,920
Your ball won't get up?

27
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,280
Yeah.

28
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,860
Well, I don't care.

29
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,980
You got a ball in my pocket.

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,380
Yeah.

31
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,300
Oh, well, that opened up a lot.

32
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,240
Hello.

33
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
What about you?

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,020
I got a great big monster ball in my pocket.

35
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,820
Hey, Rick Buck.

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,520
In answer to your second question,

37
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,580
it was planned that dog noses should look like wall sockets.

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,040
Opinions expressed in this rant are my own

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,860
and probably not even remotely similar

40
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,660
to those of you who have heard me speak.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm not sure if you're aware of this radio station

42
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,040
or management or equipment.

43
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,000
Today's sermon, friends,

44
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,620
is on the girls of 7-Eleven.

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,280
As you may know,

46
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,960
the Southland Corporation

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,120
and many other chain convenience stores

48
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,880
recently ripped Playboy and Penthouse off their shelves

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,500
because they received vague threats

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,720
from some stupid arbiters of decency or another

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,700
saying they'd be charged with selling pornography

52
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,660
if they kept those balls in their pockets.

53
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,600
Those nasty magazines in stock.

54
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,880
Now, apparently those magazines are much more dangerous

55
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,320
than cigarettes or beer,

56
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,380
which 7-Eleven still sells.

57
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,520
Now, I don't even buy Playboy and Penthouse myself.

58
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,460
Not that I think they're bad magazines.

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,020
Exactly.

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
They're just pink.

61
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,500
Pink in the wrong way.

62
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,860
But, see, Bob Dobbs doesn't believe in censorship

63
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,600
aside from child pornography

64
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,300
and subgenius church financial secrets.

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,820
In fact,

66
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,040
he once decreed that child sex pornographers

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
ought to be tortured on live TV for life.

68
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,600
But it's more pornographic

69
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,720
to hide that stuff away

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,840
and call it dirty

71
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,180
than it is to show some naked people

72
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,240
strutting their stuff.

73
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Sure, it exploits women.

74
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,460
So does perfume and detergent ads.

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,180
Conspiracy's always gonna exploit everybody

76
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,920
for everything one way or another.

77
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,800
Repression,

78
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,840
That's what makes twisted, screwed up, suppressed needs

79
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,200
turn into bizarre outbursts of irrational hate.

80
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,280
You aren't going to go blind from whipping it,

81
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,420
and that's all there is to it.

82
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,500
Hello, darling.

83
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,820
Hello, darling.

84
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,120
Hello, darling.

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,820
Hello, darling.

86
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,880
Hello, darling.

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,200
Hello, darling.

88
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,800
Hello, darling.

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:20,800


90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,200
Hello, darling.

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,900
Let me feel your willy, darling.

92
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,800
Let me feel your willy.

93
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,420
So anyway, I was in the 7-Eleven.

94
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,200
I told this clerk there I'd been thinking about boycotting 7-Elevens

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,260
because of their hypocritical decision to quit selling stroke books in the U.S.

96
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,840
Because they still sell them overseas.

97
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,160
But this clerk was shocked at what I said.

98
00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:00,580
It was obvious that she thought it was just fine that 7-Eleven wouldn't sell those dirty magazines.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,700
Now, you know, Playboy, to get back at 7-Eleven, is planning to run a pictorial on the girls of 7-Eleven.

100
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:16,800
And the sexist jerk that I am, I was thinking, gee, I'd kind of like to see this female clerk pose for that.

101
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,240
But friends, this was the trick.

102
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,120
There was no way that would happen.

103
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,000
Playboy.

104
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,880
I wouldn't use this woman because even though she was perfectly attractive as far as I was concerned,

105
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,540
or probably anybody else, she's real tall and real skinny,

106
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,620
had a bit too much character in her face to be called beautiful

107
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,240
by Playboy's pretty much sold-out, pink, conspiracy-oriented standards.

108
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,940
And I thought, now, which is the censorship, friends?

109
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,980
Isn't it running in both directions at once?

110
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,620
Just as 7-Eleven won't sell Playboy's,

111
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,900
Playboy wouldn't photograph.

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,240
This woman, just because she doesn't conform to their perverted idea of perfect feminine beauty.

113
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,320
So you got the conspiracy of the Puritans versus the conspiracy of the sex masters.

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,740
Hello, darling.

115
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,720
Let me feel your way, darling.

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,980
Hello, darling.

117
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,260
Let me feel your way, darling.

118
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me feel your way, darling.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,060
Let me feel your way, darling.

120
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,260
Hello, darling.

121
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:17,640
Hello, darling.

122
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
Brave Bob.

123
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,720
Brave Bob.

124
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,660
Brave Bob.

125
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,740
Brave Bob.

126
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:29,920
Brave Bob.

127
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,400
Brave Bob.

128
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,400
Brave Bob.

129
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:31,900
Brave Bob.

130
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,880
Brave Bob.

131
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,420
Brave Bob.

132
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,620
Brave Bob.

133
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,100
Brave Bob.

134
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:37,940


135
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,520
Brave Bob.

136
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Bob?

137
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,320
Bob?

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,040
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

139
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,880
every time you say, see, hear, or think

140
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,800
Bob?

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
That's your key phrase.

142
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,660
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware.

143
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,540
There is absolutely no other possibility.

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280

As it will be shown, it is well within the restrictions of the television code

150
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,080
which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas

151
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
than the industry code.

Join us.

162
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:23,880


163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:23,880


164
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:23,880


165
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:23,880


166
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,200
Welcome potential initiates.

167
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,300
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

168
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,860
The next day I was doing some volunteer work for the station.

169
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,880
I was sitting in between two fellow K-N-O-N DJs who were women.

170
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,120
On one side was a lady who hosts a gospel show

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,080
and on the other was the host of one of the women's lib type shows.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,260
They would have censored that playboy too, but...

173
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,040
but for totally different reasons each of them.

174
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,140
And Playboy would have censored them right back.

175
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,680
And truly, friends, the conspiracy is an insidious, multi-headed beast.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,060
They'll let you roam real far out on one leash,

177
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,440
and then they got another leash attached to yank you back.

178
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,480
Now, I've got two kids.

179
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,540
Do I want my kids being exposed to every aspect of grown-up sexy stuff?

180
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,740
Do I really want to curse my son and daughter with the Playboy mentality?

181
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,540
No.

182
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,060
But I don't want this bitter, jealous kind of censorship, neither.

183
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,060
So what's the answer?

184
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:32,580
And the answer, friends, is if we subgeni want to combat both the Puritans and the Sex Masters,

185
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,500
we'll just have to be as entertaining as the Sex Masters.

186
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,600
And we're already way ahead of the Puritans, so we don't have to worry about them.

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,520
So, therefore, rather than stop exploiting,

188
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,520
women on this show, we need to have some women come on and exploit us.

189
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,320
And we never said they couldn't.

190
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,680
They just never wanted to.

191
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,260
And I think, frankly, it's because they didn't want to lower themselves to our level.

192
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,760
But tonight, friends, we're censoring all male callers

193
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,040
and allowing only female callers tonight under the theory that two wrongs do make a right.

194
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,460
So call in 828-9500, but only if you're female.

195
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,480
Sorry, no morphidizing.

196
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,240
Unless they've been through the complete sex change operation.

197
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,840
So call on in and give us hell, baby.

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,260
All right.

199
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,060
All we need to do is shake it off

200
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,920
And pack it on our feet

201
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,140
Shake it off

202
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,440
When they talk about you, shake it off

203
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,460
Shake it off

204
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,520
Shake it off

205
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,800
When they miss you, shake it off

206
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,080
Shake it off

207
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,800
Shake it off

208
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,440
When trouble comes in your life

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,740
Friends talk about you

210
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,380
Oh, yes, dear friends.

211
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,020
Oh, praise Bob.

212
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,720
Hey, Buck, get off the phone, man.

213
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,920
We got a show to do.

214
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,240
I'll just...

215
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,180
What you, what you, what you got on with you?

216
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,460
Come on.

217
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,360
As we said, friends.

218
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,960
That is a great, great, excellent conspiracy caller there.

219
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,940
What was that?

220
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,000
I said we had an excellent conspiracy caller there.

221
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,840
And he was telling me about this information.

222
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,140
He's going to send it to us in the mail.

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
And we're going to finally find out who off JFK after all this time.

224
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,320
I don't know who off JFK.

225
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,500
I'm not going to say.

226
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,300
Yeah.

227
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,280
Bob told me.

228
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,860
But yes, friends.

229
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,100
This guy knows about a certain...

230
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,940
A gentleman with the initials KT that we could name who was Oswald's foxhole buddy.

231
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,600
That was also a hierarch subgenius.

232
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:54,820
Yeah.

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,660
Uh-oh.

234
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,900
Oh, more evidence.

235
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,380
So he knows...

236
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,520
This fella, this fella, I mean, he was definitely on the ball.

237
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,520
This is not a cuck call by any means.

238
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,440
This is...

239
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,100
That's what they always say.

240
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,180
But tonight we can't have guys on the air because it's all women.

241
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,960
That's right.

242
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,340
All women.

243
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,480
All women night.

244
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
We have had...

245
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Like you just heard in...

246
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,260
In Ivan's tape.

247
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,320
We have had some justified complaints that it's too much of a boys show.

248
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,440
So, hey, no problem.

249
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,500
So tonight women call in and we've got a special guest.

250
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,000
We've got a special guest.

251
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
And it's Sally Page.

252
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Hey, y'all.

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,420
How y'all doing?

254
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,180
So Sally will come out and talk.

255
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,360
So we would like women callers...

256
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,720
I'll be answering...

257
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,600
Women callers for the air only and the number to call.

258
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,700
828-9500.

259
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,140
Or...

260
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,580
828-9500.

261
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,580


262
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,280
823.

263
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
What's the 823 number?

264
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,220
7490.

265
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:48,960
That's it.

266
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,200
823-7490.

267
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,760
On that...

268
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,420
On those calls, 823-9500, we can handle a lot of calls.

269
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,460
You might get unlucky and get the one line that's out right now.

270
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,940
So if you just hear it ring and ring and ring about more than, let's say, 20 times, hang up and try again.

271
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,660
Praise God.

272
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:04,900
Oh, good.

273
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,200
We're already starting to get a few.

274
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,560
So, yeah, we'd like women callers.

275
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,680
We'll screen you just to make sure you're the right sex.

276
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:24,920
When you're faced with a serious situation, you've got a world that's on the verge of nuclear holocaust and the all-democratic institutions in this country that haven't already vanished are under severe attack.

277
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,040
And when all that comes to mind is the Church of the Subgenius, I've got to think that's one of the reasons we're in the trouble we're in.

278
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,220
Well, just to try and put the Church of the Subgenius to rest.

279
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,240
Those of you who are not familiar with it, the Church of the Subgenius is essentially a group that...

280
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,380
And I'm sure that people will argue with me with this, but it's essentially sort of a comedy routine.

281
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,360
I mean, they may have a...

282
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,940
It's not a philosophical point, but it's based on humor.

283
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,780
There are articles about it in John Rubenstein's...

284
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,300
John Carroll's column in the Chronicle and things of that nature.

285
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,100
It's more or less a sort of a comedy affiliate.

286
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,060
It's about as politically weighty or less politically weighty than, you know, Saturday morning kids' TV.

287
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,080
So there's nothing to it.

288
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,360
Okay.

289
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,600
So what's next, children?

290
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,520
You look around at this youth culture, this political universe, you ask yourself,

291
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,700
Well, what the hell is left?

292
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,380
Elvis Presley's a fat monster?

293
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,180
Ramones are covering the Chambers Brothers?

294
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,540
What the hell is left?

295
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,980
The Church of the Subgenius, children.

296
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,700
That's what's left.

297
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
Say it with me, Brother Doc.

298
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,780
We may just be a joke, but it's a joke you can believe in.

299
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,020
Oh, children, children, children, if a joke is all it's left to believe in,

300
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,980
you don't blame Bob.

301
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,700
He doesn't make history.

302
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,060
He just exploits it.

303
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,920
Hi, Bob.

304
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,220
Right, Bob.

305
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,700
Bob.

306
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,960
Bob.

307
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,960
Through subversive measures, Devo passes on the word of Bob by, uh, we...

308
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,060
If you take a look at our last album cover,

309
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,940
his name's been airbrushed into the rubber hairlines of each of the band members,

310
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,840
right next to the word sex.

311
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,140
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

312
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,980
Well, Bob is a kind of total, all-consuming sex.

313
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,820
Bob is a sex god.

314
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,040
Bob is a sex god.

315
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,180
For the backwards in galaxy.

316
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,720
We're like explosions.

317
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,000
We're like explosions.

318
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,260
We're like explosions.

319
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,100
That leave you feeling good.

320
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,780
We're like ideals.

321
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,200
That change the world for good.

322
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,840
There's nothing past the stop and go.

323
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,420
There's nothing but the up and go.

324
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,060
There's nothing like some in and out.

325
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,640
There's nothing more than what you know.

326
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,580
Oh, yeah.

327
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,580
About the only slack.

328
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,540
The only slack that I get anymore is worshiping at the holy temple of Ioni.

329
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,820
And...

330
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,920
Ah!

331
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

332
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,140
Oh, my.

333
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,140
Oh.

334
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Ah!

335
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,400
Oh!

336
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,020
Oh!

337
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,580


338
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,120


339
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,640
Oh!

340
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:41,760
Oh!

341
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:41,760


342
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:41,760


343
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:41,780
Oh!

344
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:41,780


345
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,420
Oh!

346
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,420


347
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,420


348
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:42,900
Oh!

349
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,780
Oh!

350
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,420
For Bob my friend, Bob is a sex god!

351
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,760
Ain't a bigger abomination in the world.

352
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,040
Than women wearing men's clothes.

353
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,620
And men wearing women's clothes and people being perverts.

354
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,560
That's the, two of the greatest sins in the world.

355
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,220
Is idolatry, witchcraft, homosexuality and men and

356
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,260
women wearing.....

357
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,000
The clothes of the opposition.'

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:22,140
and sex. It's abomination. And whosoever do it is abomination. And there's more people today,

359
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,280
their minds are perverted, their life is perverted, and they've been given over to a reprobate mind.

360
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,620
So many people today, even people that aren't homosexual, their minds are perverted. It's filled

361
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,540
with filth, and it's filled with all the ungodliness and wickedness that comes from the pit of hell.

362
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:48,540
And you see it on television, you see it in the movie houses, and you see it on the market stand.

363
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,200
Hey, and how about pornography? Shucks, all you have to do is look around you.

364
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,380
Female body parts are available just about anywhere, or pick up some picture books with

365
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:06,240
a free orifice included. Miracles of Engineering, yours for the plucking. If you don't mind the smell

366
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
of vinyl.

367
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:25,220
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh no, I messed it up, I messed it up. What? I messed it up.

368
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,660
Risa, call back. Risa, call back. I messed it up. Dang it.

369
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,060
Now mama's on the bottom and papa's on the top. Baby's in the crib, a-hauling for her to her pop job.

370
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,060
Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob.

371
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,940
Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob.

372
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:52,360
Yes, my baby knows. Now sea is sea and land is land. Can't get my boogie, I can get it by hand.

373
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,120
Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob. Hey, Baba Rebob.

374
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,180
Hey, Baba Rebob. Yes, my baby knows.

375
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,220
Bob, in fact, is sexy.

376
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:19,680
And all in common from sex that is the very in-ness and surrounding-ness of the union of both the human and the uni.

377
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,000
And not just heterosexual sex. All sex.

378
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,520
Bob does not choose to fornicate.

379
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,880
Bob has the tune of runtime.

380
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,320
Us to fornicate.

381
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
And not just with women. Not just with men.

382
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,040
With animals, with plants.

383
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,520
And the things that I do.

384
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:40,760
Seriously.

385
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,480
But we have both.

386
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,560
Look, if someone wants to do this...

387
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,980
Okay, level three has passed all.

388
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:03,980


389
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:03,980


390
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:04,340


391
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,220
This black slave, I was told, was Его, hoodlum, blacksmith.

392
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,100
vegetables, meat.

393
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,500
I see.

394
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,700
And we already got a

395
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,600
We're already getting a call

396
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,340
Oh good okay

397
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,140
Let's see if we can bring that up

398
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,320
So to speak

399
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,820
Hello

400
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,160
Hey how you doing

401
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm in a band called the Gravity Pilots

402
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,460
And we have a new song called

403
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,820
Bob is Sex

404
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,720
What do you think

405
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,820
Send us a tape

406
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,220
Send us a tape alright

407
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,800
I think we have sent you a tape

408
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,500
We sent one to KNON I'm not sure

409
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,780
Send one care of Buck Naked and I'll make sure

410
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,200
Okay Buck Naked Gravity Pilots

411
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,500
You know our PO box right

412
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,580
Right I've got the address

413
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,080
Oh and I was at the anti-pornography rally

414
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,440
Down on McKinney

415
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,560
And Cole at the park down there

416
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,520
Tell us more

417
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,940
Well actually I was there

418
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,100
Screaming free South Africa

419
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,800
But anyway

420
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
I saw lots of pink mediocrity

421
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,360
Pink media is the only kind

422
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,320
Right right

423
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,280
Jerry Falwell

424
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,420
And Zig Ziglar

425
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,720
And you name it

426
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,960
So anyway they all marched down

427
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,340
And I went home and went back to sleep

428
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,540
Because it was early in the morning

429
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,780
Do you think there's any chance of saving these people

430
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,140
Well there's always hope

431
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,360
Bob brings hope for anything

432
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,560
Bob is

433
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,340
Bob Hope is

434
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,400
Something like that

435
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,620
Bob is our hope

436
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,840
Well keep going

437
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,100
Jesus is Bob Hope

438
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,720
God is

439
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,260
God is

440
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,980
God is Bob Hope

441
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,440
Oh no

442
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,860
Well I'm moving to Austin

443
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,720
What should I do

444
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,860
How can I keep in touch

445
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,320
Figures you'd move to Austin

446
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,700
Get a satellite dish

447
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,280
And send a lot of

448
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,780
Well we can't tell you what to send to the subgenius church

449
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,920
But you know that PO box number 140306 in Dallas Texas

450
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,620
140306 75214

451
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,900
Okay well thanks

452
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,820
Oh yes and now

453
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,760
Praise Bob

454
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,260
Praise Bob

455
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,260


456
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,260


457
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,260


458
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,260


459
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,600
Praise Bob

460
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,340
Praise Bob

461
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,940
I think we've got another caller here

462
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,560
Would you mind

463
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,040
Okay bye bye

464
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,560
Okay

465
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,800
Hello

466
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,420
Hello

467
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
Oh this is Risa again isn't it

468
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,800
How did she know

469
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,280
Well I heard I took your call before and we got cut off but it was kind of an accident

470
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,300
We have the whiff reading device working right now

471
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,460
Oh that's okay but it really happened because the fair sex is the woman

472
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,560
Okay well keep going with that

473
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,500
Oh no no no no no no

474
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,260
I just wanted to know if you had any questions

475
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


476
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


477
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


478
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


479
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


480
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


481
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


482
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


483
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


484
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


485
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


486
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


487
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:38,260


488
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,540
Are you in the new new cult

489
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,080
Well why are you talking about this I tuned in kind of late why are you only taking women

490
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:53,480
Well primarily really because we get accused of having something against women or being

491
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,760
a boys club and it really isn't exactly that way

492
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,500
Oh it doesn't matter if it is or it isn't I wanted to ask you guys something we listen

493
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,940
here to y'all on Sunday nights and we wanted to know how long it takes you to put this

494
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,400
all together

495
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,860
Uh it it we put it together as you listen I mean this is we're all it's all on tape

496
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,700
anyway you know

497
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,160
I mean you guys don't sit down and get all this this music and

498
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,380
No no we leave it up to the chat to the to to to Bob's decisions it's all done entirely

499
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,580
by chance I have 7,000 cassettes sitting in front of me and I just stick one in after

500
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:36,920
another and praise Bob it just all seems to come out me you know it's not really a big

501
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:36,920


502
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,760
It's not really meaningful but as long as people think it is you know it doesn't have

503
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,780
to be true it only has to sound good and that's the key to running a religion properly you

504
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,320
know what I mean

505
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,160
It sounds very good it sounds like you work all week long to do it

506
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,820
I wish I wish I was being paid

507
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,140
Now I have another question who holds the pipe of Bob

508
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,180
Who now holds the pipe of Bob well that is a very good question because uh we don't we're

509
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,900
not sure about that we're not sure about that we're not sure about that we're not sure about

510
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:14,740
now whether the whether Bob Dobbs is alive or dead and there's a there's a supposed Bob

511
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,780
corpse implanted in Lucite at the top of the Interfirst Bank building with a pipe a broken

512
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:28,760
pipe clenched in its teeth but you know subgenius doctrine says that that if Bob's pipe is not

513
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,880
if the smoke from Bob's pipe is not rising to heaven the aliens won't think there's anything

514
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,740
on earth worth saving and they'll destroy us.

515
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:36,900
It's not a problem.

516
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:36,900


517
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,700
Oh in that case in that case we have to believe then that he's alive

518
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,340
we must we must there's no choice and there's no explanation you know that's the important

519
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:53,240
thing you have to remember there is no explanation and if we can just have faith in Bob and accept

520
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,680
that then we got no problem you know

521
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,800
well then I guess we should all praise Bob then

522
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,880
yes praise or kill Bob

523
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,500
no no no no never kill maim but never kill

524
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,420
maim Bob

525
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,900
okay I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead

526
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:14,400
and now we've got we've got a one of our K&ON DJs now to give a tell something to a previous

527
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:14,780
caller

528
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,420
okay

529
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,800
this is this is Audrey now she Audrey's gonna speak to us all in subgenius

530
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,900
Hello this is to the person that called and said they're going to Austin we have had somebody

531
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,900
from Austin call us up on our show several times and say that he has hooked his radio

532
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,780
antenna or wires or something up to telephone.

533
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:36,880


534
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:36,880


535
00:25:51,920 --> 00:26:06,880
We usually call this arato

536
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:06,880


537
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,500
By the way, I'd like to say this also.

538
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,700
Ka-vomit.

539
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,000
That's a secret message to somebody else out there.

540
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,020
And what did you say?

541
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,640
Ka-vomit.

542
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,260
Oh, you're talking about vomiting now?

543
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,020
No, no, no, no.

544
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,300
It's ka-vomit.

545
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,400
Oh, oh, oh.

546
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,140
Special message.

547
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,540
Oh, oh.

548
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,700
Well, I just wanted to call in and make an appearance that you said only females to call in.

549
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,400
I wanted to...

550
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,140
Absolutely, because we get too many calls from men and not enough calls from women out here,

551
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,600
so we're going to try to undo all that in one night.

552
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,080
We're just doing some censorship now.

553
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,120
Oh, well, I think you guys are doing fine.

554
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,440
You have no problem with me.

555
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,280
If no women want to call in, well, tough luck on them.

556
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,820
Okay, well, thanks for sharing that with us, and call us back sometime.

557
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,280
Bye.

558
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,120
Okay, slack.

559
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,580
Hello?

560
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,940
I don't know if I got that one.

561
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,380
I think I got it that time.

562
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,740
Wow.

563
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,240
Hello?

564
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,680
Hello?

565
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,280
Hello?

566
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,440
Yeah.

567
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,060
Hello?

568
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,280
Hello?

569
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:00,880
Hello?

570
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,180
I think we messed up.

571
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,760
No, here we go.

572
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,560
I think...

573
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
Doctor...

574
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,020
Is this it?

575
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,720
No!

576
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,860
Doctor, please.

577
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,080
No, wait.

578
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,680
Can you wait?

579
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,260
It is a time of flagrant immorality.

580
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,420
A time when the old standards have crumbled as if hit by history's greatest tidal wave

581
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:28,340
of filth and perversion and sexual promiscuity undreamed of even five years ago.

582
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,800
America's theater marquees screen every kind of degeneracy known to man,

583
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,960
from which...

584
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,640
to its craft and occultism, to devil worship and necrophilia.

585
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,900
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore, while the nation's mailmen stagger under a burden

586
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,480
of filth that pours off the press and into America's homes.

587
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,740
Nothing is sacred, and the profane is sold on the Open Market Places of our cities, while

588
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,640
God is mocked, and the churches themselves.

589
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,060
Stage dances for sex perverts and new statues are substituted for the state's laws against

590
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,060


591
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,060


592
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,060


593
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:05,900
elen.

594
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,700
of the cross in an Oklahoma City Catholic Church.

595
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,680
We'll be right back.

596
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,860
Watch out!

597
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,380
Are you kidding?

598
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,460
Nice guy, huh?

599
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,880
Oh, God.

600
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,300
This is a crooked and perverse nation.

601
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,300
A guy like that, to me,

602
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,120
they should do nothing less than draw and quarter him.

603
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,820
Well, televise, draw and quarter him.

604
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,680
No.

605
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,880
It's coming. It's coming.

606
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,600
The only reason I'm going this way

607
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,280
is because I was cutting over to Abrams,

608
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,080
but I never did.

609
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,920
You can look for televised executions

610
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,060
by the late 80s.

611
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,660
It happens.

612
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
It has got to stop.

613
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,000
Man, I'll tell you what.

614
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,420
It's just, there seems like the weirdos are,

615
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,780
I mean, the really weirdos,

616
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,300
the dangerous weirdos are outnumbering

617
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,020
the harmless weirdos now.

618
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,620
Uh-huh.

619
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,160
It's giving a bad name for all weirdos.

620
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,440
Go ahead, T.

621
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,480
Go ahead.

622
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,140
Go ahead.

623
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,560
Go ahead.

624
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,560


625
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,560


626
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,560


627
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,560


628
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,620
The lady down the block,

629
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,540
she had her piggy on the trolley

630
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,680
when it felt so bad.

631
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,900
So he took it the first chance he had,

632
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,880
and then he shot her in the leg.

633
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,700
But this is what she said.

634
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,920
He's only a rag.

635
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,600
You really can't blame him.

636
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,940
Only a rag.

637
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,480
I decided to maim him.

638
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,840
Only a rag.

639
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,140
It's our responsibility.

640
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

641
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,440
Only a rag.

642
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,980
He really couldn't have them.

643
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,340
Only a lie

644
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,040
He didn't want to do it

645
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,280
Only a lie

646
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,240
He's under privilege and abuse

647
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,560
The cops, a little bit confused

648
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

649
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,580
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

650
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,220
Uh, yes, dear friends, this is KNON 90.9

651
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,980
The voice of the Yetis

652
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,540
The voice of the Yetis, everyone

653
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,360
Where are we at, Sally?

654
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,720
What city are we in?

655
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,520
Um, Big Dig Dallas, Texas, yeehaw

656
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,340
And what happened to cassette, too?

657
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,800
I'll drink to that

658
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,060
Oh, it's cassette one

659
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,800
You can drink to anything

660
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,940
Do you want to take another call?

661
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,040
Huh?

662
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,620
I think it's

663
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,440
Yes, yes

664
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,560
I want to hear from teenagers

665
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,860
I want to give some helpful hints to teenagers

666
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,020
Teens, call in

667
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,660
This is the

668
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,700
You know, sex, friends

669
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,200
Is the key

670
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,220
Is the divine battle

671
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,580
And we're just not getting enough violence

672
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,720
And verbal epithets hurled back and forth

673
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,820
It's a battle that shall never end, friends

674
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,480
And, you know, this is

675
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,460
This is a sexist church

676
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,200
And that we're for the sexes

677
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,000
You know what I mean?

678
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,460
You worship Brother Bob

679
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,820
You don't worship Sister Carol

680
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,140
No, as a matter of fact

681
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,100
There's Bob's feminine counterpart, Barbara

682
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,220
His twin sister

683
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,180
It's a twin sister

684
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,340
Is that anything like She-Ra?

685
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,460
Very much like She-Ra

686
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,700
You know, She-Ra is He-Man's twin sister

687
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,200
In a separate universe

688
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,380
Barbara

689
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,520
We just lost one

690
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,100
Those poor

691
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,800
Those poor callers

692
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,240
You know, and I'm wondering

693
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,720
What happened to my poor cassette?

694
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,460
Can we hear anything from this caller?

695
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,080
Hello, caller?

696
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,040
Hello?

697
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,700
Hello, nice caller

698
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,700
Come here

699
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,160
Come here

700
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,160
Come on

701
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,320
If we don't get a real caller

702
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,780
We're gonna put a fake one on

703
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,460
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

704
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,820
Give me a little call now

705
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,520
Come on

706
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,740
Be a good caller

707
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,360
Come on

708
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,780
How about that?

709
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,480
Hello?

710
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,640
Here I am

711
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,000
It's Reverend Cecilia again

712
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,540
Oh, great

713
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,900
You bounced around on the board

714
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,220
But go ahead

715
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,500
Talk to us

716
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,680
Oh, hi, guys

717
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,080
It's a wonderful evening

718
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,840
Isn't it?

719
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
Praise Bob and then some

720
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,220
Oh, yes

721
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,180
It's wonderful that you're finally talking about Barbara

722
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,160
Not too many people know about her

723
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,420
Not Barbara

724
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,240
The divine counterpart of Bob

725
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,880
The mistress of Slack

726
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,460
That's right

727
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,220
Well, Barbara is

728
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,900
You know, Bob looks different every day

729
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,720
And I've got pictures of Bob

730
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,000
You bet

731
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,480
I'm Barbara even as we speak

732
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
And who knows?

733
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,160
Sally maybe as well

734
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:27,480
Well, you know, the reason we don't talk about Barbara much

735
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,940
Is frankly there's a terrible scandal involved in the Dobbs family

736
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,160
Uh, Bob is a terrible man

737
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


738
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


739
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


740
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


741
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


742
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


743
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


744
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:40,520
Bob has tried to cover up a certain rather intimate relationship that he had with his sister, Barbara

745
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,680
Mm-hmm

746
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,500
That is Bob

747
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,200
But Barbara and Barbara are one and the same

748
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,580
Oh, ask Onan about that one

749
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah, well, it does take two to make a squirting universe

750
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,580
Well, there's a squirting oozing universe with two

751
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,080
That, too

752
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,040
Now, we could get into singularities

753
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,280
But that's okay, too

754
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,140
Absolutely, positively

755
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,180
Mm-hmm

756
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,160
It's a lot more fun when you have both of them

757
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,060
I agree

758
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
How long do we have to go?

759
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,600
See, why do you think you have to keep this on, Bob?

760
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:22,700
Because we're trying to find out

761
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,000
Then we can also see color

762
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,000


763
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,080
We can now get to decide

764
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,240
Is there a collusion of MICHAEL and OTTA

765
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,240


766
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,780
Yes, but you know

767
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,860
To Ideally be connected

768
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,560
Why not?

769
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,780
people may have ideas now that they've stumbled upon it but now we're talking about something

770
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:45,500
totally alien to our way of of uh reproduction entirely oh i don't think we can underestimate

771
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,780
this this reverend here what do you think it's the third or fifth section i think the the uh

772
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,300
it will bring like a new boom to business to singles bars personally i think oh absolutely

773
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:03,020
absolutely even now on alien joining the rush i urge all the subgeniuses to get out there and

774
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:10,080
practice and be ready for it be ready for it because it's coming good friends and so will we

775
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,120
all oh yes dear friends sex hurt yeah sex hurt that don't mean tying them up nay nay it doesn't

776
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:24,660
mean hurting anybody means love just pure love love until it hurts until something hurts too much to

777
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,420
keep going

778
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:39,960
so uh oh yes it's it's it's so true and you know the problem is though the conspiracy set it up so

779
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:47,520
that both sex and the lack thereof cause tremendous problems and can you imagine when there are 24

780
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,300
different sexes how many people you're going to have to hit on in a singles bar it'll take you all

781
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,080
night to get the full combination

782
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,220
for sure no one will get bored that's right and just think uh pansexuality

783
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:10,820
a pan full of sexuality and a bucket of slack beer friends and a loaf of bread and a jug of wine and

784
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,300
dad beside me squirting in the universe

785
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:23,260
someday friends that mighty climax of this whole universe will occur and earth will make it to the

786
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,280
to the punch line i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced

787
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,820
i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced i'm convinced

788
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,580
you know if we can just let bob finish the the minor practical joke that's right the one that he

789
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:41,620
doesn't stick around for praise help me somebody oh yes thank you sister praise cecilia praise you

792
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,340

794
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,180
what that's a good question this church is a what is it you know that's that's the only

795
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:19,060
way we can describe this religion we're part of is there a god it is a god why limit yourself to

796
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,920
one there are there are more than one no matter what you've heard from the false churches philosophy

797
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,280
where uh i don't believe it you're just just a part of it you're just a part of it i'm just part of the church

798
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:34,460
in god or the so-called god of you don't believe in god what were you saying there is a god

799
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,800
okay what do you believe in instead i i believe that i don't have to believe you don't have to

800
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:52,320
i believe that i don't need a superior being that i have to believe in i believe i can live

801
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,320
by myself and not having have to believe or depend on something else just depending on myself the

802
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:07,320
only problem with that is you cut yourself off from bob man from bob yeah and barbara let's not

803
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:17,200
forget barbara barbara and what about nunu i mean don't you don't you ever have the need for nunu in

804
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,980
your life what are the ancient fertility goddesses of the past right

805
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,100
nunu and narnini i mean where would you be if it weren't for those fertility goddesses

806
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,820
what if you never had a sperm donor what what do you think i mean i know you're strong enough to

807
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:39,360
stand on your own but but why bother when you've got all these great gods goddesses

808
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:46,680
i mean why not use a crutch if you've got one i've tried it you've had no it doesn't work you

809
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,360
would have no holidays to celebrate maybe the fourth of july oh i celebrate every day

810
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,140
this

811
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,940
this isn't it there's no reason to have to celebrate you can celebrate whenever you feel like

812
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,520
well yeah but you have no fruit in your life you know bob's birthday is it is every day and

813
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,160
it's true you don't have to celebrate bob's birthday for him but that gives you some one more

814
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,200
excuse to have another beer that's right he's had 365 different past lives each one

815
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,160
beginning on a new disc see i think you're closing yourself off you don't realize this

816
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,300
the church of the subgenius is totally different from all the other crutches you've ever seen i've

817
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,160
been to the church of the subgenius i mean most of those are just to be metaphorical the rest of

818
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:33,960
them are like just sticks of wood bob is like an electric wheelchair with with uh servo motor arms

819
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,940
on it that does everything for you well i see it this way where uh something happens the only

820
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,420
reason i have to blame is myself and that way i don't get hurt but don't you know you can't don't

821
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,020
you blame neagie for all your misfortunes any of them that you don't think neagie can even mess you

822
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,800
up it's called karma

823
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,360
karma oh she does have a religion yeah

824
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:05,300
yeah so everything has a fill your guts uh-huh i believe in karma the cause of okay causing effect

825
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,640
so in other words if somebody's bad in this life then they're gonna they're gonna have to pay for it

826
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:19,740
later every day a person makes their own karma every day a person okay but if you make causes

827
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,200
and whatever your cause that you

828
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,520
make every day even when you're thinking you're making a cause

829
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,780
what about him what about him does that mean what about dust bunnies what about him caller caller if

830
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,080
you had an affair with a married man all right does that mean that when you got married your

831
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:45,780
husband would cheat on you no i don't know what it means is that karma or not that's called causing

832
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:52,300
effect you're going to get an effect from making that cause but you don't know what this sex is going to be until it happens

833
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,700
and you don't even know what it is when it happens you know you'll get an infection、

834
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,720
because you make causes every every minute of the day well that's pretty cosmic friends are

835
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,520
you tired of cosmic sweetness and life garbage you calling my philosophy y garbage

836
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,020
are you staying you making a cause there I wouldn't want to be in the new shoes with the effect

837
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:22,300
this is for the ultimate cause like what other cause do you need than bomb i mean it's like the ultimate excuse since it's made a deal by the fact that LOVE and hated is because you're negative it's all a slip of the i Drive to cleaning I lips when you're happy if you do love God but you leave is no horizon Nihilism doesn't mean yes or no peace

838
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,780
I don't need an excuse.

839
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,040
Oh, that's what you think.

840
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,440
What about pills? Do you need pills?

841
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,340
Do I need what?

842
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:28,780
Pills.

843
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:29,940
Pills?

844
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,920
Yeah, the pills.

845
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,940
What for? Are you talking about drugs?

846
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,400
No, pills.

847
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,800
Well, yeah, we are, but not cheap conspiracy street drugs and not even the kind that doctors push on you.

848
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,100
No.

849
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,900
But I'm talking about cult drugs.

850
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,020
Yeah, pills like Bob or Jesus, you know.

851
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,900
Or Hoverfob Zipulops.

852
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,200
About what?

853
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,520
How about Hoverfob Zipulops?

854
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,980
You've tried the new Frop High, haven't you?

855
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,800
Let's not get too inside, but this person is completely new.

856
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:01,120
No, no, no.

857
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,980
I feel like she can really understand everything in this cult.

858
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,520
Well, what about it?

859
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,200
Book pills.

860
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,160
How about book pills?

861
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,200
Do you ever read a whole book?

862
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,540
I think we need to go to another call.

863
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,480
I read books, yeah.

864
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,600
But do you ever take a pill that gives you the whole book?

865
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,240
Oh, sorry, never mind.

866
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,360
Look, they're making me hang up on you.

867
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
It's against my will.

868
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,280
I'm sorry.

869
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,360
I don't care.

870
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,120
I don't care what lengths I go to anymore.

871
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,500
All is fair and all that.

872
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,080
Dr. Harris, you're a doctor.

873
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,040
A doctor.

874
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,020
Doesn't that mean anything to you, a surgeon?

875
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,620
Yes, I'm Dr. Edith, but I'm a man also.

876
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,780
You're under arrest!

877
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,760
Something sick.

878
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,520
Something sordid.

879
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,360
Vicious and depraved.

880
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:45,820
Vagina.

881
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,480
Vagina.

882
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,720
V-A-G-I-N-A.

883
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,100
Vagina.

884
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


885
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


886
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


887
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


888
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


889
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


890
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:52,280


891
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,080
It's now like passage between the uterus and an

892
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,740
opening between the father's legs.

893
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,400
It is the place where sperm are deposited by the father and

894
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,820
the maiden in the passage so that the baby passes

895
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,840
into the new world where he was born.

896
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:08,860
Testicles.

897
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,540
Testicles.

898
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,140
Spelled T-E-S-T-I-C.

899
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:14,920
Ah, ah.

900
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,380
Hi.

901
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,380
Have I got something for you.

902
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,420
This?

903
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,220
This is the one and only Mojo Bag.

904
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:32,160
And with this, you don't need no long hair

905
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:39,200
or cool cigarettes or cool guy shades

906
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,380
because you could have any woman you want

907
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,380
with the Mojo Bag.

908
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,340
And you don't need no knife or gun

909
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,280
because ain't nobody can hurt you

910
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,860
when you got the Mojo Bag.

911
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,720
But you too can have the one and only Mojo Bag.

912
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,580
Yeah, I'd give it to you for oh, I guess about $8.

913
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,280
I accept no substitutes, but one word of caution,

914
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,680
one word of caution.

915
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,460
Don't you never look inside the Mojo Bag

916
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,460
because it got the juju and that is hot stuff.

917
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,740
Hot stuff, baby.

918
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,100
All right, well, we're gonna try another one here.

919
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,240
Hello, caller.

920
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:42,860
Hello.

921
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,320
Hello.

922
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:43,660
Hello.

923
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,300
Boys and girls in this up-and-coming-us land.

924
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,040
I just wanted to say, I think this is terrible censorship

925
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,040
having all these women calling me.

926
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:53,860
And no men, right?

927
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,640
You are, you are.

928
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,400
And we're not letting any men call and just women, right?

929
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,060
What does this test drone have to do with anything, huh?

930
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:01,620
You are damn right.

931
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,580
And you think it's censorship?

932
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,440
It's censorship?

933
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,720
You're saying it's very much that way.

934
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,580
You're right.

935
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,540
You are damn right.

936
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,620
Yep, that's right, because this is all women night.

937
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,380
We've had plenty of men callers in our show.

938
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:14,780
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

939
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,980
We need to have a female speaker here.

940
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,100
It's damn right that this is censorship.

941
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,340
It is our Bob-given right that we as followers of Bobra,

942
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,440
the female sector, have a right to stand up and speak.

943
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,840
I mean, let's not, let's not pussyfoot, pardon the pun,

944
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,060
anymore around this.

945
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,000
Women are the dominant species.

946
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,400
We have let men slide. What a joke.

947
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,100
They've been played along too long.

948
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,660
I mean, let's face it.

949
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,000
Let's face it.

950
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,140
Our vaginas have teeth and you know it.

951
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,460
The beak, beware the octopus beak, my friend.

952
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,580
What she's saying is true.

953
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,040
Men, we've got to fight back.

954
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,620
No, it's useless.

955
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:09,720
The numbers to call are 823-7490 or 828-8500.

956
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,040
823-7490.

957
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,720
823-7490 is the best number to call.

958
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,300
If it's busy, call the other number.

959
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,360
This is all women night tonight.

960
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,380
And they're lighting them up.

961
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,340
Let's give one.

962
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,720
Oh, let's try one more of these disgusting creatures

963
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,860
that lack important parts of their anatomy.

964
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,920
And of course they're replaced by better parts

965
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,060
and for certain things.

966
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,820
Let's see, try this again.

967
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,080
Oh, no wonder.

968
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,100
We weren't hooked up.

969
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,180
Okay.

970
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,400
Hello?

971
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,100
Hello?

972
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:47,520
Hello?

973
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:47,780


974
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,660
What am I doing wrong?

975
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,380
Red room staying.

976
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,720
Hello?

977
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:54,940
Hello?

978
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,340
You're just not showing enough.

979
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,640
Anybody here?

980
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,960
What's wrong?

981
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,360
You aren't putting your hand on that queue button there.

982
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:02,700
Are you?

983
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,940
No friends.

984
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,540
There's only one thing left.

985
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:06,860
Hello?

986
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,160
Hello?

987
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,160
Hello?

988
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:08,800


989
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,500
Hello?

990
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,500
Hi.

991
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,440
Hi.

992
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,700
Okay.

993
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,780
We got a live one.

994
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,280
Is this the Bob show?

995
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,520
Yeah, our Slack.

996
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,320
This is the first time I've heard your show.

997
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,260
Great.

998
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,060
No, not great.

999
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,380
You see, I'd always heard good things about Bob

1000
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,100
and about people who believe in Bob.

1001
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:26,800
Yeah?

1002
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,460
Well, y'all aren't very good.

1003
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,540
We're not.

1004
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,540
No?

1005
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,000
What have we done wrong?

1006
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,260
What have we done?

1007
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,840
Well, you can't run the board right, for one thing.

1008
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,460
Oh, well.

1009
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,780
Gee, thanks.

1010
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,320
Will you come in here and help us?

1011
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,900
No, I have other things to do.

1012
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:43,880
Yeah.

1013
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,340
Oh, I see.

1014
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:46,920
Yeah.

1015
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,720
I had plans tonight.

1016
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,540
Uh-huh.

1017
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,040
Uh-huh.

1018
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,740
Yeah, really.

1019
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,460
You really ought to organize your thoughts a little more

1020
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,680
and figure out what it is you do believe in

1021
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,740
and send her an issue for the evening, not just divide it up.

1022
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,180
Let's have women denied, men the next time.

1023
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,400
Well, thanks for sharing that with us.

1024
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,220
Find an issue.

1025
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,560
Yeah, we don't have an issue tonight, Buck.

1026
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,280
Yeah, I know.

1027
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,520
Wait a minute.

1028
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh, god.

1029
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,080
I just issued all over my .

1030
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,880
Oh, my god.

1031
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,800
If you're worried about . . .

1032
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,700
Everything I heard about Bob followers is true, isn't it?

1033
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,280
Everything you know is true.

1034
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,060
That's what people just can't seem to get through their heads.

1035
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,320
Literally everything you've ever heard is true,

1036
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,760
and you just keep trying to give things certain priorities of truth.

1037
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,660
It's just, you know, one . . .

1038
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,440
God, I just don't get it.

1039
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,140
Let's get her.

1040
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,380
Oh.

1041
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:39,800
. . .

1042
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,340
Oh.

1043
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,440
Pink alarm.

1044
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,860
Hello?

1045
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,200
Hello?

1046
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,040
Caller?

1047
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,360
Hello?

1048
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,160
Well, we don't know how to run the board, you guys.

1049
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,400
We're just a bunch of immature babies.

1050
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,980
Oh, no.

1051
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1052
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1053
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1054
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1055
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1056
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1057
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1058
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1059
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1060
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1061
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1062
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1063
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1064
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,980


1065
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,100
No!

1066
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,580
Hello?

1067
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,740
I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

1068
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,120
I love little girls, they make me feel so bad.

1069
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,500
When they're around, they make me feel like I'm the only guy in town.

1070
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,020
I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

1071
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:06,040
They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror, or that I'm right by my cold exterior.

1072
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,540
They don't ask me questions.

1073
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:09,980
They don't ask me questions.

1074
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,800
They don't want to scold me.

1075
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,760
They don't look for answers.

1076
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,980
They just want to hold me.

1077
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,100
Isn't this fun?

1078
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,040
Where's this place all about?

1079
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,220
Isn't this a great country?

1080
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,840
Isn't this a nightmare too?

1081
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,680
Oh, I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

1082
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,980
I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

1083
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,360
I love little girls, they make me feel so bad.

1084
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,500
When they're around, they make me feel like I'm the only guy in town.

1085
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:52,320
I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

1086
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:58,200
They don't care about my inclinations, they're not right by my revelations.

1087
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,620
Uh oh.

1088
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,100
Take a second, take a second.

1089
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,940
Uh oh.

1090
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:04,380
It's a mistake.

1091
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,040
Uh oh.

1092
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,560
I'm in trouble.

1093
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,900
Uh oh.

1094
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,980
Little girls, they make me feel so good.

1095
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:09,980


1096
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:09,980


1097
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,060
A little too, a little too.

1098
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,720
Little too.

1099
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,480
Little, a little too, a little too later!

1100
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,180
Isn't this a place all about?

1101
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,300
Isn't this a train country?

1102
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,080
Isn't this a nightmare too?

1103
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,160
Uh oh.

1104
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,240
I don't care what people say.

1105
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,120
And I don't care what people think.

1106
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,880
And I don't care.

1107
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,960
How he looked when he got back free

1108
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,180
They make me feel so

1109
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,860
I love little girls

1110
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,280
They don't care about the one-way mirror

1111
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,080
They don't care about my cold exterior

1112
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,620
They don't ask me questions

1113
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,520
They don't ask me stories

1114
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,820
They don't look for answers

1115
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,000
They just try to hold me

1116
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,780
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble

1117
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,820
Uh-oh, the little girl is just

1118
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,100
Too little, too little, too little

1119
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,060
Too little, too little, too little

1120
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,800
Too little, too little, too little

1121
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:39,980
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble

1122
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,920
It's a true, it's a

1123
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,220
It isn't just a nightfall

1124
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,960
It isn't just a dream come true

1125
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,240
It isn't just a nightmare too

1126
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,020
I love little girls, they make me feel so good

1127
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,780
I love little girls, they make me feel so bad

1128
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:07,720
When they're around, it feels like they're the only guy in town

1129
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:13,280
I love, I love little girls, they make me feel so good

1130
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,420
I love

1131
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,020
No, no don't touch me

1132
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,560
Don't think I'm not gonna tell him about men

1133
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,060
What terrible things men do

1134
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:27,080
When he grows up, he's not gonna manhandle any poor little girls

1135
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,320
And do you know that I have not been in a city for the last probably five or six years

1136
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,900
Where I have not had to deal with children

1137
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,480
Who, this has been their affair since they were little children

1138
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:37,700
And I'm not gonna tell you

1139
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,920
Oh-ho-ho-ho

1140
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,180
Well, when

1141
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,300
Friends, I know there's some troubled teenagers out there

1142
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,400
And Sister Sally is here ready to take your calls

1143
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Answer your questions

1144
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,840
We've got a boy caller here

1145
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,020
meaning the most ancient of the fertility goddesses,

1146
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,000
Nunu, the ancient one.

1147
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,100
A man could get lost in her many folds.

1148
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:22,160
The most ancient art of mankind.

1149
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,640
You're with us, Collier. You're with us.

1150
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,040
The sculptures of Nunu.

1151
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,200
Go ahead, tell us about Nunu.

1152
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,860
Lay it on us.

1153
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,060
Nunu?

1154
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:31,840
Yeah.

1155
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,600
Come on, get it together, man.

1156
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:34,660
It's okay.

1157
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,880
I have troubles.

1158
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,800
Yes?

1159
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,340
Yes.

1160
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,740
We're here. We understand. We care.

1161
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,460
Hello?

1162
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,120
Yes.

1163
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:45,720
Hello?

1164
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,300
I have troubles.

1165
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,480
Yeah?

1166
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,760
Nunu is in my dreams.

1167
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,120
Hmm. In your dreams, huh?

1168
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,300
Yes. She's been in my dreams for the last ten years.

1169
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,980
And I've been fertile all this time.

1170
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,620
But now she has stopped coming in my dreams.

1171
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,520
Does this mean I am no longer fertile?

1172
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,060
Let me ask you this. Have you started coming in your dreams?

1173
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,180
Have I been coming in my dreams?

1174
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,440
Everyone has.

1175
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:07,700
Everyone has.

1176
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,740
What else has entered into your dreams?

1177
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,640
Well, actually, there are occasional dragonfly or warthog,

1178
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,740
but that's nothing unusual for me.

1179
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,840
It's pretty surrealistic.

1180
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,100
And how do you feel when this happens?

1181
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:25,520
When I have these dreams, a number of things happen.

1182
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,400
Occasionally, my navel will swell.

1183
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,320
But normally, I wake up with a massive fit of sneezing,

1184
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,180
but it's nothing I can't control.

1185
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,260
It just worries me because my wife, you know,

1186
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:37,700
she's...

1187
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,200
It's a sneezing universe, Franz.

1188
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,200
Have you ever tried eating a Taco Bell?

1189
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,240
Um, I thought of that, but I wanted to get your approval first.

1190
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,520
I think if you eat a Taco Bell for the next three weeks,

1191
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:54,020
lunch and dinner, and start practicing pyroflatulation.

1192
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,740
Okay. What about breakfast?

1193
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,000
And I don't care what you eat for breakfast.

1194
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,920
Nails and goldfish.

1195
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,060
Well, if you can stomach it.

1196
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:06,100
But just like I said, I wanted to hear more guests

1197
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,240
the next time you speak to us.

1198
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:07,440
Okay?

1199
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,620
Thank you.

1200
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,300
And, uh, yeah.

1201
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:09,960
Flashulation.

1202
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,360
Just flash this over the air, okay?

1203
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:11,880
Praise God.

1204
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:12,480
All right. Slide.

1205
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,720
Well friends, you know, the examination of this data field

1206
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,580
surrounding the philosophy of spatio-centric relationships

1207
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,300
reveals a direct connection between physics

1208
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,780
and theology and the sneezing universe.

1209
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,060
Oh, yes.

1210
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,800
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty.

1211
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,040
Dirty little girl, dirty little boy.

1212
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,160
I, your mother, want to scrub, scrub, scrub you clean, clean, clean.

1213
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,740
Get that filthy animal out of here!

1214
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,820
Said there's so much depression

1215
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,320
Can't keep trying to live no more

1216
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,200
Son's becoming husband, still in murders

1217
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,020
Old man turning young daughters into whores

1218
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,280
And this is Crooked and Perverse National

1219
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,760
And thou hast broken the covenant with thy home maker

1220
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,680
And thou knoweth not the law

1221
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,620
What is the law?

1222
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,980
Not to walk on all fours

1223
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,380
That is the law

1224
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,580
Mine is the house of pain

1225
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,560
Mine is the hand that makes

1226
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:32,920
For thou art slipping back like unto the ape of the forest

1227
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,800
Who eateth his own excrement loose

1228
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,760
Who eateth his seed or his own cake

1229
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,120
If ye can whip it not, go ye down

1230
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:48,980
Henry Ford

1231
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,620
Big hairy devil

1232
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,140
We went together for about three years at St. Bernard

1233
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,460
He died in my arms

1234
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,920
Ha ha ha ha ha

1235
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,540
Laura?

1236
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,600
God says it's a sign of the times

1237
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,060
When you turn your back on my truth

1238
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:09,200
Your society is going to be given over to this corrupt lifestyle

1239
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,560
And God says that it's corrupt

1240
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,520
And I don't care what any psychiatrist or sociologist

1241
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,980
I don't care what any political leader says

1242
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,900
I don't care what anybody in America says

1243
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:26,480
God almighty says that homosexuality is an eternal sin

1244
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,440
Submissive to government, submissive to masters, so on

1245
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,040
Likewise, you wise, be submissive to your own heart

1246
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:35,420
Submissive to your husband

1247
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,040
In other words, push yourself under the authority

1248
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,080
Under the headship of your husband

1249
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,820
God's coming back for a Holy Ghost, power-packed, soul-winning church

1250
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,320
That's going to be taking this world by force

1251
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:52,300
By the power of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

1252
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,340
We're going to see literally millions of Christians

1253
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,540
They're going to march through the streets

1254
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,520
We're going to preach on the television, on the radio

1255
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,600
We're going to start controlling society

1256
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,040
Because we're tired of being pushed around by the world

1257
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:10,020
And I'm tired of the devil lying and stealing and cheating people's lives

1258
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,940
And the only truth is our Lord Jesus Christ

1259
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,580
And we are not going to hide

1260
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,240
We are not going to be intimidated

1261
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,140
We are not going to be pushed around

1262
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,340
But we're going to stand up for righteousness

1263
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,260
And stand up for godliness

1264
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,660
But let's leave things of this world behind

1265
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,520
And walk now down the path of Bob

1266
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,680
For this brief minute of slack

1267
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,040
From the Church of the Submissive

1268
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:35,460
Genius

1269
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,680
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart

1270
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,460
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs

1271
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,740
Conspiracy, corporate, peak situations

1272
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:53,760
Where mommy and daddy get up in the morning and go to work

1273
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,360
And they kiss the kids goodbye

1274
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,260
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye

1275
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:01,400
Kind of a simultaneous goodbye and hello

1276
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,820
Then they get home about seven o'clock

1277
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,140
Ticked off, to use a polite term

1278
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,760
After a long drive back out to the suburbs

1279
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,040
They get home, they kiss their kids hello and goodnight

1280
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,960
And they go to bed

1281
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,840
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family

1282
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:21,040
Is cause the kids see a little tittering stupid sexy gags on television

1283
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,220
Or cause the new permissiveness

1284
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,540
Where men are allowed to do things with other men

1285
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,960
That's a bunch of holy hooey I say, my friend

1286
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,140
I say, why not legalize pornography?

1287
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,500
And ban work

1288
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,180
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids

1289
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,300
Most of these kids these days grow up

1290
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,160
They don't have parents

1291
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,540
They got some kind of robot scarecrows

1292
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:46,600
And the, oh friend, let there be slack

1293
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,880
Yes dear friends

1294
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,800
Now it's coming down towards the end of the broadcast

1295
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:10,640
It's about time for us to give that sacred P.O. box again

1296
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,940
For the Church of the Subgenius

1297
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,440
And this is where you can write for information

1298
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,720
For free, for free

1299
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,980
Free, free, free, free, free, free

1300
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,740
No money, just free, free

1301
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,060
Then we hit you up for the money

1302
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,160
No, no, no, no

1303
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,940
We wouldn't do a thing like that

1304
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:25,920
Free, free, free

1305
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,800
It's, friends, have you got that pencil ready?

1306
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,860
I know it's confusing

1307
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:31,920
But here it is

1308
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,760
It's P.O. box

1309
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,120
One four oh three oh six

1310
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,160
Dallas, Texas

1311
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,320
Seven five two one four

1312
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,760
Ah yes

1313
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:46,940
Good night, baby subgenius

1314
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,660
Yes, and thank you, Sally

1315
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,400
Sister Sally

1316
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,440
Oh my, I can't wait to lead him

1317
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:00,860
His mom leaves his friend

1318
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,020
In the past

1319
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:05,320
And then back into the mighty slaughterhouse

1320
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,440
And special thanks to Phil and the Blanks

1321
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,940
For helping us on this

1322
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,840
And every show, actually, Phil

1323
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,980
And in this case, without the Blanks

1324
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,580
Has been in the background

1325
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,180
On almost every hour of Slack

1326
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:24,720
And friends, let's pray for his soul

1327
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,140
It's too late for me and Buck and Sister Sally

1328
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:30,040
But that's P.O. box

1329
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,060
One four oh three oh six

1330
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:32,720
Dallas, Texas

1331
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,920
Seven five two one four

1332
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,940
And stay tuned for the mighty

1333
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,440
Monday morning show

1334
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,300
With Norm Ward

1335
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,260
And eventually John Horton

1336
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,620
No, no, Horton's in overseas or something

1337
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,520
He's calling in

1338
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,460
Baby, baby John

1339
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:50,580
Praise Bob

1340
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,800
Come help me, somebody

1341
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,240
Shane got no legs

1342
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,680
My legs are on fire

1343
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,800
Pull the lever

1344
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,100
Down you go

1345
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,720
Ow, ow, ow!

1346
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,140
sûre

1347
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,560
You didn't get hit

1348
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:05,880
So I could meet up with the fake

1349
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,880


1350
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,880


1351
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,880


1352
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,880


1353
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,880


1354
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:05,920
Just look at you

1355
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1356
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1357
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1358
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1359
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1360
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1361
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1362
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1363
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1364
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1365
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1366
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1367
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1368
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920


1369
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:05,920
