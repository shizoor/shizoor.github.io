1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Oh my god!

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,520
My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about Bob?

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,120
If you've played this kind of action, you're the least to mind that action, Bob.

4
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,700
If you've played this kind of action,you're the least to mind that action, Bob.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,260
You both look terrible in chains, Bob.

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,260


7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,520
If you keep playing this газ мы meine Woah Use the chain gun

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,620
You will make a sunset

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:46,620


10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,260
So, what are you doing, Bob?

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,460
You can still talk with me

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,940
She hasn't told me!

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,160
Hello there.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,640
You know, there's been all around this wonderful world of ours,

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,320
and in all this world, nothing else is Bob.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,640
Bob?

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,580
Bob?

18
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,180
Bob?

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Bob?

20
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,780
Bob?

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,300
Bob?

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,120
Bob?

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,400
Bob?

24
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,400
I told her, lift a finger till your ox gets gored

25
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,920
And when beasts is in the cookie jar, we'll rank with snore

26
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,140
Doesn't take republicans to fuck you anymore

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,980
Oh God, what a big dick talk

28
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,300
Bob?

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,920
I want a real asshole hook for Albert Gore

30
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Oh God, what a big dick talk for Albert Gore

31
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,240
I don't like that because it portrays women in a subordinate role

32
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,620
Oh God, what a big dick talk for Albert Gore

33
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't like that because it glorifies drugs and mentions nasty things like

34
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,020
It's for a great life, it's for a great life

35
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,060
Oh God, oh God, what if the children hear?

36
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,780
Jane will be a communist and Ted will be a queer

37
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,680
Oh God, oh God, please help us if you can

38
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,380
Ali, North and FEMA can draw up the master plan

39
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,940
I thought this was a way out for our revenue

40
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,180
And I didn't know that darling Hickey was a woman

41
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,040
I felt that it was inappropriate for her and her eight-and-six-year-old sister

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,580
To hear a song describing a girl masturbating in a hotel lobby with a magazine

43
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,140
I had no warning, in fact all I knew was that Prince was the new creative teen idol on the scene

44
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,980
And had just received a Grammy award

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
This eben bit to blow my mind

46
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:01,500
Well then, of course, тем affects the director of the story

47
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,500


48
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,500


49
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:01,580
Did he know you were here in Mia

50
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:01,580


51
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,340
Better make me know you don't care

52
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:10,180
At least it'syd that��

53
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,980
Hold on,onia, you're right

54
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:10,980


55
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:10,980


56
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:10,980


57
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,020
You could marry me

58
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,240
See a world I was just lost for

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,360
Brand new

60
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,620
And I''m her mother

61
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,500
Let me tell you

62
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,300
crabs like ihrer

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
¶¶

64
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,700
¶¶

65
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:28,700


66
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,880
¶¶

67
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:38,900
¶¶

68
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,960
But you know what, friends?

69
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,620
What Father Joe Mama was saying about that one side

70
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:46,880
of the world,

71
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
the conspiracy, it makes you wonder.

72
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,440
It makes you wonder which side of the conspiracy

73
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,140
is running things. I started getting paranoid about

74
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,340
well, uh,

75
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
the Masons, let's say.

76
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,280
Let's just say.

77
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,260
For all I know, I'm really worried about the Illuminati.

78
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,800
You know, it started with that

79
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,220
America Online logo,

80
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,820
which is a triangle with a circle in the middle of it.

81
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680
It looks just like

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:16,860
the

83
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
old eye in the pyramid, or the eye above the pyramid.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,780
You know, and I mentioned that to my friend

85
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,240
Emot, and Emot said, oh, that's just the beginning of it.

86
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,080
Haven't you noticed those triangles and the eyeball shapes are just

87
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,220
everywhere, and in fact, they've even gotten quite obvious about

88
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,280
the names of these businesses. You guys ever notice

89
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,400
the red arches that form a big M

90
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
of the Sonic?

91
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,800
Hamburgers? Get it? Sonic?

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,340
M-Sonic? I think I'll have

93
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,980
M-Sonic Burger now.

94
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,980
Or, he goes, did you know that

95
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,040
Philip Morris cigarettes and General Foods

96
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,400
were both owned by this gigantic

97
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,700
conglomerate Kraft Foods?

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,880
Kraft?

99
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,820
The, as in

100
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,540
The Kraft?

101
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Yes, friends.

102
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,440
And not to mention when they replaced

103
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,500
that Popeyes

104
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,480
place next door with

105
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,580
churches.

106
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,600
Arches. Fried chicken.

107
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,260
Uh-huh. But it doesn't stop there. If you look around, next time you drive

108
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,280
through town, friend, just keep your eyeballs open. You may see

109
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,120
things you didn't want to see. Buildings one after another that look

110
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,480
like, well, like the Temple of Solomon.

111
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,420
If it's not the arches, it's that Temple of Solomon shape that you

112
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,920
see etched onto Masonic aprons and symbols.

113
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,440
My old supermarket nearby here, Menards, he pointed

114
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,620
out, looks just like that. All of the Sam Walton stores.

115
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,920
Walmart, Sam's, Hypermart.

116
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,120
They're in the grand Masonic design, my friends.

117
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,380
Computer places.

118
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,920
Computer City, Discovery Zone.

119
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,040
The Best Buy stores. All subtle Masonic symbols.

120
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,640
Then go buy your local water pumping station.

121
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,120
The gas company.

122
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,900
The gas company in most small towns is in the same building

123
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,740
as a Masonic lodge, my friends.

124
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,460
The electric company.

125
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:26,140
They all, all of them, my friends, are part of one conspiracy or another.

126
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,160
You know, but what do they, you try to talk about things like this and

127
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,360
they call you, well, the polite term, conspiracy researchers or

128
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,420
conspiracy buffs or conspiracy nuts or conspiracy kooks or conspiracy

129
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,460
crackpots.

130
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,720
Yeah.

131
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,260
That's my friends.

132
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,560
Then those, those are the real polite terms for the folks who attempt merely to lift the

133
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,100
veils, peer under the rocks and pry into the business of the authorities, so-called.

134
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,880
What I want to know is friends, how come the conspiracy researchers get worse pressed than

135
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,600
some of the conspiracy perpetrators?

136
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,120
It must be a conspiracy.

137
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,320
You know, I can wax as sarcastic as the next guy about some conspiracy theories.

138
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,540
I like to think I'm skeptical to the bone, but I actually do believe a large percentage

139
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,040
of those conspiracy theories.

140
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,100
And worse still, I believe in the conspiracy, yes, the plot by ordinary, normal, everyday

141
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,120
people to label conspiracy researchers as loonies.

142
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,500
Or as a part of a conspiracy.

143
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,520
Now contrary to unpopular opinion, friends, it's still possible to use mass media to expose

144
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,300
mass media conspiracies, but you have to couch your expose carefully.

145
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:02,440
You have to make it look like a satire or a comic book or a radio show like this one,

146
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,100
which is pieced together from the dead parts of history books.

147
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,140
And of course, some conspiracy theories are just that.

148
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
They're just theories.

149
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Improbable.

150
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,740
Paranoid.

151
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
Predicated on few facts.

152
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,940
Like the one about the masons creating the greys.

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,700
They've obviously got it backwards.

154
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,020
Others are founded on pure coincidence.

155
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,040
These I would consider kooky, wouldn't you?

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,340
And you know, one man's a paranoid lunatic is the next man's dedicated researcher.

157
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,160
And you know, the problem is the domino effect, though.

158
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,940
There's those things.

159
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
There's those who see conspiracies everywhere.

160
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,100
Literally everywhere.

161
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,000
The crazy old bircher lady who fears commies under her bed isn't just a stereotype.

162
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,500
Nor is the religious nut who sees Satanists everywhere.

163
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Nor the UFO cultist who mistakes something that could be cured with Prozac for messages

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
from the Space Brothers.

165
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,800
But you know, there might be something to some of it.

166
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,920
And once you're fairly sure of one conspiracy theory, you can't just say, well, I'm not

167
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,300
all that good about it.

168
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,800
If you don't believe inبدs and conspiracy theories—

169
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,580
Listen, you know, over the course of most of your life, one conspiracy theory starts

170
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,480
to tie in to neighboring conspiracy theories.

171
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,240
And you can believe in a few, and then you start to sound like one of those nuts!

172
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,500
Unless you're selective about who you tell it to.

173
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:33,460
And that's one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history.

174
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,460
It's the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea.

175
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,940
You know, try discussing the CIA's more heinous misdeeds in polite society.

176
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,640
People edge away.

177
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:54,180
They just can't allow themselves to believe that men whose portraits still hang in city halls and corporate headquarters

178
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,840
were in fact amoral monsters and eager collaborators with Nazis.

179
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:08,040
Because that would imply that that smiling, rosy-cheeked, glad-handing politician they just voted for might be involved in something worse.

180
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:18,060
Paranoia has a bad rep these days, but as the ancient saw goes, it's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

181
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,120
And they are! People should be a lot more paranoid.

182
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,160
And a lot of so-called normalcy.

183
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,920
Normal people are.

184
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,120
Oh, they're in fact as paranoid as you can get.

185
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,540
They're just paranoid about the wrong things.

186
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,980
Since the FBI has no proof for organized satanic ritual murder cults,

187
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,620
the many little Christian fundamentalist conspiracies have invented them.

188
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,200
The same guy who can't believe the army could ever do anything evil and anti-American

189
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,780
may be convinced that the devil sends heavy metal bands out to corrupt our youth.

190
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,460
He's paranoid about marijuana, fiends, but he drives drunk.

191
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,860
He's paranoid about sex and violence on TV, but thinks everybody should have their own automatic weapon.

192
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:14,460
He's learned that the media is controlled by liberals because he listens to right-wing blather all day long on the radio.

193
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,280
Shut up, little man!

194
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,820
Nobody asked you to say anything.

195
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,420
Shut up, little man!

196
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,520
Shut up, little man!

197
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:54,160
Shut up, little man!

198
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,720
Shut up, little man!

199
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,140


200
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,720
Shut up, little man!

201
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,720


202
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,720


203
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,720


204
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,340
Hey, hey, we're so wild!

205
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,720
All your farmer's daughters gonna repunch your soul.

206
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,960
Hey, hey, we're so wild!

207
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,060
Dancing with the milky moon.

208
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,800
Baby, take communion with the rest of the clan.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,580
They bought a path of food to her to the Holy Land.

210
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,080
At the shrine of the Virgin, she was dressed in...

211
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,340
...and killed with a mad dog's one and a birth control pill.

212
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,620
Hey, hey, we're so wild!

213
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,960
All your farmer's daughters gonna repunch your soul.

214
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,300
Hey, hey, we're so wild!

215
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,380
Dancing with the milky moon.

216
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,040
Hey, hey, we're so wild!

217
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,620
All your farmer's daughters gonna repunch your soul.

218
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,580
Hey, hey, we're so wild!

219
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,980
Dancing with the milky moon.

220
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,260
On your hands, hands, hands and knees

221
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,260
On your hands, hands, hands and knees

222
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,800
On your hands, hands, hands and knees

223
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,680
Talking purty, purty, purty, purty, purty, purty, purty

224
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,460
Baby cries sometimes for no reason at all

225
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,200
Makes the minister nervous in the good that you stall

226
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,080
Ma's little angel, Paul's little bear

227
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,580
A child of God with a bigger spirit

228
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,620
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

229
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,280
All your farmer's daughters gonna eat what you sow

230
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,160
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

231
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,720
Dancing deep in the milky blue

232
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,120
Oh, come on

233
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,800
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

234
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,080
Bow to your partner in a do-si-do

235
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,320
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

236
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,840
Dancing deep in the milky blue

237
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,280
All right now

238
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,920
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

239
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,540
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

240
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,780
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

241
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,600
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

242
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:35,400
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

243
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
Hey, hey, we're sold, you wild oats

244
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,100
Woods in the M bowls

245
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,120
Swag bunch of

246
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,140
Stuff apiece

247
00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:14,280
I'm needin' some overstates

248
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,780
Be Fred Ph. vidae

249
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,760
guitar solo

250
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,920
Sexy Day

251
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,440
Sex, sex, sex, violence.

252
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,060
Sex, yeah.

253
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,200
Sex, sex, sex, violence.

254
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
Sex and violence.

255
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,460
Sex, sex and violence.

256
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,800
Sex and violence.

257
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:22,400
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, violence.

258
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,100
I love it!

259
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,960
Sex and violence.

260
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,480
Sex and violence.

261
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,940
Sex and violence.

262
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,680
Sex and violence.

263
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
That's it.

264
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,240
That's the end of the record, folks.

265
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,220
This is the end of the record.

266
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,620
The record has faded.

267
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,940
Yes, dear friends.

268
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,160
And welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,659.

269
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,920
This time it's not a rerun.

270
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,760
Although we are at Tarzan's radio station for real, for live.

271
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,180
And what we've been listening to, let's see.

272
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:22,940
The beginning opening titles were by Lee Murr, the great Fernandi Lee Murr.

273
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:32,200
Then we heard some cuts from the Rudy Schwartz Project, an old album called Sam and Dave that's been remastered.

274
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:42,680
And incidentally, friends, did Princess Wee and I mention that the Rudy Schwartz Project now has some DVDs out?

275
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,740
Oh, my.

276
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,020
If we haven't, we are really remiss.

277
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,940
Well, there are two Rudy Schwartz Project DVDs.

278
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,060
One called Meatloaf Tastes Better Now.

279
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,940
Not Meatloaf Tastes Better, but Meatloaf Tastes Better Now.

280
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,200
Low Budget Video Outrage, volume number 1.

281
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,640
And then volume number 2 is called Blood Freak.

282
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,460
And volume 1 has DVDs.

283
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,160
Okay, these are music videos of Rudy Schwartz.

284
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:25,140
The Rudy Schwartz Project crazy songs are edited and created by the Rudy Schwartz Project and Waldo themselves.

285
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:40,480
With songs like The Year They Switched to Cornmeal, Enjoy Our Delicious Fish Dinners, 11-Inch Poop Hatch Cha-Cha, You're Not Rondo Hatton,

286
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,060
Quiet Evenings with Gimpy.

287
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,060
Those are all.

288
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,480
All on the first collection.

289
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:57,500
The second one includes the classic Sarah Palin Vaginal Fluids.

290
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm paraphrasing the title so that I don't have to go back and cut it.

291
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,200
It's a lot plainer than that.

292
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,380
And, friends, I don't know how to describe these videos.

293
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,800
They are to the eye what the Rudy Schwartz Project music is to the ear.

294
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,980
That is quite...

295
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,200
rich and dense.

296
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,560
That's a good description, Reverend Stang.

297
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't know that I'd be able to enunciate it so clearly.

298
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,120
I would say it is pure bulldada.

299
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,240
Oh, yes.

300
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,480
Pure bulldada.

301
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,880
And the only thing I can really compare it to is the videos of Zontar.

302
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,300
Yes.

303
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,320
Although Zontar doesn't write songs.

304
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,140
He just does the videos.

305
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,640
And Zontar has his own style, which is different.

306
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,400
But they're both richly dense in dizzying...

307
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,780
Stareable.

308
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,800
They're stareable.

309
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,620
They're stareable.

310
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,720
They're absolutely stareable.

311
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,640
In the classic sense.

312
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,540
What else did we hear?

313
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,820
Oh, the Rainmakers, of course.

314
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,840
Only one song this show.

315
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,100
Wild Oats from their very first album 100,000 years ago.

316
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,660
And Lothar and the Hand People.

317
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,940
An almost forgotten...

318
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,680
Bulldada band.

319
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,420
About as weird as Captain Beefheart.

320
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,820
Doing sex and violence.

321
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,080
But now it's time for our show.

322
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,440
And this is the part of the show where we unlock the secret box here.

324
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,220
What's this special Bob number?

325
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,900
And the contacts.

326
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
Jehovah One.

327
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,300
Connie Dobbs.

328
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,300
Where's...

329
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:46,920
There it is.

330
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,460
Dave.

331
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,560
Under L.

332
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,520
Lonesome.

333
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,420
Cowboy Dave.

334
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,740
I'm on mic two.

335
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
You're on mic one.

336
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,620
Mike.

337
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,400
Okay, Mikey.

338
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,160
There we go.

339
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,060
I had to lift up my cyborgic vest because I was clipped on the wrong way by my abdomen muscles.

340
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,880
I don't have any real abdomen muscles left.

341
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,980
I hate when that happens.

342
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,260
Well, you got it all...

343
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,300
Yeah.

344
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,040
You got it all worked out.

345
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,580
Worked out right.

346
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,200
Right.

347
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,440
Well, I got it worked out pretty...

348
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,520
I shouldn't explode during the course of this transgression.

349
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,620
You shouldn't, but you might.

350
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,200
I might.

351
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,460
It's been known to happen.

352
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,780
One never knows.

353
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,980
I've seen Dave do some...

354
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,300
One never knows.

355
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,500
Do some rude things.

356
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,400
He got carried away in the course of doing a skit one time when we were there at the

357
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,180
Brain Rock Radio Theater.

358
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,140
Mm-hmm.

359
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,520
I did?

360
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,080
Yeah, you got carried away.

361
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,720
And Princess...

362
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,880
We were playing a lovely blonde lady, and you were playing a lecherous old guy, and you

363
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,560
actually grabbed her by the chest.

364
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,840
You got so into your...

365
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,280
And then you were mortified.

366
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,140
You were terribly embarrassed because you got...

367
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,760
I guess he's a method actor.

368
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,280
That was his method of getting a cop in a field.

369
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,040
Yeah, I'm from Mecca.

370
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,100
I'm a Hiberian actor, all right.

371
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,740
He said, you know, the cabbage stone that the Islams worship sometimes.

372
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,440
I didn't say Mecca actor.

373
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,480
I said method.

374
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,060
Oh.

375
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Method.

376
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,500
We all need better hearing aids.

377
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,440
Oh, look, Princess, we just took hers out.

378
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,000
Yes, I did.

379
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,980
Well, it causes pain along with the headphones, you know, dear.

380
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:27,900
Oh, not me.

381
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,520
I like it that way.

382
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,980
That's what I thought.

383
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,020
It caused pain with the headphones, dear.

384
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,360
But, you know, if you're a Soviet monkey or any of those many infantile chimpanzees,

385
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,180
they don't really count anymore.

386
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,600
I mean, they know how to count up to 12 or something like that.

387
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:44,860
You know?

388
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm not kidding.

389
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,720
Usually only about 10.

390
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,140
Yeah.

391
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,580
Unless they remember their feet.

392
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,620
Then they can go up to, like, 14 or so.

393
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,060
They're usually missing some toes.

394
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,860
Yeah, and chimpanzees' feet are genuinely different than human toes.

395
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,980
Or, like, human toes.

396
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,320
Well, I thought you were talking about human chimpanzees there.

397
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,160
Which, you know, I mean, same diff.

398
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,100
Yeah.

399
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,020
Plus, they live.

400
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,320
They live together in the same, you know, renegade wilderness abandoned of some sort.

401
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,380
Yeah, it's called The Suburbs.

402
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,700
Like, what's his name?

403
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,120
Like Johnny Depp in Dead Man.

404
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,320
Oh.

405
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,000
He could bite you and try to shoot you in the foot, you know?

406
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,160
That was a great movie.

407
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,600
That movie, Dead Man.

408
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,100
Jim Jarmusch, right?

409
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,980
It's a western in black and white.

410
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,480
It was actually from Cleveland.

411
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,860
It was shown at two X-Day.

412
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,440
Drills by the beloved late Dr. Dark at his drive-in.

413
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,220
Oh.

414
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,780
Yeah, it was strange.

415
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,340
Usually, what he showed were what we might call great bad films.

416
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,080
But he did show just a good art film at one time.

417
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,540
Although, it certainly has its bull-dada moments with Billy Bob Thornton and other character actors.

418
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,120
But it...

419
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,460
How do you get your hair to do that?

420
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,240
I just...

421
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,900
I can't do anything with mine.

422
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
They, uh...

423
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,360
Are you doing your hair in the middle of the air time?

424
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:30,760
The last X-Day that Dr. Dark was there, he gave the audience their vote on which movie to watch.

425
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,020
And the funny thing was, everybody decided on a good movie instead of a great bad movie.

426
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,140
They picked a great good movie.

427
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,020
Weirdly enough.

428
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,220
Yeah, strangely enough.

429
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,900
I didn't mind.

430
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,120
I actually...

431
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,880
I prefer good good movies to good bad movies.

432
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,040
Yeah, plus Subgenia and Subgenia are not known not to be weird.

433
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,240
Or not to be...

434
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,760
Right, they're not known not to be weird.

435
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,180
They're not known to not to be weird.

436
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,280
They better not be.

437
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,720
And they're better not to be.

438
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,200
Because if we know they're not to be weird, we're going to weird them up.

439
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,760
They're not known for their classy taste in films.

440
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,900
Pretty good.

441
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,560
Their classy taste in films?

442
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,360
Well, why not both?

443
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:11,940
Right.

444
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,860
You know?

445
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,220
You got your classy...

446
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,480
Ass.

447
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,380
And you got your ass, as it were.

448
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,520
You got your robot monster.

449
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,640
And you got your...

450
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,860
A dead man.

451
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,160
Right.

452
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,960
You got highbrow.

453
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
You got lowbrow.

454
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,000
Right.

455
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,620
And you got Big Man Japan, which covers everything.

456
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,500
Right.

457
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,820
It's all in the balance.

458
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,700
Yeah.

459
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,880
It's all in the popcorn.

460
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,640
Dave's right.

461
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,500
It's true.

462
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,680
It is all in the popcorn.

463
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,060
Popcorn is what brings together all these different social strata of the universe into

464
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,740
one powerful mechanism so that we can wear the cyborg vest that has...

465
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:43,960
You know?

466
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,220
Has...

467
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,220


468
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,500
You know?

469
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,460
Abdominal, abdominal, pelvic pains.

470
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,440
Popcorn was made in this very room just yesterday, I believe.

471
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,160
Really?

472
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,620
Yeah.

473
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,480
Yeah.

474
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,920
Your mom whipped up some popcorn.

475
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,560
Oh, she's a popcorn head.

476
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,640
She eats it every day.

477
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:58,840
Wee Ma Ma.

478
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,240
Wee Ma Ma makes popcorn.

479
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,840
Wee Ma Ma makes popcorn.

480
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Wee Ma Ma makes popcorn.

481
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,240
I'm going to get some of Wee Ma Ma's popcorn.

482
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,160
It's the best popcorn in pop country.

483
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,960
In pop culture, that's the best popcorn.

484
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,020
Wee Ma Ma.

485
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,800
Popcorn.

486
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,660
It's corny.

487
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,840
You got both my feet and my mouth, my ears watering, my nasal areas.

488
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,260
Boy, that sounds delicious.

489
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,540
That's the flu, Dave.

490
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:27,940
Oh.

491
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,080
Well, the flu could be delicious, too, wouldn't you say?

492
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,020
Wouldn't you allow that?

493
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,360
No.

494
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,140
Let me check and see.

495
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,200
No.

496
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,360
Not delicious.

497
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,120
Mmm.

498
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,940
Not bad.

499
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,980
Salty.

500
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,060
The flu is repulsive.

501
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,060
It's the only salt I ever get, you know.

502
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,320
It's disgusting.

503
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,220
I have to hock up.

504
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,800
I have to hock up whatever salt is in my body and taste it for a minute.

505
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,520
I'm going to have to go, you know, get a bucket soon.

506
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,940
Keep this up.

507
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,920
Everybody needs a spare bucket.

508
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,980
I got Big Brother Syndrome.

509
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,620
I thought Princess Wee's big brother.

510
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,260
He's got it bad.

511
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,440
A teaser.

512
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,300
I pick up snakes and toads and say I'm going to thrust them at her.

513
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:07,920
Yeah.

514
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,180
I strap them on and then I thrust.

515
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,140
He does all that.

516
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:11,940
Yeah.

517
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,860
I thought you, like, you went up to her.

518
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,780
I went up to her drawers and smelled her underpants.

519
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

520
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
I get into her drawers with my toad.

521
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,680
I strap on a toad and then I get after her drawers.

522
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,800
Yeah.

523
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,840
Well, I would say that you are genuinely safe now.

524
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,000
I mean, you have no fear, no worries.

525
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,720
They're not going to come and get you because you have passed the test.

526
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,880
With a flying oral conviction, B plus or minus, depending on your mood, you win.

527
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,120
Actually, you know, I've been getting a little paranoid.

528
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,340
Well, maybe they could come and get me.

529
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,660
They could.

530
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:59,680
I normally don't feel very paranoid because when I go into small town America, it just looks like it always did, pretty much.

531
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:12,820
Whether I'm in the big city, in the inner city in Cleveland or in the rural small town Texas, they both look, they don't look the same, but they look the same as they used to.

532
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,220
To me.

533
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,440
To me.

534
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,040
So, I'm not normally that paranoid, but it's election time here in Glen Rose, Texas.

535
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,100
And there's all these electioneering signs everywhere.

536
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,560
And I don't know anything about these local politicians.

537
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:38,280
And I would guess that they're all a little bit to the right of Ted Cruz and think that Trump is just too much of a New York liberal.

538
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,220
So, and it does occur to me that, you know, I mean, what if somebody did?

539
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,220


540
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,280
I didn't like my something.

541
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,120
My church.

542
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,480
My cult.

543
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,520
Don't worry about it.

544
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,620
You know, my hair day.

545
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,580
Now, you know they're not all like that, dear.

546
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,380
Actually, my hair day is pretty common around here.

547
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,660
You just discovered someone that writes for the paper that was a little.

548
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,280
A libtard.

549
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,560
Yeah.

550
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,400
That's right.

551
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,520
There is a libtard blogger right here in Somerville County.

552
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,660
There's a glint of light, you see.

553
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
But that.

554
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,400
And he likes your hair?

555
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,600
Oh, it's.

556
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:13,900
It's.

557
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,220
It's.

558
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


559
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


560
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


561
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


562
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


563
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


564
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


565
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:14,220


566
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,560
It's.

567
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,660
It's a her.

568
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,380
I don't know anything about.

569
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:25,220
I mean, this person knows nothing of Reverend Ivan Stang or probably not even J.R. Bob Dobbs, although they will soon.

570
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,300
All of a sudden, I've been getting calls from podcasters wanting to interview again.

571
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,240
You know what it is?

572
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,840
They figure we're going to die.

573
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,260
That's what it is.

574
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,760
That's why they're making this movie.

575
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,080
Well, actually, they think you're going to come about again, as they call it in noble French.

576
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,960
They call it, you know, quote, coming about.

577
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,180
Yeah, but after we die.

578
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:45,960
That means you.

579
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,520
Yeah.

580
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,500
It means you're slipping off into another dimension.

581
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,300
You could be born reborn as a reptile.

582
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,400
Maybe have three feet.

583
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,880
Only have two toes on each foot.

584
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,920
Been there, done that many lives ago.

585
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:57,900
Right.

586
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,600
You could be a mathematics tutorial wizard and never wish in your entire life.

587
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,100
Probably didn't do that.

588
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,280
Oh, I thought you had, you know, a stunning classically left wing argument for that side of it.

589
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,280
You libtard snowflake you.

590
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,960
Yeah.

591
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,200
I'm just a tar of snow tar.

592
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm a snow tar.

593
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,700
I'm crying because I cry all the time because I don't.

594
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,500
I never want to have a job and I just want free money.

595
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,160
That's what that's what.

596
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,900
Some people.

597
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,640
Some people say some people do that.

598
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, haven't you found it to be true?

599
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,820
All you do, you have to do is peruse through the pages of everyday necrophile.

600
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,480
And just, you know, just when you go next time you're on the Internet, as you are many

601
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,740
hours of the day doing your job, so to speak, take out that piece of toilet paper and relinquish

602
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,180
your rights as a human being.

603
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,700
You're triggering me.

604
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,500
I'm triggering you.

605
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:12,320
My friend, Paul Mavridis, the artist who used to, well, he draws all kinds of comic books

606
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,300
and movie posters.

607
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,220
Yeah, he used to be heterosexual or something like that.

608
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:14,680
Yeah.

609
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,580
Well, that's the problem.

610
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:26,720
He's been invited to lecture at a college or something, a gallery in Ann Arbor, Michigan,

611
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,120
which is as college town of a college town as you can get.

612
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,120
Yeah, it's where they have the big hash festival.

613
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,500
Well, Palmer is worried because he's heard how sensitive modern day college students

614
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,660
are, some of them.

615
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,380
They're so terribly sensitive and he's afraid that he's going to bruise their feelings by

616
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,760
saying something blunt.

617
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,560
So he's trying to study and learn how not to offend a nice classroom full of modern

618
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,080
day protected college students.

619
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,180
He doesn't want to trigger any of them by saying a bad thing.

620
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,020
And his head is full of bad things.

621
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,260
There's nothing but bad things.

622
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,980
What else is going to come out of lies?

623
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,640
Yeah.

624
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:17,460
This is a guy who signs everything on the book of the subgenius by him signed lies.

625
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,660
Yeah.

626
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,280
He's not a nice person as artists go.

627
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,260
He's a real nice guy in real life.

628
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,560
In Chinese parlance, they would say he's losing his woo, meaning he's losing his

629
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,840
mass diastrophe, his mass objects.

630
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,240
He's becoming less dense and he can't handle like if some 19 year old were to say, I'm

631
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,460
a sophomore majoring in history.

632
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,640
I'm a sophomore majoring in history.

633
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,080
I inhuman studios out.

634
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:58,100
And now I'm lysндic in the old post-waromn floating.

635
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:03,300
And all of those will be あ affects the culture I'm in lying about everything that

636
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,880
society at some point will affirm that this Buy s and shut down in supposed ways.

637
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
Support for me has actually been great.

638
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,040
I think völlig otherwise.

639
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,520
Thank you below the readable screen.

640
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,820
It's got's it done.

641
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,760
the shot. Well, half the college students are saying, free the KKK

642
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,680
three, and half of them are saying, you know,

643
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,560
free the...

644
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:27,260
the KKK. Yeah, that's what I call them, but

645
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,740
who cares what I think?

646
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,720
Well, that's the problem. You can't care what they

647
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,700
think. What was it? Yeah.

648
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,480
You have to... your audience is

649
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,900
smarter than you, and they know when you're lying.

650
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,460
That's what somebody...

651
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:54,420
What was that quote? It was Joan Blondell, or

652
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,640
some showbiz woman told Rusty Warren that, as reported

653
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,620
by Byron Warner. Don't lie to your audience. They're smarter than you, and they'll

654
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,500
know. Now,

655
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,420
I think that's true

656
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,680
of...

657
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,560
of any subgenius with

658
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,620
an audience, certainly, by definition.

659
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,480
We don't have any

660
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,420
choice, but to be completely honest,

661
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,500
I have always been that way

662
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,720
in all my talkings

663
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,200
and rantings on the radio.

664
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,420
I've never stretched the truth

665
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,580
or put people on

666
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,460
always just as

667
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,340
honest and straightforward, because they're

668
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,320
smarter than a subgenius.

669
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,480
You know, you can't fool them.

670
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,480
You can't fool them, but you can fool them. You can screw them.

671
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,180
Now, that's not what I mean.

672
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,600
Hey, the music in the background that you're not hearing is from A Man Called Horse.

673
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,320
Oh, I remember that movie, too. It starred Amanda

674
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,820
Fear, the world's most famous transvestite detective.

675
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,200
No, actually, it had an old respected English

676
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,160
woman playing a Lakota,

677
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
an ancient Lakota

678
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,380
heredity, or

679
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,220
a Greymalkin.

680
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,640
And they actually had

681
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,340
all the actors speak Lakota

682
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,760
for real.

683
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,940
Cool. Now, I was

684
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,800
living on a Lakota reservation

685
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,320
at the time, and they all laughed at the accents

686
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,240
and thought, you sound like Englishmen

687
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,960
talking Indian.

688
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,160
You know, this

689
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,220
Dame Edith...

690
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,700
What's her name? I can't remember.

691
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,780
Anyway, it was a long, long time ago.

692
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,900
But all of them is...

693
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,780
And Richard Harris was the pale-faced boy who had to go to a sun dance.

694
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,980
And in this movie version of a sun dance, they would put eagle claws through your chest muscles

695
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,160
and lift you up to the top of the structure.

696
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,840
How?

697
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,220
In real life, that's...

698
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,300
In real life, the sun...

699
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,360
They don't actually lift you up off the ground.

700
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,140
You...

701
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,120
You're tied to the top of a pole,

702
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,340
kind of a maypole thing, only you've got

703
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,760
eagle claws going in your chest.

704
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,040
It's interesting, when they were...

705
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,140
They had to do it

706
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,240
on the sly, back at least

707
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,420
in the 70s

708
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,200
when I was there.

709
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,600
It's like they asked me to film one.

710
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,460
And I didn't feel comfortable doing it.

711
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,860
So I had my

712
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,040
local assistant helper guy

713
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,520
do it.

714
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
And, uh...

715
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,660
Yeah, they actually...

716
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,100
What...

717
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,140
The idea behind the sun dance is

718
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,940
you hurt so damn much

719
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,020
stretching your skin like this

720
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,760
and mainly from walking around in circles

721
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,780
in the hot sun.

722
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,560
You start to hallucinate and see

723
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,360
you know, Wakantanka

724
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,480
or your spirit guide

725
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,080
or whatever kind of wild, crazy thing

726
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,540
you're going to see.

727
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,660
You properly give vision, yeah.

728
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,320
Yeah, you're looking for a vision.

729
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,140
A lot of times you get a lot of mini-visions

730
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,160
in the sweat.

731
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,220
You know, like

732
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,340
once a week you could have a little mini-vision

733
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,780
too, started up by your

734
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,120
recollections as you fart

735
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,960
out your friends in the

736
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,900
sweat lodge.

737
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,240
It's like the old-fashioned schwitz, you know, like you're not allowed to

738
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,780
fart in there.

739
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,840
You know, that's a good question.

740
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,520
Probably that may

741
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,060
depend on which medicine man

742
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,080
is running the Uwepe ceremony

743
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,800
or whatever

744
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,020
in the lodge.

745
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,260
I was actually in a sweat...

746
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,920
I've been in a for real, not a hippie Indian sweat lodge, a real Indian sweat lodge.

747
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,280
I've been in a real Indian seance

748
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,400
and I did have visions, but it was all induced by

749
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,160
predictable things like staying up too late

750
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,620
and rhythmic drumming and chanting and darkness,

751
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,120
totally darkness, so you start seeing things.

752
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,680
And they're playing tricks.

753
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,120
They do stage tricks.

754
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,400
They do the same things that they do at

755
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,160
that they did at spiritual

756
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,040
spiritualist seances in the previous

757
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,260
previous century

758
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,280
and used each other's tricks and I

759
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,440
recognized them.

760
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,080
But I still believed, at the time I believed, it was only later that I realized they were tricks.

761
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,280
And the old medicine man had said something to the effect of,

762
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,300
you may later decide that maybe

763
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,200
there was

764
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,660
something else going on here, but

765
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,480
just remember your original feeling that you had.

766
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,140
And for a while there I really did believe that there were spirits of the spirit.

767
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,380
There was the afterlife in the room.

768
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,000
But now I don't believe there are spirits of the afterlife anywhere, personally.

769
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,060
I chased them all out.

770
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,680
I know. They're a hell of a bad as far as being like Republicans and they won't pay their rent.

771
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,100
They're always like three months behind.

772
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,100
Oh God, tell me about it.

773
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,480
Some of them even have those weird Chinese haircuts,

774
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,480
like Kim Kim Kim Kim Il-Sung, what's his name, Kill Bill...

775
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,700
Kill Bill Jung, the psychiatrist.

776
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,840
Yeah, the mad psychiatrist.

777
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,580
The psychoanalyst.

778
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,480
Yeah, the mad psychiatrist slash the psychoanalyst.

779
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,220
Yeah.

780
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,800
And...

781
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,220
Some people pronounce his name Jung.

782
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,600
At least we don't have to worry about him.

783
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,900
It was Jung or King Jim Jung.

784
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,000
Young, King Jim.

785
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,700
Young Kim Carl Jung.

786
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,000
Young Kim Kardashian.

787
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,860
That would be quite...

788
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,320
Kim Carl Kardashian Jung.

789
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,720
Yeah, that's getting pretty ridiculous.

790
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,900
Yeah, he's too stupid.

791
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,140
I like Troy.

792
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,980
I like Freud anyway.

793
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,380
Pink Freud.

794
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:32,960
Pink Freud.

795
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,640
They were a great band, Pink Freud.

796
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,600
They were petty, intellectual.

797
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,200
Even better was 20 years after was Punk Freud.

798
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,900
I mean, Punk Freud.

799
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,420
Punk Freud, right.

800
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,040
And he used to...

801
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,240
I guess he used to wear dildos on his head, you know, like to look like an evil jester

802
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,100
or something like that.

803
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,420
Yeah, and I know a guy who used to be his manager and he just buys old beat up dildos

804
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,140
and then sells them as if they were...

805
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,340
I mean, I think they were the ones that used to be on Punk Freud's head.

806
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,840
Yeah, I...

807
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:12,460
He also sells excrement be smeared Gigi Allen microphones, but it's not really Gigi Allen's

808
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:12,920
excrement.

809
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,980
Got news for you.

810
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,760
It's a little dog named Dammit.

811
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,540
Not my Dammit, another person's Dammit.

812
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:25,020
You mean there were a bunch of Dammits or Dandrites?

813
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,500
Yeah, that reminds me.

814
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,120
I've got to invite the owner of the previous Dammit to Star Wars.

815
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,260
I have to invite the owner of the previous Dammit to Star Wars.

816
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,820
And I also need to write a letter to Vermin Supreme.

817
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,720
Oh, wow.

818
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,560
Yeah, I have jobs to do.

819
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,000
I have jobs to do.

820
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:46,540
I have to invite Chicken John, would-be mayor of San Francisco, and general entrepreneur

821
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,440
and raconteur, and Vermin Supreme.

822
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,320
I forgot he had a Dammit dog.

823
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,340
He had a Dammit the Wonder Dog.

824
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,140
Dammit the Wonder Dog.

825
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:55,400
Yeah.

826
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,840
He didn't know any tricks.

827
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,240
Yeah.

828
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,500
But he would try to get it to do tricks.

829
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,480
He was the kind of Wonder Dog like Circus Apocalypse is a circus.

830
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,920
They juggle knives, not that they ever learned how.

831
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,080
So you know it's real when you see the blood.

832
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,060
But they used to juggle knives.

833
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,000
They've toned down their act a little bit now.

834
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,620
Well, I think it was the weird-

835
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,500
They just jump over flaming bikes and flaming baby wieners.

836
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,220
Baby wieners.

837
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:28,920
With a bike.

838
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,000
Yeah, with a bike.

839
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,240
Flaming, oh, wow.

840
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,700
No, they did.

841
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,740
It's on YouTube.

842
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,040
If you don't believe me-

843
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,820
It is on YouTube.

844
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:36,920
It sure as hell is.

845
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,720
So there's this thing on YouTube that there's like hundreds of thousands of baby wieners

846
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,200
being flash fried by a pick, by a what?

847
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,620
Only one, and it's done by Andrew the Impaled, but it's done so well-

848
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,080
Oh, okay.

849
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,140
It'll turn your stomach and make you want to go to the bathroom.

850
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,220
Because he's squeezing it out of its skin.

851
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,200
And he had it.

852
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,880
And he had the whole audience go, .

853
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,600
It's amazing.

854
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,240
Yeah, make your sound, make your sound.

855
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:10,260
It was a great little improv moment where he involved the audience and did simulated

856
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,180
defecation of a baby wiener on stage.

857
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:13,800
Yes.

858
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,100
These were little wiener, what do you call, cocktail wieners?

859
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:18,560
Yes.

860
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,060
We're venturing into taboo territory just saying the word cocktail wieners.

861
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,340
Yes, we are.

862
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,500
For some dirty minds.

863
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,420
And squeezing the wiener out of the casings also.

864
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,220
Yeah.

865
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,920
That's too German.

866
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,360
Too graphic.

867
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,520
It's way too graphic.

868
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,620
Yeah, taking your wiener out of a German sausage is too gratuitous or something.

869
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:47,020
But I remember when he used to chew up a bunch of light bulbs and stuff, and he said, the

870
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,620
secret is to eat 152 bananas.

871
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,300
Right.

872
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,360
So you poop them right out and you don't hurt yourself.

873
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,040
Right.

874
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,480
And then he stuck a huge long nail up his neck.

875
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:57,480


876
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:57,480


877
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,020
He had a huge nose hole.

878
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:58,900
That's right.

879
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,780
Because he knew the special spot that wouldn't kill him, but he didn't want to tell anybody

880
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,920
or else they'd try it and do it wrong, or maybe they would just learn how to do it and

881
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,980
have their own sideshow.

882
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,100
Well, Brad, that's the problem.

883
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,560
Everybody wants to be a sideshow marvel.

884
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,520
I'm just glad they quit sewing their lips together.

885
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,360
Yeah, that one always got me going.

886
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,740
I couldn't find the pinholes, and I thought, maybe this is for real, but I know it still

887
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,360
can't be.

888
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,200
It was for real.

889
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,520
It was absolutely for real.

890
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,440
David Apocalypse would sew shut the lips of Andrew the Impaled with surgical needles.

891
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:40,980
They did it carefully, but it was absolutely real.

892
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:48,260
I saw it over ... I filmed it up close and personal from inches away, numerous nights.

893
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,540
It's completely for real.

894
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,340
Folks, we're talking about a sideshow geek actor that appears in Cleveland, D.C.

895
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,340


896
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,600
frequently for the Pittsburgh Boys, Andrew the Impaled and ...

897
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,300
Circus Apocalypse, yeah, and David Apocalypse.

898
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,540
And David Apocalypse.

899
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:10,200
And they've appeared ... Andrew's been at every X Day for the last 15 years, I bet,

900
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,140
and singing.

901
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:18,140
And now, he's there with Amy Mm-hmm, his beautiful girlfriend who sings with him, and David Apocalypse

902
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,740
who has returned to Pittsburgh from the West Coast.

903
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,280
So, you never know.

904
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,120
When ...

905
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:31,180
When a bunch of Pittsburgh clowns will show up with their lips sewn shut, and Papa Joe

906
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:37,080
Mama said to Andrew the Impaled, with his lips sewn ... I mean, Papa Joe looks at Andrew,

907
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,540
Andrew's guy's lips sewn shut.

908
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,960
He goes, doesn't that hurt?

909
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,880
As if a guy with his lips sewn shut is gonna answer.

910
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,280
And he kinda did.

911
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,100
Reverend Andrew the Impaled said ...

912
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,600
Through his lips sewn together.

913
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,060
Through his lips, he said, not enough to come.

914
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,100
Not enough to come.

915
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,100


916
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,120
So, there you go.

917
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,320
Not quite enough to fully orgasm.

918
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,600
You don't have to repeat yourself.

919
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,060
As a result of having one's lips sewn.

920
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,120
But yeah, it was the saddest, sad clown with his lips sewn shut and little tears coming

921
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
down his ... because it hurts.

922
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,520
Yeah.

923
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,780
It actually kinda hurts.

924
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,680
So, you know, it was sad.

925
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,740
The farm animals could hear us right now.

926
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,660
There'd be some trouble in heaven or hell.

927
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,380
I'm telling you.

928
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,800
Oh, there's trouble.

929
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,100
There's trouble.

930
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,100


931
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,100


932
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,100


933
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:30,280
We've broken every lascivious law of carnal contact in the whole wide universe.

934
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,960
We need to build a wall between heaven and hell.

935
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:35,520
And make hell pay for it.

936
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,280
Yeah, that's it.

937
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,060
Build a wall.

938
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:38,940
Build a wall.

939
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,680
No more devils coming into heaven.

940
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,700
Wait a minute.

941
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:42,920
Wait.

942
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,860
That narrow band between purgatory and heaven, we have to build a 250-pound wall on the hallway

943
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,100
down the sideways to the cement blockage.

944
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,080
Actually, what it is, is to keep the angels from trying to get into heaven.

945
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:00,520
The angels are desperately trying to escape from that boring, boring place.

946
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,920
They wanna have sex and gamble and eat brie cheese and fondue factories and cry in the

947
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,860
nighttime when there's nobody around.

948
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,420
They wanna be like us, whoever the hell we are.

949
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,520
Devils.

950
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,860
Devils.

951
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,160
Bunch of devils.

952
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,240
Angelic devils.

953
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,200
Trying their best to maintain a modicum of mediumness.

954
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,060
If there ain't no slack, no sex in the hell, then we're gonna be like the devils.

955
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,060


956
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:25,060


957
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,480
If there ain't no show, then I'm not sure that I really wanna go.

958
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,360
Whoa-ho.

959
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,780
Ha-ha-ho.

960
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:31,580
Yeah.

961
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:32,700
Heh.

962
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,000
Heh.

963
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:35,560
Fooey.

964
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,480
But sometimes you just gotta go no matter what.

965
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,320
You know what I'm saying?

966
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:47,920
The anthropologists all agree that once you become an ensconced demonic angel, your feet

967
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,920
are, well, let's just say the thing, they could never find a way to market your patrol

968
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,300
feet.

969
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:55,960
Oh.

970
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:57,720
Well, they...

971
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:04,380
Did you know, as you know, devils grow devil toenails?

972
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,380
Yes.

973
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,100
What we didn't know was that devils grow, they shed them really fast.

974
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,760
They grow a new toenail in like every day.

975
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,660
They're great, big, gnarly, stony, curved toenails.

976
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:24,900
And we know this because we find fossil devil toenails all over the place out here on Stangler.

977
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:24,900


978
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,140
Stangler?

979
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,200


980
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,200


981
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,540
In the Stangler Ranch, which is famously located in the Cretaceous Formation.

982
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:36,140
So we got not only dinosaur tracks, but I'm not kidding, I could show everybody on the

983
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,980
radio five jars, mason jars, of devils' toenails.

984
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,440
They're not fresh ones.

985
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,460
They're fossilized, so they don't stink anymore.

986
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,820
The dog thinks they're just little rocks.

987
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,560
They're pretty.

988
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,900
But they're, uh, they're the toenails of demonic angels.

989
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:54,900


990
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,680
entities that tormented dinosaurs

991
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,600
millions

992
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,860
of years ago.

993
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,880
Well, you can

994
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,940
laugh. I mean, there's a skeleton. We have a

995
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:06,480
complete skeleton of one

996
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,040
sitting in front of the

997
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,560
sacred shed. It's true.

998
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,020
He's not kidding. What's so funny about that?

999
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,860
What's so funny

1000
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,380
about peace, love, and understanding

1001
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,240
and prehistoric devils?

1002
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,020
We've also got a couple of cave subgeniuses.

1003
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,180
Yeah,

1004
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,180
a couple fornicated, what do they

1005
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,100
call them, alewives?

1006
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,960
They wanted to become fish.

1007
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,940
We call the cave subgeniuses Adam

1008
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,120
and Eve, but frankly, I'm pretty

1009
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,920
sure they're really Adam and Steve.

1010
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,480
But

1011
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,080
the rubes can't tell the difference.

1012
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,860
And we found a little fossilized pink

1013
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,080
bow, so we stuck it on the head

1014
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,200
of one of them, and that proves it's a female.

1015
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,200
Well, what about

1016
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,760
Wadham and Weasel? They were two

1017
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,100
twins that you could not instill

1018
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,860
because they have not been able to

1019
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,020
delineate the sexual

1020
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,540
variants of what they were.

1021
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,860
We could separate them if we but had

1022
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,140
the scissors of sight.

1023
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,720
But that secret is denied us

1024
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,820
to this day. But we await

1025
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,820
the twins who will come with the scissors

1026
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,360
of sight.

1027
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,900
Any minute now, just like X-Day.

1028
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,580
I have hope, faith.

1029
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,780
Well, I guess I got my knuckles

1030
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,760
crossed, too. I'm just hoping it doesn't happen

1031
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,860
too slow because I might not

1032
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,360
be around to see that.

1033
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,280
I wish I could just think

1034
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,100
you'll get, as soon as you die, you'll be really

1035
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:27,580
famous.

1036
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,080
I know. I've heard everybody said that

1037
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,340
for the way it works, but I was kind of

1038
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:34,500
hoping. And you get rich, too.

1039
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,600
Well, somebody does.

1040
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,420
Yeah. Hey, maybe your publisher.

1041
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,100
That's it. Maybe

1042
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:42,360
your publisher. No.

1043
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,820
That's me. How about his son?

1044
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,860
I'm Dave's publisher.

1045
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,740
There's a book out. Neighbor World.

1046
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,680
I was going to tell you I had a dream the other day

1047
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,220
and I realized it was somebody else.

1048
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,760
And seeing what the book

1049
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,140
said,

1050
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,200
different than I did.

1051
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,800
There's a real good review of it.

1052
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,880
You mentioned it in a confused way

1053
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,320
last week, but I looked at the

1054
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,800
Amazon listing for Neighbor

1055
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,960
World and somebody wrote a nice

1056
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,800
review of it.

1057
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,800
Yes. That was

1058
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,040
at the same time. He called it a cross between

1059
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,520
Neuromancer and

1060
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,620
Infinite Jest.

1061
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,780
Well, there you go.

1062
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,000
I feel like I'm pretty

1063
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,920
like, you know, a hip type of

1064
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,000
person, you know, amongst

1065
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,920
that company.

1066
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,720
Well, you know about as much

1067
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,860
about computers and the internet

1068
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,600
as William Gibson did when he wrote

1069
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,280
Neuromancer, which was nothing.

1070
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,740
He was just extrapolating.

1071
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,960
Yeah, he wrote it on a manual typewriter.

1072
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,960
He may have gotten a computer since then.

1073
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,380
I don't know.

1074
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,280
Yeah, given the right

1075
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,760
pricing.

1076
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,420
And the right quality time

1077
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,260
along with his own

1078
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,640
furniture. I know at least three

1079
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,820
old men on the radio who still

1080
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:01,720
don't have smartphones.

1081
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,860
Well, you're suddenly, instead of

1082
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,340
other physical sensations,

1083
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,880
you're dependent on knowing, like

1084
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,760
hearing that song that you couldn't remember

1085
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,380
the name of. What was that?

1086
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,840
Who was that? Right, you can just instantly look it up.

1087
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,220
Hey, did you ever get

1088
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,880
when they put a urethra tube in your nasal?

1089
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:20,780
I mean,

1090
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,280
did you?

1091
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,320
I mean, it hurts to even think about it, Dave.

1092
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,520
It wasn't in my nasal. It was where you, it was right up in there.

1093
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,700
They had to, they had to do that to test,

1094
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,940
to test my pressure, my spray.

1095
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,420
My spray was terrible.

1096
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,660
It was really weak.

1097
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,820
And if they, if they tested it

1098
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,180
after the operation, it was like a fire hose.

1099
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,740
Yeah, it's unbelievable.

1100
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,440
It's reverting now.

1101
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,840
The stubborn beast fleshed out.

1102
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,480
Creeps back.

1103
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,060
Well, thank God for that.

1104
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,440
Because I remember what, what were you saying about it?

1105
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,100
We, it was very inconvenient when

1106
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,840
family or the neighbors were around the house

1107
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,740
and like they were sitting down to a

1108
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,300
a moist, delicious

1109
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,920
bowl of flan and chocolate cake.

1110
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,980
Just like President Trump.

1111
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,900
Poor Dave. It's like he can't,

1112
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,320
he, he, he,

1113
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,660
it's hard to say anything without that name

1114
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,920
popping into it.

1115
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,220
I know.

1116
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,380
I'm sorry. I want to cry now.

1117
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,120
I feel very like I've been touched deeply and sadly

1118
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,400
by the great creator and master genius,

1119
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,180
the philosopher of the universe.

1120
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,320
What's his name?

1121
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,360
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1122
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,020
Bob Dobbs.

1123
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,560
Yeah, him.

1124
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,080
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1125
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:41,280
That guy.

1126
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,380
It's so easy to forget.

1127
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh yeah, that guy.

1128
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,760
That guy that's the whole reason

1129
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,260
that there is a church of the subgenius in this show.

1130
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,460
The guy we hardly ever talk about anymore.

1131
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,380
Yeah, old pipe face.

1132
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,580
Old pipe face, yeah.

1133
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,480
The salesman.

1134
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,760
The guy who could sell anything to anybody.

1135
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:57,960
Yeah.

1136
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,500
What about him?

1137
00:56:59,840 --> 00:56:59,920
Yeah.

1138
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,920
What about him?

1139
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,760
He's not allowed to talk too much.

1140
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,060
Isn't he gonna get after us

1141
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,000
for not praising his sweet name enough?

1142
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,400
It's like, I've got thousands of Bob songs

1143
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,500
I could play from years past.

1144
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,540
I don't, I don't think too many people

1145
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,920
are singing Bob's songs now.

1146
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,900
There hadn't been a new one in quite a while,

1147
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,140
except the next day.

1148
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,780
I'm not singing his victorious praises

1149
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,520
because he hasn't lost, he hasn't lost.

1150
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,120
Oh, Dr. Howell has been writing them.

1151
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,980
What am I saying?

1152
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,360
Yes.

1153
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,340
Dr. Howell and Dr. Oney and Cannonbite

1154
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:34,320
both had really good new ones last year at X Day.

1155
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,240
They were most excellent.

1156
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,960
Yeah, I haven't played the sing-along yet.

1157
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
God, there's a ton of stuff I haven't played yet

1158
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,940
because we moved and I haven't had a chance

1159
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,300
to even listen to that stuff.

1160
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:45,420
And don't they sing the Machapella too,

1161
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,700
which makes it even more astounding?

1162
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,860
Oh, and they do, yeah, and they do,

1163
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,600
and they sign in deaf language while doing it.

1164
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,700
Which is tricky, that's really hard

1165
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,180
because it's like all hand movements

1166
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,220
and shucking and jiving,

1167
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,700
but you're also signing for the deaf at the same time.

1168
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,240
Only Onan could do that.

1169
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,000
He's a pro.

1170
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:03,900
Yeah.

1171
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,560
Well, because he was an Onanist to begin with.

1172
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,660
He can't keep his hands where they don't belong.

1173
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,880
I'm not saying his hands don't necessarily belong

1174
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,520
on his arms, I'm just saying they're not his.

1175
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,800
Never mind.

1176
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:17,780
He's good at it.

1177
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,140
He's a good Onanist.

1178
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:20,780
Yep.

1179
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,660
I've never seen him perform.

1180
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,280
I don't think I want to.

1181
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,840
But I guess if he's a real cannabis eater too,

1182
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,100
on top of being a malnort.

1183
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:35,820
Onan Cannabide and the Fappers, I think was the name.

1184
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,180
No, Dave, you would like it.

1185
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,560
You would really like Onan.

1186
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,500
I know you would.

1187
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,820
It's real hip stuff, like man,

1188
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,520
like he's real hip and stuff.

1189
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,820
Well, it's a good thing you're monogamous

1190
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,340
and you swear by the Sunshine Act

1191
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:50,760
because, you know, Pfizer's is very different.

1192
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,000
It's a difficult thing to deal with.

1193
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,080
When somebody says they're having a solution

1194
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,480
or reptilism is growing abundant in their bodies

1195
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,460
and stuff like that, they want to know that Dr. Swyfe

1196
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,980
or Dr. Herndonite knows exactly

1197
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,700
what the prescription should be.

1198
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,420
It should be a hefty dose of realism

1199
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:16,020
and a big gobsmacking mac of bulldada, right?

1200
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,420
Well, that's the problem.

1201
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,060
We're surrounded by rampant rectilism.

1202
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,740
Rampant rectilism, I tell you.

1203
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,700
The rectilates are everywhere.

1204
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,020
Mm-hmm.

1205
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,960
All right, phooey.

1206
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:34,960
And friends, you can save yourself from the rectilators

1207
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,780
by joining the Church of the Subgenius.

1208
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,300
You can look into that at subgenius.com.

1209
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,120
And I can tell by the fact that our background music

1210
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,380
has run out that it must be the end

1211
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,040
of the show approaching.

1212
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,700
Ah, but first, one last wonderful thing.

1213
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,200
A little song by the Psychoskeletons called

1214
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,580
You're Projecting.

1215
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,620
You're Projecting.

1216
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,560
Good to have ya!

1217
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,200
I like that one.

1218
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:38,200


1219
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,540
So did you slightly forget

1220
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:42,540


1221
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:42,560
As your foolish friend

1222
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,120
Orahu is not,

1223
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:45,600
No.

1224
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,980
merchandise anymore

1225
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1226
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1227
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1228
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1229
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1230
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1231
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1232
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1233
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:46,980


1234
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,080
You haveger

1235
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,480
nokum

1236
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:47,480


1237
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:47,480


1238
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:47,780
hide

1239
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:47,800
somehow

1240
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:47,800


1241
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,360
mind

1242
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,640
Thank you.

1243
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:22,420
Thank you.

1244
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:57,820
Thank you.

1245
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:25,760
Thank you.

1246
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,780
Thank you.

1247
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:26,780


1248
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,480
Thank you.

1249
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,720
Thank you.

1250
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,320
Thank you.

1251
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:46,620
Thank you.

1252
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,280
Thank you.

1253
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,280


1254
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,760
Thank you.

1255
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:47,760


1256
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:47,760


1257
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,020
Lonesome Cowboy Dave has been our...

1258
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,660
It's not exactly our guest, he's our co-host.

1259
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,500
Question.

1260
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,060
It's always just the three of us.

1261
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:01,180
Dave, there's other people wanting to take your place on the show,

1262
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:06,460
since we can only do one caller at a time at Tarzan's so far.

1263
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,620
Who was that, I might ask?

1264
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:09,500
Everybody.

1265
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,300
But could it really be the Hour of Slack if it wasn't just you, I, and Dave?

1266
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,440
Everybody whose name starts with an F.

1267
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,600
Philo, Fox, Fid, and Pease.

1268
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,780
All those names start with an F.

1269
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,860
Philo, Fox, Fid, and Pease.

1270
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,440
And what do they want again?

1271
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,960
They want to get on my show.

1272
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,460
I got on their show, and then the next week Philo got on their show.

1273
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,640
So I may be playing their show with Philo on it at some point soon.

1274
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:46,440
It's hard to play their show without me or Philo on it because they cussed too much on all their earlier shows.

1275
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,080
They cussed so much, I'm not even going to think about it.

1276
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,660
So much it's not even funny.

1277
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,280
Well, it was to them, I'm sure.

1278
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:04,420
That's the thing, that's the difference between a podcast and a for real broadcast show like this.

1279
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:10,020
Which, although admittedly we're recording it in my house.

1280
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,140
In Welsh.

1281
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:17,200
It will be broadcast on actual respectable university stations.

1282
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,220
But they are.

1283
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:22,900
And a couple of other, otherwise respectable indie type stations.

1284
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:23,640
And they are.

1285
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:24,760
Oh, and Night Flight is on.

1286
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:29,820
Night Flight is going on to TV and it's got Subgenius on it again.

1287
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,340
It's not just on the internet.

1288
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:37,300
Yeah, Night Flight came back as a show that you pay for.

1289
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,580
A monthly fee or something on the internet.

1290
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:48,480
And they brought, it was, Subgenius Arise, the Subgenius video, was a big part of Night Flight in the 80s.

1291
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,940
And it's back and they wanted it back.

1292
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:55,740
And they're going on to some kind of broadcaster cable or something.

1293
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,440
Not just Roku or whatever.

1294
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,400
Cool beans.

1295
01:04:59,420 --> 01:04:59,720
So, yeah.

1296
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,240
And I'll get, we'll get paid.

1297
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:01,780
Yay.

1298
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:08,280
Don't tell Hal or DK Jones or Court Holland or any of the people who've worked their butts off on that thing.

1299
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,900
Nobody's been paid for it in a long time.

1300
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:12,300
Could I be paid too?

1301
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:18,220
No, you didn't have, you're not even, I think, I think you're in Arise for like a half a second.

1302
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,940
Because that was all done in the 80s.

1303
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,100
We added some last minute things to it.

1304
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:28,720
So there's like, I think there is a clip of Dave's band.

1305
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:31,880
And with you in it, Princess Wee, singing.

1306
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,420
Maybe you're singing America.

1307
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:35,740
Yeah.

1308
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:44,120
Come on again to save the, oh, I can't see any of that song on the TV right now.

1309
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,540
M and F and day, yeah.

1310
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:46,720
Right.

1311
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,300
Yeah, it was a song.

1312
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,380
The theme of Team.

1313
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,080
Oh, what?

1314
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,460
Oh, Team America World Police.

1315
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:54,720
Yeah.

1316
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,800
America blank yeah.

1317
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,940
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

1318
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,540
Blank yeah.

1319
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,760
Now, so that's where I would cut to the recording.

1320
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:09,860
Because now we're doing that, the part of the show that comes after the show.

1321
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:15,240
Well, if they weren't acting like such Aborigines, we wouldn't have these didgeridoos.

1322
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:16,520
Right.

1323
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,080
And since it's only on the internet, I'm tempted to go ahead and upload it.

1324
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,060
I'm going to open this liquid frop here.

1325
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,400
Uh oh.

1326
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,280
And squeeze this baby wiener out of its casing.

1327
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:32,700
Here it comes.

1328
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,900
It's not very big, but it's stiff.

1329
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,420
It's yummy too.

1330
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:38,400
Oh, so salty.

1331
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,400
So disgusting.

1332
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:40,860
Baby wieners.

1333
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,200
What difference does it make if you're drinking liquid frop when you're not even at a radio

1334
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:47,700
station?

1335
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,380
There's like no FCC.

1336
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,060
I don't know.

1337
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1338
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1339
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1340
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1341
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1342
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1343
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1344
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:50,060


1345
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,080
I don't even know if there's any FCC rules when you're recording it in your home.

1346
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:52,700
Goodness.

1347
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:58,820
Well, people used to drink alcohol in radio stations and smoke cigarettes.

1348
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,420
Smoke cigarettes?

1349
01:06:59,740 --> 01:06:59,900
Yeah.

1350
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:00,840
Yeah.

1351
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,440
In fact, it was considered normal and cool to smoke cigarettes in the radio station.

1352
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,480
Yeah.

1353
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,140
By your own personalized microphone.

1354
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:15,040
There was another little hole that you could put a drink or an ashtray in, I guess, or

1355
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:15,640
two of them.

1356
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,580
Can you imagine nowadays not being able to pour your favorite vegetables?

1357
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:26,080
Well, what you do nowadays is like if you're Rush Limbaugh or any of these Sean Hannity guys,

1358
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,180
you just take a ton of oxycodone before you go on the air.

1359
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,520
And lay there like a big flabby blob in a wheelchair.

1360
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,820
That makes you feel like you're God, so you just blabber all kinds of insipid nonsense.

1361
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,940
And for your audience, it's perfect.

1362
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,520
Thanks.

1363
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,580
You drink it up.

1364
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:47,540
Yeah.

1365
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,020
Yeah.

1366
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:49,460
Yeah.

1367
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:50,820
Fooey.

1368
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,960
Well, Dave, do you have to get up in the morning and go to work?

1369
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,380
I certainly do.

1370
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,780
Oh, no.

1371
01:07:59,200 --> 01:07:59,780
So do I.

1372
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,780
But it doesn't make any difference because I never get done.

1373
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,460
Actually, I have to get up in the morning and go to the doctor.

1374
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,280
I think I should go see a new doctor, a brand new doctor, just so he can give me a referral

1375
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,640
to go see my heart doctor from last year.

1376
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:14,940
Me too.

1377
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:19,100
But it's because I'm on Obamacare now.

1378
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,060
I used to be on county government care, but they lied and cheated me.

1379
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,340
Me too.

1380
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:27,960
Kicked me out, raised the rates.

1381
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,560
So now Barack Obama is paying for most of my insurance.

1382
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,020
Me too.

1383
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,360
Thanks, Obama.

1384
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,480
Thanks, Obama.

1385
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:41,240
Way to go, Obama, paying $800 a month of my insurance.

1386
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,020
Way to go.

1387
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,660
God, the stupid Democrats.

1388
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,620
I'm sorry.

1389
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,680
But God, they're just going to screw everything up.

1390
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,360
How dare they pay for my insurance?

1391
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,700
Or a whole lot of it.

1392
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:58,720
Just look at how wonderful the stock market is right now and how happy we should be that

1393
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:02,360
Mr. Turnitin has finally become the new president.

1394
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,260
Who knows?

1395
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,060
Who cares?

1396
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:10,560
Who knows?

1397
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,160
Not that I .

1398
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,300
I don't care.

1399
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,660
I'm fed up.

1400
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,280
I've had it. I've had enough of it.

1401
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,560
I'm done with it, I tell you.

1402
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,960
I've washed my hands of it.

1403
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,100
See, hear me? Hear me washing my hands of it?

1404
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,640
I'm out of here.

1405
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,500
Oh, I hope you would wash my sink sometime.

1406
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,740
Splish, splash, he was taking a bath.

1407
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,720
Friends, if you want to fight the power,

1408
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,240
join the power of the Church of the Subgenius.

1409
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,900
Fight power with power by sending

1410
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:48,840
$35 plus $395 postage

1411
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,820
to Post Office Box 807,

1412
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:00,540
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1413
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,440
And with that, we salute you.

1414
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,140
Well, actually, we salute Bob,

1415
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:11,880
because if we...

1416
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,660
If we don't, he'll torture us,

1417
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,940
jail us and torture us,

1418
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,700
make us live in our own feces.

1419
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,660
Well, he didn't really necessarily make us.

1420
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,780
Some of us said,

1421
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,140
would you choose, would you wish...

1422
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,060
Well, we know that would be the right thing to do

1423
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,520
if we didn't praise Bob enough.

1424
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,600
Well, we wouldn't get in trouble anymore,

1425
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,120
and people would certainly stay away from us

1426
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,680
for long periods of time.

1427
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,740
So it was the right thing to do.

1428
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,640
Yeah, cover yourself with feces.

1429
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,120
And praise Bob.

1430
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,960
I actually had to argue with some elderly person

1431
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,320
who had locked herself in a bathroom

1432
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,840
and was throwing feces at the...

1433
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,700
Once again, the...

1434
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,880
They looked like Soviet chimpanzees.

1435
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:58,720
Do you remember those guys?

1436
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,160
The Soviet chimpanzees?

1437
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,840
That was my favorite band in high school.

1438
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,340
Oh, mine too.

1439
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,920
Everybody loved them,

1440
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,400
especially, you know, the candy heads.

1441
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,660
I actually got some poo thrown on me

1442
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,860
when I went to their concert.

1443
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,600
When I was 17.

1444
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,140
Ruski chimpanzees?

1445
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,940
The Soviet...

1446
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,740
Soviet chimps.

1447
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,600
Soviet chimps.

1448
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,380
That's what they called them.

1449
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:19,780
Uh-huh.

1450
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,160
I had some...

1451
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,900
And I had Argo sign some of mine.

1452
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,200
What do you think about that?

1453
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:28,980
Argo himself?

1454
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,420
The real...

1455
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,460
He signed the poo before he flung it?

1456
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,680
The baby chimpanzee lead singer of them all.

1457
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:35,620
Man.

1458
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,680
He signed mine.

1459
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,820
He signed it...

1460
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:38,840
One of them signed it,

1461
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,540
I think it was something like Vaseline

1462
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:41,500
or some kind of...

1463
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:42,840
Sodium oil?

1464
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,780
Some cream of some kind?

1465
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,180
And the other kind was a blood-red ink

1466
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,840
of a damaged other species.

1467
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,980
I forget his name.

1468
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,160
Well, what they usually do

1469
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,740
is they use their poo

1470
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,280
to autograph, like, your back

1471
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,000
or your chest or something.

1472
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,380
Well, yeah.

1473
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,240
It was more poo on the poo.

1474
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:05,520
Right.

1475
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,360
That was part of their disgust

1476
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,880
for their audience.

1477
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:09,920
And, of course, the audience

1478
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,400
lapped it up, as it were.

1479
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:11,780
Well, no.

1480
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,520
Right, yeah.

1481
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,000
And especially chimpanzees didn't mind.

1482
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,780
They thought it was a little bit over the top.

1483
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:18,100
Man, I don't know how much more

1484
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,100
of this conversation I can take.

1485
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,880
This is getting way beyond disgustipating.

1486
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,900
Well, if you think monkeys pooping

1487
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,820
is disgusting...

1488
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:29,900
It's natural, Princess.

1489
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,820
Just having it smeared on me physically,

1490
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:33,940
I mean, come on.

1491
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,180
I'm getting ready to gag now.

1492
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,060
That's a performance art.

1493
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,440
Having it become takey in the sun

1494
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,700
at the days of no moisture.

1495
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:41,860
Yeah.

1496
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,160
Well, I...

1497
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,760
That's an art statement, Princess, were you?

1498
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:46,660
Yeah.

1499
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,340
I can think of a friend...

1500
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,160
I can actually come to think of it.

1501
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,620
We have a good friend in common

1502
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,620
who has worked in that medium.

1503
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,320
That's true.

1504
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,600
So, she was faking it

1505
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,500
during some of the set pieces.

1506
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:06,740
Yes.

1507
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,740
I'm calling it a burnt sienna crayon,

1508
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:10,880
but really,

1509
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:12,920
I'm calling it a burnt sienna crayon.

1510
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,520
Well, anyway, on that note, friends,

1511
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,860
we're going to wipe it up here.

1512
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:18,460
I mean, wrap it up

1513
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,540
and flush this show down

1514
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:23,320
and get the taste out of our mouths.

1515
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:25,620
Awful.

1516
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,820
I've got molecules all over my fingers now.

1517
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:30,800
Did you just come rolling out?

1518
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:31,360
Yeah.

1519
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,240
Yeah, when I asked for the toilet paper,

1520
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,540
that's when you come rolling out.

1521
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,720
To quote Jimi Hendrix.

1522
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,360
Okay.

1523
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,000
Dave, we have to go now.

1524
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,280
I have to go to the doctor

1525
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,640
and you have to go to the work.

1526
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,400
You load 16 tons.

1527
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:49,240
What do you get?

1528
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,060
Another day older, deeper in debt.

1529
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,220
Thanks for reminding me.

1530
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,640
Bob Dobbs, don't you call me

1531
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,220
because I can't go.

1532
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,460
I owe my soul

1533
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,700
to the subgenius doll.

1534
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,100
Oh.

1535
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,620
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1536
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:10,700
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1537
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,860
I kissed Bob one morning

1538
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,100
where the sun doesn't shine.

1539
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,240
Picked up my shovel

1540
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,040
and I

1541
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,840
walked to the mine.

1542
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,940
Loaded 16 tons

1543
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:28,920
of...

1544
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,280
It got real quiet all of a sudden.

1545
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:32,820
Did Dave go?

1546
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,560
Loaded some cowboy Dave poo.

1547
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,020
I think Dave left.

1548
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,940
And the next thing I said was

1549
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,300
goodnight to you.
