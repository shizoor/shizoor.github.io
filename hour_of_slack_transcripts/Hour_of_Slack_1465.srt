00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Dear friends, stay tuned for the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, number 1,465.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,100
The program you are about to hear, Bob's Slacktime Funhouse, is parody, satire, and comedy.

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:35,080
Any reference to Bob, the Church of the Subgenius, religion, politics, or any other touchy subjects is intended only as humor,

4
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,220
and should cast no reflection on the high standards of WREK Atlanta, its staff, or that of Georgia Tech.

5
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,020
Or WCSB Cleveland, for that matter.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,160
Oh, the show. What are we going to do?

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,600
Let the joy jump in the good times roll. Let the pleasure pop. Now let's take a stroll.

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,080
Light up. Let's all get...

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,860
Melon. Light up. You're smoking your eyes. Light up. Get hip, I say, fella. Light up.

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,220
Say, what is this job? Light up. Let's all get ready. Light up. I know how you feel. Light up.

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,240
Now don't be afraid of you. Find what I mean in any old field.

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,440
Pop. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

13
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,220
Slow. 8, 9, 10, and then 11.

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,640
Closer. Now get your day going.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,000
Lays up. I'm saying that's the thing.

16
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,900
Light up. Don't let that man get you. Just pop on your seat and get blown to smoke, man.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Music.

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:49,360
Friends, this hour of Slack is most, well, the first third or so will be from Reverend Susie the Flusie's Bob Slack Time Funhouse,

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,000
an episode that was a Bob Dobbs special.

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,360
Music.

21
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,040
Originally broadcast on beautiful WREK Atlanta.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,900
But we'll be back with Lonesome Cowboy Dave soon enough.

23
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,700
First, the collaging of that crazy collage-y-ass Reverend Susie the Flusie.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,500
By the way, what does Jack the Ripper have in common with Susie the Flusie?

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,220
I don't know. What does Jack the Ripper have in common with Susie the Flusie?

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,240
V.

27
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,760
I may not change my underwear, but I'm changing my ways.

28
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,600
Oh, there hasn't been a whole lot of Bob in the Slack Time Funhouse lately.

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,880
But now it's battle stations and full speed ahead Slack.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Ooh, with the size tension here.

31
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,100
Whew.

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,640
God, it's the reek of future.

33
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,160
Future death zooming down on us.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,500
This isn't the time to be lulled into warm complacency.

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,240
Oh, the end times have checked in and they've left an early wake-up call.

36
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,960
What does it take to convince you of the signs of the end times anyway?

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Oh.

38
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,520
Think you'll be able to hang on to your precious Slack now?

39
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,720
You don't have enough Slack to go around now.

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,440
And they're going to take even that little.

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,080
I've been away.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,340
Good Lord.

43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,040
Name me one friend you've got left, he said.

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,060
Bob, I said.

45
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,080
This was the only lifer in the prison.

46
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,960
The only American to have been convicted of treason during the Korean War.

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,380
He was the chief clerk in the supply room where I would soon be given my civilian clothes.

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,500
He was a science fiction writer of some note, publishing many stories a year under various pseudonyms, including Frank X. Barlow and Kilgore Trout.

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,620
Somebody said, oh, Mr. 666 is way off in the future.

50
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,720
No, my dear friend, he's been around a while.

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,840
And he's here tonight.

52
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,620
He's here tonight on the face of the earth.

53
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,840
And all the world is wondering after him.

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,820
And that's why this subject is so important.

55
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,540
The deceptions are all around us.

56
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,500
Deceptions are saying it's off in the future.

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,120
It's off in the future.

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't worry about it.

59
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,720
We better start worrying about it.

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,660
And friends, there are some things taking place around us that's going to come down very, very soon.

61
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,020
Are you ready for it?

62
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,260
Are you ready for it?

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,420
I tell you, we're living in serious time.

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,880
Look at the signs before basic food groups have been replaced with a pyramid.

65
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
Isn't that enough to tip you off?

66
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,600
Look at the signs.

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,940
The new Blue Star ointment commercial no longer mentions tether.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,040
I don't even know what tether is.

69
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,980
And they took it away from me.

70
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,400
Look at the signs.

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,100
We think we're okay in our little shells minding our own business, standing on the corner of walk and don't walk.

72
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,480
But, Seekers, it's time to run.

73
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,460
Quick.

74
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,920
It's not too late.

75
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,180
We got to get some Bob into us.

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,120
We got to get some Bob into us.

77
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Bad.

78
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,600
Bad.

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:55,620


80
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,520
Oh, even if it hurts.

81
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,260
Oh.

82
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,240
It will.

83
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,760
It will.

84
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,720
Oh, it's time to read some beads until it bleeds.

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,860
The only sensitivity I care about is nerve endings.

86
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,480
Are you yeti enough to test yours?

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,540
So welcome, friends, to Reverend Commandant Susie Darflusie's Boot Camp for Bob.

88
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,600
Today is the first day of your last hurrah.

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,360
Hey, you, pink boy.

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,960
Drop and give me 20, mister.

91
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,360
The rest of you, you'll have to suffer through these Bob songs and don't think you're getting off easy.

92
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
The hell is just beginning.

93
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,280
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

94
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,380
She says things I would not dare to articulate.

95
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,440
But I'll simply say this.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,680
If that is true, why so many of them get injured in the very act?

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,040
Why are some of them killed in the act?

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,160
And why do so many of them have to have colostomies?

99
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,740
Ah, good times.

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,380
You!

101
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,120
You're one of us!

102
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,960
Maybe you're one.

103
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,460
Something to be outright laughed at.

104
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
I heard someone over here say who's been the most effective evangelist the last 20 years.

105
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,400
His name is Bob.

106
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,760
And while, listen, listen, wait, listen, look at me.

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,280
Listen, wait, wait, wait.

108
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,040
While he entertains you, he indoctrinates you.

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,260
While he entertains you, he gets through to you.

110
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,040
While you laugh, you begin to lose automatically.

111
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,020
I met Bob when he came in.

112
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,840
When I came in the door to service today.

113
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,700
And Bob was formerly bound by the powers of darkness to a terrible degree.

114
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,560
Oh, whatever.

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,040
He says he gets a funny feeling down inside when he sees the Boy Scouts and the YMCA.

116
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,500
Thank you.

117
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,900
Thank you very much.

118
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:35,820
Ah!

119
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,880
And they were doing these crazy things.

120
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,720
Of course, that's just the start.

121
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,580
Thank goodness that, you know, nobody I knew was there because I thought,

122
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,700
Bobby, I'm never going to another one of these as long as I live.

123
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,000
I mean, you know, and he was a little nervous too when they grabbed his hands, you know.

124
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,640
It was like, this is not what we're used to.

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,380
What we learned a long time ago is that you become what the people you associate with.

126
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,900
And so he started associating with people in this business.

127
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,180
And I began to see the changes.

128
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,980
You know, Bobby was a good person and a good guy.

129
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
But I started seeing the change of staying away from the people that he was hanging around with

130
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,420
and looking forward to the future.

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,180
And so I started getting a glimpse of what this business had to offer.

132
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,420
So will all you goonie birds answering this description please stand up?

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,980
You misfits in this brave new age.

134
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,000
You dismally disorganized, improperly apologetic ghosts of the past.

135
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,760
Stand up.

136
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,120
Stand up and be counted.

137
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,720
And now it's time to bring up the headliner of the evening, a very special gentleman.

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,500
Please welcome to the stage, Bob.

139
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
Bob!

140
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,120
Last night my baby wanted to talk to me about art.

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,340
But I said no.

142
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,340
No.

143
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,480
Let's just close our eyes and watch.

144
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,220
Bob!

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,000
Hi, Bob.

146
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,360
I like to get mail, of course.

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,320
But for some reason, I get the strangest kind of mail.

148
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,900
And these are all real letters I'm reading you.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,300
Every one I assure you has come in in the mail from someone I don't know.

150
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,820
To give you an idea of what the people think of the show and what they like to say in their communications.

151
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,380
Dear Bob, before I tuned in your program, I could never get my husband out of bed in the morning.

152
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,760
Now he can't get out of the house fast enough.

153
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,320
Why don't you give up?

154
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,840
Why can't you act like normal people?

155
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,020
Why don't you stop whistling?

156
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,940
Why don't you stop acting like a moron?

157
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,680
Or maybe you aren't acting.

158
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes.

159
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
That's all I'm taking from you.

160
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,280
Get back here, you jackal!

161
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,840
He's gone!

162
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,620
He's gone!

163
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,140
He's gone!

164
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:37,980
He's gone!

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:38,320
He's gone!

166
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,940
He's gone!

167
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,400
He's gone!

168
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:39,600
He's gone!

169
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,600


170
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,600


171
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,600


172
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,600


173
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,120
He's gone!

174
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,000
He's gone!

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
He's gone!

176
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,300
Ah, old slack magic has me in its spell!

177
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,540
Mmm.

178
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,180
Oh, it's hard sometimes, howling and bumping and grinding in the radio wilderness.

179
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,280
Trying to sow my little seeds of slack on hundreds of sweaty strangers in the dark.

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,300
Oh, while the city sleeps around, I'm lighting up your dials with the power of Bob.

181
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,320
When I tell people I have a show called Bob's Black Time Funhouse,

182
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,880
they often say, who's Bob?

183
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,480
Well, that certainly separates a wheat from a chaff now, doesn't it?

184
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,940
Oh, I like to think that you all know Bob,

185
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,240
at least those of you who matter.

186
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,120
But don't fool yourself into thinking that that puts you any higher up in the food web because of it.

187
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,320
Oh, yeah, here at the funhouse, it seems like we've lost our grip on Bob.

188
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,480
We gotta latch onto his pipe and pull him down off the ceiling and bump his stomach

189
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,580
and get him into fight and trim because he's our only hope.

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,220
Oh, I want you to get to know Bob personally.

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,580
If you don't already, those of you who don't know Bob,

192
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,060
my heart sings like...

193
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,620
The prairie squid and rutting season for you,

194
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,560
the joy you're about to experience.

195
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,140
Oh, and those of you who've forgotten Bob,

196
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,700
fie, fie upon thee.

197
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,600
Wake up.

198
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,940
It's time to cover your ass, kids.

199
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,580
Don't be a pink boy.

200
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,280
Pinks are like sponges that don't work.

201
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,880
You, you subgenius, Todd.

202
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,260
Yeah.

203
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,080
You, on the other hand,

204
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,960
soak in this.

205
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,100
I want to give you...

206
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,300
I want to give you a close encounter with Bob and his amazing life,

207
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,360
his precocious youth,

208
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,360
his early careers in sports and salesmanship,

209
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,740
and his hot, hot linkage with Connie, his first and primary wife.

210
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,140
And all through the wonders of our patented sub-g-liminal

211
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,160
hypnognostic brain-ventilating system.

212
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,800
I want you to take the fronts off of your speaker-seekers.

213
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,860
There.

214
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,720
Yeah, now...

215
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,500
Now, put your head in the speaker cone.

216
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,200
No, no, no, not, not that one, the big one.

217
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:14,820
Yeah.

218
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,480
Okay, reach over.

219
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,540
Yeah, you can still barely reach now.

220
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,000
Turn that dial up to 11.

221
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,000
Or lethal, if you have it.

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,780
And I want you to feel the slack

223
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,140
pouring over you like drug tapping,

224
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,100
saturating you with pure wobbling.

225
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,400
Meanwhile...

226
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,680
Ah!

227
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,700
Ah!

228
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:39,700


229
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:39,700


230
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,180
Just match up your pain meters a little bit.

231
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

232
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,660
Once upon a time, there was Bobby.

233
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,460
Bobby was a boy who drank milk.

234
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,820
He drank milk in the morning, he drank milk at noon,

235
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,300
he drank milk before he went to bed.

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,640
And where do you think all that milk came from?

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,740
Well, that milk had a long journey.

238
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,600
For once upon a time, there was Bobby,

239
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,980
and once upon a time, there also was...

240
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,500
Do you hear them?

241
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,280
Yes, there also were five cows,

242
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,880
five cows, five cows.

243
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,320
They didn't like to wait,

244
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,320
but came and moved at the farmer's gate.

245
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,180
Five big cows.

246
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,080
The farmer came when he heard them call

247
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,040
and led each one into her stall.

248
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,020
Now I must milk them one and all

249
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,700
to get the milk for Bobby.

250
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,000
The five cows were Daisy,

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,880
and Squirrel, and Queen, and Lady, and Buttercup.

252
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,180
When they were in the barn,

253
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,780
the farmer took his stool and big pail

254
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,920
and sat down to milk.

255
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,360
Squirt, squirt, the milk poured into the pail.

256
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,440
And when the five cows had given all their milk,

257
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,340
the farmer let the cows wander out of the barn

258
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,220
and into the pasture again.

259
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,800
There they ate the green grass

260
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,620
and forgot all about the milk.

261
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,080
But the milk had only just begun its journey.

262
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
For once upon a time, there was Bobby,

263
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,560
and once upon a time, there also was...

264
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,380
Do you hear it?

265
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,820
Do you hear it?

266
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,660
Yes, there also...

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,200
There was a wagon, a wagon,

268
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,680
with a horse, rubber shoes, a clock.

269
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,620
Each time he started, each time he stopped.

270
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,380
A milk wagon.

271
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,320
And the milkman said,

272
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,200
My work is done before most other work's begun.

273
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
From house to house I hurry on

274
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,900
to bring the milk to Bobby.

275
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,960
The milk wagon came down the street

276
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,100
until it stopped at Bobby's house.

277
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,040
The driver jumped out and put down the bottles

278
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,880
Bobby's mother had ordered.

279
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,120
Then he drove away and forgot all about the milk.

280
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,980
But the milk still went on with its journey.

281
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:38,980


282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
For after the milkman went away,

283
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Johnny's mother ran downstairs and opened the door.

284
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,200
There stood the milk bottles.

285
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,500
The milk from the cows who couldn't wait

286
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,160
But said moo moo at the farmer's gate

287
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,980
The milk in the truck that couldn't stand still

288
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,700
But went a-hawking down the hill

289
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,500
The milk on the train that carried the freight

290
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,240
And clickety-clackety couldn't be late

291
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,040
The milk where the factory whistle blew

292
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,840
And said now there is work to do

293
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
The milk that went where the horse could plop

294
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,620
Each time he started, each time he stopped

295
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,660
The milk from a bottle that opened up

296
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,620
And mother poured into Bobby's cup.

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,700
Don't call me Bobby.

298
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,500
The milk slipped and slid down Bobby's throat

299
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,900
And so turned into Bobby.

300
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,880
And so at last the milk ended its long, long journey.

301
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,380
Your commentator was privileged to visit

302
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,540
Space Platform 7 last week.

303
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,160
And before Cadet Bobby and Cadet Betty

304
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,600
Went into pre-lunar medical quarantine,

305
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,520
I interviewed them.

306
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,060
These telememory tapes will introduce you

307
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,340
To these two exceptional youngsters.

308
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,040
Cadet Bobby.

309
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,500
Don't call me Bobby.

310
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,520
Bob,

311
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,720
Are you and Betty worried at all

312
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,420
About your lunar adventure?

313
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,300
Not really, Doctor.

314
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,200
We've been thoroughly checked out

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,540
On our space shuttle craft.

316
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,840
And of course, adults have made thousands of such trips.

317
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,580
After all these years of research,

318
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:07,580


319
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:07,580


320
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,500
And training, I suppose it's

321
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,100
Really a great thrill.

322
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,600
It certainly is.

323
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,060
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.

324
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,780
Bob, where have you trained?

325
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,100
Well, I had calculus and logarithms

326
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,360
In elementary school in Washington, USA.

327
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,340
Then I spent one year

328
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,660
In the Space Flight Center

329
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,680
At Houston, USA.

330
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,500
Another year in Moscow

331
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,860
On advanced power and propulsion systems.

332
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,540
Six months in England

333
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,740
At the Academy of Celestial Navigation.

334
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,580
And then back to Houston for a year.

335
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,220
For advanced computer technology.

336
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,200
I had just about the same program.

337
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,260
Except for the fuels and propulsion.

338
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
The girls,

339
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,660
Just don't seem to take

340
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,000
To the engineering courses.

341
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,600
Well, you kids have spent

342
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,660
Six months here,

343
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,900
50,000 miles from Earth

344
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,680
On Space Station Number 7.

345
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,280
And now you are ready for the final

346
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,640
200,000 mile

347
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,860
Voyage to the Moon.

348
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,920
Goodbye.

349
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,020
And thanks to all of you.

350
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,340
For watching.

351
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,900
I hope you enjoyed the video.

352
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,120
And I'll see you in the next video.

353
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,160
Bye.

354
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:39,920
B

355
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,340
O

356
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,680
B

357
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,560
He said,

358
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,840
Do you know the story about Bob?

359
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,640
And I said, well, Coach, the only thing I can tell you

360
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,680
He looks like Mr. Clean.

361
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,120
I mean, he's the largest thing I've ever seen

362
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,140
Since a Big Mac truck.

363
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,680
He is about 225, 230 pounds.

364
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,120
Packs arms the size of my thighs.

365
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,020
A huge, huge man.

366
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,840
This is my friend and colleague,

367
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,980
Texan.

368
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,000
Howdy there.

369
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,560
I didn't catch your name, mister.

370
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,500
Bob.

371
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,700
About as big as a mountain.

372
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,360
90 feet high and 9 feet wide.

373
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
God, oh, man.

374
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,520
Like you might have played some football.

375
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,760
Wanna kill some elephants today, are we?

376
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,220
Ding, ding, ding.

377
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,300
Help.

378
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,600
Ha, ha, ha.

379
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,920
Why did Bob do that?

380
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,860
Bob knew what he wanted.

381
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,160
He made a plan.

382
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,300
And he stayed enthusiastic

383
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,580
Over several years.

384
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,960
I mean, I've read his interviews and his letters.

385
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,220
No, he's, you know, not retarded.

386
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,660
I mean, I've talked to the man

387
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,500
And he's pretty quick.

388
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,280
But for some reason,

389
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,180
You kind of get that impression sometimes.

390
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,580
I don't know, maybe he just like,

391
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,280
You know, when he goes into create,

392
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
It's like somebody, you know,

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,320
Playing a musical instrument

394
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,020
Or driving a car.

395
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,200
That kind of went into a thin state of retardedness

396
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,580
Where if they were neurotic,

397
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:07,580


398
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:07,580


399
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,660
Neurotically trying to, you know,

400
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,600
Do something.

401
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,760
Specifically,

402
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,120
You can't drive a car

403
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,040
If you're totally concentrating.

404
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,980
You'll go nuts.

405
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,060
It's like being, you know,

406
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,740
That's the way you are when you're learning to drive.

407
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,640
At the same time, he's kind of nuts.

408
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,580
I mean, he's kind of a nutty guy.

409
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,440
And eccentric.

410
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,160
I mean, he's not Hugh Beaumont.

411
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,560
He's definitely not Mr. Normal.

412
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,900
Then neither am I.

413
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,120
Put the car in here!

414
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,720
Someone, someone said that

415
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,260
To your native speaker

416
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,960
Let's consult with Dr.

417
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,560
AOC about a major issue

418
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,420
With pre-suggesting

419
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,440
Tendency issues at 9 to 9.

420
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:28,780
Dr. Sharon Parham speaks

421
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,580
So, what do you try to do?

422
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:31,720


423
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,500
Tibur is actually like this.

424
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,500


425
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,500


426
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,500


427
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,500


428
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,080
Just keep going until all things

429
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,800
stop and at their agencies

430
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,040
More assumed that of us

431
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,220
Her buddy's the Lymphnode Institute.

432
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:49,000
You can find that at subgenius.com if you push the radio page button.

433
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,000
And you can find copies of all of this show.

434
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,040
Well, not all of them.

435
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,900
Not the first 200.

436
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,180
But I think everything since then.

437
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,860
And we're on show number 1,465 this time.

438
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,240
Well.

439
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,320
And that was some really old stuff that Susie played there.

440
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:20,460
That was, in fact, the original of that cut of the man, the square man saying, Bob.

441
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:27,540
And it was the beginning of the end of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

442
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,800
Yes.

443
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,320
Yes.

444
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,540
Yes, yes, yes.

445
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,140
Dave!

446
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,480
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

447
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,020
It's Dave!

448
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,620
It was.

449
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,900
I called on the regular land phone just to see what miracle might happen.

450
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,880
Because miraculously, this thing got healed somehow.

451
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,860
Well, then that is a first for this month.

452
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
A healing.

453
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm really glad to hear of a healing for a change.

454
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm real glad to hear of a healing.

455
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,800
Have there been many sickenings going on this month?

456
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,280
Let the healing continue.

457
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,220
Dave.

458
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,480
Let's see.

459
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,140
Since the last time I talked to you, I think we know two more close friends are in the hospital.

460
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,100
Oh, no.

461
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:28,020
In fact, as we left to drive to the station, our friend Reverend Pockets was Facebooking madly from the emergency ward.

462
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,920
Yes.

463
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,360
Somewhere in North Carolina where they rushed her for gallbladder problem or something like that.

464
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,260
And she was.

465
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,620
They've already given her her diluted or dilaudid or whatever.

466
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,700
Her pain drugs.

467
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,080
In an IV.

468
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,300
She called it the medicine water.

469
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,700
And she's sitting next to a guy, a gunshot wound victim, who's ranting and singing and laughing and crying.

470
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:56,440
And she just wishes that she could stream that to the Hour of Slack audience or YouTube or someplace.

471
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,040
Because she thinks it would go viral immediately.

472
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,760
She's probably okay because she's laughing and joking in the emergency room.

473
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,400
Thanks.

474
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:10,100
I think selfies are forbidden in the, especially humorous selfies are forbidden in the EM.

475
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,160
I think so, too.

476
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,200
Fascists.

477
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,560
Neo-Nazis.

478
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,720
CNN.

479
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,400
Scorpions.

480
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:15,940
Yeah.

481
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,340
High testosterone, slime berries, and other, I'm sorry.

482
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,460
Don't go, Dave.

483
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,180
It's not your fault.

484
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,520
And of course it's not.

485
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,740
You'd kind of want to take credit for it if it was.

486
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,940
Yeah, this is the special hospital's Hour of Slack, I guess.

487
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,520
Yes.

488
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,540
Or get out.

489
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,320
Get out of the hospital.

490
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,700
Get well and get out.

491
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,380
Princess, we had a chunk taken out of her head yesterday.

492
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,420
It happened to be a tooth, luckily, and not a permanent bone like the entire skull or the mandible.

493
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,380
Yes.

494
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,580
And that was an easy one.

495
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,660
Well, that sounds terrible, too.

496
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,920
I hate when teeth leave.

497
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,140
I had a tooth leave at a high school reunion, which is portentous, you know.

498
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,420
This is really great.

499
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,440
I hate people.

500
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,840
Yeah, I have to have young, strong teeth to eat that pizza.

501
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,980
I didn't tell you.

502
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,500
I don't know if I mentioned this to Princess Wee, but I've been getting emails about a

503
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,300
classmate of mine from 19, the class of 71 who croaked.

504
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,080
Oh.

505
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:21,980
Oh.

506
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,320
It's just, well, I don't even remember the guy.

507
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:25,960
Oh.

508
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,240
But I keep getting emails about it.

509
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,580
I didn't know anybody in my class.

510
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,520
I got a call from a bass player who I thought had a tooth.

511
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:34,520


512
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:34,880
I had died.

513
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
And that was the common rumor.

514
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,980
Oh man, that cat's dead.

515
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,560
That cat's dead.

516
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,240
Yeah.

517
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,280
He's like, .

518
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
He called you up and went .

519
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,500
Let's hope it's not the cat that I know that played with us at X Day once.

520
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,740
Let's hope not.

521
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,220
What?

522
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,240
In the Mondo Ricardo band, there was a bass player.

523
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,520
Let's hope it's not that one he's not talking about.

524
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,140
No, I certainly hope not.

525
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,500
No, I hope not.

526
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,720
I'm not talking about that.

527
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:04,740
I'm talking about the guy who played with us at the X Day.

528
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,180
Oh, that's good.

529
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,620
Very good.

530
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,920
No, you're talking about Charles of Rabbit's fame.

531
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,640
Right.

532
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,200
Yes, Jay.

533
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,380
Okay, so somebody's still alive.

534
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,080
That's good.

535
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,640
That's good.

536
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:15,960
Yes, yes.

537
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,800
We're just somewhere now.

538
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:16,940
Yes, yes.

539
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,400
Thank goodness.

540
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,460
Well, what's weird, it's amazing that Dave is still alive, or me, or you for that matter.

541
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,180
Well, that's what we want.

542
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,260
And we revel in the amazement every day as we walk down the corridor looking at the other

543
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,840
patient so grim-faced and sleepy, baby.

544
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
We laugh and sing his song.

545
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh, that's good.

546
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,840
It'll never happen to me.

547
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
And it, I'm sorry?

548
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,860
Dave, did you know that the first time I experienced an ophthalmic migraine or an optical

549
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:53,740
migraine, I was looking at you in the old station on Chaz's show, and you hear me in

550
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,180
the recording saying, suddenly I say, I think I drank too much coffee, you guys.

551
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,180
And what was happening was I was looking at your face, Dave, and it was disappearing.

552
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,720
Yes.

553
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,920
And your face was disappearing from the center, moving out.

554
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:07,940
Well, no, no, no.

555
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,920
That's not an ophthalmic or optometric migraine.

556
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,160
That's when little sparkles go around, make it look like an old-fashioned drive-in movie

557
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,560
type of that, or like a large flat-screen monitor.

558
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,120
Oh, yeah.

559
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:27,080
That goes on for 10 minutes like you're describing, although today I had it for about three hours.

560
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,820
I almost decided not to do the show.

561
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,120
That sounds like poop.

562
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,380
Because I was seeing the inside out.

563
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:34,480
Well, that's a good thing.

564
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:34,500
You know, the very first thing that you said about what it is, is, it's the Brian

565
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,280
Patterson story about the paramecium, or the Batman-Pow cartoon balloon with jaggy edges.

566
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,440
But, no, when the ophthalmic migraine begins, the very center of your vision, or maybe just

567
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,740
to one side—maybe Dave's nose, or left eye—begins to just, it's not there somehow.

568
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,860
And then the effect spreads to where the hole—

569
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,180
If you're talking about me, I say that all the time.

570
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,980
It's not fair.

571
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,680
It's not fair.

572
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,680
But I've learned to accept things the way they are, that I have a perfect face for a radio.

573
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:14,220
And as far as things disappearing, we will attest to the fact that my face regularly does disappear, and you just won't accept it.

574
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,840
It's true.

575
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,940
You're like a hypochondriac.

576
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,540
His face does disappear sometimes.

577
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,540
Oh, Dave's face is disappearing.

578
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,240
I must be having a migraine.

579
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,040
No.

580
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,140
It could be that Dave's face just simply disappeared.

581
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,160
Exactly.

582
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,480
And that's what happens frequently.

583
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,420
The center does not hold.

584
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,480
Yeah, especially when the knobs are all too low.

585
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,380
And none of them go up to 12.

586
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
My feet smell.

587
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,340
Mis piedes es del bueno.

588
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,620
Or, that's the wrong word.

589
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,840
Ah, mis piedes.

590
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,480
Oh, never mind.

591
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,000
I think it's that we're large mammals and we're not getting younger.

592
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,720
But the center...

593
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
The scrub genius...

594
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,500
Well, what about time control, you scrub genius hypochondriac?

595
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,440
Time control.

596
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,080
Right.

597
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeah, well, time control is when you go, I'm not even going to go in and do this show.

598
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm just going to do a rerun.

599
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,520
Dang it.

600
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,280
It's not giving yourself a few more years somehow?

601
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,380
Right.

602
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,980
I'd be giving myself some more years.

603
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:26,200
But I'd have to make a new show sooner or later anyway.

604
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,440
Oh, my God.

605
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,540
And nobody's talking about the fact that you...

606
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:41,020
The reason why you're making less frequent appearances is because the last few times you've been showing up like Captain America and Daredevil and other kinds of weird costumes.

607
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,540
And then their faces disappear.

608
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,040
Like comic book stores during comic book week.

609
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,180
Hey, I'm Captain America, too.

610
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,060
I mean, the red, the rascally of anger.

611
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,360
I was always the red skull.

612
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,120
The thing...

613
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,500
I can't get those jobs anymore.

614
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,780
They're all going to younger folks.

615
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,720
But at least I'm not in the hospital like everybody else except you.

616
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,060
Thank goodness.

617
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:14,560
Like I said, Princess Wee, she was at the dentist's office yesterday, knocked out on some kind of narcotics.

618
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,840
I wish I'd had a recorder yesterday driving her home.

619
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,420
That would have been a show right there.

620
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,240
And I remember none of this.

621
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,260
None of this.

622
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,760
She doesn't remember driving home or being driven home.

623
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,100
I should have let her drive.

624
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,140
That would have been a YouTube viral, you know.

625
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:43,900
As long as you drive home the pathetic propaganda on a daily basis, that's how the elixir of life is squeezed out of a stone.

626
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,360
You just keep on BS-ing people until their eyes turn purple.

627
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:55,160
Or figure out some way of getting rid of all those figs you got laying around the backyard, if you know what I mean.

628
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,420
If only we could BS the disease out.

629
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,000
You know, if we could BS...

630
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,700
The sickness out.

631
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,440
Yeah.

632
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,160
The BS.

633
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,660
Maybe...

634
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,760
Yeah, she missed it out like a bad poor.

635
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,700
You know, sometimes the laying on of hands or sledgehammers can do that.

636
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,040
Philo used to teach the laying on of sledgehammers.

637
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,500
It was a diversion of pain sort of thing, you know.

638
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:17,760
Right.

639
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,260
He was a...

640
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,300
Philo's still a diversionist, isn't he?

641
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:20,980
Yes.

642
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,480
If you're...

643
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,620
For instance, if you had a headache, he would apply a thumb screw to your toe.

644
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,040
Or a toe screw to your thumb.

645
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,260
Did you just rename Philo and call him...

646
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,160
DeFilo?

647
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,380
DeFilo.

648
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,600
Lord DeFilo.

649
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,060
Lord DeFilo.

650
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,840
Was one of the names back when he was hanging around with Cagliostro and those other...

651
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,540
And Nostradingle.

652
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Don't forget about that guy.

653
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:43,880
Yeah, Nostradingle.

654
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
The only one I shock at.

655
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,980
That's the only one that worked half the time.

656
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,200
The other times you're taking days without pay, you know.

657
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Yeah.

658
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,440
One man's bummer is another man's beautiful thing.

659
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,440
Yep.

660
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,240
This is the life we live, compadres.

661
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,000
We run to the mountains.

662
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,420
We run to the mountains.

663
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:01,520
We run to the mountains.

664
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,520


665
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,520


666
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,520
Squirrels get dry or too hot or perhaps even too wet.

667
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,740
Other times we collect coconuts and give them to the peasants.

668
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,440
It is the life that we have chosen.

669
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:16,800
Well, there was a discussion on the Scrub Genius Forum about...

670
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,640
Well, it was Phineas Narco, yet another of our radio friends, said,

671
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,740
I wish people wouldn't say, I'm sending good vibes your way.

672
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,060
That irritated him because he doesn't believe in good vibes especially.

673
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,820
Because he's a sacrilegious woman with no eyes to see what he's doing.

674
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,580
A lot of people jumped in and said, yeah, I hate it when people say they're going to pray

675
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,500
for me or send me good vibes.

676
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:48,500
But a few of us, me included, said, well, actually, it can't hurt.

677
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:53,280
I don't believe in that stuff.

678
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,340
But by God, if I didn't wake up the other morning just praying my little heart out for

679
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,820
my sick friend in the hospital, I can't even remember which one it was.

680
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,040
Now, I'm going to go to the hospital.

681
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,040


682
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,040


683
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,260
I guess every morning I wake up going, oh, whatever.

684
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,440
I hope God does better.

685
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,480
It just happens naturally.

686
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,280
You can't help it.

687
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,320
You can't help it, but send good vibes.

688
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,880
If you're concerned about a friend, absolutely.

689
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:14,520
Yeah.

690
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,420
That's the real true religion right there.

691
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,160
And that's one thing that I think bothers a little bit of a frozen temple, you know.

692
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,580
Wow!

693
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,620
Man, that was great!

694
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,040
I'm going to turn on this Byron Leonard music in the background to get you to surrender.

695
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


696
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


697
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


698
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


699
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


700
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


701
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


702
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


703
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


704
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,040


705
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,620
go with that.

706
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,240
That was amazing.

707
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:33,820
I missed that

708
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,860
because I'm in a low,

709
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,500
I'm in an,

710
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,220
I'm invisible.

711
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,340
Wow.

712
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,680
What happened?

713
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,920
I wish we could do it again.

714
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,760
That was a cool sound effect.

715
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,100
I think he channeled

716
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,020
Bob just now.

717
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,060
No, I think he channeled

718
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,720
Negative Land,

719
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,380
actually,

720
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,160
maybe the web.

721
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,000
Oh, you channeled

722
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,680
Negative Land.

723
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,320
No,

724
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,040
Negative Land may be

725
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,280
in the background right now.

726
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm not sure if this is

727
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,680
Rural War Room

728
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,100
or Thing-matic.

729
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,000
Thing-o-matic.

730
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,180
Mark Hostler's band.

731
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,620
Princess,

732
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,560
we was down at

733
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,100
Mark Hostler Street Fair.

734
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,860
Yes, I went to

735
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,060
Mark Hostler Street Fair.

736
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,800
Here in Cleveland,

737
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
they have a Hostler's.

738
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,180
I don't know if it was

739
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,360
worth the laugh after all.

740
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,720
Well,

741
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,080
the one thing I was going to say

742
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,260
about the praying

743
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,320
or sending good vibes and stuff,

744
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,180
it won't necessarily

745
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,500
do any harm

746
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,920
unless you let

747
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,160
the good vibe

748
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,200
and prayer sending

749
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,080
replace doing something.

750
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,060
If you could do something,

751
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,320
but instead you sit

752
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,860
on your butt going,

753
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,880
oh, Lord,

754
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,740
please go,

755
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,640
will you do the dirty work here

756
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,220
and drive over to the hospital

757
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,060
and visit my friend

758
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,100
because I really don't want to

759
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,060
because it makes me depressed

760
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,780
to go in a hospital,

761
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,060
but I'm praying for him.

762
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,240
Well, it seems to me...

763
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,000
Or if you go,

764
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,660
well, I could do

765
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,200
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

766
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,540
or the Heimlich maneuver

767
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,800
on this dying person,

768
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,720
but I think I'll send

769
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,260
really good vibes their way instead

770
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,140
because I wouldn't want to

771
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,940
make a mistake and look stupid.

772
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,920
Or hurt them

773
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,300
instead of making them better.

774
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,720
Yeah, let's let them die

775
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,180
rather than be injured

776
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,420
by my crude CPR.

777
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,720
They change the rules on CPR

778
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,360
every week, you know.

779
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,860
What do you mean?

780
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,060
The way they make you push

781
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,740
on the chest

782
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,160
or blow in the mouth.

783
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,280
Well, if they're changing it

784
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:31,820
every week,

785
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,260
it must be very important now

786
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,980
that maybe perhaps

787
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,880
there's a lot of disingenuous

788
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,940
dingleberries riding the wind,

789
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,520
so to speak,

790
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,520
meaning that our aeroflora

791
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,460
and fauna

792
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,680
have captured

793
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
our very innards

794
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,180
and are leading us

795
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,240
to the waters of sticks.

796
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,740
Well, that plus

797
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,700
all the microbes

798
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,620
can evolve a lot faster

799
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,940
than we can make medicines,

800
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,460
so they're going to win anyway.

801
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,360
Well, I smelled the...

802
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,060
the diesel fuel-ish smell,

803
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,760
the kind of puffer dome-ish,

804
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,380
propane-ish smell

805
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,360
associated with large swaths

806
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,520
of nuclear lapazoids.

807
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,160
That means you're having...

808
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,040
And I wondered if I was just

809
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,380
smelling diesel in the air

810
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,060
or if...

811
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,660
Or if you were having

812
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,060
a nose-centric migraine.

813
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah.

814
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,260
Hallucinating smells.

815
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,860
Yeah, I was hoping I was,

816
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,160
you know,

817
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,840
because I was thinking,

818
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,400
Fukushima!

819
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,160
Well, they say it's still

820
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,540
floating around various places

821
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,500
like two or less or...

822
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,960
You know, it didn't go away

823
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,480
or anything,

824
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,020
and it's still coming, so...

825
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
Well, it would be carried

826
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,320
on the rain and the...

827
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,480
Oh, I see what you're saying.

828
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,840
Well, I think people should go

829
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,960
to the sub-genius site

830
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,800
and play Iodine-131

831
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,520
and Nuclear Boy.

832
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,500
Nuclear Boy.

833
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,580
Oh, did you see that video?

834
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,440
Yes.

835
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,260
That General Public made.

836
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,100
This guy took a...

837
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,400
a Fukushima cartoon

838
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,720
and put Dave's song with it.

839
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,360
Oh.

840
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:07,940
Fukimanga.

841
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,020
Oh, is that his dream?

842
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,580
Yeah.

843
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,880
Fukimanga anime.

844
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm sorry.

845
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,360
There...

846
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,620
We went to see

847
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,480
one of those

848
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,140
Japanese disaster movies

849
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,820
just a couple of days ago.

850
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,540
It was called Godzilla,

851
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,380
the one they're advertising on TV.

852
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah, just like the other one,

853
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,640
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

854
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,600
Those were funny, too.

855
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,460
Yeah, yeah.

856
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,060
It was...

857
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,760
Well, it's...

858
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,580
You know,

859
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:28,900
if the...

860
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,200
The photography's great.

861
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:30,960
It looks cool.

862
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,100
But, yeah,

863
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,040
that actually had

864
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,820
a lot of

865
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,640
very deliberate

866
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,920
visual references

867
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,180
to 9-11

868
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,860
and the...

869
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,260
the Christmas tsunami.

870
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,680
You know,

871
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,420
there were lots of

872
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,460
shots of

873
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,220
tidal waves

874
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,620
carrying cars down streets.

875
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,740
And, of course,

876
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,760
they were caused by

877
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,180
monsters the size of

878
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,540
medium-sized towns.

879
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,300
That was pretty cool.

880
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:56,620
Well, you know,

881
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,300
in the media,

882
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,880
people are conning you.

883
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,740
They used to, you know,

884
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,620
pictures of cars

885
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,900
submerged on streets

886
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,980
and stuff like that.

887
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,160
But I dare say,

888
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,320
in a picky-lo-peek-o

889
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
tiny-lilly-teeny-tiny voice,

890
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,980
that such things

891
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,780
are becoming

892
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,520
a little bit

893
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,840
more...

894
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,020
every day.

895
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,200
Well, there are

896
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,920
a lot of movies

897
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,320
with cars underwater

898
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,980
in them,

899
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,720
that's for sure.

900
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,320
That is true.

901
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,020
What about

902
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,120
Namor of the Deep?

903
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,580
He drove a rocket 88

904
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,800
until he took a sleep.

905
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,040
They haven't done

906
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,180
that movie yet.

907
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,600
What they told me

908
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,660
when I was a baby boy,

909
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,640
now I'm 75.

910
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,020
Hoi, hoi.

911
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,860
Hoi, hoi.

912
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,800
Ah, hoi, hoi.

913
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,580
I'm not really

914
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,640
spending my time

915
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,600
searching how it feels

916
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,160
like to help

917
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,020
everybody else

918
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,400
who's not dead, too.

919
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,820
Are we even alive?

920
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,600
Do we really know?

921
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,780
Are we in the Matrix?

922
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,100
Did X-Day actually happen

923
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,460
in what we thought

924
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,320
was 1998?

925
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,880
And it was 1998,

926
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,200
and now we're in a jar.

927
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,780
Thinking we're

928
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,740
in a radio station.

929
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,660
What's the difference?

930
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,160
None.

931
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,840
What's the difference?

932
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,540
There's no difference.

933
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,480
No, I agree completely.

934
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,360
I think that what has happened

935
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,580
is, you know,

936
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,980
since everything's a product

937
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,960
of your own perception,

938
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,600
as the yogis would say,

939
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,160
the mind creates the world,

940
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,580
the...

941
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,280
Until you stub your toe.

942
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,220
Yeah.

943
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,880
And you go,

944
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,620
I didn't freaking do that.

945
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,560
I really didn't.

946
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,660
I didn't do it.

947
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,840
I didn't create that.

948
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,680
I didn't build that.

949
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,820
I didn't build that thing

950
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,640
that stubbed my toe.

951
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,220
That's when you start to...

952
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,120
I didn't build that stubbing.

953
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,780
It's not fair.

954
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,780
Not fair.

955
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,960
Fair is where you take your pig

956
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,280
and hope you win a prize.

957
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,360
Stubbed toes and...

958
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,060
and, uh...

959
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
three-day-old fish

960
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,740
usually are what lead people

961
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,000
to conventional relations.

962
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,120
You know,

963
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,960
minor catastrophes

964
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,380
make them go,

965
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,640
uh, it's just not perfect.

966
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,760
Well, we call that involuntary.

967
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,040
I don't find that a perfection.

968
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,620
It's, uh...

969
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,540
We call that involuntary slack.

970
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,560
Yes.

971
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,880
Where something dreadful

972
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,560
interrupts all of your plans.

973
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,640
But then,

974
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:07,960
after a while,

975
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,420
you realize,

976
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,960
well, those plans were stupid

977
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
and what I'm doing now is better.

978
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,740
I'm glad that disaster happened.

979
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,240
Yes.

980
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,620
Yeah.

981
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,140
But sometimes you just go,

982
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,340
if that disaster hadn't happened,

983
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,900
I wouldn't be in this iron lung.

984
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,460
Oh.

985
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

986
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,720
You know what I mean?

987
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,160
But, uh,

988
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,720
you pointed in the right direction

989
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,400
and wasted it away

990
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,360
from the rest of us.

991
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,560
Thank goodness.

992
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,160
Yeah, I don't want you

993
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,980
getting a hold of it.

994
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:37,480
It'd make you sick.

995
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,600
You guys wouldn't be able

996
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,120
to handle it.

997
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,520
Hell yeah, you gotta...

998
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,620
It's like you gotta have

999
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,580
a bunch of PhDs

1000
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,460
in biochemistry.

1001
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,180
Yeah.

1002
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,140
Even, like, Glock.

1003
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,720
Yeah, just a Glock

1004
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,420
you have to have...

1005
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,140
you have to have a degrees.

1006
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,960
And bony knees.

1007
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,500
And you also have to have

1008
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,660
a filigree thigh,

1009
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,500
like one of the elder ladies.

1010
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,860
At the Kabooska house.

1011
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,900
What do you know?

1012
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,320
What do you mean, bony knees?

1013
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,560
Are you making fun of me again?

1014
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,440
No, my knees were knocking,

1015
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,700
so I thought I'd give myself a jab.

1016
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,200
Oh.

1017
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,580
Okay.

1018
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,480
I was afraid

1019
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
because the moon is getting

1020
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,840
pretty big right now.

1021
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,020
Is that what it is?

1022
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,760
Because, you know,

1023
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,400
not only have I been lately

1024
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,760
beset by the sadness

1025
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,960
of seeing so many people fall,

1026
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,800
literally fall,

1027
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,460
or get sick,

1028
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,520
but what was the other thing

1029
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,180
that was bothering me?

1030
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,780
Now I can't remember.

1031
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,760
It must not have been that bad.

1032
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,480
Oh, well.

1033
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,620
Life is great.

1034
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,260
Yeah.

1035
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,540
As long as I don't remember anything,

1036
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,740
it's really cool.

1037
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,420
Yeah.

1038
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,620
Oh, well.

1039
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,080
I'm sure it'll come to me

1040
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,460
when I listen back to the tape.

1041
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,440
You see the purity,

1042
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,680
the essential,

1043
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,920
the innate beauty of the system.

1044
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,900
It's just a little glimpse.

1045
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,220
It's like a crappy movie,

1046
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,760
and then the movie's over.

1047
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,360
But who knows where the audience goes?

1048
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,200
That's what I want to know.

1049
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,540
Well, the system is about punishment,

1050
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,340
not reform.

1051
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,260
That's the bottom line.

1052
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,340
There might have been a system

1053
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,580
that was about reform

1054
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,980
instead of punishment,

1055
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,900
or maybe both.

1056
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,220
But no,

1057
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,440
it's going to be punishment

1058
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,260
all the way down.

1059
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,980
And bad puns.

1060
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,380
All the way down.

1061
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,960
All the way down.

1062
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,420
All the world gone bad.

1063
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,680
Yeah, I unfortunately

1064
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,560
harmonized with you there

1065
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,220
on that elaborate backwards note.

1066
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,740
Although I fail to see

1067
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,640
what kind of grand choral design

1068
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,860
we're bringing into the universe,

1069
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,580
if such a thing could exist.

1070
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,600
Because we want everyone's toes

1071
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,740
pointed in the right...

1072
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,800
Well, we don't want

1073
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,000
to proselytize or misrepresent

1074
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


1075
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


1076
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


1077
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


1078
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


1079
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,600


1080
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,840
an area or anything like that,

1081
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,200
but it would be nice

1082
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,520
if everyone's toes...

1083
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,460
Grand choral?

1084
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,420
Well, Suzy the Flusy

1085
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,380
already did that

1086
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,380
earlier in the show.

1087
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,460
She proselytized...

1088
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:08,820
What, in her toes?

1089
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,820
Yeah, well,

1090
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,240
she always does that,

1091
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,000
and everybody else's toes.

1092
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,300
But she did the proselytizing

1093
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,500
and did a nice little

1094
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,240
Bob brainwashing thing.

1095
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,600
Might work on some people.

1096
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,680
But I'm blanking

1097
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,400
on the grand choral.

1098
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,580
That just doesn't...

1099
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,720
Grand choral?

1100
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:30,580
Yes.

1101
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,540
That means the universal chorus.

1102
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,680
Ah.

1103
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,820
The implazoid conjecture

1104
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,880
beyond the roofing.

1105
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,260
The next outspoken

1106
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,020
argumentative individual

1107
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,640
that needs to be restrained.

1108
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,080
And they never restrain.

1109
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,900
Oh, now I remember

1110
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,700
what it was.

1111
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,840
Besides people getting sick,

1112
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,100
is the insane people

1113
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,200
are agitated.

1114
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,040
This week.

1115
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,140
Maybe Mercury's hiding

1116
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,660
behind the moon or something,

1117
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,920
but my regular crazy person callers,

1118
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,640
message leavers who leave...

1119
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,160
See, we have a toll-free phone.

1120
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,500
Subgenius church phone,

1121
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,380
and we get crazy people.

1122
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,180
Let's go ahead and say it.

1123
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,640
Really, really crazy people.

1124
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,280
And there's been a...

1125
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,940
There's a new one started

1126
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,060
this week.

1127
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,780
Oh, my.

1128
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,280
Yeah.

1129
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,280


1130
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,560
Staring out the window.

1131
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,740
He said...

1132
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,560
He mentioned that he was

1133
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,740
in a mental institution.

1134
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,260
And he said that he wanted

1135
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,920
to get in touch

1136
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,780
with our cult leader

1137
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,740
because he had discovered

1138
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,580
our cult leader

1139
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,360
who was Hermes Trimestus,

1140
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,320
or Trid...

1141
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,160
Oh, yeah, that guy.

1142
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,000
I've heard of that guy.

1143
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,480
Oh.

1144
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,780
And he wanted to talk to him

1145
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,540
and let us know

1146
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,940
that that was who he was

1147
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,040
or who we were.

1148
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,980
Well, just send him a picture

1149
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,120
of anybody with a beard,

1150
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,500
you know,

1151
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,820
and a kind of a short beard.

1152
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,000
Well, he left his number

1153
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,760
several times,

1154
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,260
and he can't remember

1155
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,580
saying that he would call back

1156
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,560
when we were in.

1157
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,280
Ah.

1158
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,740
But I sat there

1159
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
and listened to him

1160
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,540
leave messages

1161
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,040
without picking up the phone.

1162
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,680
Well, tell him

1163
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,500
that you will not

1164
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,220
call him back

1165
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,480
until you're three times

1166
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,100
as ready.

1167
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,560
But it wasn't just him.

1168
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,560
I got an email

1169
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,860
that was about

1170
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,720
a hundred pages long

1171
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,420
of coded sentences

1172
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,300
that the author knew

1173
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,460
had to be true

1174
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,580
because he'd run them

1175
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,100
through a little

1176
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,180
computer program

1177
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,260
an end time program.

1178
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:28,600
It was written by

1179
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:28,600


1180
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:28,600


1181
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,680
Book of Revelation

1182
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,900
numerology calculator

1183
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,320
that if your sentence

1184
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,580
came out to decode

1185
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,900
to 777 times three,

1186
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,600
whatever the heck

1187
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,660
he means by that,

1188
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,700
then therefore

1189
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,500
that sentence was correct.

1190
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,520
And some of the sentences

1191
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,640
of this author,

1192
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,980
Sam Moser,

1193
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,880
you can look him up

1194
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,360
on the internet.

1195
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,380
There's quite a bit about him

1196
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,240
because he talks about

1197
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,500
the masons all the time.

1198
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,440
And he's in and out.

1199
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,300
Oh yeah, the masons.

1200
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,080
I've been out there

1201
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,460
You mean on the Southwest?

1202
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,180
One of his sentences was, Ivan Stang's very demonic.

1203
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,360
And I was like, did he leave a word off?

1204
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,900
Does he mean Ivan Stang's very demonic pet newt or Ivan Stang's very demonic latest album or what?

1205
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,360
But it just meant that I'm very demonic.

1206
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:30,900
It also, another thing that he had decoded was that Barack Obama was after him, that it was okay for fathers to sleep with their daughters because they do it in the Bible.

1207
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,800
Okay.

1208
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,780
Although he tried that with his hamsters.

1209
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,560
I've been looking forward to that.

1210
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:44,760
Honest to God, Dave, this guy in the midst of this hundred-page email, which takes like ten minutes just to open on an older computer, just a text file, it's that long.

1211
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,320
I hear you.

1212
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,860
He said that he had been breeding his hamsters to see whether...

1213
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:57,740
Like in the Bible, if the father got drunk and did it with the daughters, whether how the baby hamsters would turn out.

1214
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,180
And he said that they turned out catatonic, which made him almost doubt the Bible.

1215
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,500
But then he ran his phrase through that computer on somebody else's website, some other religious nuts website.

1216
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,380
And it came out to 777 times 21.

1217
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:12,780
Times three.

1218
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:17,620
So that meant it was true that father mate with daughter, okay.

1219
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,180
I think that's what he said.

1220
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,280
Ten minutes, yeah.

1221
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,240
It was really something.

1222
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:36,780
And I mean, it's like every time the phone rings, either it's a crazy person telling me something like that, or it's somebody, another crazy person telling me one of our friends is in the hospital.

1223
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Or it's the person in the hospital calling us up or texting us and going, I'm on painkillers.

1224
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,420
Yeehaw, come on down and get yourself trepanated like me.

1225
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,500
Yeehaw.

1226
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,300
Yeehaw.

1227
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,740
So, you know, some of them are having fun.

1228
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,920
Well, I'm glad I got trepanated.

1229
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,780
Believe me, boy, a lot of times I just couldn't go to the bathroom, you know.

1230
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,340
It fixed your phone.

1231
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,840
Other apertures, of course, but, you know.

1232
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,260
It did fix your phone.

1233
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,060
Dave's phone sounds so good, it's like pornography to me to hear this.

1234
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,760
It's so clear.

1235
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,060
It's crystal clear.

1236
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,780
You'd think Dave was in the studio with us.

1237
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,100
Yes.

1238
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,460
I am the specter in your studio, right behind you.

1239
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,980
And if you look on the console, you'll notice I've left a present for you.

1240
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,200
Is that what that is?

1241
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,440
You did that?

1242
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,380
That's gross, man.

1243
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,600
A piece of demon dung.

1244
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,480
Yes, I did that.

1245
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,140
I gave that to you.

1246
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,680
Yes, yes.

1247
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,220
It was me.

1248
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,680
It's got maggots in it.

1249
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,300
Oh, don't worry.

1250
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,400
They're not real maggots.

1251
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,340
Maggots don't grow in demon excretion.

1252
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,540
Okay, well, if you left your brain here, what are you using to talk with now?

1253
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,240
Because this is a stinky old brain.

1254
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,600
A maggot brain.

1255
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,120
Well, thanks a lot.

1256
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,960
Well, it's stinky.

1257
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,180
It looks pretty old.

1258
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,460
I'm trying to make yourself nice for Mother's Day and for happy, you know, non-Easter or whatever.

1259
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,160
Poor Reverend Pockets.

1260
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:09,640
Not only did she get no Mother's Day, but she got thrown into the emergency room.

1261
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,260
Yeah.

1262
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,720
It's not fair.

1263
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:19,620
And on top of that, I jokingly told her she was crazy for giving us such wonderful gifts.

1264
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,360
And she thought I meant it.

1265
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:21,880
Yeah.

1266
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,220
Oh.

1267
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:31,660
So, Reverend Pockets, if you're in the hospital or doped up listening to this later, I was just, that was an icebreaker.

1268
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:36,340
I didn't really, I don't really, well, I do think you're crazy, but not that kind of crazy.

1269
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,300
The same way you've always been bragging that you're crazy.

1270
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,460
Nice, crazy.

1271
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,060
Reverend Pockets.

1272
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,560
Creative.

1273
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,900
Happy, free-spirited, you know.

1274
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,640
Crazy.

1275
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,920
Wild and crazy guy.

1276
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:47,800
Kind of crazy.

1277
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,420
Yeah.

1278
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:49,840
Yeah.

1279
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,120
Yeah.

1280
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:50,820
Yeah.

1281
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,580
What happened to our background music here?

1282
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,180
What happened to the beacon and the gloom?

1283
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,160
That's what I'd like to know.

1284
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,380
I hear the rough disadvantages of an accordion and the coarse laughter of naked people.

1285
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,140
And I can hear it all the time.

1286
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,280
You hear naked people?

1287
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:08,840
Yes.

1288
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,360
Yes, yes, yes.

1289
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,920
I hear them in the wind.

1290
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,080
I would feel so cheated.

1291
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,420
Pardon?

1292
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,400
I'd feel cheated, you know, hearing naked people all the time.

1293
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,040
But believe me, you don't want this present.

1294
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:28,240
Once you get it, you know you've been cheated out of real hearing and real searing.

1295
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,160
Well, if there were naked people there, it must have been the dream Starwood Festival.

1296
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,280
Oh, that's right.

1297
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,660
We were going to brag up Starwood.

1298
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,760
Princess, we're already at Starwood.

1299
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,760
And handing out little postcards and flyers about the Starwood Festival, which comes up in, what is it, July.

1300
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,360
I don't make money off this, so I can talk about it.

1301
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,300
I do help with it.

1302
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,920
But right after X-Day, at the same place.

1303
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,440
Sometimes if you're really drunk.

1304
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,400
No, I'm just kidding.

1305
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:05,820
Right after, immediately after X-Day Festival at Wisteria Campground in Southern Ohio, there's Starwood Festival.

1306
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,460
That starts, you can hear it in the background here.

1307
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,760
And that starts, what, July 8th?

1308
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,040
Yes.

1309
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,640
July 8th through 14th, I believe.

1310
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,460
And it's a camp out.

1311
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,260
But there's a...

1312
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,920
About 40 bands and a bunch of lecturers and ranters like me.

1313
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,640
Oh, and there's a great magician going to be there, Magnus the Magician.

1314
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,180
Yes.

1315
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,940
He's...

1316
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,500
He's...

1317
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:36,380
He is a professional Las Vegas magician who's done a lot of shows at...

1318
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:36,940
He's famous.

1319
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,120
And we've opened for him.

1320
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,760
And Penn Jillette hates him because he believes in the other kind of magic.

1321
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,860
He's a stage magician.

1322
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,120
But he also believes in magic.

1323
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,820
That is very unusual.

1324
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:53,600
Right.

1325
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,280
Wouldn't you say?

1326
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,740
Yeah, yeah, it is.

1327
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,680
Usually they're debunkers that, you know...

1328
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:58,720
Right, right.

1329
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,360
And they know that the card's always going to be pointed...

1330
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,260
Oh, never mind.

1331
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,620
I am pointing to...

1332
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:11,400
Well, Magnus or Jeff McBride is not trying to convince adults that they're...

1333
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,760
The spirits of their parents are revealing where the hidden will is or anything like that.

1334
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,220
He's...

1335
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:17,340
He's...

1336
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,560
It's the kind of thing where...

1337
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,040
I'd almost be afraid to tell Penn Jillette that I'm friends with that guy, too.

1338
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,720
Although, when we were in Las Vegas, we visited Magnus.

1339
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:39,020
And he got to see his nice house, and he told us about the Valley of Fire.

1340
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,440
I thought he was going to tell you that the house was built by Lord Zaldor.

1341
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,180
It was.

1342
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,560
It looks like it was built by Lord Zaldor.

1343
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,380
But...

1344
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,740
And there's weird...

1345
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,580
It's a magician.

1346
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,380
It's a...

1347
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,560
It's like a Kabuki...

1348
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,360
Yeah, a Kabuki alchemist house.

1349
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,560
Oh, boy.

1350
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,380
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1351
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:01,980
It's fabulous.

1352
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:02,640
But he did...

1353
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,180
He told...

1354
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,840
He said if you...

1355
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,620
Flying around the place all over there, you know?

1356
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,860
The way he got rid of us was he said, you know, if you guys take off now, you can make it

1357
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,600
to Valley of Fire by sunset, and that'd be really worth it.

1358
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,900
And we did take off, and we got...

1359
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,200
Valley of Fire is a state...

1360
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,200


1361
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,200


1362
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:23,280
It's a state park about an hour from Las Vegas, and it's the most alien-looking place of all

1363
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,540
the alien places we went to, just about.

1364
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,100
It was spectacular.

1365
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,840
Much to us here in the East, much of the West does look very alien indeed.

1366
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,520
It looks lunarscaped and strange.

1367
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,640
I'm sorry.

1368
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:41,200
Well, if you look at a globe that's got the wrinkles where mountains are, the right half

1369
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,400
of the country is interesting and wrinkly.

1370
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,680
And the...

1371
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,100
No, no.

1372
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,080
Left half of the country.

1373
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,400
Is interesting and wrinkly.

1374
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,040
And the right half where we are, starting about at Albuquerque, it's...

1375
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,000
You don't even know how sad it is until you drove across the West.

1376
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,260
Mm-hmm.

1377
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,040
And you realize how utterly boring the Midwest is.

1378
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,440
The plain plains.

1379
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,260
Yeah.

1380
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,980
Did you ever drive through North Dakota or South Dakota, man?

1381
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,860
I've lived in South Dakota, Dave.

1382
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,200
Oh, man.

1383
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,940
I've lived in Mission, South Dakota for two years.

1384
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,840
And there's a new subgenius who's in Valentine, Nebraska.

1385
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,200
That's where I used to drive for beer on Sundays.

1386
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,100
I drove across Nebraska one time.

1387
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,480
It was like, it just goes on and on.

1388
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,380
And there's these, like, roads with lights on them and stuff.

1389
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,460
And it's like, who is it for?

1390
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,180
Right.

1391
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:32,420
It's for the drunk person driving straight at you down that highway.

1392
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,020
And they're talking about flatness.

1393
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,500
And I couldn't believe that it was really that true, that things could just be...

1394
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,400
The horizon just went on forever and on forever.

1395
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,500
Yeah.

1396
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,400
Our friend Dr. Zeronius...

1397
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:46,820
Yeah.

1398
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:53,260
...Taudry Milk Toast did a series of tapes while they were hallucinating their way driving across Kansas.

1399
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,020
Because it's like being in a sensory deprivation chamber.

1400
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,740
Yes.

1401
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,700
It's just the same thing.

1402
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,840
I mean, driving through Kentucky, the interstate going through Kentucky and Tennessee will almost hypnotize you.

1403
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,700
But at least there's...

1404
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,660
At least there are beautiful trees in Tennessee.

1405
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,400
Yeah, but it's the same tree over and over again.

1406
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,460
It's like you can tell it's an animated background.

1407
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:14,000
Yes.

1408
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,220
And in Kansas, it's the same pool.

1409
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:22,380
It's the same pool and the same field over and over and over forever and ever and ever.

1410
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,000
Yes.

1411
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,760
It makes Ohio and Texas look sort of interesting almost.

1412
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,180
Yes.

1413
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:27,720
I would have to do that.

1414
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,460
There is one...

1415
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:30,900
There are three interesting places in Texas.

1416
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,920
We've been to all of them.

1417
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,240
They're all named after the devil.

1418
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,460
Well, to me, the piece is humongous, so there's got to be like 20 places.

1419
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:43,500
It was like the devil's staircase, the devil's wash basin, the devil's commode, the devil's inkwell.

1420
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,420
Devil's pool.

1421
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:45,540
The devil's pool.

1422
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,200
Yeah.

1423
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,900
The devil's armpit.

1424
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,260
The devil's Facebook page.

1425
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,060
Yeah.

1426
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,620
The devil's picnic table.

1427
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,420
Yeah.

1428
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:54,960
It's...

1429
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,280
Yeah, anything named after the devil is good.

1430
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,060
Hey, we've only got like five minutes left of this show.

1431
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,020
Thank God and Bob both.

1432
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1433
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1434
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,200
I'm sorry.

1435
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:15,400
Well, I've actually kind of been fighting off this hallucination of the...

1436
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,660
of the ophthalmic migraines a little bit this whole time.

1437
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,380
Hmm.

1438
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,800
He's a warrior of the ophthalmic migraine.

1439
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,440
I experienced my nerve a couple days ago, but it was only for a few hours.

1440
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,420
No, I did not know.

1441
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,700
Norm, they don't hurt.

1442
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,400
They're not like migraine headaches that are brutally painful.

1443
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,680
They don't hurt at all.

1444
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,820
You try to ignore what you're seeing there.

1445
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,160
Well, it's hard.

1446
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:45,800
You read.

1447
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,360
It's...

1448
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,640
If you're playing a video game, you miss the monsters every other hit

1449
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,580
because you can't really focus well.

1450
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,360
It's irritating.

1451
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,300
You know, it's like...

1452
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,400
Do you experience colon sometimes?

1453
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,660
It's kind of like what they say that LSD stuff is like, visually.

1454
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:06,720
Yes.

1455
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:14,400
But not quite as much frilly frill work and paisleys and fiddly bits as you might get.

1456
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,120
As I've heard.

1457
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,400
But they're...

1458
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,500
They're so

1459
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:26,500


1460
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:34,860
It was the first CGI type of movie.

1461
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,400
Yes.

1462
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,500
Yes.

1463
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:41,940
You know what I mean, man?

1464
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,400
Dave, you lived so long that they've made a remodel

1465
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,220
remake of Tron.

1466
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,880
Did you know that?

1467
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,700
Oh, of course.

1468
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,400
Oh, okay.

1469
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,980
Well, they've remade everything.

1470
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,180
Somebody was saying...

1471
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:54,160
I don't watch movies anymore.

1472
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,500
I let the movies come to me.

1473
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,600
Right.

1474
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,660
There was a guy on Scrub Genius saying,

1475
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,880
okay, they must have a mathematical sheet

1476
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,740
or some kind of schedule where they go,

1477
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,440
okay, Godzilla was cool of 25...

1478
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,560
It's been 25 years.

1479
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,680
Okay, time for the remake of Godzilla.

1480
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,240
Or before, it was like Beverly Hillbillies.

1481
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,360
It's been 25 years.

1482
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,740
Time to make a Beverly Hillbillies movie.

1483
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,180
That was about 10 years ago.

1484
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,220
So they're probably due to make another

1485
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,500
Beverly Hillbillies remake movie remake.

1486
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,380
And they'll be due for another Tron.

1487
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,660
And it occurred to me that by this formula,

1488
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,420
by the year 2047,

1489
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,820
the Church of the Sub-Junior should start making money.

1490
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,400
If that's the way that formula goes.

1491
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,260
We came along a little ways after,

1492
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,960
26 years after Godzilla,

1493
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,720
because I was born the year Godzilla was born.

1494
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,820
And the Church came along and grabbed me when I was 26.

1495
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,080
So that means 26 years from now,

1496
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,820
we ought to be able to do the remake of Church of the Sub-Junior.

1497
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,320
And this time actually make money.

1498
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,400
That Godzilla movie's made 96 million bucks

1499
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,160
in the last two days since it opened.

1500
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,360
Goodness gracious.

1501
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,960
That was because I mentioned it.

1502
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,160
You know, that's all.

1503
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:14,580
Of course.

1504
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,920
Of course.

1505
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,400
Of course.

1506
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1507
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1508
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1509
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1510
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1511
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1512
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1513
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1514
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1515
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1516
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1517
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,400
You really knew Godzilla.

1518
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,820
I guess that's what the real name is.

1519
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,400
Kotsura or something like that.

1520
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:20,740
Gojira.

1521
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,460
It was actually the nickname of a big...

1522
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:23,760
Gojira.

1523
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,400
It was the nickname of a funny looking guy

1524
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,600
that worked at the studio.

1525
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,480
And it means a gorilla whale.

1526
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,460
And originally Godzilla was like a gorilla whale.

1527
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,960
If you think about the way he looks,

1528
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,640
he's kind of not a normal dinosaur.

1529
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,600
He's kind of like a gorilla whale.

1530
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,240
Anyway.

1531
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,760
He's kind of way aquatic.

1532
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,240
Yeah.

1533
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,160
He's big.

1534
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,580
He's mad.

1535
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,440
He's Godzilla.

1536
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,280
And there were some nice little funny jokes

1537
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,340
like cops shooting at these creatures

1538
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,560
the size of several buildings.

1539
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,560
I mean, shooting with pistols.

1540
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,420
At one point, it works.

1541
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,600
The guy's like, he's about to be killed by Godzilla.

1542
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,640
I'm just total spoiler.

1543
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,820
He clicks it.

1544
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,960
He shoots his gun at Godzilla, at the monster.

1545
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,640
It's not Godzilla.

1546
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,520
It's another monster.

1547
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,660
And the monster...

1548
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,140
stops in its tracks like the bullet did something.

1549
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,580
Yeah.

1550
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,320
Then you realize it's because Godzilla's got his teeth

1551
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,840
sunk into the back of that monster's neck.

1552
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,100
And with that lovely image, friends,

1553
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,900
we must bid you some sort of adieu or adidu

1554
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:37,000
as we fade slowly off into subgenius.com,

1555
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,200
which is where you can find out about all this stupid...

1556
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,220
Yes, yes, yes.

1557
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,520
Often, often, often, often.

1558
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,880
I used to say...

1559
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,340
Thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1560
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,200
Thank you, Princess We Are Doe.

1561
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,360
Oh, okay.

1562
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,480
And thank you, me.

1563
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,760
And...

1564
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,860
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1565
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,000
And so...

1566
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,900
There they go.

1567
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,740
From PR News in Washington,

1568
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,040
I'm showing slow but steady improvement

1569
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,960
on the ground in a hail of bricks and bullets.

1570
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,800
Some analysts say this year was last year.

1571
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:14,220
Good.

1572
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:14,940
PR's...

1573
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,580
Report reports.

1574
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,420
You're listening to PR News,

1575
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,500
found dead in Washington.

1576
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,160
And that's one thing that I think bothers

1577
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,260
a little bit of a frozen tadpole.

1578
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:23,880
Uh...

1579
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:26,940
Whoa!

1580
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:27,780
Wow!

1581
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,020
Man, that was great!
