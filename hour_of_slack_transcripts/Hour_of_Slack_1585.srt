1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,220
Rise now, you white whale.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,540
Show us your crooked jaw.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,120
Show us your wrinkled brow.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,140
Rise.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,280
The birds.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,620
The birds!

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,720
He rises!

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:27,760
He rises!

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:29,900
The

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,140
So genius

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,800
Power of

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,120
Swarming!

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:38,840
Mob?

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,360
He'll not escape!

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,440
Thunder and hell, what's wrong with you?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,900
Oh, you

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,300
Mob?

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,640
You damn it!

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,220
Mob?

20
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:51,620
Mob?

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,300
Hey, we, uh, we didn't do the, uh,

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,300
the, the, your, I know the costume ball was like an anything ball, but it was originally going to be your, your favorite dead rock star.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:17,960
And, uh, I forgot my pants, cause I was going to be, uh, no, everybody was going to do like Elvis or that sort of thing, but, uh, how many people in here know who Screamin' Lord Such is?

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,300
Okay, there's one.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,400
Two.

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,800
See, I would've walked around, you guys got a, oh, who are you supposed to be?

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,340
I'm Screamin' Lord Such.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,800
I just thought of Blowfly.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,640
Yeah.

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,140
You tend to forget the good ones.

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:38,380
I was going to, my first thought was Gigi Allen, which would be easy cause you'd just be in your underwear covered with chocolate syrup.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,500
You'd have to shave your head.

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,380
Right.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,900
And I thought, okay, who do I, who, what dead rock star would I really look like?

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,580
Pete Seeger.

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Pete Seeger?

37
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,460
Well, he's not really rock, but yeah.

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,820
No, what I decided was Jim Morrison didn't really die.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,240
He moved to Africa and just died the other day.

40
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,700
And that's...

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,080
That would have been my costume.

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,160
I wouldn't have to wear anything.

43
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,540
Instead, I came as walkers for Trump.

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,920
Did you see my zombie mask and sign?

45
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,080
And walker?

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,780
Oh, yes, dear friends.

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,020
X Day, such a beautiful, uh, time just before the end of the world.

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,200
It's so, uh, somehow freeing to know that it's all going to be over with and you don't have to pay any more bills.

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,340
You don't have to worry about any of that crap.

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,800
Because it's X Day.

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,480
It's X Day.

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,260
And you've got Bob on the brain.

53
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,620
Yep, you've got Bob on the brain.

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,380
B-O-B.

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,300
Big old brother.

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,400
You've gone crazy on X Day.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,080
Because that's what you do on X Day.

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
You just go crazy.

59
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,840
Because the world's about to end.

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,800
The world's about to end.

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,440
You've got Bob on the brain.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
And Bob's your big brother.

63
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
And everything's okay.

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,420
Because all the subgeniuses are around and they're jamming.

65
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,640
And, you know, you've got some beer and some frappy.

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,500
And you've got...

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,440
You're Woody and you're Surfboard.

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,620
And you go have a subgenius beach party.

69
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,520
You can just go right down to that pond and have a subgenius beach party.

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,600
Go surfing with the brain-eating amoebas.

71
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,240
You can go scuba diving with old Seaclaw.

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,460
Oh, you can just have the funnest time running around X Day.

73
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,720
Not X Day in this particular case.

74
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,020
But this will be the last one, I'm pretty sure.

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,800
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

76
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,880
It's going to be great.

77
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,100
But Bob promised me.

78
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,980
And I know...

79
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,240
I love Bob.

80
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,420
I love Bob.

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,540
He talked to me one time in my dream.

82
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,940
And so that's why I know that he's for real.

83
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,540
And one time I went to sleep in the alley and I woke up with a haircut.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,040
And I know that was Bob that did that.

85
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,440
That was fun.

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,040
So anyway, friends, it's X Day.

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,120
It's X Day.

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,040
It's crazy.

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,080
Everybody's crazy.

90
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,160
Because it's X Day.

91
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,980
And everybody loves Bob.

92
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,460
And Bob loves everybody.

93
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,760
And I love everybody.

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,380
And I love everybody.

95
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,740
Because everything's crazy at X Day.

96
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,480
It's crazy, I tell you.

97
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,500
Because it's slack.

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,360
It's slack.

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,360
Some people got some slack.

100
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
I know they did.

101
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,820
Some people got lucky.

102
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,220
They got some damn slack.

103
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,080
They got more of them kind pills, Bob.

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,100
It's great.

105
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,320
It's X Day.

106
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
It's crazy.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
Oh, yeah.

108
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,180
It's crazy.

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,800
It's crazy.

110
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,460
It's crazy.

111
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,660
It's crazy.

112
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:26,660


113
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,320
It just about makes me out of breath talking about how crazy it is.

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,540
I love X Day.

115
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,440
It's just so fun.

116
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,380
You can just go crazy at X Day.

117
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,000
Or as we might call it, you can go sane at X Day.

118
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,720
That's right.

119
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,700
You can go 8-shit-sane at X Day.

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,440
You can go 8-shit-sane.

121
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
That's Dr. Legale.

122
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,600
put it. Say, speaking of Dr. Leguim, we should call him up and put him on FaceTime. We get

123
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,260
Dr. Leguim up on FaceTime. He'd write to us. It's a beautiful thing. It's X Day. It's a

124
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,760
beautiful thing. One man's bummer. It's another man's beautiful thing. Praise Bob.

125
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,440
Ah!

126
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,720
Ah!

127
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:50,340
To be enraged with a dumb brute that acted out of blind instinct is blasphemous.

128
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,660
Speak not to me, a blasphemy man.

129
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,420
And I'd say,

130
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
Strike the sun if it insulted me.

131
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,900
Look here, Starbuck.

132
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,100
All visible objects are but as pasteboard masks.

133
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,920
Some inscrutable yet reasoning thing puts forth the molding of their features.

134
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,240
The white whale tasks me.

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,700
He heaps me.

136
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,660
Yet he is but a mask.

137
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,420
Just the thing that I'm not.

138
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,180
The thing behind the mask I chiefly hate.

139
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,800
The malignant thing that has plagued and frightened man since time began.

140
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,320
The thing that mauls and mutilates our race.

141
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,060
Not killing us outright, but letting us live on with half a heart and half a lung.

142
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,860
God keep us, keep us all.

143
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,640
Amy, mm-hmm.

145
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:54,820
Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,880
Challenged me to another song once, many months later.

147
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,940
We were talking about flow charts.

148
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,460
And she said,

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,980
Hey, how about you write a song that's based on a flow chart?

150
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,740
And I tried, and ten minutes later, I'm like, fuck this.

151
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,840
No, I can't, no.

152
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,820
No, this is wrong.

153
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,080
Forty-five minutes later, I had this.

154
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,240
Hey, kids, you want to be a star?

155
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:19,980
Star?

156
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,300
Star?

157
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,300
Star?

158
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,520
Star?

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,280
Star?

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,800
Star?

161
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,600
Star?

162
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:24,620
Star?

163
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,420
Why?

164
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,420


165
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,420


166
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:29,960
Barnes.

167
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,900
No.

168
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,780
But you won't be a star like you're predecessor for a long while, bro.

169
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:41,940
You won't be a star like mean wimpy altri.

170
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,060
A new teen star.

171
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,060


172
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,060


173
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,060


174
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,220
No.

175
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm sorry, baby.

176
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,520
Balck b点k Resource Mission.

177
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,680
I don't know why I didn't write this song myself.

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:45,680


179
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:45,680


180
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:45,680


181
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,660
Theen.

182
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:46,960


183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:46,960


184
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,580
That's some stuff from Bruno Ronaldo.

Yeah, every song made me exhausted like, in my daily life, not too bad.

187

Save me the time.

188
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,200
That's fine, yeah.

189
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:06,040
Did the band show up? Yes. Did anyone else? Yes. Did anyone buy your songs? Well, no.

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:18,180

Well, no. Do you have songs for sale? No. Did your band quit? No. Then go record some songs.

193
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,580
Well, no. Then go record some songs.

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:17,920
Practice. Book a gig. Did the band show up? Yes. Did anyone else? Yes. Did anyone

Practice, book a gig.

203
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,340
Can we get a second microphone hooked up?

204
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,800
Can we get a second microphone hooked up here? Can we get some more musicians to the stage, please?

205
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,480
Hey, there's an amp and there's a synthesizer. Those are there.

206
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,720
And there's microphones and cables and projectors.

207
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,240
There's a lot of music coming from the stage.

208
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,240


209
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,540
It's not ex-day until you can't see the stage anymore.

210
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,160
It's not ex-day until you can't see the stage anymore.

211
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,720
10 years ago

212
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,880
I was on the verge

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,800
of losing all hope

214
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,400

They made a book

258

Living in a state

Where you never confirm nor deny

277
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,620
The possibility of the existence of one or more gods

You know I was reading something interesting

285
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,240
The other day

286
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,240
It's about a guy named Bob

287
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,460
It's about a guy named Bob

288
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:28,460


289
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,040
It's about a guy named Bob

290
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,620
And there's just as much proof that he existed

291
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,140
And there's just as much proof that he existed

292
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,700
As Buddha

293
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,100

Jesus.

297
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,720
This book is really neat.

298
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,500
They wrote it kind of like a Bible.

299
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,800
It's got two columns on each page,

300
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,260
little annotations, subscripts, notes.

301
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,420
Look, they even put the names of all the artists

302
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,340
underneath every picture.

303
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,540
This wasn't just done by one guy in his basement,

304
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:42,780
but by dozens of stark, raving lunatics.

what have you got to tell me

364
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,320
in your case my boy

365
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,960
diagnosis is extremely difficult

but

367
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,080
but the examination you made this morning

368
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,500
the x-rays

369
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,260
examination discloses one condition

370
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,760
pressure upon certain parts of the brain

371
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,900
this condition

372
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,300
coupled with your belief

373
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,280
that the moon can bring about a change

374
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,240
accomplishes exactly that

375
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,400
during the period

376
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,840
in which your reasoning processes

377
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,680
give way to self-hypnosis

378
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,220
the glands which govern your metabolism

379

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,180
when this happens the gland is going to be

382
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,520
able to generate an abnormal supply of certain hormones

383
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,120
in your case those which bring about the physical transformation

384
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,080
which you experience

385
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
by explaining it doesn't help

386
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,960
what can you do about it

387
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,100
operate

388
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,880
a surgical operation to enlarge the cranial cavity is a long and dangerous one

389
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,880
then there's nothing you can do to help me

390
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,180
there might be

391
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,800
come here my boy

392
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,840
under tropical conditions

393
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,960
which we've tried to duplicate here

394
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,000
this hybrid plant

395
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
the very formosa

396
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,180
produces a mold

397
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,960
from which we've been able to distill

398
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,980
a substance which possesses the property of softening

399
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,720
any hard structure composed of calcium salts

400
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,120
bone for instance

401
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,940
with this medium

402
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,040
it might be possible without surgery

403
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,980
to reshape the cranial cavity

404
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,280
and thus eliminate the pressure

405
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,400
you can do that now

406
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,240
can you

407
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,760
unfortunately it'll take

408
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:15,980
some time to get to the point where you can't do it

409
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,720
some time to produce

410
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,920
insufficient quantity

411
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,040
tonight the moon will be full again

412
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,780
the

413
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,000
the

414
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,000
the

415
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,740
the

416
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,880
the

417
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,700
the

418
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,500
the

419
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,400
the

420
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:38,400


421
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,120
the

422
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,120


423
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,120


424
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,120


425
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,500
the

426
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,620


427
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,340
Twist away the gates of steel

428
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,020
And lock the sacred voice

429
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,880
And give in to the ancient noise

430
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,720
Take a chance on a brand new dance

431
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,520
Twist away the gates of steel

432
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,060
Twist away, now twist and shout

433
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,320
Fade away the gates of steel

434
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,320


435
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,980
But the earth, it moves too slow

436
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,740
But the earth is all we know

437
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,620
Hate or pray the human way

438
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,540
Twist away the gates of steel

439
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,680
The day of steel

440
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,960
The day of steel

441
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,980
But the earth is all we know

442
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,900
Hate or pray the human way

443
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,840
Twist away the gates of steel

444
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,900
The beginning was the end

445
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,080
Of everything now

446
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,500
The egg rake cuts his tail

447
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,260
He's a comet

448
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:30,720
He's a comet

449
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,340
He needs until he fails

450
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,000
Half a goon and half a god

451
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,060
A mansion made of steel

452
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,560
Twist away

453
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,640
Now twist and shout

454
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,520
The earth, it moves too slow

455
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,200
But the earth is all we know

456
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,500
He needs until he fails

457
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,500


458
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,500


459
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,500


460
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,100
To play the human way

461
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,060
Twist away the gates of steel

462
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,680
But the earth is all we know

463
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:16,280
He needs until he fails

464
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:24,060
But the earth is all we know

465
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
And that's real

466
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,160


467
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,500
The end of this world

468
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:49,720
When I first moved out to Pittsburgh, I worked at a TGI Fridays, and I had to wear the suspenders.

469
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,720
Yeah. It was cool for a little bit.

470
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,600
I did. I got a lot of really cool buttons out of that, that I threw out.

471
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,400
But I ran an open mic at TGI Fridays, and I wrote this song, and I got to sing it at Fridays,

472
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,520
where, you know, this song was out of a lot of angst.

473
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,920
It's called 283.

474
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,420
Hi, my name is Amy, and I'll be serving you tonight.

475
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,960
I've got coffee, beer, and smiles, as long as you treat me right.

476
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,100
I don't ask for much in my simple life.

477
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,480
You don't have to dress up or any of the like.

478
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,920
I got bills, I was a student, you see.

479
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,080
And all they give me is 283.

480
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,520
283 is all they give me.

481
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,600
Dollars and cents, ladies and gentlemen.

482
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,400
283.

483
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,520
283 is all they give me.

484
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,280
You can ask me dumb questions, and I'll be honest with a smile.

485
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,400
I will tell you what's good and what's not, as long as you tip me in style.

486
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,440
You see, my life isn't free like you think.

487
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,820
I've got bills to pay, man, they ain't rinky-dink.

488
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,620
All I'm asking is compassion.

489
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,360
You see, all they give me is 283.

490
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,780
283 is all they give me.

491
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,620
Yes, before taxes.

492
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,780
283 is all they give me.

493
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
It's been a pleasure to have you.

494
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,420
I hope to see you again.

495
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,800
Sign your name by the X on the line.

496
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,600
Make sure you sign it.

497
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,580
Make sure to add and be kind.

498
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm not a second-class citizen.

499
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,700
I pay all my taxes.

500
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,700
I've got discipline.

501
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,400
I'd like to think you appreciate me.

502
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,080
So add 20%.

503
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,480
And that's where you take the first number and you times it by two, and then you add

504
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,680
it all up together, and you sign the right receipt, and you give me my fucking pen back

505
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,180
to 283.

506
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,600
283 is all they give me.

507
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,600
That's 16 cents less than a dollar.

508
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,720
That's less than a soda, people.

509
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,520
283 is all they give me.

510
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,360
Reverend Amy Mhmmm.

511
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,680
Everyone, welcome her to your fold.

512
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
Gooble gobble, one of us, one of us.

513
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,740
What's more for Amy Mhmmm, everyone?

514
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,900
Come on.

515
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:08,680
40 years and a thousand lowerings ago, why this madness of the chase, this boiling blood

516
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,180
and smoking brow?

517
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,640
Why palsy of the arm and the oar, the iron and the lance?

518
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,500
I feel old, starbuck and bowed.

519
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,600
as though I were Adam,

520
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,940
staggering under the vile centuries since paradise.

521
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,360
What is it?

522
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,960
What nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing

523
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,720
commands me against all human lovings and longings

524
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,080
to keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time,

525
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,020
making me do what in my own natural heart I dare not dream of doing?

526
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,280
Is Ahab Ahab?

527
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,340
Is it I, God, or who that lifts this arm?

528
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,600
But if the great sun cannot move except by God's invisible power,

529
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,700
how can my small...

530
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,980
My small heartbeat, my brain think thoughts

531
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:26,980
unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living,

532
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,020
and not I?

533
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,180
By heavens, man,

534
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,240
we are turned round and round in this world

535
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,580
like yonder windlass,

536
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,800
and fate is the handspring.

537
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,480
All the time, that smiling sky,

538
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,240
and this unsounded sea.

539
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,360
Look ye into its deeps,

540
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,880
and see the everlasting slaughter that goes on.

541
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,160
Who put it into its creatures to chase and fang one another?

542
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,120
Where do murderers go, man?

543
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,980
Who's to doom when the judge himself is dragged before the bar?

544
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,820
By these fairies of the Barrier Reef,

545
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:39,100
I march in the

546
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,400
frequentedИ

547
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,020
outst 예�ing,

548
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,260
for si passing by.

549
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,380
guitar solo

550
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,000
guitar solo

551
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,820
guitar solo

552
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,020
guitar solo

553
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,620
From hell's

554
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,220
heart I slap at thee

555
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,200
for hate's sake

556
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
I spit

557
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
my last

558
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,740
breath at thee

559
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,980
thou dammit

560
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,520
whale

561
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,860
thou dammit

562
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,340
Bob

563
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,740
yeah

564
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,240
that was

565
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Gregory Peck

566
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,920
doing Melville in the

567
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,320
movie of Moby Dick from a long

568
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,880
time ago

569
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,900
the guitar music there was our buddy

570
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,220
Reverend Jimmy Ryan

571
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,160
that one was called

572
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,440
Ladyland

573
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,460
full

574
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,640
well

575
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,340
Reverend Amy

576
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,520
was credited on there

577
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,000
by St. Andrew the Impaled

578
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,880
who did that song Get a Band

579
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,560
and that cover

580
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,720
of Gates of Steel

581
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,940
the Devo song was done by

582
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,840
a band called Night of

583
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,620
the Rabbit

584
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,440
which we suspect

585
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,700
has something to do with

586
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,580
Reverend Bleepo

587
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,580
Abernathy

588
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,380
could

589
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,340
be could be

590
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,040
could be

591
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,700
could be

592
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,880
and we heard Reverend Fox

593
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,520
ranting at 19X Day

594
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,500
with rock gods in the background

595
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,640
or rock God

596
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,920
Reverend Rock God specifically

597
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,560
on guitar and somebody was on drums

598
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,300
it might have been

599
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,660
Fid,

600
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,200
Chuli

601
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,580
or possibly Pease

602
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,420
and on bass there might have been

603
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,980
Reverend Angry Larry or Reverend

604
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,600
Sinfaltimus Ex Mortis or Reverend Pease

605
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,580
I didn't look at the videos I just

606
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,520
that came off of my recordings

607
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,260
and Reverend Angry Larry of course

608
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,240
of course

609
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:45,940
is

610
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,360
the angry

611
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
angry guitar player

612
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,000
of the church of the subgenius

613
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,960
it's a good thing he has that outlet

614
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,420
man he's such a nice guy

615
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,200
yes

616
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,780
because he's able to release the anger

617
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,500
the broiling

618
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,280
hatred

619
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,900
and anger

620
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,560
hatred of the pink box

621
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,160
the boys

622
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,060
the humans

623
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,020
and mediocritans

624
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,660
and the

625
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:12,920
and

626
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,080
there's

627
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,520
not the mask

628
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,300
but the thing itself

629
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,860
behind the mask

630
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,580
that I hate

631
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,740
that's the hate

632
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
so we're hate haters

633
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,840
it's the hate

634
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,400
hate squared we call it

635
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,460
the hate of hate itself

636
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,160
that's the

637
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,320
well that's one of the subgenius ways

638
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,160
there's lots of those ways

639
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,180
and it is a big mean vicious hate though

640
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,840
the hate of hate

641
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,520
oh it's a hateist

642
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,000
yes

643
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I'm not gonna do

644
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm not gonna imitate him

645
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,060
I'm not gonna do it

646
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
I'm not gonna do it

647
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,080
I'm not gonna do it

648
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,760
gonna try to avoid it this time

649
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,900
we have some rare recordings

650
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,080
that have we've unearthed

651
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,640
starring our old buddy

652
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,300
Lonesome Cowboy

653
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,580
Dave

654
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,800
he was in a band

655
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,860
called the Chronics

656
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,680
over 100 million years ago

657
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,920
and we dug up copies of that stuff

658
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,020
and I'm expecting him to help narrate them

659
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,600
I think it's him singing on them

660
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,520
it sounds like a little tiny baby Dave

661
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,220
aww

662
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,700
just like you hear on some of the really old subgenius tapes

663
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,400
you hear baby me

664
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,180
yeah

665
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,300
and little tiny baby Dave

666
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,960
and baby Philo

667
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,120
yes

668
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,820
and baby Dr. Hal

669
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,680
and baby

670
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,040
baby Puzzling Adolescence

671
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,760
and baby Bear

672
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,440
but she always sounded like that

673
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,020
yes she always sounds like a baby

674
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,240
yeah and Dr. Leguimin

675
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,900
he always sounded like a baby Dave

676
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,540
he looks kinda like a Gerber's baby

677
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,980
he'd probably bust me

678
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,860
knock my teeth out for saying that

679
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,040
what happened to our man?

680
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,540
I don't know

681
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,960
he should be calling

682
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,880
or he should have already called

683
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,280
yeah I gave him lots of things

684
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,380
you know like if this

685
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,180
how long can this go on?

686
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,340
how long can this go on?

687
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,440
I've been editing the devotional footage

688
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,420
that the two of us shot

689
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,720
just kind of for practice with

690
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,160
what's for me a new editing program

691
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,460
Final Cut Pro X

692
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,960
cause I am a video and film editor

693
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,000
only I haven't

694
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
just like I'm a smoker

695
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,420
but I haven't had a cigarette in 20 years

696
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,460
and I've

697
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,260
I haven't really done high-end

698
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,600
editing in a long time, but thanks to our friend Zaphod, I can now, and we're doing that. I've

699
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:53,180
been practicing on the devotional stuff, and so I've had cause to hear versions of dozens of

700
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:59,680
Devo songs, and now every time somebody says a word, if that word was in a Devo song, that Devo

701
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,480
song starts running through my head. We still praise Zaphod. Well, he didn't have anything to

702
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,660
do with that. The sad thing is that I've had so much joy out of syncing. Like, when I was a young

703
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,060
editor, it was so long ago that the picture and the sound were on different strips of sprocketed

704
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,760
film, and that's why that little clapboard is at the beginning of shots, where they go, action,

705
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,700
you know, scene three, blap. The editor has to put the plop of the sound with the closing board

706
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,340
in the picture. Well, we didn't have that with the devotional videos, and we also didn't

707
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,900
have a soundtrack on one of our cameras, but it synced up with the one that did have the soundtrack

708
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:49,680
if you studied the background projection videos, which had a lot of fast cuts, and you could match

709
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:58,220
cut on the cuts, and that's why lonesome cowboy Dave finally made the cut. The cut of what?

710
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,240
The cut of your jib, my friend. We were just admiring your jib, and it's the old scar from

711
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,300
cut there. You should put your jib in your pants. I have a jib scar that stretches all the way from my penile

712
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,300
orifice all the way to my frozen backside. I was going to say, zip your jib back up there,

713
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:24,220
chub. Well, in that case, it makes sense, doesn't it? Finally. Nip your jib.

714
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Well, I promised, I already told the beloved listeners that we unearthed the fossilized 45

715
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,560
records.

716
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,380
Les chroniques.

717
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,860
Yeah, the chroniques, not spelled with a K or an X, but with two sets of CHs, right?

718
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:50,380
Yes, we also tried to chronicle what was going on around us. We were kind of like a news band.

719
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,360
It was punk, but it was intelligent punk.

720
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,820
That's no way to make money, as I'm sure you guys know. No, you said that it was

721
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,720
like number one something in Deutschland.

722
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,280
In Deutschland, yes.

723
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,500
Both Netherlands and Germany.

724
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,660
In Deutschland and Deutschland.

725
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,400
Wow. That's impressive.

726
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:11,820
Yeah.

727
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,640
And also got some airplane in Great Britain and Ireland, too.

728
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,320
But what century was this we're talking about?

729
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,260
This was the 20th century. Late 20th century.

730
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Not that late, though, was it? Are you talking about like the 70s?

731
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,520
We're talking about the late 70s, yes, and early 80s.

732
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,020
That's when that old punk stuff was punking around.

733
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,860
Yeah.

734
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,040
First starting up.

735
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,840
We used to warm up for the pagans, who later became a famous relic.

736
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:44,980
Yes.

737
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,980
Of artifacts.

738
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,060
Yes.

739
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,140
Cleveland-oriented artifacts.

740
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,020
Most of the bands that opened up for me later became really, really famous, and now I have

741
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,920
to open up for them.

742
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,520
Yeah. Well, that's the...

743
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,740
Well, spoken word doesn't rock.

744
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,460
I'm starting laughing, but it makes me cry.

745
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Well, hey, at least you could...

746
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:05,980
Yeah.

747
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,460
At least you...

748
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,620
You learned how to play a guitar and can play a guitar and sing at the same time.

749
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,940
But we should play some of that.

750
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,440
We should play one of those for these listeners, shouldn't we?

751
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,180
Yes. Please.

752
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,120
Okay. This is from...

753
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,160
Oh, this is Test Tube Baby. Now, what was the news that was going on then?

754
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,160
That some doctor and his girlfriend, or not his girlfriend, but a woman met him at a party

755
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,760
and wanted to know if it was possible to do a Test Tube Baby, to create a Test Tube Baby,

756
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,440
and they went ahead and created...

757
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,880
They created one.

758
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:46,320
And it celebrated its universal anus, the first of never more, whenever that was, 30,

759
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,900
25 years ago or something like that.

760
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,880
Okay. Well, I'm going to play it, man. Here it goes.

761
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,960
Okay, man.

762
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,600
Here it goes.

763
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,040
Test Tube Baby. Test Tube Baby.

764
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,980
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe.

765
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,140
Test Tube Baby. Test Tube Baby.

766
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,000
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe.

767
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,940
Iceberg robots havin' nothing else to do.

768
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,560
They gotta have their babies.

769
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,420
But they don't wanna have children.

770
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,420


771
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,920
We'll make a fortune and he'll do all the work

772
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,780
Half a million dollars for a test tube job

773
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,880
Test tube baby, test tube baby

774
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,760
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe

775
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,800
Test tube baby, test tube baby

776
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe

777
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,700
Test tube baby, mama said

778
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,760
Test tube baby, mama said

779
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,640
Looking in the laboratory, safe on sterile shelf

780
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,520
A million possibilities for 14-footer cells

781
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,460
They don't count around the pony, they just don't have the space

782
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,400
But if you've got the money, you can start your own race

783
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,580
Test tube baby, test tube baby

784
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,400
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe

785
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,540
Test tube baby, test tube baby

786
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,440
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe

787
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,480
Test tube baby, test tube baby

788
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,460
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe

789
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,360
Test tube baby, test tube baby

790
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,340
Daddy said no, but mama said maybe

791
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,380
Whoa.

792
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

793
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,160
Man, I was pogoing so hard, my false teeth and hearing aids flew across the room.

794
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,480
That's what will happen to you when you listen to 35-year-old music.

795
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,040
Me-he, me-heek.

796
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,220
That was great, Dave.

797
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,380
I could hear your voice.

798
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,060
Yeah, I was singing on it, and Dan, psychopath, and Finder, Dean,

799
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,500
I don't know if he was in the band, but he wasn't the original drummer on that take.

800
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,420
He did play percussion on it.

801
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:43,500
And little tinny doorknob or tiny doorknob Tim Dorman became the bass player.

802
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:44,760
Wow.

803
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,200
And Bill Chronic Elliott was the other guitar player and played the lead

804
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,140
while I played the cluster vomit that is so regional and well-known to those who live around here.

805
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,140
And I played with myself.

806
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,480
Yep.

807
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,780
I didn't have a band.

808
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,620
And we wanted to write a song about it.

809
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,480
And you wouldn't.

810
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,140
You wouldn't let us.

811
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,460
You wouldn't let us.

812
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:08,760
Oh.

813
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,060
I didn't want everyone to know my dirty laundry.

814
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,820
You didn't mind showing it off on YouTube.

815
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,460
You certainly didn't.

816
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,300
I took it off of there.

817
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:20,660
Actually, they took it off.

818
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,800
After titillating the crowd with the noise of your elements,

819
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,960
then you reduced yourself to being a squandering sidekicker.

820
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,280
Man in the bushes looking on.

821
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,320
An Arnold.

822
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:34,620
Lurker.

823
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,140
Lurker.

824
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,740
Lurker.

825
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,480
Lurker.

826
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:37,500
Lurker.

827
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:37,800
Yeah, man.

828
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,860
An on-lurker.

829
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,440
Yeah, man.

830
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,160
Well, that was on a 45 record, what we just heard, right?

831
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,060
Mm-hmm.

832
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,820
A little plastic disc with grooves on it.

833
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:51,860
Yeah.

834
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:52,840
Yeah.

835
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:59,660
And what's weird is now that there are these bands that weren't, the kids weren't even alive,

836
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,120
and they're into archival stuff and everything,

837
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:04,480
they just weren't even able to get out and play.

838
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


839
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


840
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


841
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


842
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


843
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


844
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


845
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


846
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,480


847
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,840
And they collect vinyl, and they listen to this stuff.

848
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,720
And I said, how do you find this interesting?

849
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:18,480
And I realized that 30s and, you know, 40s and 50s music or 60s music even was interesting to me.

850
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,140
Yeah.

851
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:26,120
I used to dig up old 1920s and 30s blues records.

852
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,200
Yeah.

853
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,540
Because I just thought that stuff sounded great.

854
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,140
I used to listen to old, really old cowboy records and things.

855
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,580
Yeah.

856
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:33,620
Yeah.

857
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:34,960
And—

858
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,240
Well, I guess it does make sense.

859
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,240
You can be 28 and like this stuff even though, you know, it's over 28 years old.

860
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,320
Sure.

861
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,420
Sure.

862
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,320
Why not?

863
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,080
Right.

864
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,000
Nobody else is going to like it, but at least somebody does.

865
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,620
At least—

866
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:49,840
Yeah.

867
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:50,660
Oh.

868
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,220
Well, actually, I found the copies on YouTube.

869
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,200
It was real easy.

870
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,920
Somebody had, I guess, wanted to share it.

871
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,840
And they took pictures of the cover and the back cover

872
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,460
and the record.

873
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,360
And the record itself, so all those graphics were on there.

874
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,580
And Princess, well, you didn't see them, but they were—the back cover had a picture in

875
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,340
3D, a drawing in 3D.

876
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:21,720
And it was Dave and the—some former female that you had captured briefly.

877
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,740
I think I did see.

878
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,520
I think it was because I looked this up on the internets.

879
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,200
Oh, you did too?

880
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,480
Yeah.

881
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,100
Well, the 3D cover was of a test tube baby and some woman that was kind of like a Bob

882
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,920
Dobvish piece of graphic art at the time.

883
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,380
And then on the back, there was me as Lee Harvey Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby.

884
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:43,940
Yeah.

885
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,300
Oh, that was supposed to be you.

886
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,500
I thought one of the other people was supposed to be you.

887
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,960
Yeah, I colored in some hair because I was even balding then.

888
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,700
And so I, you know, just hid it a little bit.

889
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,660
Yeah, I know that I recognize the Lee Harvey Oswald, but that's all I read.

890
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,860
I didn't—and I thought the—like I said, I thought the other guy in there was you.

891
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,460
But the listeners can't see that.

892
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,400
But they can hear the flip side called Calling All Cardinals, right?

893
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:14,040
Right, which was created because some guy named Turkmani Alsassin or whatever his name

894
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,200
was tried to kill the pope.

895
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,800
Ah.

896
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:24,720
And then—so I think the pope actually died and somebody else became a pope and Lilith

897
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,660
became the popet, but that was a long time ago back in the pasture.

898
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,440
The popet.

899
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,240
Oh, man.

900
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,120
Yeah.

901
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,440
Back when they had popets.

902
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,180
Yeah.

903
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,880
Those special bras they—

904
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,380
And Eric Siren—I remember when the Germans were attacking, but they don't always attack.

905
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,780
Sometimes they recant what they've said.

906
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,100
Well, let's play Calling All Cardinals and see how that works.

907
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,980
I think that's this big button that says—with the P on it.

908
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:54,760
Ooh, it's wet.

909
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,320
Calling All Cardinals.

910
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,820
Better wear your knee protectors.

911
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,520
Calling All Cardinals.

912
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,260
Calling All Cardinals.

913
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,380
Calling All Cardinals.

914
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,640
You're a terrorist objective.

915
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,420
Calling All Cardinals.

916
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,240
Calling All Cardinals.

917
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,860
You gotta be a vote selector.

918
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,420
Calling All Cardinals.

919
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,540
Turn this plane around because there's something going down in Rome.

920
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,480
I gotta be there.

921
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,120
Turn this plane around.

922
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,540
They got a hostage on the ground in St. Peter's Square, so you better not be there.

923
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,920
Calling All Cardinals.

924
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,220
Make Rome your destination.

925
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,980
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

926
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,060
We can't stand investigation.

927
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,940
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

928
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,640
You know we plan all revelations.

929
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,160
Calling All Cardinals.

930
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,200
Get an actress, pay these dues, call the sequel, John Paul II will shoot and roam.

931
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,960
So you better be there.

932
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,620
We'll stage a big parade and invite the Red Brigades and their ski masks.

933
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,260
You won't see them laughing.

934
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,040
Calling All Cardinals.

935
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,160
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

936
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:25,240
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

937
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,100
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

938
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,900
Calling All Cardinals. Calling All Cardinals.

939
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:29,900


940
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,400
That was cool!

941
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,980
You could tell that was a baby Dave.

942
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,100
Oh, you could definitely tell that was a baby Dave.

943
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,100
It just hatched.

944
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,280
Part of it was the other guitar player singing there

945
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,640
who was saying the setups,

946
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,740
and I would get an actor to play these dudes,

947
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,560
and the other refrain chorus was mine,

948
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,860
and we all would sing together in harmony.

949
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,480
It was a B!

950
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,820
B!

951
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,600
Because that's the way it was done in those days.

952
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,980
Ronald Reagan and the Foresight Footballers

953
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,800
and the Jaco Mamey Orchestra,

954
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,820
all those people, that's where they got their starts.

955
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,660
It sounded great.

956
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,480
Among other things.

957
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,020
Yeah, I thought it had religious purpose.

958
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,040
The guy who used to be,

959
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,520
Don Novello used to be the father of Guido Sarducci.

960
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:32,820
Yeah!

961
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,220
I pitched him, and he sounded interested in that

962
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,780
Calling All Cardinals part,

963
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,240
but one of the crazed underground cartoonists

964
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,680
out there in Fairfax, California

965
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,140
throttled him and I both at the same time,

966
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,240
and I couldn't find his address or phone number anymore.

967
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,880
What sad throttling.

968
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:56,580
Yeah.

969
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:57,520
Yeah.

970
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,700
Yeah, I mean...

971
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,540
So, what's excruciating in your painful news area?

972
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,040
Oh, everything's...

973
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,380
I'm going to get an MRI scan next week.

974
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:15,040
We're all getting all kinds of surgeries and stuff.

975
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,760
I'm going to have...

976
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,180
I'm getting a hip replacement, a spine replacement,

977
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:25,980
a foot replacement, and both arms replaced.

978
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,400
And a Botox for teeth.

979
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,100
Treatment?

980
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,580
And, uh, yeah.

981
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,800
No, that's...

982
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,780
I would, but that's cosmetic,

983
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,000
and the insurance won't pay for it, so...

984
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,540
And if you think that's a lot,

985
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,860
I'm having twice as many body parts replaced as he is.

986
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:42,820
Yeah, that's...

987
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,140
I didn't want to...

988
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,160
I know, but...

989
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,700
Women have twice as many body parts as men do anyway,

990
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,060
just to start off with.

991
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,460
Right.

992
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,020
Thank goodness for that.

993
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,540
Just in our feet alone.

994
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,300
Well, I...

995
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,400
I...

996
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,340
I...

997
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,500
I...

998
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,520
I...

999
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,960
I...

1000
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,720
I...

1001
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:01,740
I...

1002
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1003
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:01,740


1004
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,840
Well, Dave, after that band, what band were you in?

1005
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,640
Was it the Strawberry Alarm Clocks, or the...

1006
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah, there was the Clark...

1007
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,740
The Clocks.

1008
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,420
The Clocks.

1009
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,700
Which, somehow, because another band in Chicago was named The Clocks,

1010
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,140
rather than fighting, duking it out with us,

1011
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,300
saying, we have proprietary interest in this name

1012
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,460
because we were before you,

1013
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,240
we thought we'd change it to Radio Alarm Clocks,

1014
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,240
which is too big of a mouthful to chew on

1015
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,420
if you've got the wrong kind of...

1016
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:28,940
gums.

1017
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,400
Well, you know, we knew a great solo performer called Man.

1018
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:34,980
Yeah.

1019
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,980
But it turned out there had been a British rock band called Man Forever,

1020
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,880
and he had to change to Man, Incorporated.

1021
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,180
So...

1022
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,680
And then, you know, back in the old days,

1023
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,440
there was poor old Reverend Buck Naked.

1024
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,260
He was a very early subgenius.

1025
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,860
Yeah.

1026
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,200
He had a band called Buck Naked,

1027
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:58,880
and the Jaybirds.

1028
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,880
But the problem was,

1029
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,240
there was another one in California

1030
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,900
that was a lot better known,

1031
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,500
and there was another one somewhere else,

1032
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,920
and another one somewhere else yet.

1033
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,040
Another Buck Naked and the Jaybirds?

1034
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,040
It's a pretty obvious name,

1035
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,540
especially if your name is Buck Naked.

1036
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,920
Of course, your band's going to be the Jaybirds,

1037
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,120
and there were at least four bands with that name

1038
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,900
until, I think, a homeless crazy guy

1039
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,080
killed the famous Buck Naked,

1040
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,180
and...

1041
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,120
And the infamous Reverend Buck Naked that I knew,

1042
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,840
the less said, the better.

1043
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,200
Yeah.

1044
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:39,700
Although he did do some wonderful subgenius hymns

1045
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,100
back in the ancient, ancient days.

1046
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,360
But thanks for the paltry governor,

1047
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,660
he was not a gobstink,

1048
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,340
and he was a real person.

1049
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,720
He was not one of those falsified articles de rue,

1050
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,560
as they call them in France, you know?

1051
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,900
Yeah, we're all real here.

1052
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,840
Real.

1053
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:58,880
Yeah.

1054
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,980
Not made of steel.

1055
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:01,760
Man.

1056
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,680
Too bad it's real, you know?

1057
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,420
It's so real, I'm not playing background music tonight.

1058
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,440
Did you notice that?

1059
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,100
No, I didn't notice that.

1060
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,580
No, it's just so real and just grindingly,

1061
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,200
grindingly real.

1062
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,120
I had a great thing to read from this

1063
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,060
Ian Banks sci-fi book,

1064
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,260
The Hydrogen Sonata.

1065
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,040
He wasn't the oldest man,

1066
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,280
but he imagined what the oldest man in the world

1067
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,340
would say about life, the universe, and everything,

1068
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,160
and it's really great.

1069
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,200
I might read it next week before the conference.

1070
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,940
It sounds beautiful.

1071
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,940
It will.

1072
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,860
But we have to get off the show fairly soon,

1073
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,280
although we started late.

1074
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,180
Yes.

1075
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,180
So I guess we could,

1076
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,620
I doubt if incoming show hosts in our time zone,

1077
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,540
which in here has to be Dr. Sinister,

1078
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,740
he's like the honey badger.

1079
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,740
He don't, you know.

1080
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,300
Yes, he don't give.

1081
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,520
So, yeah.

1082
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,860
Well, I was going to ask you if you might publish my book,

1083
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,260
but now if you're going to go in October,

1084
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,820
you probably won't be able to.

1085
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,480
No, I'll be more able to.

1086
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,520
In October?

1087
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,320
Yeah, just as able as I am now.

1088
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,820
Dave's talking,

1089
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,420
Dave wrote a science fiction novel,

1090
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,580
you might say,

1091
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,180
it's certainly not the standard kind.

1092
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,640
It's more of a Clockwork Orange-y kind of,

1093
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,040
not that it's anything like Clockwork Orange,

1094
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,840
but it's too science fiction what Clockwork Orange is.

1095
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,040
In other words, it's literature.

1096
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,560
And it's,

1097
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,540
our agent tried to get it printed,

1098
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,300
but they don't read books anymore.

1099
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,200
They will read e-books,

1100
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,440
and e-books are cheap to publish,

1101
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,540
because they don't actually exist.

1102
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,180
They don't exist on anything but a phone.

1103
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,020
And I just haven't learned how to do that.

1104
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,180
I'm still reading Moby Dick on my phone.

1105
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,440
It's the only book I have on there.

1106
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,440
Although apparently you can get books of the subgenius,

1107
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,960
but that's, we don't get, that's different.

1108
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,520
I have a plan to become an e-book publisher,

1109
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,800
and publish not just your novel,

1110
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,300
but one by a subgenius in Australia,

1111
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,640
and also our old stuff.

1112
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,520
150 old books.

1113
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,520


1114
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,520


1115
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,520


1116
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:27,520


1117
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,340
And I have old subgenius books that are out of print.

1118
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,520
And so, I just need to get to that.

1119
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,760
However, I have this weekly radio show

1120
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,940
that keeps infringing on my spare time.

1121
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,760
Have you ever known what that was like?

1122
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,220
To infringe upon your time?

1123
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:42,800
Yeah.

1124
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,080
Sure.

1125
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,740
And the summer festivals

1126
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,400
where we record the 100,000 hours of cool stuff

1127
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,780
that I then have to edit.

1128
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,580
So, we got a full plate.

1129
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:55,880
Yes.

1130
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,980
Praise Bob, though.

1131
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:57,520
We've got a full plate.

1132
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,080
We've got all those minions to help and do stuff for us.

1133
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:00,340
Yeah.

1134
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,660
Because we just love minions.

1135
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,640
We love followers and minions.

1136
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,420
Legions.

1137
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,000
And idiots.

1138
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,240
Useful idiots, we call them.

1139
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:13,720
Who'll, you know, do anything incompetently.

1140
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,800
I'm kidding, actually.

1141
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,920
We have no minions.

1142
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,700
We prefer to go without minions.

1143
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,840
We do have legions, though.

1144
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,500
We have legions of collaborators.

1145
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,920
We have legions of equals.

1146
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,900
He said we have legions.

1147
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:27,520
We do.

1148
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,540
And we have legions

1149
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,140
particularly of perfect mediation by the Legion.

1150
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,460
Yes.

1151
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:37,720
And maybe,和備 Circle

1152
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,440
Yeah.

1153
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:56,660
And especially legions of nawad 되지

1154
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:02,820
Yeah, well, that big organ, the dirtiest organ in my body, the right side of my brain,

1155
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:10,420
that was once there, now occupied by a very, very fat, belching, brain-eating amoeba.

1156
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,860
I'm glad she's not Belgian.

1157
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:20,660
Well, Princess We lost her left brain a long time ago, but between the two of us, we have one working.

1158
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,200
Right, a little duct tape, a little electrical tape, and you guys are on the, yep.

1159
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,240
Yep, held together with boogers, snot, and scotch tape, I'm sorry to say.

1160
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,220
It's Quote Mad Magazine.

1161
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,860
Oh, by the way, that rant I did at the very beginning of the show that the listeners heard,

1162
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,300
where I was going about, I got Bob on the brain.

1163
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:46,600
That was actually stolen from a song rant by the great Reverend Kenneth Huey,

1164
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,560
who did the cover, painted the cover of Book of the Subgenius, by the way.

1165
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,200
He was actually a woman for a while, wasn't he?

1166
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,380
No, no.

1167
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:54,920
No, you're.

1168
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,800
You're thinking of another Huey.

1169
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,680
No, this was St. Ken Huey anyway.

1170
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,820
I ripped him off.

1171
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,640
But now we have to go.

1172
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,320
It's time for the news, and I have to say that it's.

1173
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,280
This is the Hour of Slack, voice of the Church of the Subgenius, or one of them, actually.

1174
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,900
And you can find more at subgenius.com.

1175
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:21,640
And now, thanks to Fernanda Nandy-Lemur, we're going to go to the news.

1176
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,380
Bye, Dave.

1177
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,120
Praise Dave.

1178
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,000
I want to hear the news.

1179
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,520
Okay.

1180
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,480
Okay, I'll leave you on.

1181
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:25,820
Bye.

1182
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,860
Bye.

1183
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,260
Well, where's the news?

1184
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,300
I don't know.

1185
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,120
See, there you go.

1186
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,740
There you go.

1187
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,440
I just think I'm so slick.

1188
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,440
Right when you think you're right at the slickest moment, that's when you.

1189
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm the disaster.

1190
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:53,300
Growing evidence suggests that union separatists destroyed PR News days after the Dutch Civil Safety Aviation Organization supplied nearly 300 people.

1191
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,500
Growing evidence suggests that the Dutch Civil Safety Aviation Organization supplied nearly 300 people.

1192
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,580
Growing evidence suggests that the Netherlands were Dutch.

1193
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,560
Diplomats attacked a hospital today after firing rockets from a compound.

1194
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,600
John Kerry is fighting and trying heavy firing.

1195
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,100
Acclaimed PR News officials denied.

1196
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,920
The nation's just turned out to the neck of the year.

1197
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,040
First in the East, Growth Economic Directive cast forecast manuals.

1198
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,500
It's being cut as group rate tilt reflected.

1199
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:22,060
Today, the National Federation said it expects 3.6% rather than the PR News that initially forecast in Washington.
