1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
This is KNON 9.9 FM, Dallas.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,660
I'm Robert Wisdom, and you've been listening to the American Music Party.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,280
And get ready for the hour of slack.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,500
Please notify us.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,740
We're thrilled to be on the subgenius show.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,720
We're preparing to blast.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,160
Five.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,480
Four.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,160
Three.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,380
Two.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,280
One.

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,160
Rock it away.

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,260
Rock it away.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,100
Rock it away.

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:44,920
Rock it away.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,640
In our last episode, you may remember,

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,240
Sterno went completely out of control and would not shut up.

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,820
We finally had to wrestle him to the floor and continue without him.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,440
But today, we receive the poor, battered spirit of puzzling evidence

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,500
from the great Ukabalaponga beyond

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,280
and attempt to put him back together

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,720
using the latest in modern miracles of surgery and precision alchemy.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,900
Hello, I'm Dr. Howell,

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,340
and we'll be stumbling on through tonight's program,

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,180
putting together the ravaged corpse of our one-time Klonedam colleague and friend.

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,980
So without further delay, let's rock.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Rock it away and get down to that operating amphitheater

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,260
of the endless circus of horrors,

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,580
the circus of the soul,

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,320
the dark night of the soul bookstore,

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,840
and related agencies.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,960
In just eight minutes, the earth behind us looks like a giant.

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,460
Captain, captain, stop the rocket.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,300
I left my wallet in another suit.

37
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,900
It isn't in my pocket.

38
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,580
You won't need your wallet here.

39
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,860
A thousand miles from the atmosphere,

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,740
we're on the first moon rocket.

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,200
Stop that rocket now.

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:02,880
Stop it.

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,600
We're on the first moon rocket.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,020
I just don't know what we're going to do here.

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,100
Men will be traveling to the planets.

46
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,440
No, we won't.

47
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,060
Turn it off.

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,000
There are nine important planets circling our sun.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
We're going to look like this, Howell.

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,880
The subject is a 33-year-old male in good physical condition.

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,880
Here are the traumatic lesions which occasion the death of the subject,

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
and we are going to enter,

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,180
through the sternum first by snipping away the outer surface of the manubrium,

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,920
and pop the main ribs of the, well, the floating ribs to float down the Mississippi to the ocean.

55
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,580
Uh, let me see, has anyone got a, uh, uh, uh, one of those little shiny things?

56
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,900
Uh, it's off.

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah.

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,240
That's it.

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:55,760
Listen.

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,200
Listen.

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,100
Well, squeaky clean.

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,560
The only way to do a show.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,160
Woo!

64
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:00,940


65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,200
Woo!

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,200


67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,200


68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,200


69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,200


70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,200


71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,060
Hmm?

72
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,200
Hmm!

73
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,080
Hmm!

74
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:07,380
Hmm!

75
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:07,840
Hmm!

76
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:08,440
Hmm!

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,180
Hmm!

78
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:09,600
Hmm!

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:09,700
Hmm!

80
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,240
Hmm!

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,340
Hmm!

82
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,420
Hmm!

83
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,420


84
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,240
Hey, King.

85
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,660
Watch shaking.

86
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,680
My everything.

87
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,740
Come on!

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,620
Get up off that chair!

89
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,820
Follow me!

90
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,040
Ready?

91
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,660
Go!

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,620
The Soap Genius.

93
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,580
Our home.

94
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,480
What?

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,980
The Soap Genius.

96
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:29,980


97
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,780
We're staying up late for her, wouldn't you say?

98
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,940
Definitely.

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,520
Hey!

101
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,480
Hey!

102
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:41,980


103
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,400
Hey!

104
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,520
Hey!

105
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:43,900
Hey!

106
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,420
Hey!

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,440
Hey!

108
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,720
Hey!

109
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:45,920
Hey!

110
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,220


111
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:46,620


112
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:46,620


113
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:46,780


114
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:46,780


115
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:46,800


116
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,220


117
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,220


118
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,080
Hey!

119
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,120
Hey!

120
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,800
Hey, there you go.

121
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,360
Wow.

122
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,060
This is fantastic, guys.

123
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,200
You've got to love these.

124
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,260
Astounding!

125
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,920
Crazy.

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,680
Silly!

127
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,060
Tut, tut, tut, tut.

128
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,760
Stang, the...

129
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,980
The sexiest man on Earth.

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,880
That's it, baby.

131
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,100
A young Adonis who's irresistible to women.

132
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,760
Help me.

133
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
I can't wait a moment longer.

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
I've got to have sex with you.

135
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,380
That's what they all say.

136
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,360
Yes.

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,340
Those nasty girls out there.

138
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,620
Well, anyway, let's see.

139
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,320
I can just knock that one out

140
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
and be ready to flip this one in.

141
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
And dear friends, Merry Christmas

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,420
to all and to all a good night.

143
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,160
Oh, you know, I am tired of running full speed

144
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,040
all week and all weekend.

145
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,480
This is my second show tonight, dear friends.

146
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm going to do an interview

147
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,780
with a big FM rock and roll station

148
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,760
in Cleveland of all places.

149
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,980
There's a lot of sub-geni in Cleveland

150
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,700
and they're very vandalistic.

151
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,480
They put so much stuff up all over,

152
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,420
so many pictures of Bob up all over Cleveland

153
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,780
that we got a letter from the Cleveland Tribune

154
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
and the transit authority threatening to sue us.

155
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,420
Anyway, it was a great show.

156
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
It was like a phone interview in Cleveland

157
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,640
and there are a lot, we got a lot of hate calls.

158
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,980
There were a lot of friendly, unsaved people

159
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,000
who just didn't know about Bob before,

160
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,100
but were into it.

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,760
And then there were people who just plain didn't get it.

162
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,440
And then there were the hate calls.

163
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,580
It's funny how you get sub-genius,

164
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,880
you know, when you speak the true word of Bob

165
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,340
and really get down to business,

166
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,480
they get mad.

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,820
And we, when Buck and I were allowed to do the call-ins,

168
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,360
and it's a good thing we've done in a way,

169
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
we never got those hate calls.

170
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,920
We got very, very few.

171
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,820
And friends, I think that says something

172
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,440
about K and O-N listeners.

173
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,920
It says that you have sick minds.

174
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,120
You're a bunch of people that,

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,660
with sick minds, if you can put up with this show

176
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,560
and praise Bob.

177
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,980
Eey-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

178
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,160
But, oh, Christmas is a special time

179
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,040
in the sub-genius religion, just like all the others.

180
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,540
It's a time of slack, also called the season of turnover,

181
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,200
because it's near the nativity of Santa Claus.

182
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,840
And also, believe it or not,

183
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,460
Bob Dobbs was born on Christmas Day.

184
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,200
Not in this life.

185
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,840
As you know, there have always been Bobs.

186
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,420
And in his,

187
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,700
oh, 900-some-odd lifetimes,

188
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,640
Bob Dobbs, our great guru of the church,

189
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,740
of the sub-genius,

190
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,280
has happened to have been born on every day of the year,

191
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,960
which really makes every day Bob's birthday

192
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
and not only a good excuse,

193
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,760
but it makes it a law that you have to party, right?

194
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,740
But, friends, blessed, thank you, thank you,

195
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,420
for blessed are those who give,

196
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,760
and even more blessed, those who take.

197
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,340
And in that way,

198
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,840
I am thrice blessed,

199
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,700
because last week we actually did raise a good bit of moolah

200
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,940
for the pledge drive, $1,300 for the station.

201
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,520
Praise Bob!

202
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,980
We are on the air, thanks to you!

203
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,060
You right there who's sending the money,

204
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,280
and you right there who helped with the phones

205
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,560
and made brownies and so forth.

206
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,460
But you, uh-uh, no, not you, no, not you,

207
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,180
who decided he didn't have enough cash

208
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,880
to spare for Bob's religion and Bob's radio station.

209
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,240
Oh, no, no, you had other priorities.

210
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,320
What you gonna spend that money on?

211
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,900
Boy, cigarettes, liquor, liquor,

212
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,480
soundtrack album of true stories.

213
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,840
You gonna be hiding in a liquor bottle

214
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,520
come X day, my friend?

215
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,500
You think you, you there Mr. Pot Smoker,

216
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,760
you think you gonna hide in that reefer?

217
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,520
So I've got, that's right, I've got magic powers.

218
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
I see you sitting there with that joint

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,060
hanging out of your mouth.

220
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,580
Well, I hope you enjoy it, pal.

221
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,600
That joint could have gone to Bob,

222
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,680
and for all you know, he would have used that joint of yours

223
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,300
to clear up all the world's problems.

224
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,940
And you're the reason that there's still war

225
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,080
and hate and poverty.

226
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,100
Thanks, thanks so much.

227
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,120
Now friends, I'm gonna get on with the Christmas show.

228
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,740
This is actually a compilation

229
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,920
of last year's Christmas shows and a few other things.

230
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,260
But, but there's an important message that I have to impart.

231
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,960
And that is that we want to have a subgenius meeting.

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,180
Not a revival, not a revival,

233
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,660
but I wanna set up a meeting

234
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,040
with those of you, I keep getting calls from people

235
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,440
who want to, who want to help the church

236
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,720
in some way or another.

237
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,140
They wanna be involved with the show

238
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,200
or with Canoe Manor.

239
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,180
Do something, you know.

240
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,760
And, like I say, this ain't gonna be a revival.

241
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,740
It's not entertainment.

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,980
We wanna have a meeting for volunteers.

243
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,080
This is a non-profit situation.

244
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,580
Understand, you ain't going to be in for a big job

245
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,060
or nothing,

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,500
and not only that,

247
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,620
but we don't want everybody.

248
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,940
We don't want everybody.

249
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,440
We have to have sort of a screening, a test.

250
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,360
The problem, and I would tell you a time and a place to meet tonight, but I don't have

251
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,600
a place to meet.

252
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,700
We can't do it at my house for very obvious reasons to anybody who's ever been in the

253
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,000
evil subgenius castle.

254
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,340
Now, plus the fact that somebody there has chicken pot.

255
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,920
But if you out there, I'm going to play mostly tapes tonight, and if you out there want to

256
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,880
call me with the offer of letting us use your apartment, some single person out there probably,

257
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,480
although you know, somebody who's willing to have some people they don't know show up

258
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,240
at their place and meet the weird subgenius minister such as myself and some of the great

259
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,100
people we met at the parade, I need to set up a meeting, but I need a place to do it.

260
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,700
So call.

261
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,900
Call at 828-9500 or 823-7000.

262
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:09,900


263
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,020
823-7490 if you want to offer your place for a meeting place in the evenings sometime

264
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,260
after Christmas.

265
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,120
So at next show I can announce where the meeting's going to be because friends, this subgenius

266
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,360
thing has a lot of potential for actually giving people slack.

267
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,900
And if we had a little more help, a few more zombies, I think that we could really do something

268
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,600
for Bob and for the station.

269
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,040
This strictly subgenius thing.

270
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:47,120
But call me at 828-9500 or 823-7490 if you want to offer up your abode as a meeting place.

271
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,520
I really hope somebody calls.

272
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,740
I hope we get a choice.

273
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,720
And if I don't have time to talk, I'll take your number and call you back tomorrow or

274
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,620
something like that.

275
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:06,480
This is Reverend Ivan Stang at KNON 828-9500 or 823-7490.

276
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,700
Merry Christmas.

277
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:08,940
Merry Christmas.

278
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,020
Merry Christmas.

279
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,020


280
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,020


281
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,020


282
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,040


283
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,420
And we all welcome...

284
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
We're starting all over again.

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,120
We're broadcasting down here from the Biblical Arts Center down here at KNON Radio.

286
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,540
KNON Radio.

287
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,860
We're watching the slides of the city here and here, of course, is the John Fitzgerald

288
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,640
Kennedy Memorial at Main and Market Streets.

289
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,020
You're listening to KNON Radio, and it's going to be a great time to watch the video.

290
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


291
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


292
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


293
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


294
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


295
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


296
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


297
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


298
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


299
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


300
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


301
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


302
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


303
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


304
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,020


305
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,200
Buck naked.

306
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Myself, Doug Smith.

307
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,880
Who else will be on the show this morning?

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm real sorry.

309
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,020
We're having some technical difficulties.

310
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,920
We keep getting our show all tangled up with these other subgenius shows from Texas.

311
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,920
We're broadcasting live from Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.

312
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,920
This is some kind of a mix-up with our satellite communication system.

313
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,680
That's right.

314
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
We are having continuous mix-up.

315
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,880
How is view screen 2 over there?

316
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,840
Would you give me another signal there, Helswami?

317
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,700
Yeah, let me try this out here.

318
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,940
No, I'm not really picking you up.

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,560
We're going to have to...

320
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,760
I'm thinking as hard as I can.

321
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,400
All right.

322
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,560
We're just going to spread this microphone way out here.

323
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,760
Let me just try to...

324
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,640
Camera 2 doesn't seem to be working here in the station.

325
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:32,960
A little bit more.

326
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,620
There we go.

327
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,360
The cords have too much slack in them.

328
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, there's...

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,660
But can you hear me?

330
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,180
Friends, you know, there's never such a thing as too much slack.

331
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,980
Bring the trauma bar over here.

332
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,880
We'll apply some tension to this thing.

333
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,280
Ah, yes, friends.

334
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,780
Some emotional stress.

335
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,600
This is Doug Wellman, Reverend Doug Wellman, also known as Puzzling Evidence,

336
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,480
here with Gary Gbrook, friend.

337
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,940
Say hi, girls, Gary.

338
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,760
And from the east into outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth,

339
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,300
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

340
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,660
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

341
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:13,960
Sir, no.

342
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:14,840
No.

343
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,200
Apparently, all the others will have something to pay for in the afterlife,

344
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,120
or the before life, whichever comes first.

345
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,500
They'll all be paying.

346
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,220
But, friends, we, like I say, we constantly have technical...

347
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,980
That's what these shows are all about, is technical difficulties.

348
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,240
Swing with us.

349
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,180
Swing with us.

350
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,740
Swing with us.

351
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:36,740


352
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:36,740


353
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:36,740


354
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,720
Strunk.

355
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,080
The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.

356
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,400
Barbecue and bed salt separately.

357
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,480
You put it together.

358
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,860
Hey, guys, guys, what's listening to?

359
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,940
Pop music.

360
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,500
Snap, crackle, pop music.

361
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,460
God's approval no longer needed.

362
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,720
Approved by God since 1730.

363
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,560
Someone called in last week and said that they were going to give us a chance,

364
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,080
but it seemed too disjointed.

365
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,540
And, friends, it's true.

366
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,320
You do have to understand about the Church of the Subgenius to understand the show,

367
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,040
but you also have to understand the Church of the Subgenius

368
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,280
in order to have any satisfaction in any area of your life at all.

369
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,660
So that may sound like a big,

370
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,960
big claim, but it's true.

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,280
Just keep listening and you shall find...

372
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,820
I got a new explanation.

373
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,920
Uh-huh.

374
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,680
We could explain the jokes to them, but that wouldn't save your souls.

375
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,100
Reverend Wellman, I got a new explanation for the Church of the Subgenius.

376
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah, Gary.

377
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,480
Okay.

378
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,320
You know, everybody thinks the Church of the Subgenius started about 1953 or so,

379
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,240
but that's not true.

380
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,220
It's a lot older than that,

381
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,500
and it dates back to the first time a couple of kids cut up in church.

382
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,420
Amen.

383
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,080
Yeah.

384
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,160
That's down there at Belt Springs, right?

385
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,300
You're tuned in to the etheric airwaves, my friend.

386
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,260
Bob said about all that?

387
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,900
Bob said, if you have to ask, you're never going to know.

388
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,420
Bob is the lesson which cannot be taught.

389
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,560
Just open yourself up to Bob, friend.

390
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,600
Just feel the Bob energy.

391
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,880
Open up to the isness of the business, the very beingness of Bob.

392
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,320
Can you lean in there and breathe on that radio?

393
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,540
Can you suck that power off of Bob?

394
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,300
It's coming through.

395
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,160
It's coming through the air.

396
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,740
You need to put the...

397
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,160
Put your hands on the radio, directly on the speakers.

398
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,840
Are you doing that, friend?

399
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,500
Are you on...

400
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,660
Yeah, my hands on the speakers.

401
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:11,960
Okay.

402
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,520
Okay, now...

403
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,460
If you have an electrical socket nearby, urinate into it.

404
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,460
You are on the air.

405
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,020
I know two people named Bob, and I'm just confused which one is the real one.

406
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,060
There's many false...

407
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,900
It's the right one, the one on the right.

408
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
There is only one right Bob.

409
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,120
Friends?

410
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,240
Ah, yes.

411
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,480
Listen to that music.

412
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:33,940
It's...

413
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,620
Every show is a Christmas show on KNOA.

414
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,220
It's coming in for the next couple of weeks, and we'll be doing our lovely subgenius Christmas show, too.

415
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,220
Again, and this is another hour of flat Christmas show.

416
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,220
We, uh...

417
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:55,280
And we're gonna service, uh, also, not just the, the, uh, Santa Clausians out there, but also those of other faiths.

418
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,040
You have to have a different excuse to worship things and toys and new goods around Christmas time.

419
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,300
I hate steps of time.

420
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,700
We...

421
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,560
This is, I think, friends, will be the only show...

422
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,860
You're gonna hear Bob and the Dillentones, lovely version of, uh, White Christmas.

423
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,400
Friends, this is, this is Bob and his band, the Dillentones.

424
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,840
I think you should enjoy it.

425
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,100
We sleep on a fantasy house.

426
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,380
All the same.

427
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,500
Yeah.

428
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:23,780
Yeah.

429
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah.

430
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,560
Yeah.

431
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:26,860
Yeah.

432
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,120
Yeah.

433
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,140
Yeah.

434
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Yeah.

435
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,900
Yeah.

436
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,260
Yeah.

437
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,540
Yeah.

438
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah.

439
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:30,940


440
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:31,600
Yeah.

441
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,540
Yeah.

442
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,460
Yeah.

443
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:51,940
Yeah.

444
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,120
Yeah.

445
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Yeah.

446
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,600
Yeah.

447
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:05,960
Yeah.

448
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.

449
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,040
Yeah.

450
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,080
Yeah.

451
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,120
Yeah.

452
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,160
Yeah.

453
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,200
Yeah.

454
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,260
Yeah.

455
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:06,260


456
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,500
Yeah.

457
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,860
Merry and bright

458
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,980
And may all your Christmases be white

459
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,320
guitar solo

460
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,300
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

461
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,500
With every Christmas card I write

462
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,820
May your days be merry and bright

463
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,600
And may all your Christmases

464
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,920
All your Christmases

465
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,460
All your Christmases

466
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,520
All your Christmases

467
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,740
May all your Christmases

468
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
Be white

469
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,520
guitar solo

470
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,080
Dear friends, dear friends,

471
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,700
you wouldn't believe it.

472
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,940
But before I'd even finished talking a minute ago,

473
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,420
and see, this is going to save me

474
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,000
having to talk for the whole rest of this show.

475
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
The first call I picked up

476
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,500
was the perfect meeting place

477
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,080
for those who want to help out.

478
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,860
Now, that call was followed by about 20 others.

479
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,540
And I really appreciate all of that help,

480
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,620
you know, the offers of help.

481
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,360
Because there's a lot of,

482
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,000
you know, we do magazines,

483
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,240
we do all kinds of stuff.

484
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,000
And a meeting is what we need to have

485
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,180
just of the, the,

486
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,780
the worthy folks.

487
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,880
And next week I will be able to tell you

488
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,520
when and exactly the address.

489
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,840
This is, it's a nice centrally located

490
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,660
homey abode of a wonderful person

491
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,900
who we know well.

492
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,960
And of course, I'm sure the tough guys

493
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,600
of the church,

494
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,220
like,

495
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,380
the butt naked,

496
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:40,480
and Dr. Chaos and Reverend Zafod, all these big guys will be there to keep the sort of,

497
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,200
the mal-aligned normals who want to believe that they're subgeni in line.

498
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,100
And we'll have a mighty, mighty time there.

499
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,180
I'm going to go on with this Christmas show.

500
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,980
So if you have an offer of a place to hold the meeting, we don't really need one right now.

501
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,060
I'm going to get on with the tape.

502
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,640
I will answer the phone lines.

503
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Can't do it on the air.

504
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,260
But praise Bob.

505
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,780
It is turnover.

506
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,460
The time of the year when all things sell.

507
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,060
The end of the year sale.

508
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,940
Oh, yeah.

509
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,860
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

510
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,940
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

511
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,520
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

512
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

513
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,340
But the present subgenie.

514
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:39,000
We try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

515
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,280
Oh, yes.

516
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,260
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

517
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,680
And it was something else in between there.

518
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:54,880
Before it was after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

519
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,720
But I think they started a war over it.

520
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah.

521
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:57,820
Yeah.

522
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,140
Well, friends, we've got our own special Christmas carol.

523
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,980
That we're going to play.

524
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,740
That we're inventing as we go right now.

525
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,320
X is missed.

526
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,600
In the town.

527
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,300
Snap.

528
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,160
Damn.

529
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,980
That's some sound system.

530
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,380
Ho, ho, ho.

531
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,860
Ho, ho, ho.

532
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
Ho, ho, ho.

533
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,960
Ho, ho, ho.

534
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,700
Come one, come all.

535
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,080
From Bugs Bunny, Ewoks, C-3PO, and R2-D2.

536
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,500
Scooby-Doo.

537
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
Ho, ho, ho.

538
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,320
Ho, ho, ho.

539
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,240
Ho, ho, ho.

540
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,520
Merry Christmas to all.

541
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,340
They're so better.

542
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,660
Yes.

543
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,920
The Bright Zone.

544
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,000
You put it together.

545
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,860
The Bright Zone.

546
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,240
It's He-Bomb.

547
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,940
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius rice overthrow the evil normals with new Bob Dobbs action figure with rocket pipe.

548
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,700
What I wouldn't do.

549
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,440
From Bob Cobb.

550
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,780
Get new water cooling.

551
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,380
Ah!

552
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,000
He's starting to stand.

553
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,040
She gets a bite.

554
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,060
She's gonna play herself now.

555
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
She looks so proud.

556
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,280
Let's give her a hand.

557
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,620
That's my baby.

558
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,880
Up, upsy baby.

559
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,040
Upsy baby.

560
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,180
The doll that stands up.

561
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,120
She's new.

562
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
From Kenner.

563
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,540
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

564
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,480
We must buy our toys.

565
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:26,260
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

566
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,320
They will empower us to resist us.

567
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,120
You will be surprised.

568
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,120


569
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,480
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

570
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:46,460
It will be a Bobber for kids.

571
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:56,120
Do you understand and accept this lesson now?

572
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,980
For the usual.

573
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,100
You will be surprised.

574
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,100


575
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,700
You will be asked to tell if enough of yours and enjoy the forayer ritual.

576
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,540
For the troublesome struggles.

577
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:15,400
This λw play is all for you.

578
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,680
Review some pictures and it's not going down too sand.

579
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,880
It's a real place.

580
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,180
darlin bucks.

581
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,720
It's a property guy.

582
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,720


583
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,720


584
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,720


585
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,740
Girl.

586
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm edgesBox.

587
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,080
The Rob is so happy.

588
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,080


589
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,080


590
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,560
changing the dollar bills and back again.

591
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:46,340
Yes, but how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

592
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,360
Good has lots of muscles.

593
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,320
Good. Good!

594
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,360
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.

595
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:15,740
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires, latent in children,

596
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:24,300
brought out through the vehicle of this so-called pharmaceutical business.

597
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,300


598
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,140
This boy's at church.

599
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,440
That was not good.

600
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,100
Skull farmers, that's good.

601
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,320
I think that may sell to the humans.

602
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,380
Skull farmers, little white duck bobs.

603
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:51,260
Hundreds of little bobs, each whispering their messages in the night to the little children as they sleep.

604
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,040
Too much is all.

605
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,400
It's always better than not enough.

606
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,360
Too much is always better than not enough.

607
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,460
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much.

608
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,640
I'm going to have a shower.

609
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,280
When everybody sells,

610
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,980
we're all selling.

611
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,660
We all have something to sell.

612
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,820
Yes, everyone selling together, mighty symphony of prosperity.

613
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,420
Chocolatey pebbles from the new world.

614
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,980
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

615
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,380
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

616
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,940
Feeling spacey.

617
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,140
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles, now so chocolatey.

618
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,460
Smells cocoa-licious.

619
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,220
This cocoa like the world.

620
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,760
Oh yes, dear friends, Christmas, the season of turnover, when the shelves must be cleared.

621
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,180
I can't get that call right now, dear friends.

622
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:10,240
You know, I got, after all these friendly calls, I got one call from somebody who said,

623
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,860
what are y'all, the usual thing, the usual question, what are y'all trying to do?

624
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,100
And I go, hey, we're trying to give you some slack, okay?

625
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,580
You know, they go, who's Bob?

626
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,480
I said, well, give me your address, I'll send you some information or whatever, you know.

627
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,040
I'll give the number at the end of the broadcast.

628
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,700
And they, and this person, you know, I knew there was something that they weren't saying.

629
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:40,360
And finally, he goes, well, I just hope that, it was something like, I just hope that, you know,

630
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,900
you can get right with Jesus or something like that.

631
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,620
And just hung up.

632
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,360
He hung up.

633
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,640
That was the key point.

634
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,560
He said he didn't want to hear what I had to say back about that because, you know,

635
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:59,460
you see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

636
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,240
stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

637
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,820
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

638
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,660
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

639
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,560
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

640
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:19,620
but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy.

641
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,500
Is holy.

642
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:27,140
Is holy compared to the evil of some, not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists,

643
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,700
Charismatics, Evangelicals, etc., in general, of course, they and their corresponding types

644
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,680
in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,

645
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,820
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

646
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,080
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

647
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,800
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say,

648
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,380
our old drinking buddies got nothing against Jesus, it's just his fan club.

649
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,860
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

650
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,480
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

651
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,780
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

652
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,020
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

653
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,880
He doesn't even sneeze.

654
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,120
We're made in His image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

655
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,800
and we have to go in the secret room.

656
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,800
The bathroom.

657
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,020
To do awful things.

658
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,720
But God, oh, He's clean and pure, according to them.

659
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh, and He's male.

660
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,540
But He doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of Him like we do.

661
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,720
Because we sinned.

662
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.

663
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,600
We're bad, we're worthless, we're no good to God,

664
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,840
unless we sign a contract with His agent.

665
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,460
Well, friend, Jesus Himself, He spouted just about as many great punchlines as Bob.

666
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,200
Probably more.

667
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,980
But, and this is true, this is historical fact,

668
00:29:52,220 --> 00:30:00,900
the very early mainstream Christian church methodically censored about half of the existing gospels about Jesus.

669
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:10,540
And this is, I'm not kidding, you can go to any real bookstore and pick up the censored gospels that they finally found years later.

670
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:17,440
They took out the parts where Jesus specifically said that every person had equal access to the Lord,

671
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,060
and that you didn't need no preacher between you and Him.

672
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,300
That, in fact, was probably His main point, now lost in antiquity,

673
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,860
that you were the son or daughter of God just as much as Jesus was.

674
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,420
Or Bob, see?

675
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,960
But that's too humanistic for the conspiracy Christians,

676
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,940
so they wiped out the subgenius Gnostic Christians.

677
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,440
Anyway, I'm going to get off my soapbox.

678
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,640
We'll get into the hideous theological discussions.

679
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Coming up next week as we attack the Bobbies.

680
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:55,000
First I must play this cartridge, and then we'll go back to Christmastime.

681
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,440
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

682
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,180
Well, friends, what do you think?

683
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,760
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here,

684
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,440
or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

685
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,260
as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures?

686
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,540
We're each so separate, we're each so separate, we're each so separate, we're each so separate,

687
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,220
we're each so separate, we're each so separate, new from Tonga.

688
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,800
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

689
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,600
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

690
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,900
Shut up, pink boy!

691
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,640
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

692
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,880
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

693
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,240
Hi.

694
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,360
Santa.

695
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,280
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets.

696
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,260
Pipe, head launcher, Janeer device.

697
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,300
All Yakatizma, Fightin' Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

698
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,480
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

699
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,060
This toy falls apart in three days.

700
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,000
He-Bob!

701
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,040
And the bastards of the universe.

702
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,500
Too much is always better than not enough.

703
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,660
From Bob Dobbs.

704
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,800
Cool, right?

705
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,060
Seagulls can blow from head to toe.

706
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,580
Like Barbie, I'm pretty easy.

707
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,660
I don't understand.

708
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,320
Who are you?

709
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,000
And what's the big happening you're talking about?

710
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,480
And why are you holding me in this place?

711
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,200
I am Thurston Kilgore, scientist.

712
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,180
But soon I shall be Thurston Kilgore, master of the world.

713
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
Master of the world?

714
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,160
You've got to be kidding.

715
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,880
Kidding?

716
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,820
Not at all.

717
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,780
You see these television screens?

718
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,460
I'll turn on number one.

719
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,740
What do you see?

720
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,800
The White House.

721
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,940
The Christmas tree on the lawn.

722
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,800
And here's number two.

723
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,900
Now, what do you see?

724
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,900
I'm not sure.

725
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,180
Looks like, yeah, a missile at a rocket site.

726
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,100
Very good.

727
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,320
That rocket, by the way, is ready for immediate launching

728
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,900
and carries a payload of five nuclear warheads,

729
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,160
each 100 times as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb.

730
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,880
But what has this got to do with...

731
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,820
Patience, young man.

732
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,820
But the only person authorized to push the button is...

733
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,060
Yes?

734
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,200
The President of the United States.

735
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,420
Precisely.

736
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,260
But we're not at war, and he's not about to push that button.

737
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,180
Quite right.

738
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Not that button, and not knowingly.

739
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,440
But there are buttons and buttons.

740
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,220
I still don't...

741
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:24,100
Like the button that will turn on the lights on that beautiful Christmas tree.

742
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,200
On the White House lawn?

743
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,180
Right.

744
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,360
You mean to say that button is tied into the rocket launch system you just showed me?

745
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,020
Now you're getting it.

746
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,040
It's tied in by a remote control circuit I secretly installed.

747
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,600
And when the President pushes the button that lights the tree...

748
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,160
...who knows?

749
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,960
Good Lord.

750
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,100
You hear the thunder here?

751
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,420
When I feel the punch here?

752
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,300
Feel the punch.

753
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,560
Thunder Punch.

754
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,120
He-Man, new from the Masters of the Universe collection.

755
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,580
Skeletor and Castle Grayskull, each sold separately.

756
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,160
But toys for the young and wrestling pub will return.

757
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,380
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe will be back after this message.

758
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,020
Santa Fe.

759
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,320
Oh, my Lord.

760
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,740
I love him.

761
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,560
I adore him.

762
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:25,400
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all.

763
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,200
And we do...

764
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,100
We're gonna...

765
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,680
We're gonna seriously address this issue.

766
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,960
But in the meantime...

767
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,040
We have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?

768
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,900
Were there any readings here on the Santa Bob?

769
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,000
Didn't you have I'm-a-Bob on the show last week?

770
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,760
No, that was the show before and we had to pay...

771
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,620
Yeah, that's right.

772
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,100
That's right, we did have the I'm-a-Bob on the show last week.

773
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,900
Uh, that's a...

774
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,380
The He's-a-Bob and the You're-a-Bob.

775
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,880
Santa Bob and the Lena.

776
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,940
But you know, we ought to talk a little bit about Where-Bobs and I'm-a-Bobs tonight, Reverend Stang.

777
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,900
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Room Stang.

778
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,360
The Where-Bobs and I'm-a...

779
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:12,020
Those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

780
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,020
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

781
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,600
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

782
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:28,400
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

783
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,800
And they stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.

784
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,440
Well, friends, it's tough.

785
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,980
And, you know...

786
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,740
You...

787
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,740
Just...

788
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,580
Just going to church ain't enough.

789
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,220
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.

790
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,300
As a matter of fact, I...

791
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:53,840
The people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

792
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,820
Can you believe that?

793
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,880
They asked...

794
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,120
The kids were asking if their parents...

795
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:03,040
If maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

796
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,460
And the mom said, no, no, he won't.

797
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,960
Because he bills us.

798
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,000
We can't afford that.

799
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,100
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

800
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

801
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,680
Yeah.

802
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,300
What kind of a Christmas season is this where Santa Claus is starting to bill you?

803
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,260
And the delivery.

804
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,180
Can you imagine the delivery costs of bringing that stuff up from the North Pole?

805
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,980
That's going to be added on too, friends.

806
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,960
When everybody sells...

807
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,080
We're all selling.

808
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,760
But we all have something to sell.

809
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,600
Yes, everyone selling together mighty symphony of...

810
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,500
Bob will return.

811
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,260
Be Bob and Claus.

812
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Here's Verbot, a robot you can program to perform eight different functions.

813
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,920
Go right.

814
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,560
Take a jump.

815
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,900
You can control Verbot with your own voice.

816
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,260
Go left.

817
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,160
Verbot, I said left.

818
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,480
He'll obey your commands.

819
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,280
Verbot, speak.

820
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,480
Four AA, two 9-volt and two C batteries not included.

821
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,020
C batteries not included.

822
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,940
Four AA, two C batteries not included.

823
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,680
C batteries not included.

824
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,260
Mission accomplished.

825
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,760
The prince is satisfied.

826
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:18,840
Yeah.

827
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,420
Verbot, a voice-activated robot.

828
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,140
Oh, yes, dear friend.

829
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,980
Season's greetings from all of us at the K-N-O-N.

830
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,540
Launch the heat seekers.

831
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,980
We must destroy those evil humans.

832
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:48,020
Well, friends, so Christmas has become a lovely sort of hideous mix of sensitive music and...

833
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,280
Your gift of $50 will mean so much.

834
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,100
Friends, $50 to the church of the subgenius.

835
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,400
And Jim and Tammy want to give you Susie Moppet.

836
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,160
It'll bless a church.

837
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
And this little K-N-O-N.

838
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,900
You pulled a string at the back of his neck.

839
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,800
I'm sure everyone wants to know what did you do with the $31,000 you won.

840
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,160
Well, this $31,000, friends, goes to the home for a surplus.

841
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
And last, the control room.

842
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,620
No, stay out of here. This is a control room.

843
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,040
And what have we here?

844
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,420
I think we've got a phone call.

845
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,140
Everything's soggy.

846
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,860
Everything's soggy all over the place.

847
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,580
Hello?

848
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:23,900


849
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,400
Huh?

850
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,940
Hi, girls.

851
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,680
Hi, girls.

852
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,420
Hi, girls.

853
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,300
No wonder...

854
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,700
You know...

855
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,460
The spiked studded armor of the mighty Spike-O.

856
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,140
You know, part of the reason...

857
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,640
Part of the problem with doing any kind of a call-in thing around here is that...

858
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,440
Well, of course you can't.

859
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,160
We have a lot of trouble finding...

860
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,680
Digging our way through the sound effects and getting to the actual telephone.

861
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,640
No one will dare oppose us.

862
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,480
No one.

863
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,840
Remove that man.

864
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,980
We will remake every government in the world in our image.

865
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,700
And those that oppose us.

866
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:17,840
So, I guess it's time to just let it go.

867
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,400
Of course.

868
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,560
That's right.

869
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,100
Let's take care of it.

870
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,880
Yes, sir.

871
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,420
Okay.

872
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,260
See you.

873
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,320
Thank you.

874
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,320


875
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,360
Goodbye.

876
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,080
Bye-bye.

877
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,220
You're welcome.

878
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,600
Bye-bye.

879
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,600


880
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,600


881
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,600


882
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,600


883
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,800
Goodbye.

884
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,040
Goodbye.

885
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


886
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


887
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


888
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


889
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


890
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


891
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


892
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


893
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,040


894
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,060
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance.

895
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,640
We're down here at Reunion Tower.

896
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,440
I hate that demon.

897
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,440
Desperately.

898
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,020
I know, Gary.

899
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,680
We need those demons to go on the air.

900
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,720
They're part of the exciting new show.

901
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,540
Ah, there we go.

902
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,180
Well, we're mighty glad to be here on non-radio tonight

903
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:02,420
because we know that other station is trying to get rid of us.

904
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,460
Hey, non-radio.

905
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:03,940
That's right.

906
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,420
Non-radio for Central Texas, South Texas, East Texas, some Texas.

907
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,700
That's right.

908
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,360
Radio Nunu Narnini.

909
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,700
Yes, Nunu, here we are in the cult of Nunu and Narnini.

910
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,680
And Ivan.

911
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,880
Yes.

912
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,300
I hate that demon.

913
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,600
Oh, I forget.

914
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,080
That's right.

915
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,160
My name is Ivan Stank.

916
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,180
That's right.

917
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,660
And my name is Ivan Naked.

918
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,340
And my name is Mobius Rex, or my name ain't puzzling.

919
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,020
I never dance.

920
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,380
That's right.

921
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,740
So you won't be getting that part of the tape.

922
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,900
And we'll be leaving that part of the tape for the listeners.

923
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,380
To them.

924
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:42,740
To them.

925
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,980
We'll probably be calling California.

926
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,520
Like an conspiracy.

927
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,200
Later in the day.

928
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,480
Yeah, we'll be calling.

929
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,180
We'll be calling.

930
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,580
Actually calling up those doctors, those crazy doctors.

931
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,240
That's right.

932
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:52,780
In California.

933
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,200
Who have the most crazy doctors.

934
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,020
Their show.

935
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,220
That's right.

936
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,600
You're listening to the hour of slack.

937
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,420
But if you were listening to more than an hour, less than a show right now,

938
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,800
you'd be a lot more entertained than you are here from these stupid little doctors like us in Texas.

939
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,360
That's right.

940
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,240
And I'll put it as a question because then the FCC can't do it.

941
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,800
Is this KNON?

942
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Well, yes, it is a question.

943
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,240
Is this KNON?

944
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,840
Is this non-radio?

945
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,920
Well, is this a lot of confused people driving around the highway right now going,

946
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,820
Oh, no, I knew I should have taken that turn in Arkansas.

947
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,580
Now I'm in Dallas.

948
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,380
I should have taken that pill in Arkansas and I wouldn't have been here.

949
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,640
Ladies and gentlemen, it's awfully hard to remember when to take those pills when you're in Arkansas

950
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,380
because there's so many pills to take there.

951
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:45,440
I was working at Las Colinas last night on a conspiracy media church tape.

952
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,100
All those, yeah.

953
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,920
Well, I was getting paid, too.

954
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,220
It was real good work, but I thought I have forsaken my church.

955
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,940
I have forsaken the church of the subgenius and I have hurt those around me

956
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,040
because here in Dallas,

957
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,740
it's not so easy to be a subgenius.

958
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,500
Hey, listen, we had to rush back here from Las Colinas, too.

959
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,440
We had to jump in the car and get back here in time to do this show.

960
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,720
It's about 1130 now and we'll be going for another hour.

961
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:16,980
That's right.

962
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,760
It's about 1130 now.

963
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,240
It's about.

964
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,300
Just almost.

965
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,200
Oh, here's some.

966
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,620
Yeah, money's all over the station here.

967
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,000
Is it a...

968
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,700
Non-radio.

969
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,700
Hey, Ivan, is it wrong to tell the wrong time on the radio?

970
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,660
No, no, it's only illegal to use your...

971
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,140
Okay.

972
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,260
Okay.

973
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


974
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


975
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


976
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


977
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


978
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


979
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


980
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,420


981
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,540
It's 1.45 a.m. right now, folks.

982
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,580
We're all late for work.

983
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,660
Come on, don't confuse people.

984
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,640
You're going to be listening on the radio and probably two people crashed right now as you said that,

985
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,660
thinking, I'm late, I'm late.

986
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,840
Live from Plano.

987
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,360
I hate that demon.

988
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,620
What's going on here?

989
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,580
That time demon.

990
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,860
Is that that time demon?

991
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,060
That time demon that be on your back.

992
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,040
I came down to the station and I found out I wasn't even me anymore

993
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,140
and I found my real self passed out in a room full of pills.

994
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,400
What's going on?

995
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,780
What's happening?

996
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,020
A giant piece of live meat hanging out of my jaws.

997
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,600
Yep, that sounds like me too.

998
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,760
I hate that demon.

999
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,220
Sam is on a diet.

1000
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,920
Now he has to eat...

1001
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,440
...stupid candy canes.

1002
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,180
.

1003
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,180


1004
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,180
.

1005
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,760
.

1006
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,020
.

1007
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,960
It all started when he accidentally sat on one of his elves

1008
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,880
and turned him into smelly elf soup.

1009
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:52,260
As punishment, he was forced into exile to a San Fernando Valley health spa

1010
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,640
where they forced him to take off his clothes and embarrass him

1011
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,740
and he grazed him in front of people.

1012
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,820
his reindeer, who fled in confusion and hung her into the sky.

1013
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:16,580
Luckily, his famous white beard was long enough to cover his tiny penis, which had gone soft

1014
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,080
in the cold shower.

1015
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,900
Everyone had to leave the steam room so Santa would have room to sit down.

1016
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,420
Some idiot threw him a medicine ball, but it bounced off his belly and knocked down

1017
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,280
the wall like the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge.

1018
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,500
When he got home, nobody recognized him.

1019
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:54,760
Instead of the chimney, he could fit through a keyhole like a skeleton key.

1020
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,120
The next morning, Santa was back in the house.

1021
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,760
Friends, that was Zug's Rift.

1022
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,240
Zug's Rift.

1023
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,640
I think it was off the Mini Mastodon's album.

1024
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,080
I'm not sure.

1025
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,680
Good old Zug's Rift.

1026
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,420
You ought to look for his stuff in the record store.

1027
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,720
He deserves your support.

1028
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,080
And you ought to hear the stuff that I can't play.

1029
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,320
It's like the Subgenius tapes.

1030
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,020
You wouldn't believe what's on the Subgenius tapes that I can't play.

1031
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:23,800
Anyway.

1032
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,300
Yeah.

1033
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,820
I'll tell you what, friends.

1034
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,240
There's been all sorts of serious problems in the Church of the Subgenius,

1035
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,500
many of which include trying to find the right equipment in the radio station

1036
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,300
with so many confusing issues at hand,

1037
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,600
including whether or not the Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry

1038
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,060
that day on the Mount of Skulls,

1039
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:55,700
or whether...

1040
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,940
the over-modulation can be helped at some time in the far future.

1041
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,580
So, friends, this is a song by...

1042
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,680
Oh, I see.

1043
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,680
I can control the hiss that comes in and out of here.

1044
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,440
Learned how to control the hiss.

1045
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,120
We can now control the hiss.

1046
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,960
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled

1047
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,480
by subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.

1048
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1049
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1050
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,500
But, uh...

1051
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:26,880
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1052
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:26,880


1053
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,220
I said earlier, we've got to minister not just to those who are celebrating Christmas,

1054
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,400
but those who are also celebrating the pagan solstices.

1055
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:41,000
This is a tune by Magic Mosen and his royal rockers.

1056
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,640
I doubt if you've ever heard this one.

1057
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,300
It's a pretty obscure one.

1058
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,840
But this is Blind Sam, a great old Blind Sam,

1059
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,560
and Reverend G. Andrew Maness of the Church of the Subgenius.

1060
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,500
I believe this was a live cocktail lounge song,

1061
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,180
for those who believe.

1062
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,420
For those who try to believe.

1063
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,080
For those who must believe or die in the case of this church.

1064
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,000
Smooth, baby.

1065
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,080
This is a smooth, professional mix here.

1066
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,440
Say, do we have any druids in the audience?

1067
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,040
Well, hi, yeah.

1068
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,560
This one's for you.

1069
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,460
That's nice.

1070
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,400
Have your...

1071
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,140
...souls.

1072
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,260
A groovy little solstice.

1073
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,260
Mithras won his fight.

1074
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:50,880
From now on, the days are longer than the nights.

1075
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,260
Mm-hmm.

1076
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:06,360
Yeah, have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

1077
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,480
Nosh out on druid food.

1078
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,580
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves.

1079
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:23,540
Then we'll all dance naked in a fair shoe.

1080
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,600
Ooh.

1081
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,480
Ooh.

1082
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,480


1083
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,480


1084
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,480


1085
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,480


1086
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,480


1087
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:26,480


1088
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:26,600
Ooh.

1089
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,220
If you are a dazzling urbanite.

1090
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,660
A smug suburbanite.

1091
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,060
Hey, that's true.

1092
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,340
Ooh.

1093
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,480
You don't have to lead a boring country life.

1094
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,840
To groove on natural life

1095
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,900
As a woo

1096
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,560
Someday soon

1097
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,140
We'll all dance nude together

1098
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,120
If utility rates allow

1099
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,860
You know, those funky Boston Edison guys, you know

1100
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,000
Until then

1101
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,740
We'll don our ritual robes and bow

1102
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:47,320
To have ourselves a groovy little

1103
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,000
Big deal, big deal, big deal

1104
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,180
Scott, you made your choice

1105
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,780
When you rejected my word, you rejected me

1106
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:09,520
And to your eternal soul

1107
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,140
You have found that only could you afford

1108
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,140
To give to God that which was his

1109
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,360
But you could not afford to do otherwise

1110
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,780
The Senate still stands

1111
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,840
From the bottom of my heart

1112
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,480
To do without our darkness

1113
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:30,360
Where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth

1114
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,940
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir

1115
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,300
I don't want to go to hell, sir

1116
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,400
No, no

1117
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,980
Thank God I don't want to go to hell

1118
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:43,340
No

1119
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,900
No

1120
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,740
Live as he could be

1121
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,000
And the children saved

1122
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,560
Who could laugh and play

1123
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:54,840
To the world

1124
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,880
of the same earth, you and me.

1125
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,280
The talebearer will be at the judgment.

1126
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,360
I suspect that here

1127
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,420
will be a special place in hell

1128
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,320
for such beings.

1129
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,400
David the psalmist said in

1130
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,320
Psalms 15, 1 and 3,

1131
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,380
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle,

1132
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,340
who may dwell on thy holy mountain,

1133
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,620
the man of blameless life,

1134
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,040
who does that which is right

1135
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,580
and speaks the truth from his heart.

1136
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,040
Who has no malice on this tongue,

1137
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,620
who never wrongs a friend

1138
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,580
and tells no tale against this man.

1139
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Thank God.

1140
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,900
There will be those who in their malicious tongue

1141
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,900
have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.

1142
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,780
These gossipers will be cast

1143
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,380
into the lowest, darkest pit of eternity.

1144
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,660
They're going to be cast

1145
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,760
into the pit.

1146
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,140
Mommy?

1147
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,140
Why do my feet hurt so bad, Mommy?

1148
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,060
Pastor Naked?

1149
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,020
I mean, Dr. DeBrogue, friend,

1150
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,260
if you need to do your public service messages,

1151
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,920
this is a good time to do it.

1152
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,440
We can...

1153
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,040
We can...

1154
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,680
Oh, wait, we got a phone call.

1155
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,220
Listen, dear friends.

1156
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,640
Yeah.

1157
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,640
Is...

1158
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,940
Oh, no.

1159
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,380
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife

1160
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:19,060
by a band called Mechanical Sterility.

1161
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,760
The singer, I think, is Reverend M. Schaefer.

1162
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,520
The pastor of the Church of the Subgenius.

1163
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,340
Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.

1164
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,500
Ah, yeah.

1165
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,200
Santa Claus is coming

1166
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,720
to rape your wife.

1167
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,520
Santa Claus is coming

1168
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,640
to rape your wife.

1169
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,500
He's got a gun.

1170
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,140
And he's got a big knife.

1171
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:34,180
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

1172
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,480
guitar solo

1173
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,400
guitar solo

1174
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,680
guitar solo

1175
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,660
guitar solo

1176
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,280
guitar solo

1177
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,280
guitar solo

1178
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,680
Santa killed off all his elves

1179
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:06,800
Cut off their heads and put them up on the shelf

1180
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,940
Rudolph's cold in the freezer

1181
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,780
Packed in separate baggies

1182
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,080
Christmas causes disappear

1183
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,360
Is that blood in Santa's beard?

1184
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,660
Christmas time again I fear

1185
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,760
Christmas time again I fear

1186
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:47,760


1187
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,920
When should we sing?

1188
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,660
And what time the bell should ring

1189
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,420
columns and rows of houses

1190
00:54:59,420 --> 00:54:59,420


1191
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,700
Dedicated day is awarded It isnaires

1192
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,240
No this wasn't Merry Christmas

1193
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,600
It is surviving too far but alguien

1194
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,720
Difficult powdered to explain where they came from

1195
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,940
Santa cooked up a mean reindeer stew.

1196
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,860
Daughter and Gibson.

1197
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,020
And Rudolph too.

1198
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,540
Quite tasty.

1199
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:53,820
Oh, dear friends, that's Reverend Schaefer doing Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife.

1200
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,740
Just wanted to get you all into the Christmas spirit, you know.

1201
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:04,500
And actually, once again, the evil subgenius castles, but the only one in the block with Christmas lights up.

1202
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,420
Actually, that's not true.

1203
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,000
This time, there were a few others, you know.

1204
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,540
But, well, friends, you know, like I said,

1205
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:20,060
next week on this show, I'm going to announce the place and time of a meeting

1206
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:25,920
of those who would like to help disseminate the word about

1207
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:34,000
we need drivers, typists, menial slaves, people who own Macintosh computers.

1208
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,200
That's a very important one.

1209
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,840
And just, you know, mutants. Mutants, baby.

1210
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,580
I'm going to announce that time and place so that I can finally,

1211
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,040
I've finally gotten over the fear of the Dallas bobbies.

1212
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,880
I've run into so many people that were like,

1213
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,960
oh, man, I don't want them to know who I am.

1214
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,060
Don't want to know where I live.

1215
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,760
But there's more and more and more.

1216
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,620
Finally, the true, the true subs are coming through.

1217
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,500
And I was surprised the other day, found out that if,

1218
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,160
if you're looking for a last minute Christmas present,

1219
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,580
and I can say this because I don't get royalties off these because of,

1220
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
it's a long story.

1221
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:14,880
I'm not going to say anything else.

1222
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,920
You can get the Bob Dobbs t-shirts at Lone Star Comics,

1223
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,320
and they are heavy K-N-O-N supporters.

1224
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,080
They're all over town.

1225
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,080
But at the same time, you have to remember.

1226
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:30,240
Oh Bob, it's been a long time, Bob, since you've been back.

1227
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,520
Have you got my answers?

1228
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,600
Did you bring my slack?

1229
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,000
I got a few extra questions and a special wish.

1230
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,920
I got a whole lot of problems.

1231
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:44,700
You could help me.

1232
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:44,700


1233
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:44,700


1234
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:44,700


1235
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,060
Help me with all Bob.

1236
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,800
Oh, thanks Reverend Erickson.

1237
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,180
Hello Bob.

1238
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,760
Glass Madness.

1239
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,760
It's been a long time, Bob.

1240
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,700
But friends, if you've been missing Bob,

1241
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,400
Nice to see you back.

1242
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,180
you can write to Bob and write for information on just what,

1243
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,440
what in the world we're trying to do here.

1244
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:01,800
Let's throw your slack.

1245
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,400
And what slack is.

1246
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,560
And now I got no problems that I can't solve.

1247
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,700
I'm a Bob Dobb doctor and I'm having a ball.

1248
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,660
Hello Bob.

1249
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,060
And all you have to do is,

1250
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,660

This is the, this is the number to write to Bob at P.O.

Box one four oh three oh six Dallas, Texas seven five two one four.

Send no money.

1258
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,000
Dear friends, just ask for the information and you'll see just what else there might

1259
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,920
be available.

1260
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,100
Oh yes.

1261
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,340
That was.

1262
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:47,040
Reverend Jim Erickson of Glass Madness.

1263
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,600
Ah yes, that old hymn.

1264
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,980
And now for the news.

1265
00:58:59,060 --> 00:58:59,660
Hurricane Bob.

National Weather Service, Miami, Florida.

1268
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,640
