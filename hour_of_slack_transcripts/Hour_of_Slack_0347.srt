1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,880
LSD doesn't control anyone's mind. It may actually work in the opposite. It may uncontrol your mind.

2
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,980
But control your mind for what? Control your mind for where?

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,720
The Self Genius Hour of Swatch.

4
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,860
But what do we really know of freedom? My God, of real freedom.

5
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,880
Freedom was offered to you. You'd run for cover. You'd hide. You'd be terrified.

6
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,860
But I thought I was free. I mean free to do whatever you pleased.

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,900
What if I followed my every instinct completely? You mean absolutely no rules? No laws?

8
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,960
No laws. No proprieties. No holds barred. I see a piece of food I want, I take it.

9
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,140
Henry, please. I see a woman I want, I take her as well.

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,840
Hold on, Jekyll. You all act as if our manners are the same.

11
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,260
Some morality were handed down to us by God. But they are.

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,620
No, madam, they're not. We made them up by mutual agreement. But what if I don't agree? What then?

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,260
I clap you in irons and throw you in prison. Straight off.

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,660
You'll have to catch me first.

15
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,320
I am the sex goddess of the western hemisphere. So don't mess with me.

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,320
I got a big bag full of sex toys and you can't have any.

17
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,700
Cause they're all mine. Because I'm the sex goddess of the western hemisphere.

18
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,360
Hey! You may say to yourself, who the hell is she trying to kid?

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,460
She's no sex goddess. But trust me, I am.

20
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,840
I am the sex goddess of the western hemisphere. Hey! You may say to yourself, who the hell is she trying to kid?

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:26,840


22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,000
She's no sex goddess. But trust me, I am.

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,440
If only for the fact that I have the unabashed gall to call myself a sex goddess.

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,200
I mean, after all, it's what so many of us have at some point thought we've all had.

25
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,180
Somebody who worshiped our filthy socks and walked like a dog when we were near.

26
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:50,080
Giving us cause to pause and think, you know, I may not look like much, but deep inside, I am a sex god.

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,920
Only we'd never come out and admit it publicly.

28
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,080
Well, that is, you would never come out and admit it publicly.

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
But I will. Because I am the sex goddess of the western hemisphere.

30
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,140
I haven't always been a sex goddess. I used to be just a mere mortal woman.

31
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,240
But I grew tired of the pathological implications of sexuality as they manifest in our culture.

32
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,880
I grew tired of the late-night 900-number ads where three bodacious bimbettes

33
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
heave cleavage into the camera's winking lens and sigh.

34
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,600
Big girls, ooh. Blonde girls, ooh. Bad girls, ooh.

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,800
You know what to do. Call 1-900-unmitigated-bimbo.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,320
Ooh, yeah, I got tired of the ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

37
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:42,420
I got fed up with it all and I put on my combat boots and hit the road in my bag full of sex toys.

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,060
They were a vital part of my sex goddess image even though I would never actually use my sex toys.

39
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,220
Because my being a sex goddess, it isn't a sexual thing. It's a political thing.

40
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,960
I'm a political sex goddess. I don't actually have sex.

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,920
Because I'm too busy trying to take care of important sex goddess business.

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,160
Yeah, I gotta go say outrageous and sexual things to the press.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,420
Yeah, I gotta go on Donahue and Dennis Miller and make buckets full of money off my own inane brand of pop psychology.

44
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,100
Because my pain is different. Because I am a sex goddess.

45
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,980
And when I talk, people listen. Why? Because you guessed it.

46
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,000
I am the sex goddess of the western hemisphere and you're not.

47
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,780
At last I have control of your radio tubes.

48
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,360
And I do too.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,980
Good. This is Ren Huak.

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,140
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,200
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

52
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,240
Keep listening, you idiots.

53
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,740
Else I shall kill you.

55
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,780
Whoa.

56
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:15,800
Okay. Well, the song there, dear friends, was Sex Goddess of the Western Hemisphere by Huge Voodoo.

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,820
Maggie Estep doing the words.

58
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:29,860
And my good friend, Reverend D.K. Jones and his good friend, Reverend Bruce Grant forming their Huge Voodoo.

59
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,360
And some more Huge Voodoo coming up that will blow your mind.

60
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,740
This is, dear friends, Hour of Slack number 347.

61
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,820
And the first of the sermons tonight is on Satanism.

62
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,100
Cops and rap music.

63
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,000
And reading the newspaper.

64
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,580
Reading the newspaper makes me sick, dear friends.

65
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,020
That's why I read it every morning.

66
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,740
To make myself sick with hate.

67
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,840
So that I can be a good preacher.

68
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,060
A good minister here on the air.

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,320
But oh, oh, the hate.

70
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,520
The hate of the smug people that it produces.

71
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
The idiots.

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,020
The venal.

73
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,220
The greedy.

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,280
And the small-minded.

75
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,080
Oh, what luxurious hate.

76
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:32,180
I like this police boycott of the entertainment conspiracy because of Ice-T's song, Cop Killer.

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,620
And you know, I'm glad they brought that up.

78
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,540
I wouldn't have bought Ice-T's new album otherwise.

79
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,900
Actually, I tried to buy it today.

80
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,320
But Sound Warehouse, they, you know, they...

81
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,740
They had to chicken out.

82
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
They did have plenty of copies of Arise.

83
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,240
But anyway, the, I mean, it's so...

84
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:04,620
The whole thing about Ice-T and this so-called boycott is so illustrative of the pink anti-weirdness white bread mentality.

85
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,740
They're so out of it.

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,520
To begin with, they picked the worst possible target among rap singers.

87
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,320
I mean, Ice-T is like...

88
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,720
He's the thoughtful, cerebral rap singer.

89
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,900
I mean, they couldn't have picked a song that was more obviously a portrait of frustration.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,620
Uh, I guess, you know, they didn't notice all those 18,000 other rap songs that really do outright tell people to kill cops.

91
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,440
I also suppose they didn't notice all the white bands from the 70s onwards like the Dead Kennedys and...

92
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,560
Dead Kennedys and Dead Kennedys.

93
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,900
You know, that also did cop hatin' and killin' songs.

94
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,280
But, uh, the lack of hipness, dear friends, is the moot part of the point.

95
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:07,900
What's really sickening is that they can get so much more upset over a guy mouthing words than they ever did over a gang of cops beating an unarmed man for fun.

96
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,520
At which they knew perfectly well is a daily occurrence in Ice-T's old neighborhood.

97
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,460
And a lot of other neighborhoods besides.

98
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,960
Now, I'm not puttin' down all cops, friends.

99
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,480
I'm puttin' down the evil, willfully ignorant...

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,080
Ignorant cops.

101
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,040
Uh, but what can you expect?

102
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:41,880
What are you gonna expect, dear friends, when the kind of instruction and education that cops get are seminars by born-again religious nuts about the ever-present dangers of...

103
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,740
Oh, satanic cult.

104
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,060
Ohhhhh.

105
00:08:45,080 --> 00:09:07,860
Uh, did you hear a few weeks back, friends, when we mentioned on this show that we'd learned that police in Cleveland were being instructed by a Christian fundamentalist expert that the picture of Bob Dobbs, our guru Bob Dobbs, is, get this, gang graffiti and a satanic trigger to boot.

106
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,880
Now, take it from me, friends, if you ever wondered...

107
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,660
This whole satanic cult scare is nothing but a witch hunt.

108
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,320
It's sheer invented nonsense by hate-filled paranoids who never learned what good sex is.

109
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,780
You know how many murders there are a year that actually have anything at all to do with Satanism?

110
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,740
About three.

111
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,980
Oh my gosh, better shut down the New Age bookstores.

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,260
You know how many babies are scalded to death each year?

113
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:50,080
Because they wouldn't stop crying and their Christian parents just knew it was the devil and not colic that was making them cry.

114
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,680
So they killed the baby to drive the devil out.

115
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:02,820
About 300, dear friends, a hundred times as many people are sacrificed for Jesus as are sacrificed for the devil.

116
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,020
And hey, Christians invented Satanism in the first place.

117
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,340
Because Christians invented the devil.

118
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,080
I mean, how many Satanists do you know who weren't raised as Christians?

119
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,000
None.

120
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,520
So, I mean, you know, if you're gonna make pot illegal because all the heroin addicts smoke pot first,

121
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,560
and make porno illegal because it leads to rape, and make abortion illegal because it leads to hell,

122
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,160
then you better make Christianity illegal because all the Satanists started out as Christians.

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,060
It's exactly the same logic, friends.

124
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,860
Now, don't get me wrong.

125
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,880
I think Satanists are even stupider than Christians.

126
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:49,340
And not only do they follow a fictitious character, they follow a quote, evil fictitious character.

127
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,020
A loser.

128
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:58,340
Now, when it comes to wrecking lives in vast unthinkable numbers, the Christians win hands down.

129
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:08,260
So I hope that the cops and the moralists and fundamentalists have fun policing those record stores instead of themselves or the bad neighborhoods.

130
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:18,180
Because God forbid that somebody say words on a sound reproduction system that might give some idiot the wrong idea about life.

131
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,880
We wouldn't want entertainers setting a bad example.

132
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,020
I mean, look what happens.

133
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,880
Those riots in LA, that wasn't because of a gang of white cops proved they could get away with lynching.

134
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,700
It was because those crazy Negroes got a bad attitude from listening to rap music.

135
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,460
So, well, hey, violence is okay.

136
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,080
We just won't allow any dangerous concepts to happen.

137
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,660
It's those concepts and ideas that really threaten our freedom.

138
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,780
Oh yeah.

139
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,100
Oh yeah.

140
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,940
Oh, let's get some perspective here.

141
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,240
I mean, first things first.

142
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,660
All right.

143
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,200
My friends.

144
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,700
Bob Dobbs.

145
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,500
Bob Dobbs needs to hose down the streets.

146
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,300
That's what needs to happen.

147
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,380
And that's what's gonna happen, dear friends.

148
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,500
Come X Day.

149
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,540
The beginning of the world.

150
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,820
Ah, yes.

151
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,540
Ah, the harvest.

152
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,320
America is waiting.

153
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,660
They, the jury, found the defendant Lawrence M. Powell not guilty.

154
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,480
And once again, Archie Bunker wins.

155
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,500
Time is running out.

156
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,480
The revolution.

157
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,320
Anywhere.

158
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,260
J-Live.

159
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,240
J-Live.

160
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,300
J-Live.

161
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,300


162
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,300


163
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,860
J-Live.

164
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,580
Once again, Archie Bunker wins.

165
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:15,920
As the gatekeeper grins for a tour de four who sinned then were let off bread scot-free.

166
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,920
The verdict.

167
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,380
Don't believe what you see.

168
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,520
Like the crowning of a king's behind by the not-ready-for-prime-time swine.

169
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,700
Spineless jellyfish, a tonemane, poisoned kiss of death.

170
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,280
Blown by a jade.

171
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,740
A jaded jury.

172
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,800
To test.

173
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,620
They rest.

174
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,360
Then confess.

175
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,800
We'll have no trouble sleeping.

176
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,180
Yet peeping from suburban safe houses hoping douses of gasoline, as seen on the screen,

177
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,240
don't mean their pristine world will be hurled straight to hell.

178
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,620
Well, I wouldn't bet the bank.

179
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,740
As tanks are rolling, heads swollen, bodies dead.

180
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Bush beds down with his tarnished king's crown, took under a goose-step feathered pillow.

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,000
This unpatriotic pussy will, oh no!

182
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,380
Let my people go.

183
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,300
So maybe Willie Horton ads got whitey crazy.

184
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,520
A driving Miss Daisy state of mind.

185
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,860
Now the greatest fear, black on white crime, has come to fruition.

186
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,940
As a deep dish suspicion sweeps a narcissistic nation.

187
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,020
Screwing Haitians, blocking natives on reservations.

188
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,480
The creation of a hate race.

189
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,400
But no one wants to face the music.

190
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,960
Quick trigger finger dead ringer.

191
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,760
A mayday KKK who'll pray, slay, and kill to live another.

192
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,900
Way down upon a burning ghetto.

193
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,760
Not far away, as old fays say, I'm glad I live in semi.

194
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,700
Hooray, hooray.

195
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,400
But semi south of the Canadian border, as the new world order causes death and destruction.

196
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,820
And once again,

197
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,800
Penless grenades explode.

198
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,760
And our silent code seeps into insane membranes of killer cops.

199
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,260
And you won't stop.

200
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,800
Popping people of color, copters buzzing, dozens dead.

201
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,960
Right, said Fred, cause our body ain't sexy when it's filled with lead.

202
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,800
While Ted Koppel and his non-stop will steal news.

203
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,960
Jockeys with Arsenio who's crying to blues.

204
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,340
They hit, quit, then split to fly cribs.

205
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,220
Eat, repeat, snooze.

206
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,680
As niggas lose lives.

207
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,780
Semi-valley Cali honkies theorize.

208
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
Why burn your community?

209
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
But as usual,

210
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,260
Casper the unfriendly ghost is too blind to see.

211
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,800
That Koreans, Iranians, Indians and Jews.

212
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,900
The chosen fews.

213
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,680
Who own the stone that's been torched and looted.

214
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:01,660
While muted blacks sluggin' slut ass Miss Liberty on their backs for 500 years.

215
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:08,600
Swig beers, cause there's no room for tears in a country arrears on a bill that has never been right.

216
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,340
Founded by might, yet with many men black stand and fight.

217
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,700
Whites lose their minds.

218
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,180
Hard times getting worse.

219
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,860
Cursin' each other in another war zone.

220
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,600
Motors stoned on live TV.

221
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,420
We all see, yet act surprised.

222
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,280
But don't.

223
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,520
It's our, his, story.

224
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,380
Like the Boston Tea Party or Civil War.

225
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,460
And what's in store but more of the shame.

226
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,120
No one to blame.

227
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,980
No one to believe in.

228
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,740
As once again.

229
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,340
Archie.

230
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,800
Bunker.

231
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,220
Win.

232
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:53,880
Revolution.

233
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,060
Revolution.

234
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,600
Time is running out.

235
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,700
Yo George.

236
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,900
South Central LA looks like Iraq.

237
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,500
You gotta answer for that.

238
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,020
Time is running out.

239
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,680
Play.

240
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,100
Slay.

241
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,580
And kill to live another.

242
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,120
Way down upon a burning ghetto.

243
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,940
Ghetto.

244
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,660
Ghetto.

245
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,400
Ghetto.

246
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,900
Ghetto.

247
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,040
Suburb.

248
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,480
In the.

249
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,080
Suurburb.

250
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,860
Suburb.

251
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,520
In the Suburb.

252
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,640
Suburb.

253
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:23,920
Suburb.

254
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,700
Time is running out.

255
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,920
Black on white crime has come to fruition.

256
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,420
Black on white crime has come to fruition.

257
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,600
Scholars.

258
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,300
JO since college.

259
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:32,620
People.

260
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:32,620


261
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,840
Time is running out.

262
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,280
We.

263
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:34,980
Work.

264
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,560
Out.

265
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:47,260
yeah oh man wonderful piece there once again huge voodoo

266
00:17:47,260 --> 00:18:00,900
that time it was Reggie Reggie Reggie's name met the guy Reggie Gaines Reggie

267
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:09,020
Gaines words with huge voodoo music I'm most proud most proud of the up that

268
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:17,100
we're the first place and just about the world that's played that one yes Archie

269
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,740
Bunker wins again and and like I said I went in to buy that that album cop

270
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,380
killer but they refused to sell it out of deference to the executive

271
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:30,880
people

272
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,100
boys and you know the sad thing really the saddest thing about that whole boy

273
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,240
caught is it's like as if time Warner really cared what cops think friends

274
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,720
boycotting trying to boycott something as huge as time Warner it's like boycott

275
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,980
in the IRS it's like a pea shooter against Godzilla let me tell you about

276
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,560
time Warner here friends in this book

277
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:13,040
utilities news and communications radio news 24 hour online 6th and

278
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,040


279
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:27,880
even a Friday started curd and we according to cuchas story

280
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,540
the next on our discipline leed the new

281
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,540


282
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,540


283
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,540


284
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:30,540


285
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:39,520
arguably the most influential media conglomerate in the world. The business profile of Time

286
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,080
Inc., America's biggest magazine ad revenue earner and publisher, Time, Live, Fortune,

287
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:52,840
People, Sports Illustrated, etc., meshed well with Warner, the number one record and TV

288
00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:00,040
production company in the United States, with combined assets somewhere between 25 and 30

289
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,920
billion dollars. They also controlled a major chunk of the cable, motion picture, and book

290
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,700
markets, including home box office, Lorimar Studios, Book of the Month Club, blah, blah,

291
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,920
blah, blah, blah. Such an amalgam of lucrative components gave Time Warner distinct advantages

292
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:26,120
for promoting their products in a multiplicity of media. A magazine article with the company

293
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,980
copyright, for example, could be expanded into a Time Warner.

294
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,980
It could serve as the basis for a film made at an in-house studio, which would then be

295
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,240
distributed through a movie theater chain owned by the same company. The movie, doubtless,

296
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:48,240
will be reviewed in widely read magazines, also published by Time Warner, and the soundtrack

297
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,500
album would be issued on a company record label. To catch a rerun, turn to one of Time

298
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,080
Warner's cable channels. More and more...

299
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,400
Ahem.

300
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,020
More and more...

301
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,820
More and more...

302
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:09,680
We will be dealing with closed loops, predicts Ben Bagdikian, as a handful of mega-conglomerates

303
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,580
squeeze others out in the field.

304
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,820
And, uh...

305
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,720
A journalist covering the Time Warner merger rarely featured statements by public interest

306
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,720
critics warning that mass media concentration in fewer and fewer corporate hands poses a

307
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,020
threat to the economy.

308
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,020


309
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,340
A journalist covering the Time Warner merger rarely featured statements by public interest

310
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,340


311
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,340


312
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,340


313
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:30,340


314
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,020
serious threat to pluralism, democratic discourse, and the First Amendment.

315
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,000
You see, the Time Warner tango was only the latest episode in an accelerating march toward

316
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
media monopolization that is transforming news and entertainment. In 1982, according

317
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,600
to Ben Bagdikian, 50 corporations controlled most of the media business. In January 1990,

318
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,000
that number was 20.

319
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,560
The number of newspapers in the United States is now 23, and shrinking fast. Time Warner

320
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,840
co-chairman Richard Munro predicted that within a few years, a half dozen vertically integrated

321
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,620
media mammoths will dominate the industry, not just in the U.S., but globally. And he

322
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,880
vowed his company would be one of them. Today, about a dozen corporations, only a dozen,

323
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,400
control most of America's daily newspaper circulation. Only three firms account for

324
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,980
a majority of magazine earnings. Only one of them is the American Times. And the other

325
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:29,980


326
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,240
is reinsuranceintelligence.com.

327
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
Ok, maybe one's access to two books screenings and six publishing houses, have a lock on

328
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,040
most of the book business!

329
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:44,040
The motion-picture scene is dominated by four film studios. A half-dozen corporations control

330
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,520
90 percent of your domestic record sales.

331
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,440
The lack of concern among the public is in large part attributable to the silence of

332
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,960
mass media, which rarey probed the dangers of propaganda. consciousness, in the course

333
00:22:59,960 --> 00:22:59,960


334
00:22:59,960 --> 00:22:59,960


335
00:22:59,960 --> 00:22:59,960


336
00:22:59,960 --> 00:22:59,960


337
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:07,380
concentrated ownership as it pertains to their own industry. The insidious impact of merger mania is

338
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,480
not readily apparent to the casual consumer who sees newsstands stocked with lots of publications

339
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,000
and bookstores filled with different titles. Equally misleading is the fact that there appear

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,540
to be thousands of radio stations, blah, blah, blah, all different. On the surface, it seems a

341
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:31,800
tremendous variety of media are available to us, yet appearances are deceptive. For only a handful

342
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:39,900
of multinational corporations control what most Americans see, hear, and read. These highly

343
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:48,740
centralized information outlets are remarkably uniform in what they offer. And, uh, dear friends,

344
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,220
what we're getting to is the fact it's a jungle out there, all right?

345
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,100
What we're...

346
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:04,220
A station like K-N-O-N is a rare thing indeed. These little stations where you can get and, well,

347
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:12,580
have a show where there's not a corporate sponsor breathing down your neck. And not only a big

348
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:22,420
corporate sponsor, but hand-in-hand with that, the United States government. Uh, you know, for years

349
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,380
and years, you've...

350
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:53,520
We've all heard about the liberal bias in the media. Well, the media is controlled, all right, but to show just, I mean, the fact that people really think that it's a liberal bias shows just how controlled it is. And just, because this is, um, this one, it's sad that I can't read you this entire book tonight, dear friends, but here's an interesting chapter that I think if I tell you some of this information, you'll be able to read it.

351
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


352
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


353
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


354
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


355
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


356
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


357
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


358
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:53,520


359
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:14,860
Yeah, I think you'll be able to draw a lot of conclusions for yourself that sort of back up what we're trying to point out here between mass media being all in the hands of really just a few large corporations and the fact that those large corporations are, in many cases, almost identical with, uh, the administration of the government of this country, as we say.

360
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:23,480
For instance, uh, media buzzwords, uh, what we hear over and over again shapes our language and guides our thoughts.

361
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:49,680
As with ad jingles, the drumbeat of repeated news lingo stays with us and takes on a life of its own. This is the news we're talking about, friends, not just the conspiracy TV shows. This is what's supposed to pass for, uh, facts, all right? But the language they use in presenting these things, uh, for example, bailout.

362
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,380
The word bailout is used nowadays.

363
00:25:53,540 --> 00:26:09,320
To mean, as a polite way of referring to huge amounts of taxpayers' money going to wealthy financiers who happen to have souring investments in, uh, industries like auto production or savings and loans.

364
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:22,300
Big government is a pejorative for regulating agencies that limit corporate activities or for social service programs who aid poor and middle-class people, but not.

365
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,360
Big.

366
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,520
government is not the government's enormous military expenditures. Now, if you watch your

367
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,680
news reporters and read your papers closely, you'll see that this is indeed the way this

368
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:41,520
language is always used. A cleanup is a scenario for setting right oil spills, nuclear pollution,

369
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,900
chemical releases, and the like. The phrase sounds comforting. It implies a magical vacuum

370
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:57,280
cleaner at work, except that most ecological disasters can't be undone. The phrase dangerous

371
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:04,200
drugs means illegal substances as distinct from other damaging consumables like alcohol,

372
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,120
cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals who might be sponsors of news programs or owners of

373
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:17,360
television networks, co-owners. Defense spending, of course, means military spending. Deterrent

374
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,880
spending means military spending.

375
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,100
A deterrent is a nuclear weapon pointed at the Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons pointed

376
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:30,080
at the US never get the media's deterrent tag. If it's pointed at us, then it's not

377
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,600
a deterrent. If we're using it, it's a deterrent. Experts is a common noun handy for promoting

378
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:44,140
a favored point of view. Instability is code for situations overseas where the US State

379
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,860
Department is unhappy with current events, whereas stability is code for situations overseas

380
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,420
Community is a code word for situations overseas where the US State Department wouldn't mind

381
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,980
if conditions stayed the same.

382
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:01,260
Intelligence community is a way of making cloak and dagger specialists at the CIA and

383
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,860
other spy agencies sound like friendly neighbors.

384
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,060
A military leader is a foreign military dictator whom the White House doesn't mind a whole

385
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,340
lot.

386
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,880
A military strongman, on the other hand, is a foreign military dictator out of favor with

387
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,620
the White House.

388
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:27,620
In 1989, military strongman seemed to be the first names of Panamanian General Manuel Noriega.

389
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:35,220
A few years earlier, when he was on the CIA's payroll, he was a military leader.

390
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,840
Moderate in domestic politics.

391
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,320
This favors the military.

392
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,680
Moderate is a very vulnerable adjective for not rocking the status quo boat.

393
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:54,740
As a moniker for foreign regimes, moderate denotes little inclination to disrupt US government

394
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,340
plans.

395
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:04,120
Thus, Saudi Arabia's monarchy is moderate, which would surprise the hundreds of torture

396
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,720
victims inside Saudi prisons.

397
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,320
National security is confined to subjects like the military.

398
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:12,920
Many additional drugs are usually amplified for people fighting militant firearms, soldiers,

399
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,940
and espionage.

400
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,040
With rivalized and foreign rules as well.

401
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,860
But what I can say is that social modernism does claim económical該 tendon.

402

404

If you're a woman, do you know you're actually willing to protect Search farms?

405
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,380
Who knows?

406
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,680
Visit the Google search any way you want.

407
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:36,900
Your life depends on you.

408
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,380
Capitalism comes first.

409
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,300
Onlyhana Evet replace the book is a meme.

410
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,120
The word reform can mean just about anything.

411
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,680
Tax reform during the 1980s meant legislation that gave the wealthy major tax cuts.

412
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
And special interests.

413
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,980
This phrase used to be applied to wheeler dealers relying on big bucks instead of grassroots supporters to sway the democratic process.

414
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:11,960
But in recent years, mass media has turned the term special interests upside down and plastered it elsewhere.

415
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,340
On large numbers of people with less money and less power.

416
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:23,100
Groups of black and Hispanic Americans, labor union leaders, feminist women, old folks, lesbian and gay rights, blah blah blah.

417
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,860
And terrorism, friends.

418
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,480
A label very selectively applied in keeping with U.S. government definitions.

419
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,680
So that bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings are terrorism if done by Arabs.

420
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,500
But not if done by Israelis.

421

You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

Stay tuned and praise Bob.

I'm going to shoot the president.

00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,640
I say, I say, president.

431
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,360
What's your name?

432
00:31:51,040 --> 00:32:00,180
If I can't get a ride, if I don't get paid, I'm going to shoot the president.

I say, I say, president.

I say, president.

435
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,100
I say, president.

436
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:40,460
Oh, say can you see, in the blinkless electron gun eye of the mainstream media barrage,

437
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,300
that what we hail are the hallucinations...

438
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,440
of authority and progress and righteousness,

439
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,060
whose sweet and stern voices have captivated

440
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,940
and conditioned millions of human creatures,

441
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,940
stimulated them in passive acceptance

442
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,820
of technological disruption and destruction

443
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,740
of our environments, of our histories,

444
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,280
of the possibilities of alternative ways of being,

445
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,240
whose seven stripes are broken swastikas,

446
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,240
whose fifty stars are black holes

447
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,860
sucking two hundred million atomized existences

448
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,440
into the daily routine of the human herd of hamsters,

449
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,500
rolling the great wheels of the death machine,

450
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,740
squeaking at the shocks and nibbling the cheese

451
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,960
and reciting and discussing and delighting

452
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,780
in their mutually shared programming history,

453
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,520
in their lives, in their cancers,

454
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
their TV shows, their deaths, their jobs,

455
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,700
their ignorance, their endless pointless core and creeping,

456
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,820
their glorious blind nosedive into their paycheck's pleasures,

457
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,600
into an ecstatic emptiness, a glowing incinerator,

458
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,180
a parking lot full of businessmen,

459
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,440
conspiring and colluding on the big dream,

460
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,820
the big lie, the big nauseating, screaming,

461
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,160
sweating nightmare of business America,

462
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,320
media America, corporate America,

463
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,080
consumer America,

464
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,440
fascist America.

465
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,780
On a brighter note, commercial break.

466
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,920
The government has now banned the carrying of spears.

Stop about every thousand miles ain't asking too much, is it?

468
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,240
You might wish to stay on and listen.

469
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,600
It was a place where everything was legal.

470
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,840
I met this woman.

471
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,240
So if you're looking for emotional satisfaction,

472
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,100
my advice to you is,

473
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,700
seek professional help.

474
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,220
Thank you for joining us live on the air.

475
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,180
My pleasure.

476
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,760
One nation,

477
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,580
under God,

478
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,360
has turned into one nation,

479
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,020
under the influence of one drug.

480
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,840
Television,

481
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,680
the drug of a nation,

482
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,400
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

483
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,460
On television,

484
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,380
the drug of a nation,

485
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,940
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

486
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,700
TV,

487
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,920
its satellite links,

488
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,420
our United States of unconsciousness.

489
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,840
Apathetic, therapeutic, and extremely addictive.

490
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,460
The methadone metronome,

491
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,360
pumping out 150 channels, 24 hours a day.

492
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,460
You can flip through all of them,

493
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,040
and still there's nothing worth watching.

494
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,420
TV,

495
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,200
is the reason why less than 10% of our nation reads books,

496
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,620
and more than 10% of our nation's population reads books daily.

497
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,280
Why most people think Central America means Kansas.

498
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,720
Socialism means un-American,

499
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,320
and apartheid is a new headache remedy.

500
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,280
Absorbed in this world,

501
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,920
it's so hard to find us.

502
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,000
It shapes our minds the most.

503
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,520
Maybe the mother of our nation should remind us,

504
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,540
that we're sitting too close,

505
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,140
to the television,

506
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,920
the drug of a nation,

507
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,620
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

508
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,180
On television,

509
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,620
the drug of a nation,

510
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,160
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

511
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:45,920
TV,

512
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,140
is the stomping ground for political candidates,

513
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,420
where bears in the woods are chased by a Grecian form of bald eagle.

514
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,200
TV,

515
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,560
is mechanized politics,

516
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,680
remote control over the masses,

517
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,400
co-sponsored by environmentally safe gases.

518
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,920
Watch for the PBS special.

519
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,160
It's a perpetuation of the old.

520
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,300
It's the creation of the two-party system,

521
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,560
where image takes precedence over wisdom.

522
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,820
Where sound by politics,

523
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,120
are served to the fast food culture.

524
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,080
Where straight teeth in your mouth are more important,

525
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,880
than the words that come out of it.

526
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,000
Race baiting is the way to get selected.

527
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,720
Will he hoard or will he not get elected?

528
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,680
On television,

529
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,560
the drug of a nation,

530
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,160
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

531
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,360
On television,

532
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,160
the drug of a nation,

533
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,900
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

534
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,140
On the screen is an address,

535
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,700
where you can mail your tag offering or give a look.

536
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,220
Okay, got the idea?

537
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,360
Alright, have it.

538
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,020
Time to serve.

539
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,820
Alright, have a look.

540
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,380
Come on, here.

541
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,840
TV,

542
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,840
is it the reflector or the director?

543
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,700
Does it imitate us or do we imitate it?

544
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,900
Because a child watches 1500 murders before he's 12 years old.

545
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,500
And then we wonder why we've created adjacent generations,

546
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,000
that learn to laugh,

547
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,260
rather than abhor the whore.

548
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,500
TV,

549
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,060
is a place where armchair generals and quarterbacks,

550
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,820
can experience first hand,

551
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,140
the excitement of video warfare.

552
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,160
As a theme song is sung in the background.

553
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,200
Sugar sweet sitcoms that leave us with a bad actor taste.

554
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,920
While pop stars metamorphosize into soda pop stars.

555
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,940
You saw the video,

556
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,380
you heard the soundtrack.

557
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,100
Well now go buy the soft drink.

558
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,780
Well the only cola that I support,

559
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,840
would be a Union COLA cost of living allowance.

560
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,000
On television,

561
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,840
the drug of the nation,

562
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,420
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

563
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,680
On television,

564
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,540
the drug of the nation,

565
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,160
breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.

566
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,160
Back again,

567
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,120
new and improved.

568
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,460
We returned to our irregularly programmed schedule.

569
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,000
Hidden cleverly between heavy-breasted beer and car commercials.

570
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,800
CNN, ESPN, ABC, B-C-V-T-N-T,

571
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,000
but mostly B-S.

572
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,220
Where oxymoronic language,

573
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,380
like virtually spotless.

574
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,400
Fresh, frozen,

575
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,800
light yet filling and military intelligence have become standard.

576
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,040
TV is a place where phrases are redefined like recession to necessary downturn,

577
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,440
crude oil on a beach to moose, civilian death to collateral damages,

578
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,120
and being killed by your own army is now called friendly fire.

579
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,820
TV is a place where the pursuit of happiness has become the pursuit of trivia,

580
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,860
where toothpaste in cars have become sex objects,

581
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,820
where imagination is sucked out of children by a cathode ray nipple.

582
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,140
TV is the only wet nurse that would create a cripple.

583
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,420
Television, the drug of the nation, breeding ignorance, feeding radiation.

584
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
On television.

585
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,460
The drug of the nation!

586
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,220
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation on television!

587
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,040
The drug of the nation!

588
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,820
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation on television!

589
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,620
The drug of the nation!

590
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation on TV!

591
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,600
Better living through television.

592
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,520
Okay.

593
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,120
Okay.

594
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:09,600
idea?

595
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,600
Who is

596
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,480
American Joy?

597
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,640
Better living

598
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,240
through television.

599
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,900
Who is

600
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
American Joy?

601
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,340
Okay, got the

602
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:17,520
idea?

603
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,460
All right, now

604
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:18,900
let's talk.

605
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,240
Okay.

606
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,460
Uh, yes.

607
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,000
I guess I

608
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,520
better tell you

609
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:44,820
what you've

610
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,280
been listening

611
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,780
to here.

612
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,160
Uh, shoot.

613
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,800
The President

614
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,500
was at the

615
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:50,960
beginning of

616
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,080
that.

617
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,640
Very short

618
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,320
little thing I

619
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:52,760
put on there,

620
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,180
you know, to

621
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:53,740
kind of go with

622
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,440
the cop-killer

623
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,140
subject matter.

624
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,200
Shoot the

625
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,760
President by

626
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,280
a band called

627
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:57,940
Big Stick.

628
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,160
A star-spangled

629
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,360
banner sort of

630
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,980
thing by

631
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,980
Culture Side.

632
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,740
Both of those

633
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,900
came from a

634
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,880
tape compilation

635
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,900
that Dad's

636
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
New Slacks

637
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,320
in Portland,

638
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,060
Maine put

639
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,600
together.

640
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,900
Praise Dad's

641
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,660
New Slacks

642
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,160
and those

643
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,500
strange bands.

644
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,080
Also, that

645
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,160
thing there at

646
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,820
the very end,

647
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,320
TV, is by

648
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,480
a band called

649
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,500
Disposable

650
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,580
Heroes of

651
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,220
Hyphopresy.

652
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,340
Okay.

653
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,300
And, uh,

654
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,820
listen closely

655
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,860
now, and

656
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,380
you'll hear the

657
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,780
matchbox not

658
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,440
only go back

659
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,040
and forth, but

660
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,380
also go

661
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:39,380


662
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,000
up and

663
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,540
down, if

664
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,140
you're on

665
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:42,320
headphones

666
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:42,800
anyway.

667
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,540
Yeah.

668
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,060
.

669
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,060


670
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,440
.

671
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,640
.

672
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:16,420
I can't hear you, Mrs. Fletcher.

673
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,140
Perhaps now would be a good time for you to consider upgrading your coverage.

674
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:50,100
I'm proud of you, Mrs. Fletcher.

675
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,920
Dogs, a pony, a baby elephant, clowns everywhere.

676
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,400
Trained dogs, a pony, a baby elephant, clowns everywhere.

677
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,480
Officials are quoted as explaining that since the brain of a ghoul has been activated by the radiation,

678
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,960
the plan is kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

679
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,400
Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

680
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,620
Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

681
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,940
Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

682
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,760
Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

683
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:11,080
Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.

684
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,560
What would you do?

685
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,340
Guess, guess, guess, guess.

686
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,020
Because I don't say nothing about the things you do.

687
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
Don't you?

688
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,980
And don't you think I'm no fool

689
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,180
Because just one of my ideas would crack your head wide open

690
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,780
Hello friends and welcome

691
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,600
The sermon tonight is entitled

692
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,840
Pumping Bob

693
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,100
Pumping Bob

694
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,060
Because you see friends

695
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,560
It all goes back to that quest of the thirsty heathen

696
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,880
Who was crawling through the hot shifting sands of the Mojave Desert

697
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,220
In his search for water

698
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,320
This heathen, he did not know where he was

699
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,320
This heathen, he did not know he was in the Mojave Desert

700
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,780
But he did know that he was in a desert

701
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,420
And more importantly he knew

702
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,660
That if he did not drink something

703
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,920
Soon he would perish and become the dead dehydrated dinner

704
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,220
Of the same vultures that provided the only occasional shade

705
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,640
As their bodies flew between him and the piercing sun

706
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,980
So you can imagine how relieved our wayward wanderer was

707
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,540
When he saw an old fashioned hand pump

708
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,600
Protruding from a distant sand mound

709
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,700
With his last ounce of energy

710
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,320
He crawled up the dune to the rusty pump

711
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,020
And fanatically pumped away

712
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,880
But alas, not a drop

713
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,460
Not even a cough or sputter or choke of hope

714
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,360
Just the shrill clankety clank of vapor lock

715
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,220
All seemed lost

716
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,060
And yet even as our hot helpless heathen collapsed at the base of the pump

717
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:35,020
He used his final calories of life to roll over on his back

718
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,500
And beg the heavens

719
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,800
Lord God Almighty

720
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,420
Grant me a miracle

721
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,540
And then

722
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,640
Out of the clear sky of the desert

723
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,580
In our blue sky

724
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,540
A drop of moisture fell upon his face

725
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,760
And then another

726
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,580
And yet another still

727
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,220
Yes, with disbelieving eyes

728
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,800
Our desperate desert dweller looked skyward

729
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,340
He could not cry

730
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,440
For he had no tears to shed

731
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,300
He could not pray

732
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,800
For his eyes were too dry to shut the eyelids

733
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,440
In fact it took his shriveled eyeballs

734
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,540
A moment to filter out the blinding rays of the sun

735
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,620
To see the source of his life

736
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,880
his salvation. It was the vultures emptying their bowels to make room for the upcoming feast.

737
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:30,420
The traveler was furious. He grabbed fists of sand and threw them skyward towards the birds,

738
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,880
but to no avail. The sand merely fell back into his eyes, causing him further irritation.

739
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,480
He cursed his god. He stomped about, kicking the dust, when, quite unintentionally, he stomped his

740
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,640
toe on something buried in the sand. The pain gave him new strength. He yanked the dirty jar

741
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:56,180
from the ground and aimed it to toss at the buzzards, but during the wind-up, he felt a sloshing

742
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:01,980
from within. With dire anticipation, he scraped the dirt from the label and it read,

743
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:10,400
This jar contains water. Do not drink it. Use it to prime the pump and then refill it when finished.

744
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,800
Thank you and have a nice day. Well, well, well.

745
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,060
I don't need to tell you what a predicament this put our poor protagonist in.

746
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,520
If he drank the contents of the jar, he would have his thirst quenched only temporarily.

747
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:31,200
But if he put his faith in the message, he could have the everlasting liquid of life and limitless

748
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:40,900
liters. Now, which would you do, dear friends? Or to be more precise, which have you already done?

749
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,380
For every day,

750
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:50,060
you are faced with the same dilemma as our poor little dirty, dehydrated desert dweller. You see,

751
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:57,500
the everlasting liquid of life is slack. And the message that you must believe to receive

752
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:05,840
this everlasting life is the word of one J.R. Bob Dobbs. Believe in him and you will receive

753
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:13,220
the slack in everlasting quantities. Not just a taste here or a gulp there, but an abundance of

754
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:13,400
slack.

755
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:13,780
And the message that you must believe to receive this everlasting life is that you will receive

756
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:13,780


757
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:18,280
slack. Every which way. You will drown in life's pleasures Monday through Friday with weekends to

758
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,300
boot. But you see, the conspiracy wants to keep you on a tight chain. They don't want to give you

759
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,260
any slack at all, but they do so grudgingly since you need it in order to survive and serve them.

760
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,940
They give you the weekends and some time to set aside so you can recharge and have another

761
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,800
life-sustaining drop of slack. Most folks, they waste this opportunity to mow their yards or

762
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,460
wash their cars or attend their conspiracy churches. Somewhere in between, they do get a lot of slack.

763
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,360
They don't even get a drop or two of true slack or else they die—such are the bare necessities of humans.

764
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:54,180
But how much they get is what the conspiracy tries so hard to control. Like the dehydrated traveler,

765
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,940
they want to ration it out to you with an eyedropper, drop by drop, so you'll always be at their mercy,

766
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:06,880
ready to fulfill their every whim. They control you through your ignorance. They tell you, Bob's a joke,

767
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:13,460
a myth, some kind of hocus-pocus circus magic. The only true religions, according to the public, are the ones that are just not enough.

768
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,520
to them are the ones their state owns and operates.

769
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,840
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, fill in the blank,

770
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,600
whatever it is, there's a thousand different religions

771
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,620
with a thousand different rules.

772
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,180
But all these rules and religions have one thing

773
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,340
in common, dear friends.

774
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:36,120
They tell you slack is bad, slack is evil,

775
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,000
slack is the work of the devil.

776
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,620
Oh, it's hard to believe now, isn't it?

777
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,120
And yet most of the world believes exactly that.

778
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,180
Only J.R. Bob Dobbs has the gonads to step forth

779
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,600
and tell the emperor the naked truth.

780
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,000
Only Bob is standing up and stating

781
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,220
the obvious universal reality.

782
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,760
It's good to feel good.

783
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,800
It's bad to feel bad.

784
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,980
If man were meant to feel good,

785
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,120
he wouldn't have been born with a bob.

786
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,720
While the conspiracy is telling you

787
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,760
you gotta serve somebody, Bob is saying serve yourself.

788
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,560
Take as much slack as you want.

789
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,560
It's not a rare commodity.

790
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,880
This planet is covered with it.

791
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,640
You only need to know where to look.

792
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,940
And dear friends, that same Bob Dobbs

793
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,020
wants to be your guide.

794
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,900
For as he said to himself many years ago,

795
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,760
you can give a man a fish and you've fed him for a day,

796
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,160
but teach a man to fish wallets and you've fed him forever.

797
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,800
So what's it going to be, dear friends?

798
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,560
A conspiracy recommended weekly allowance of slack?

799
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,760
Or a complete, unadulterated,

800
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,260
drown in your own pleasures orgy of slack

801
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,520
where you and only you say when you've had enough.

802
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,260
The choice.

803
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,680
Is yours.

804
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,800
For as Dobbs so aptly observed,

805
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,280
you can lead a man to slack,

806
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,640
but you can't make him use it.

807
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,620
Here endeth the word of Bob.

808
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,940
Praise Bob.

809
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,260
Amen.

810
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,900
Your time is up.

811
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,160
I will no longer play for you.

812
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,420
You won't play for me anymore?

813
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,980
Oh, please.

814
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,040
Don't start now.

815
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,620
Just one more.

816
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,240
Please.

817
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,780
In the background in your mind now,

818
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,380
you're aware that the crew is highly competent

819
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,720
and the plane is a technological wonder,

820
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,260
a magic bird to serve your desires.

821
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,240
I'm all right, Roger.

822
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,600
Just a little argument with my co-pilot.

823
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,280
And guess what, Rog?

824
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,000
The little red needle's pointing to E.

825
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,300
And while that's always stood for excellent in my book,

826
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,620
I guess it means I'm out of gas.

827
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,020
You are safe.

828
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,000
Much safer than traveling in your own car

829
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,640
to your local grocery store.

830
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,960
Bon cucu.

831
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,020
It's T minus five.

832
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,980
I need my module.

833
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,140
I want my mapo.

834
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,060
Oh, my gosh.

835
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,380
All right.

836
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,220
Standing by.

837
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,800
Take four minutes.

838
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,520
Two minutes left until.

839
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,640
You can't.

840
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,280
Stand by for eject system.

841
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,100
This rocket is suspended.

842
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,820
It's not ready to take off.

843
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,680
Will you listen to me?

844
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,140
This rocket will not fly.

845
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:46,880
We're going to die.

846
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,920
Oh, I guess there's nothing I can do.

847
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,180
Well, I'll strap myself in.

848
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,400
This is it.

849
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,000
Goodbye, Doug.

850
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,400
I could not love these here so much.

851
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,120
Love, die not.

852
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,720
This show is goodbye now.

853
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,100
I'll miss you till next week.

854
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,920
Show over.

855
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,220
Stop listening.

856
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,420
.

857
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,020
.

858
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,020


859
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,500
.

860
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,180
.

861
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,220
.

862
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,700
.

863
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:30,920
.

864
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:30,980
.

865
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:31,880
.

866
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:34,960
.

867
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:44,720
.

868
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:44,920
.

869
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,020
.

870
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:45,100
.

871
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,140
.

872
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:45,160
.

873
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,180
.

874
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:45,240
.

875
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:46,980
Stop!

876
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:47,740
.

877
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,740


878
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:47,740


879
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:48,860
.

880
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,520
.

881
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:49,580
.

882
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:49,720
.

883
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,260
We must know.

884
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:50,440
No!

885
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:51,900
And come.

886
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,040
And come.

887
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,020
And come.

888
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,380
What?

889
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,080
What?

890
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,120
Oh, God, that sounds crazy.

891
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,360
Oh.

892
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,960
What you were listening to?

893
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,320
The all-pro cavalcade for Bob.

894
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:33,560
Did the amazing music mix cut edit that preceded and followed Father Joe Mama with his lovely and inspiring Pumping Bob sermon.

895
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:44,300
And then, why, of course, we heard a little bit of the old, the good old sad stuff, the KPFA, PuzzlingEvidence.com.

896
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,300
Dr. Howell show crash.

897
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:56,620
And it's time for bed here, so we're going to listen to the Charlie Manson opera.

898
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,320
Yes.

899
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,700
It's your fear, women.

900
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,420
You're afraid of every cycle, ladies, and it keeps you in your graves.

901
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,560
Now, do you see this?

902
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,320
Do you see this?

903
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,560
This is a perfect example of what I was just talking about.

904
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,940
Do you see this?

905
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,320
We're all over here.

906
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,220
You sure as hell know none of these creeps are going to help you out, Red.

907
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,480
They can't even see past their own shadows.

908
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,000
Long enough to have any actual contact with anybody.

909
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,820
Now, they're all too busy stepping on each other like a bunch of cooped up chickens or something.

910
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,100
Yeah, and then you walk around this ranch and you talk about love.

911
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,840
Love of what?

912
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,620
Love of brother.

913
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,580
Charlie, when are you going to give your fear to me?

914
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,120
I'm going out for a pass.

915
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:10,500
Shh.

916
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,860
And it's the long walk.

917
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,480
I've been trying to help you out, get through that, Red.

918
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,360
I've been trying to help you out, see you in September or something.

919
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,040
But it's in your programming.

920
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,620
Your programmers were programmed and it's just like you and it's just like you.

921
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,180
It's easy to be here.

922
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,480
It's easy to be here.

923
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:40,480


924
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,880
And it's just like you, huh?

925
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,340
And I'm a bit afraid of my own power.

926
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,120
It's like I've been...

927
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,380
Well, come on, buddy!

928
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,200
You're all falling in the same submarine of a solar system forever.

929
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,580
When are you going to give your fear to me?

930
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,060
Come here, girls.

931
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,360
I'm going out for a pass.

932
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:58,760
Shh.

933
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,020
And it's the long walk.

934
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,760
I've been trying to help you out, get through that, Red.

935
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:10,480
I'm going out for a pass.

936
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:10,480


937
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:10,480


938
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:17,600
I've been trying to help the out-see in September or something, but it's in your programming.

939
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:35,800
We are sneaking in the county jail, looking under the door to see if the man is there.

940
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,440
Sneaking like little children out of town.

941
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,240
Sneaking.

942
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,540
J.R. Bob Dobbs being preached.

943
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,180
Sorry, Bob.

944
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,040
Couldn't be here another show.

945
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,140
Maybe next week.

946
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,380
But in the meantime, this has been your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

947
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:31,100
And get that pencil ready, because I'm going to give you the post office box where you can write for boo-coos of free information.

948
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,600
Ah, it's so relaxing.

949
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,720
And that number to write.

950
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,460
Just write to Bob.

951
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,240
Just a little postcard.

952
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,060
Say, Bob, send it to me.

953
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:59,720
That's post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

954
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,220
Once again, that's post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

955
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
Ah, yes.

956
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,240
The harvest.

957
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,020
And let there be slack for your friends.

958
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:32,300
Well, this background music here is by our good friends Ray, Jerry, and Aklim.

959
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,280
I haven't played this in a long time.

960
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,560
Fort Worth.

961
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,620
They sent us this lovely stuff.

962
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,360
The

963
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:05,760
