1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
It's reality, goodbye.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,460
Nice and noisy, oh listen to that.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,680
Love those noises, mm-hmm.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,260
Beautiful, very professional.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,160
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,720
Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,500
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,660
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,440
is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,840
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,420
Looking forward to it, Mr. Stan.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,240
But, uh, just, I guess,

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,960
I guess, I guess, I guess,

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,140
I guess, I guess, I guess,

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,800
ever since the nuclear war,

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,740
it's been hard for us subgeniuses

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,880
to keep the show running like it used to

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,920
back in the good old days.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,360
Oh, now I remember those times.

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,260
Those were good times, boy.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,120
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,400
Oh, yeah.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,820
Um, anyway, we, we create special effects

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,720
with an Ultimac color tone brainwave synthesizer.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,260
You may have been reading about those lately.

28
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,860
They're illegal.

29
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,720
Uh, they trigger a total physical separation

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,280
by stem cleavage of the left and right brains.

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,420
Um, that's cerebral mitosis to you science fans.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,200
Creating a forebrain-hindbrain sync lock,

33
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,980
if you can dig on that.

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,360
And that's the whole reason for this show to exist.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,380
This is a brain dissonance,

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,020
a disconnection show,

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,220
which operates on a simple, new, break-thinking principle

38
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,340
by which your brainwave patterns

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,940
are gradually forced into resynchronization

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,500
with this tape's underlying messages and instructions.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,360
So...

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,300
What? Oh!

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,120
A plug of noise whizzing past your ears.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,240
So, that's what we do.

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,820
Just take the old cotton wad that comes with this station

46
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,940
and clean it out.

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,080
You did get a cotton wad with your station?

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,460
I think it's almost the first of the month.

49
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,020
They come every first of the month.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,580
They put acid down the hallways of the station

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,840
to make sure they kill it.

52
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,500
Diversionary platforms might be producing that kind of trash.

53
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,860
And there's only one a day,

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,040
so be very careful where you use that cotton wad.

55
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,860
So, the homeboys, they got gold in their mouth.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,540
Come on, keep going to Bob.

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,240
Go change the fresh wear.

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,240
Keep going.

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,760
Keep going to Bob.

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,140
Bob, when is it?

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, when is it?

62
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:57,880
Bob!

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
Bob, Bob, Bob.

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,940
Imagine the letter O, like a star,

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,260
like a sun, like a blazing beacon of bobness,

66
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,780
floating in the endless night of pink fear

67
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,940
and pinker embarrassment and self-loathing.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,120
Imagine the glorious letter O,

69
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:39,180
floating like a donutty bountiful beauteous beacon in that endless darkest night imagine now

70
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:49,020
another b a brave and bold letter b sounds like sesame street circling rocketing

71
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,440
raging racing around and around that o until we have a blazing band of golden b

72
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:04,740
slice across this ban glance across this disc of b-ness into the heart of honest and emerge again

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,160
and again into eternal b attitude and dive across the disc of bobness again and again

74
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:22,940
first b then the eternal sinner of o or bness and finally as firstly b on ending on beginning

75
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,180
b o b b

76
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,820
now turn the record over as we learn three more excremeditation positions

77
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,440
oh

78
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,940
what this country needs is a good five cents sitar

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,900
ah well you might think this is just chirpy as hell doing a show but something i found is i've

80
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:22,540
got a low tolerance for things oh boy i have a low threshold oh oh the microphone fell off i guess

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,420
it's happy to see me oh kayla you're so good at this you're so good at this you're so good at this

00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,420


83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:32,200
let's see if i can cue up some of my screams when the realization of what i was doing hits

84
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,940
the first show is free and then i felt like trying another show

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:47,460

oh no

113
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,360


114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,360


115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,360


116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,360


117
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,360


118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,360


119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:25,400
oh no

120
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,880
oh no

121
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,180
when you wanna come back

122
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,180


123
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,180


124
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,180


125
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,180


126
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,180


127
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,180


128
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,440
just like it's whatever no as many times in the quake better drink rather equal probably better get a mug and a shelf and beer and other things you do

129
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,440


130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,440


131
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,460
you'll know what i'm talking about

132
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:53,580
i care about working with you i don't know a damn little bit why that's why you are so impetuous to just suck my better work with us oh my clusters are hell there's nothing usual for it

133
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:03,860
before their eyes. These verses, whether we admit it or not, are a description of all of us before we came to the knowledge of the Lord.

134
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,780
Bob?

135
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,880
Bob!

136
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,200
Bob!

137
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,320
Bob.

138
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:22,680
Look, I don't care what your reporters think. I wasn't doing anything in the parked car with Reverend Ann, except discussing church.

139
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,400
Oh, do we need to do that again? Okay, but it would be wrong.

140
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:39,000
That's the clapper loader, the best boy in the dolly grip, who's just there on strike. I'm sorry to tell you that, Mr. Stang, but they say that this production can't move on until their demands are satisfied.

141
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,740
Well, let's go on with the press conference.

142
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,140
He said in verse 21,

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:52,660
And you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked work, yet now have derecorded.

144
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,840
And you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked work, yet now have derecorded.

145
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,480
And we were all alienated in our minds by wicked work!

146
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,140
That's our past! That was their past! And that's our past tonight! That's the past!

147
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,700
But the second thing we see is the present.

148
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,320
Our parents destroyed us. Your mother turned you into a hollow human shell.

149
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,060
What?

150
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
.

151
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,000
Tavares, Florida.

152
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:40,980
Like other generations who went through the public schools in this small town an hour north of Orlando,

153
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:50,460
students at Tavares Middle School are taught to take pride in American citizenship and heritage.

154
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,240
.

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:01,780
The school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Patriots, and the school colors are red, white, and blue.

156
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:15,880
But the conservative Christians who dominate the Lake County School Board say that is not enough.

157
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:37,580
As part of a new policy approved Tuesday by a 3-2 vote, teachers will be required to teach the county's 22,000 students that American culture, values, and political institutions are, quote, inherently superior to other foreign or historic cultures.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,860
Yes, the policy conceived as a...

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:11:03,080
A response to the state's multicultural education policy is the handiwork of the school board's chairwoman, Pat Hart, who describes herself as a patriot, a Christian, and a Republican.

160
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:12,880
She said it was okay that students learn about other nations as required by the state's multicultural educational curriculum,

161
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,140
so long as they also...

162
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:23,760
She thought that the United States is, quote, unquestionably superior to any society in all of human history.

163
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:38,500
Mrs. Hart said she drafted the policy statement, which also requires teachers to promote, quote, strong family values and an appreciation of our American heritage and culture,

164
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,280
to ensure that students never forget that, quote, we are the best.

165
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,080
Of the best.

166
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:58,180
And Mrs. Hart, whose own children are enrolled in private religious schools, says she has never set foot outside the United States,

167
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:05,460
speaks no foreign languages, and has no academic training in comparative culture, religion, or government.

168
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:14,380
I don't need to visit other countries to know that America is the best country in the world, she said.

169
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,540
And Mrs. Hart was elected four years ago in a contest that attracted few voters.

170
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:33,200
She was joined in 1992 by two other religious conservatives who, like her, espoused the views of Pat Robertson's Christian coalition.

171
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,780
With their support, she became chairwoman.

172
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,440
One of the...

173
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,360
And, you know, friends, this is going on all over the country.

174
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,920
They figured out, well, all we've got to do is lie and say...

175
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,580
Not mention that we're fanatical Christian radicals that want to change how you behave in your own bedroom,

176
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,380
but we'll get elected first, and then we'll start changing things.

177
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,060
One of those board members, Judy Pearson, said,

178
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,520
we need to reinforce that we should be teaching America first.

179
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:13,620
Otherwise, she said, young people, if they felt our land was inferior or equal to others,

180
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,840
would have no motivation to...

181
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,720
go to war and defend their country.

182
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,300
Ms. Hart, whose seat is up for election this year,

183
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,860
originally ran on a tax efficiency platform,

184
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,020
emphasizing her religious agenda only after narrowly winning election.

185
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,820
In one early action that stirred controversy,

186
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,220
the revamped school board rejected federal money intended for Head Start programs for disadvantaged children.

187
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,220
Ms. Hart and her allies have also, of course, sought to limit sex education,

188
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,080
to require creationism in the science curriculum,

189
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
and to limit some reading material in schools,

190
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,380
primarily children's books by Shel Silverstein.

191
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,220
I don't know if any of you have ever seen Shel Silverstein's children's books,

192
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,200
but they're not exactly demonic.

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:48,060
who you can write about his many tapes from a post office box 4542 Austin, Texas 78765.

293
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:55,540
And I think you should do so. Joe Newman, a creation science of poker.

294
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,840
Friends, you may be laughing at those hicks in Florida.

295
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:32,300
Well, I'm not laughing. What used to be the hippest station in Dallas, Texas, got a new manager a couple of weeks ago.

296
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,920
And suddenly the delasions were no longer listening to the hour of slack.

297
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:47,500
And also the other shows that were deemed not Christian enough all of a sudden under this.

298
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,040
So.

299
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:54,800
The new management were the Jewish show, the Celtic show, and pretty much any other show done by.

300
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,160
Well, that was in any way overtly non-Christian.

301
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,060
Hmm. That's the freedom of speech that the religious right is talking about, friends.

302
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:17,300
And their idea of education would involve plenty of whitewater and, you know, not not a whole lot of mention of a wounded knee or Iran Contra.

303
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,720
Or.

304
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,720
Watergate or the Spanish American War or Haymarket.

305
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
Or Vietnam.

306
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,840
The Kennedy assassination.

307
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,540
The slave colonies on the moon.

308
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,320
They will lie, friends.

309
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:45,620
They kind of believe that they have to lie to beat us liberal Satanists, which to them actually includes Mr.

310
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,040
And Mrs.

311
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,660
Average Presbyterian.

312
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,780
Middle of the road.

313
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,300
Normal.

314
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,940
Yeah, it's they they will will move into your turf saying one thing.

315
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,420
And then once they get a little bit of power, it starts.

316
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,740
Well, it changes here.

317
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,940
This is from the Dallas Observer, Dallas Weekly Paper on May 2nd.

318
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:17,720
Canowen, the station that build itself the voice of the people changed its format, rendering it all.

319
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:17,920
But.

320
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:30,540
Unrecognizable to long term listeners gone for good or such favorite revenue producing shows such as Celtic Crossroads Magic Time Warp Machine Music by the book.

321
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,840
Ivan Stag's Hour of Slack.

322
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,960
The Jewish Music Hour and Lone Star Dead.

323
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,320
The Grateful Dead show.

324
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,840
Easy Eddie D's hip hop extravaganza suddenly dropped an hour.

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,960
The Bilingual News Hour.

326
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:57,880
Disappeared and suddenly jazz fills the airwaves every midnight from midnight to four a.m.

327
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:10,240
Every night changing as the new manager, Bobby, says it was necessary to turn Canowen into a real radio station with real service instead of just a bunch of self-serving shows.

328
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:17,720
He said he cut the aforementioned programs and several others because they did not fulfill the radio stations.

329
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:24,840
The mission, which was, as Elliot says over and over again, to serve and empower the lower and moderate income constituency in our community.

330
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,560
Some of the programming, like the Hour of Slack, couldn't really identify with that, Elliot says.

331
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,260
And that's exactly why some of those shows are going away.

332
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:45,520
Of course, Elliot's mantra, he uses the phrase low to moderate income individuals a dozen times in 15 minutes, is nothing new at Canowen.

333
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,040
That's been the station's goal since its inception.

334
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,600
To provide lower income people of all races with information about blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

335
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,220
I'm not going to tell you what that information is.

336
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:05,500
But, you know, suddenly this little station is gospel music from four o'clock in the morning to noon.

337
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,180
And then it's like reggae and soul and rap and then the jazz stuff.

338
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,560
But Elliot's decision to add jazz for four hours every night is puzzling.

339
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,940
Demographic studies.

340
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:24,540
Studies indicate that jazz radio listeners skew towards a mostly upper class, well-educated white audience.

341
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,500
Ostensibly the very people Elliot believes we're listening to, if not running Canowen before he came on board.

342
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:41,080
What makes the jazz decision even more curious is that Canowen provided two jazz programs in the past seven years.

343
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,920
So anyway, this good Christian has, oddly enough, in addition to firing volunteer disc jockeys,

344
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,980
he hired his good buddy Bob Phillips at 300 bucks a week to host the jazz show every night.

345
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,620
And it's a different thing now.

346
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:11,880
He says community-based committees that are representatives of the listeners tell him what to put on the air and what to take off.

347
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,820
And that prior to his arrival, station management ignored the committee's wishes.

348
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:26,200
However, nobody at Canowen, past or present, knows what this guy's talking about when he evokes these community committees.

349
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,580
There never were any community committees.

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,900
And there was a committee, but not what he's talking about.

351
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,920
Oh, man.

352
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:45,040
It's, well, I go on and on about this unfair situation in this one city.

353
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,920
But if it's not a good thing, then it's a good thing.

354
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,240
It's not happening to a radio station in Dallas.

355
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,260
It's happening to a school in Florida.

356
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:07,580
And if it ain't, you know, it's enough to make a feller want to tip over, if you know what I mean.

357
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,560
But I ain't gonna do it.

358
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,760
I ain't gonna do it, no, sir.

359
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,140
No, sir, ma'am.

360
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,800
We're gonna strive to continue as we have.

361
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,720
No matter how terrible our equipment is.

362
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,720
By the way, if anybody, well, donations would always, well.

363
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,680
Stay tuned for more and less.

364
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,040
Coming up on this subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

365
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,200
The voice of the church of the subgenius.

366
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,160
Praise Bob.

367
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
He's a father.

368
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,880
He's a shepherd.

369
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,700
He's a leader.

370
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
He's a servant.

371
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,580
He's a friend.

372
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,160
He's a Flanders.

373
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,000
I'll tell you what.

374
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,760
You know, if anyone who's been in church for any length of time knows the importance of a pastor

375
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,680
and how much people really do depend on him.

376
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,420
Well, I'd like to ask another thing.

377
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,880
Yeah, sorry for the subgeniuses in Dallas.

378
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,520
I'm getting a lot of sad mail.

379
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,840
The pastor or the local church, basically.

380
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,800
From the Dalatians.

381
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,660
Earlier in the program.

382
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,360
The epistles from the Dalatians.

383
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:26,720
Where they're driving about the evil of a world where they are denied the, even one hour,

384
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,200
even one poor hour of slack.

385
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,920
No, they don't even get that.

386
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm driving because I haven't had breakfast and I'm hungry.

387
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,480
I think.

388
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,960
Therefore, I'm going to have breakfast.

389
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,540
That's true.

390
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,700
I think that's what Lord sale is seeking if you'd like to have breakfast.

391
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:58,940
If we could spend the next half of the evening drinking, we'd like to enjoy that little Christmas with theiscue after about two days.

392
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,580
So, going to for it wasn't a struggle.

393
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,860
It wasn't because we have this.

394
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,960
We have got to do it and to get to encouraged to spend it.

395
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:02,960


396
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,800
The only reason we have to be are from and the couple going down, it would be just from our sheets where a couple of kids were sitting about, but I would like our switch on a methodical.

397
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:14,780
Hopefully, may be duly pressured by an appropriate appointed Citizens Committee.

398
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,780
Naomi Yeler took that same ball again.

399
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:15,780


400
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:15,780


401
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:15,780


402
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,940
Anyway, Sundays are not going to be the same.

403
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,160
I'm extremely upset.

404
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,220
It is Sunday today, and the point is driven home, and I am extremely miserable.

405
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,280
So I guess I'd better go masturbate.

406
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,140
See you later.

407
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:38,340
Now, you must see yourself as a minister and be bold.

408
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,620
I know. I've got to do the hour of slack tonight, pal.

409
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,020
I'd have to do it without a studio.

410
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,780
So I guess I'm going to have to do me a bunch of damn tape.

411
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,400
For some reason, I'm all panicky about it.

412
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,380
Like, oh no, oh, it's going to be too hard to do this.

413
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,500
I can just sit down and do it.

414
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,560
I just have to do two of them.

415
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,320
You know, the funny thing is, whenever I do a show on Sunday nights, I come home and go,

416
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,840
man, I could have done two hours.

417
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,240
Man, I could have done two hours.

418
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,560
It'd be real easy.

419
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,620
I can't believe this horrible sound I'm getting.

420
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,700
Where is it coming from?

421
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,000
This is probably destroying my day.

422
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,460
Where's the fire? Bring my mic.

423
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,900
My mic's up about half.

424
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,920
Cast, cast.

425
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,460
Here we go.

426
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,660
Something going on here.

427
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,320
Can you hear myself?

428
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,020
And if I want to bring the background up, it goes up about halfway point.

429
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,300
It is frustrating, though, dear friends, you know.

430
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:00,520
But I think maybe we can gradually, if only I had real mics.

431
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm sure the thrumming of the stupid machine sounds fine.

432
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,820
Hi, guys.

433
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,980
Good to have you here.

434
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,520
Paul, are you there?

435
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,880
Yes, I'm here.

436
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,020
What's up?

437
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,060
Paul, are you there?

438
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,300
I think we can do it all with cassette.

439
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:16,620
I think.

440
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,000
We, what choice do we have?

441
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,700
We must.

442
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,400
This is confusing.

443
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,020
It sounds like a terrible show.

444
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,520
I know.

445
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm concerned with the views of all the people out there.

446
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,260
So, go ahead, car.

447
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,160
Let's see how this works with the microphone.

448
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,200
It's sad.

449
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,500
It's sad.

450
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:41,700
It's sad.

451
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,140
Not to hear it in your head.

452
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,280
Or have a good CD player.

453
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,960
Sending.

454
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,580
Okay, let's see how this works.

455
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,780
Oh, here it is without the hum.

456
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,760
Can you hear the difference?

457
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,740
I certainly can.

458
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,820
Not a hardly half a hum.

459
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,080
I need to find a garage.

460
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,980
I need to go out and find a garage.

461
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,500
Maybe.

462
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,280
Maybe.

463
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,160
Maybe we can make the horrible, horrible equipment somehow.

464
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,160


465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,000
That's what I need.

466
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,140
I need the stand.

467
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,900
The mic stand to save good from evile.

468
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,840
Never knew I had so many ideas.

469
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,520
Right.

470
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,440
Oh, yeah.

471
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,480
Muff, muff.

472
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:31,300
We're listening to those pops and bangs and twitters and why it sounds like the mic comes

473
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,180
through balance.

474
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,120
Oh, yeah.

475
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,060
Using a tripod for a mic stand.

476
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,260
Oh, yeah.

477
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


478
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


479
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


480
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


481
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


482
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


483
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


484
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


485
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


486
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


487
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


488
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


489
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


490
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


491
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


492
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,260


493
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:48,980
I'm going to have to get a damn, uh, uh, $80 Radio Shack stereo mixer for doing your home

494
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,140
disco party.

495
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,220
I guess that's what it mainly is for.

496
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:58,280
Got a microphone that only hears you when you're talking exactly directly into it.

497
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,740
And of course you got to put that has to be over on the side because of the tripod.

498
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,180
One tape deck.

499
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,960
Hopefully we don't get too much.

500
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,460
I can only.

501
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,260
I can only.

502
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:09,720
I can only hear a little bit.

503
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,600
Not even a cassette deck that works at all.

504
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,120
Background music.

505
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,220
I have no idea what's the, uh, the right volume for the background.

506
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,000
Probably be like last week and do it all wrong.

507
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,020
There's no way to monitor it properly.

508
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,120
It sounds from these headphones like I do such damn things.

509
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,500
Oh, the wrench in power from the subgenius.

510
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,260
I'm not saying they money them subgeniuses.

511
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,580
They might spend it on equipment.

512
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,860
I'm sure they've got enough equipment.

513
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,060
They'd probably just spend it on frop or something.

514
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,540
Yeah.

515
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,300
They, they're so rich and powerful.

516
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:42,940
I got all that.

517
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,460
I don't need to send money to those stations that play that show.

518
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,660
No, no, I don't need to send money to the church and subgenius cause they're so rich,

519
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
you know, cause of Bob.

520
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,400
They are be sending money to me.

521
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,480
Why don't you come meet me in a dark alley?

522
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,400
Give me all your money.

523
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,800
Cause I'm God.

524
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,880
Oh, we do have a little mic.

525
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,440
That's the problem.

526
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,940
It's stunning.

527
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,940
It's pretty stunning.

528
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,660
Oh, one couldn't.

529
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,860
Test, test.

530
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,800
Test, test.

531
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,980
I can't understand how my own daughter can approve of this preposterous mess.

532
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,660
It's in such uncivilized taste.

533
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,460
Are you sure?

534
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,620
I got the echo.

535
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,200
Oh!

536
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,560
It's okay.

537
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,860
So, once again.

538
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,060
Situation, where my volume

539
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,420
Sigh.

540
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,080
Sometimes, sometimes they don't.

541
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,420
So, once again.

542
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,620
Situation, where my volume

543
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:01,880
Sigh.

544
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:01,900
All right.

545
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,620
Maybe there is hope.

546
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,080
Maybe there is hope after all.

547
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,840
Sometimes, sometimes they don't.

548
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,840
Better world with...

549
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,680
What happens if I do that?

550
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,480
Now that one's...

551
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,800
Big camper. Oh yeah.

552
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,220
Oh now, oh, we lost it again.

553
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,100
Now it's gone.

554
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,800
Saw new notches in my mic stand.

555
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,800
Oh boy, oh we got it made now.

556
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,040
Yes siree, bob, re-bop.

557
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,800
It's a...

558
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,920
Oh, that's a beautiful thing now.

559
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,820
Kiss me out.

560
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,280
Well I've got, uh...

561
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,200
Ooh, now it pops real good.

562
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,700
But...

563
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,080
We do have the mic hanging now...

564
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,800
From a board...

565
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,400
With notches cut out.

566
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,780
Hanging by a piece of string.

567
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,020
That's our mic stand.

568
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,720
We have this background tape deck...

569
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,400
Which we'll play.

570
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,100
You can't fight me.

571
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,400
You have no chance.

572
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,160
I know it.

573
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Throw this stupid machine.

574
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,220
Oh god.

575
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,660
We're going to fight the devil anyway though, friends.

576
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,760
We are going to fight the devil.

577
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Test, test.

578
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,660
You know that Canadian...

579
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,240
Rich guy gave that fake bob rip-off artist...

580
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,980
Six thousand dollars or something.

581
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,720
Like that.

582
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,140
They had...

583
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,040
They had thousands of dollars to put their CD together.

584
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,180
And here we, the original servants of bob...

585
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,900
Sit with a microphone hanging from a string.

586
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,720
Without it...

587
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,020
So much as a...

588
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,240
A...

589
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,580
A robot to answer the phone.

590
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,800
And with...

591
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,120
Equipment that's literally held together by...

592
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,440
A masking tape.

593
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,440
Every single...

594
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,080
Tape deck the kind that you have to...

595
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,820
Jiggle the wires on to get both channels to work.

596
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,180
Oh, I think I had a cerebral blood-put in there.

597
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:23,120
We think the concept of no pain, no gain is worthwhile...

598
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,960
Because the more self-induced agony you withstand...

599
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,580
The closer you are to appreciating slack when you get a hold of it.

600
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,860
If you rearrange your perceptions just a little...

601
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,660
It's just like hang gliding over lava pits or...

602
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,920
Or getting your eyelids pierced.

603
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,740
Oh, yeah.

604
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,160
Whew.

605
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,660
But I've had some great times here with Mike...

606
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,540
Like the Halloween party where we cornered Jesus and witless to him.

607
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,620
We sure did.

608
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,480
Oh, got him a beer because he can't get up enough for the water into wine rift anymore.

609
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,540
Oh, he was so bummed out.

610
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,860
Wearing the sandals, looking the part to a tee.

611
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,700
Mm, that Aikido vest was real nice.

612
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh.

613
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,080
Yeah, we did a tag team smiting on him and got that third nostril opened up on him.

614
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,040
And boy, that cold October air smacked into the oxygen star of brain circuitry.

615
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,900
You could see the shock waves.

616
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,300
Whew.

617
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,980
He howled and hit the floor and rolled around and burst into flame.

618
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,700
And we ruined the hostess's Persian rugs trying to smother it.

619
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:21,860
Mm.

620
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,740
Boy, that always happens any time we try to get that guy to think for himself for a change.

621
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,280
Mm-hmm.

622
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:32,360
Witnessing for Jesus is one thing, but witnessing to him is another.

623
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,420
Oh, yeah, you got to slap him around to get his attention.

624
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,280
It's plum shameful.

625
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,860
But hey.

626
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,900
Well, I saw you sitting there.

627
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,180
I was trying not to stare.

628
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,440
I wasn't sure if it was you.

629
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,420
I didn't know just what to do.

630
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,920
Well, are you drinking with me, Jesus?

631
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,020
I can see you very clear.

632
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,440
Are you drinking with me, Jesus?

633
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,460
Won't you buy a friend?

634
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:28,460


635
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,200
You realize you know that I'm on your barstool.

636
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:49,520
I felt some warmness and then an old boy looked down at my hands, and that wasn't warmness.

637
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,420
I wet myself again.

638
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,860
Hey, are you drinking with me, Jesus?

639
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,020
I can see you very clear

640
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,280
Are you drinking with me, Jesus?

641
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,300
Won't you buy a friend of mine?

642
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,120
Cause your head, now, Jesus

643
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,040
Is hung over you to rise

644
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,180
I just heard I should choose

645
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,320
You holding the bloodshot eye

646
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,440
Should we take a cam home, Jesus?

647
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,200
Shit, man, we can huff it from here

648
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,680
I know you can walk on the water

649
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,560
Can you walk on this much water?

650
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,040
Are you drinking with me, Jesus?

651
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,060
I can see you very clear

652
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,360
Are you drinking with me, Jesus?

653
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,160
Won't you buy a friend of mine?

654
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,200
Everybody now!

655
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,740
Are you drinking with me, Jesus?

656
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,720
I can see you very clear

657
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,020
Are you drinking with me, Jesus?

658
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,720
Won't you buy a friend of mine?

659
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,220
Those of who want the。

660
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,100
We'll see our discussion of this month

661
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,260
Can you imagine the beauty of a反.

662
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:35,820
It's all sort of...

663
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:35,820


664
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:35,820


665
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:35,820


666
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,200
What we said

667
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,340
Well, yeah...

668
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,840
Like far принө

669
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,980
Well, yeah...

670
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,660
Will stand

671
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:45,880
What's wrong?

672
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:45,880


673
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:45,880


674
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:45,880


675
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:45,880


676
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Don't I in the same club

677
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,900
Just have to do the same thing

678
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,620
It is a sweet thing

679
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,620


680
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,620


681
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,620


682
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:51,920
Time's up?

683
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:51,940
What?

684
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,120
I'll tell you what I have to say about that, my friends.

685
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,960
This is from the new subgenius book coming out in October,

686
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,260
Revelation X, The Bob Apocryphon.

687
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,560
In fact, this section's from an old hour of slack rant a long time ago.

688
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,520
But you know our rival cults talk of the attack on the American family?

689
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,300
The attack on the American family.

690
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,200
And they're right.

691
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,440
The fabric of society is unraveling.

692
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,720
Father is pitted against son, sister against mother.

693
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,820
Father too close up against sister.

694
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,520
And 95% of all marriages end in divorce.

695
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:00,780
But our rival cults would claim that this results from MTV pornography,

696
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,700
sitcom sex gags, premarital permissiveness and the like.

697
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,600
Oh, something's tearing the family apart all right, dear friends.

698
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,040
But it's what those other churches love the most.

699
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,640
It's what they accuse us of wanting to destroy.

700
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,620
And they're right about that.

701
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,020
They're right about that too.

702
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,480
What's tearing the family apart, my friends, is 9 to 5 jobs.

703
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,860
Pink corporate conspiracy lifestyles whereby mommy and daddy get up in the morning,

704
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,300
kiss the kids in a kind of simultaneous hello and goodbye and go off to work.

705
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,640
Then after they get home about 7 o'clock, frustrated after a long drive back out to the burbs,

706
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
they kiss the kids hello and goodnight and they all go to bed.

707
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:47,880
Oh.

708
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,800
Our rivals like to work.

709
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:49,800


710
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,980
Wail and gnash their teeth about how the children are getting exposed to too much.

711
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,060
What they aren't being exposed to, friends, is a little bit of mom and dad.

712
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
Forget the pornography.

713
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,300
We say legalized pornography and bad work.

714
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,140
Most kids these days grow up with scarecrows looking over them because mommy and daddy,

715
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,260
Mrs. Mommy and Daddy, because Mr. and Mrs. Mommy and Daddy think it's,

716
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,400
is so important to have job security.

717
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,640
It's so important to be a real American.

718
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,300
A normal American.

719
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,420
An American that doesn't know its kids as well as it knows its employees.

720
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,180
And that preacher can get up there on TV and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal.

721
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,980
Keep young wifey stuck in the house, cooped up with the kids 24 hours a day,

722
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,040
turning her into a raven maniac from boredom and pinkness.

723
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,240
While old dad, well, uh, he's got a little bit of a problem.

724
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,240


725
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,240


726
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,540
He's out making his sales calls and martinis.

727
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,300
And that way, mama gets no slack.

728
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,480
Mama turns into a nutcase.

729
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,900
And you wonder why her kids turn to drugs.

730
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,500
They see her so adamant, blithering drunkenly on the phone and think,

731
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,980
well, I'm gonna go get messed up on drugs.

732
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,060
I don't wanna be like her.

733
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,780
That's worse than being messed up on drugs.

734
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,380
It's the sad truth, friends.

735
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,220
So the next time some pink starts in on about how you're a drug addict,

736
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,220


737
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,220


738
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:25,180
or your subgenius book or radio show has some pictures of nakedness and bad words,

739
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,300
well, you just come right back at him and say,

740
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,720
sir, sir, ma'am, do you work so hard trying to preserve morality

741
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,120
in this great land that your kids hate you?

742
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,140
Oh, yes, friends.

743
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,780
You know, this is a crooked and perverse culture,

744
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,180
a guilt-ridden, glutted, consumerist society

745
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,780
of desperate, completely unbalanced pinks

746
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,360
abusing kids and each other

747
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,780
and then getting paid to brag about it on talk shows and music videos.

748
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,420
But you can't force people to behave.

749
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:07,820
Not as long as behaving involves ingrained conspiracy perversions

750
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,020
and everybody is barraged nonstop with sublimations of natural lust

751
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,060
being used to sell cars and guns and war.

752
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:26,240
Oh, the mighty Yeti of old erred when they tampered with that buzzer in our brains, friend,

753
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,480
that pleasure center right next to the orgasm dynamos

754
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,620
and left it programmable so that anything could be made to light it up.

755
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,680
That pleasure switch could be thrown by some TV commercial

756
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,100
or bleeding-heart right-wing commie talk show host's hate rant.

757
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,160
And the slobbering old man would say,

758
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,160


759
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,160


760
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,880
the old brain thinks it's getting the same reward as a righteous ooze squirt,

761
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,100
but only the top Kundalini tear is activated with nothing lit up beneath it.

762
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,820
This is unhealthy.

763
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,240
People will latch onto anything that fires that spot in their brains,

764
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,180
and they'll worship it.

765
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,820
Oh yeah, it could be high-heeled shoes,

766
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,940
or a dead guy nailed to a stick,

767
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,280
or Jim Jones' voice,

768
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,300
or Rush Limbaugh's,

769
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,480
or Ivan Stang's, for that matter.

770
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,880
Or it could be the car,

771
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,140
or the team,

772
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,560
or toys,

773
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,640
or poison chemicals you put in your body,

774
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,320
or a paycheck.

775
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,040
Could be a paycheck.

776
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,300
Or a Betty Page all tied up.

777
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,020
Or jiggling body parts and automobiles smashing together.

778
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,320
It could even be Bob's face!

779
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,920
Well, actually, we haven't run anybody in quite that far.

780
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,280
But strange, strange things can fall into that blister.

781
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,720
And, you know, falling in love with somebody of the same sex might seem weird to you,

782
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,780
but it's a hell of a lot less weird than falling in love with,

783
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,440
for instance, little rectangular green pieces of paper.

784
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,860
Oh, praise Doctors for Bob.

785
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,780
Here in the background is Doctors for Bob cranking away.

786
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,120
Let's just let him do that for you.

787
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,360
Ah, there it goes.

788
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,420
I think we're mastering this.

789
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,760
That always happens before a fall.

790
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,300
Let's hear what Bill Carlyle has to say

791
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,280
in his wonderful, mortal country and western switch-hitting menage a trois number called

792
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,960
What Kind of Deal Is This?

793
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,840
Now, me and Liz was on our first date.

794
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,020
We was a-sittin' with this red light, a-havin' to wait.

795
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,400
And this old boy walked up with a big possum grin,

796
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,380
and he just opened the cargo room, called right in,

797
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,980
and I thought, what kind of deal is this?

798
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:07,420
You know, the thing that was gettin' me the most

799
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,300
was the way this old boy seemed to feel his own.

800
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,280
Man, he was really gettin' under my skin, a-sittin' over our heads.

801
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,680
With that big, stupid grin, and I thought, what kind of deal is this?

802
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,420
I got to wonderin' about this friend of Liz.

803
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,920
But I figured in a minute she'll tell me who he is.

804
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,660
But as we drove along, I thought, man, oh man,

805
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,040
cause me and him and Liz was all free of holdin' hands.

806
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,160
I thought, what kind of deal is this?

807
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,380
Now, I ain't too smart, but I could still see it.

808
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,940
This whole deal looked all fouled up to me.

809
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,260
So I thought I'd better stop it, man.

810
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,900
It's goin' too far, cause she was a-huggin' me,

811
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,960
and he was a-huggin' her, and I thought, what kind of deal is this?

812
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,940
Well, I knew it wasn't right, but what could I say?

813
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,080
I thought I'd just kinda let it go along that-a-way,

814
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,000
but pretty soon I seen I was out on a limb.

815
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,780
I couldn't kiss her without kissin' him and the man,

816
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,160
I thought, what kind of deal is this?

817
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,040
So I stopped the car and I said, look here, Liz,

818
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,140
you'd better tell me who this guy is.

819
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,140
She said, I don't know him.

820
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,680
I thought he was your friend.

821
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,220
I said, well, if you don't know him, what's he doin' here?

822
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,160
Then I thought, what kind of deal is this?

823
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,720
So I grabbed him by the collar and I choked him out of the car,

824
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,660
said, buddy, I ain't never seen nobody like you are.

825
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,200
How come you pull these kinda jokes?

826
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:47,620
He said, well, sometimes it works, sometimes it don't.

827
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,300
And I thought, what kind of deal is this?

828
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,520
Well, I drew back my fist to hit him in the face.

829
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,800
He broke and loose and outrun a snake.

830
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,560
So now here I stand just a-lookin' at Liz,

831
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,640
and both of us are wonderin' who this guy is.

832
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,040
Now, what kind of deal do you think this is?

833
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,480
If you find out, I wish you'd let me know.

834
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,060
Man, it's tore me up like a sow's bed.

835
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,640
You ain't nervin' for me.

836
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:11,640


837
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,520
You been tore up like a sow's bed.

838
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,100
You know what I mean, Nick.

839
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,120
Uh, friends.

840
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,620
You know, uh, believe it or not, strangely enough,

841
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,480
ours would actually tend to be an almost sweet,

842
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,640
almost romantic type of relationship.

843
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:48,200
If they didn't make us spend so much time hating.

844
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,820
But none of this half-assed, namby-pamby romance for us.

845
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,820
It has to be a sweaty, a strange, and fearsome romance.

846
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:03,220
Romance to inspire awe in both partners.

847
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,880
Or however many partners. Usually just two.

848
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,560
And not that variety is necessarily a replacement for quality.

849
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,780
A neurotic conspiracy-style promiscuity is the last resort

850
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:21,460
for those ignorant of the full gospel ooze squirt.

851
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:27,700
Bob is so open-minded, even monogamy is cool with him.

852
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,940
Like any good and decent religion,

853
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:39,560
this church of the subgenius is fanatical about traditional family values.

854
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,620
Subgenius style, that is.

855
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,880
Ain't nothing wrong with staying single and free,

856
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,340
living it up in sin.

857
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,720
But for those who must get hitched and, or have a litter or two,

858
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,260
understanding the subgenius fully extended nuclear family

859
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,060
is all-important.

860
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,040
The conspiracy idea of the nuclear family is, of course,

861
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,120
mom, dad, sis, and junior.

862
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,860
The subgenius extended nuclear family includes

863
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,960
auntie, uncle, grandpa,

864
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,720
gramps, cousins, step-neighbors-in-law,

865
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,820
and close friends, and Rover.

866
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,040
The subgenius fully extended nuclear family

867
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,480
is even more loving and nurturing.

868
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,720
For it includes not only all of the above,

869
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,300
but also mom's boyfriends, dad's girlfriends,

870
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:35,620
and little friends.

871
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,760
The garbage man, the mailman, the abortionist,

872
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,680
the rats in the alley, the prairie squid in a jar on the fridge,

873
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,480
and all their fully extended nuclear families,

874
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,440
and all their nuclear weapons.

875
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,840
For that matter, the lone subgenius agoraphobic

876
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,740
locked inside his own sealed chamber is also

877
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,320
a subgenius fully extended nuclear family.

878
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,040
Ideally,

879
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,780
each individual subgenius should be its own

880
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,120
fully extended nuclear family

881
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,980
with its own personal gun emplacements and warheads.

882
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,400
Uh, this music in the background, by the way,

883
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,040
is from Jay Condom's tape,

884
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,240
SOMBO FROP LAND.

885
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,980
See the subgenius catalog for details.

886
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,980
Anyway, you know, while traditional conspiracy, quote,

887
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,500
morality says that the pink nuclear family

888
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,160
is threatened by this doctrine of what is essentially

889
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,820
more love,

890
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,220
the subgenius sees it as enriched.

891
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,940
Although more love does seem to cause more fights as well.

892
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,500
Subgeniuses, as a result of the healthy exploration

893
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,760
of their own hate squared,

894
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,060
have the potential to be much more romantic,

895
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,760
loving, horny, and consequently,

896
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,700
more friendly and respectful than humans,

897
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,760
most of whom would be just as happy with Chinese-style

898
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,180
arranged marriages for all the difference it would make.

899
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,040
They're mostly interchangeable anyway,

900
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:29,020
like a bunch of Barbies and Kens who differ only in war-drone.

901
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,740
It doesn't really matter who the subgenius is,

902
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,860
because it's the same thing.

903
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,740
It's the same thing as a couple of couples who are

904
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:41,740


905
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:41,740


906
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,180
And that's why we strongly urge couples to invest in several

907
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,160
subgenius short-duration marriages and consummations

908
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,740
before even thinking about conspiracy legalities

909
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,820
and spiritual contracts.

910
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,960
A hundred test short-duration marriages or short-dur-mars,

911
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,580
even at retail, would be far, far cheaper

912
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,840
than even one conspiracy divorce.

913
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,560
You know, friends, it's kind of rough sometimes,

914
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,800
because we who are more yeti than others

915
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,440
sometimes must suffer the knowledge of not only the glory

916
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,500
of our true heritage, but the shame of our fall.

917
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:38,520
Indeed, that shame is all too often used as a rationalization

918
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:44,020
for demeaning ourselves by continuing to fornicate with the human

919
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,440
in lieu of fellow yetinsony.

920
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:53,000
A bit, my friends, like trying to forget that you're a...

921
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,420
Like drinking to forget you're a drunk.

922
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,200
Like drinking to forget you're a drunk.

923
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,840
Like drinking to forget you're a drunk.

924
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,480
Like drinking to forget you're a drunk.

925
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,800
Like drinking to forget you're a drunk.

926
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,760
Oh, dear friends, if you'd like more information about

927
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:24,020
the Church of the Subgenius, this show, or any of the subgenius books

928
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,820
and pamphlets, you can send off for free information to the address

929
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,980
I'm just about to give you.

930
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,520
Oh, yes, just send that self-addressed stamped envelope,

931
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,680
or even just drop a postcard.

932
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,500
To... Yeah, you got that pencil ready?

933
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,400
Just write to... Bob.

934
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,240
That's right, just the name Bob will get it here.

935
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:59,840
Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

936
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:03,460
75214.

937
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,720
Oh, yes, it feels strange to read that P.O. Box here in the home studio

938
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,220
instead of the old radio station studio, but my gobs will do it anyway.

939
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:20,540
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

940
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,220
Dallas, Texas.

941
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,440
75214.

942
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,000
75214.

943
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,080
A thank you and a praise, Batman.

944
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,440
Bob.

945
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,740
And now, a public service announcement from the American Slack Association.

946
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:59,260
Normality, the dread crippler of young minds, builds up slowly in a variety of ways,

947
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,880
from a variety of sources, eventually to clog completely your entire system.

948
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,940
Just as surely as grease, scum, garbage, and excrement,

949
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,320
or pornography and lingerie flush down the toilet in a sudden panic,

950
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,740
can clog your whole plumbing system.

951
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,440
Also, just as surely as cholesterol and Snickers bars can cause a plaque buildup

952
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,220
and eventual blockage in an artery leading to a heart attack.

953
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,940
A lack of slack attack can result in much the same way.

954
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,700
The scum of normality blocks the pipeways of mentality and the arteries of emotionality,

955
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,000
with a sticky gray gunk, impeding the natural flow of slack through your system.

956
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,040
If the flow of slack is completely blocked, the weirdness gland will soon fail to function,

957
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,080
and the whole imagination system could shut down.

958
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:44,320
A form of living death ensues, called normality.

959
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,140
You are then doomed.

960
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:53,040
Doomed to walk the earth as one of the hideous, undead, a wretched, loathsome normal.

961
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,720
But sometimes,

962
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,860
in a small percentage of cases,

963
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:03,100
a slack backup can build pressure until Bob breaks through.

964
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,160
The patient may not have even heard of Bob,

965
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,400
but he knows instinctively that normality is toxic,

966
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:16,120
and there must be another way, a non-normal way to health, beauty, and happiness.

967
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:23,340
The patient may then begin exercising the virility-spewing weirdness gland

968
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,700
at first sub-sensory.

969
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,220
Soon the patient is ready for high-impact imagination workouts.

970
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,360
Subliminal message, the Dobbs workout tapes makes an excellent Christmas gift.

971
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:37,620
Soon the patient is cultivating a state of pure, creative high weirdness,

972
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,880
which promotes the free flow of slack-carrying fluids

973
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,320
throughout the nervous and endocrine systems.

974
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,460
Then, one day,

975
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,040
a grinning sort of Hugh Beaumont father figure,

976
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,120
with an attractive Meerschaum pipe,

977
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,700
clinched, tight, and loose,

978
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,500
brightly in his teeth,

979
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,160
saunters up to you,

980
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,920
and screeches.

981
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,620
Hey, your mind is molding,

982
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,480
rotting,

983
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,920
your brain is liquefying.

984
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,280
It's running out your ear,

985
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,700
draining down your throat.

986
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,280
Look here, it's evaporating,

987
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,860
sublimating,

988
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,560
becoming steam,

989
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,460
leaking away,

990
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,620
right in front of your face.

991
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,960
You're dripping, excuse me.

992
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,340
There goes your brain, it's bubbling, it's glurgling,

993
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,440
it's glurgling, it's heading for the sewer.

994
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,360
You're out of control.

995
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,240
And hey, let's let Martin Mothersbaugh take us out

996
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,480
with the best version of the national anthem I've ever heard.

997
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,160
Let's get this sucker going.

998
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,260
We'll get you to cut.

999
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,200
I'm listening to this over there now.

1000
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,920
Well, I thought you had like this much more,

1001
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,580
okay, and then you switched the pitch or something.

1002
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,160
Let's see if you can—

1003
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,360
If you can guys write—

1004
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,860
Time to go to work.

1005
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,180
Start Royce.

1006
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,280
I got two new Soviet toys.

1007
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:23,420
G ph asta da, da de, da da.

1008
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,420


1009
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,560
Well, face it, it's all a sign of the end times.

1010
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,560
We're in the grips of the end times.

1011
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:03,320
We humans do not see with our eyes or hear with our ears,

1012
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,520
but that we both see and hear with our mind.

1013
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,880
You need to do what you want.

1014
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,980
Good, I'm going to walk your mind.

1015
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,640
Beat it into submission.

1016
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,500
Burdenless a body blow.

1017
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,640
You get the slack in the arm, you get the back slip.

1018
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,460
Cultivate the highest.

1019
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,940
Blah, the slack.

1020
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,340
Make it a living art form.

1021
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,720
Make your life a work of high weirdness.

1022
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,220
Well, when you play pairs like that, you better duck.

1023
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,060
It's gonna be a little sick.

1024
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,180
It's that there Church of the Subgenius kind of deal.

1025
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,840
It's Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

1026
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:43,600
Everybody.

1027
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,720
All prepared.

1028
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,140
We must endeavor to permeate every facet of American society.

1029
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,800
Amen.

1030
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,540
It got crowded in the closet, so we're finally coming out.

1031
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:16,040
We're thumping on our bibles and building up our clouds.

1032
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,580
We're all the Lord's lieutenants and there's nothing we can't do.

1033
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:25,000
To prove it, we're now making our political debut.

1034
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,380
Oh, we're the moral majority.

1035
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,780
We're holier than thou.

1036
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,140
By God, we're here to tell you what we will and won't allow.

1037
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,900
We're out to purge the nation of its humanistic bent.

1038
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,460
A separate church and state, we've simply given up our left.

1039
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,060
Around this time, a kindly reverend came along.

1040
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,560
He asked me if I knew Bob as my professor.

1041
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,180
He was my personal savior.

1042
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Of course, I recoiled at such a thing.

1043
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,520
Oh, no, I said.

1044
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:56,820
I gave at the office.

1045
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:01,380
Well, he patiently told me he knew of my inner turmoil.

1046
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,200
He gave me a phone number.

1047
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,340
Just a phone number.

1048
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,860
Counselors will be available day and night, he told me.

1049
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,060
I prepared to toss it away.

1050
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,700
After all, I could make it on my own.

1051
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,020
I didn't need Bob.

1052
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,200
But having the number began to pull at me.

1053
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,120
I, one lonely night.

1054
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,460
Went over to the computer and with shaky fingers,

1055
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,000
dialed the number of Bulldada BBS.

1056
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,440
Somehow, I made it to the subgenius files.

1057
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,620
Reading through them, I knew I had arrived home.

1058
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,880
They were talking about me.

1059
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,980
I just had to join.

1060
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,840
I knelt down and said in a loud cry,

1061
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,640
Oh, Bob, I know now.

1062
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,680
A heavenly sound tinkled in my ears.

1063
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,860
