1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,160
Are we in a movie?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,040
Everything's a movie.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,780
Talking pictures.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,900
That's all it is.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,300
Talking pictures.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,700
Huh?

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,960
Cheesy dreams.

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,080
While Huckleberry Finn goes fishing on the edge of the moon.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,560
Who's Ben Johnson?

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,460
He's in The Last Picture Show.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,000
Just like us.

12
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,160
Don't move, my love.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Be still.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:30,980
Be real.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,080
He's gone.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,520
Tuesday, 2018 o'clock.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,400
Resuming work.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,160
As a result of stripping skin off the skull,

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
keeping clean and keeping at the required temperature,

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,140
the bones have become crystalline.

21
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,240
I may now begin reconstruction of the physiognomy whenever I please.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,920
In the ancient folk legends, tales are told of blood-sucking vampires.

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,160
Is man now doomed to produce a race of ever-living monstrosities?

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,020
Worse than the vampires of legend?

25
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,060
Such questions, mate.

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,800
Whether or not science Lak sir 굉장히 fanciful,

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,760
at this very moment,

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,500
scientists are

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,920
working on in part to brain transplantation,

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,420
and distance 1971,

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,000
human bodies are used.

32
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,060
This girl was buried in the nearby cemetery yesterday.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,140
Only a few hours ago,

34
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,260
her body was stolen

35
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,920
and brought to this hidden laboratory.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,900
He had grafted a living animal's brain

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,560
into this newly dead body.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,040
The brain cells have been reactivated by

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,820
the subgenius,

40
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:16,680
This Hour of Slack number 1826 is a rerun of 1147 from 2008 because I'm busy on an Hour of Slack improvement project.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,980
Since around 2005, I've been using a series of ever-larger external hard drives to stash show audio files on, and also movies, photos, and art, and so forth.

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,040
And I bought me a 14-terabyte drive for the same price a 1-gigabyte drive was in the year 2000.

43
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,220
And I've copied all of the audio from all of those smaller drives onto the one huge drive.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,840
I still have to interweave the files and folders from each drive into 10 or so main categories,

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,660
while also copying many dozens of even older data CD audio files, which go back to 1999.

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,000
So far, I've filled up 3 terabytes.

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,520
I'm also doing the same thing to photos and graphics,

48
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,960
trying to get all the eggs into just...

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,560
the right baskets.

50
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,520
Others will thank me after I'm dead.

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,880
And now, Hour of Slack number 1147,

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,280
FrankenCoffee vs. FrankenChenkem.

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,660
Horrified

54
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:51,580
Tracy in highness voice.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,680
However, you'll pay in other ways.

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,760
For instance, the number of brain cells that you have to kill just to take enough pills to be able to bear this show in the middle of the night.

57
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,060
Why, that in itself is quite expensive.

58
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,960
That bear is repeating.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,920
Yes, well, most people are lucky they don't have to listen to this thing every night like Uberbrow.

60
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,340
Day in, day out.

61
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,280
That poor boy not only has to listen to it every night, he has to broadcast it every night.

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,180
From his secret cubicle, hundreds of miles under solid rock.

63
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,860
Weird, weird, weird, weird, yes.

64
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,000
The little brow is so weird.

65
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,960
And yet, they kept on.

66
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,740
Nobody knew why.

67
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,460
I love this Uber.

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,980
His brow is so weird.

69
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,900
And if he won't pinch me, I'll hide in his beard.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,240
I hid under his stool to look at his feet.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,960
But could not get out.

72
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,860
For I fell upon the seat.

73
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,060
The implied adventure that the doctors had in their voices.

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,720
They knew something spooky and scary was about to happen.

75
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, that wasn't it.

76
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,600
Not even the baby breaking out of my little glass brain.

77
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,700
Yes, the little babies were hard to find in the morning.

78
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,600
Because the U-Haul trucks would come and take them away.

79
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,360
Their little china bodies lay shattered on the midden heaps of society.

80
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,380
Yes, but they all looked alike.

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,400
And they were filled with little nylon things.

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,540
And little spooky eyes.

83
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,740
They came in little boxes.

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,840
And the people fought and kicked and prayed and shot to get one.

85
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,640
But there was nothing they could do.

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,440
But be scared, of course.

87
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,860
And being scared in Berkeley is sort of a way of life.

88
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,180
Just ask the new revitalized 53rd Street Winos Association.

89
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,240
Really? Being terrorized?

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah.

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,940
It's something you'll be watching.

92
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,120
Watching now as we sturgutate our way to madness.

93
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,720
Where's Billy?

94
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,780
Just give me what's in that bag right now.

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,000
Here on the only show brave enough to bring the facts to you.

96
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,800
These are coffee winos.

97
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,280
They don't drink alcohol.

98
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,060
They drink more and more advanced grades of coffee.

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,560
Yes, Doctor. We call them coffeenos.

100
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:14,420
This old coffeeno here is holding what looks like a can of Colombian ground coffee.

101
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,540
I have coffee!

102
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,080
I've got to wait for you.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,620
Do something.

104
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,060
I know you just spent it on coffee.

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,000
More spilt of sugar, please.

106
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,280
I'm going to finally see the truth.

107
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,720
Yes, those who wouldn't say please, they were forced to take other forms of entertainment.

108
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,760
And to perform humiliating jests and actions and acts.

109
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,540
Immigrant.

110
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,800
At weird hours of the morning.

111
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,140
The American area.

112
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,820
Little tiny doctors.

113
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,700
My mind.

114
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,880
Okay, now what are my instructions?

115
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,060
What was I going to do?

116
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,000
This I...

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,320
I always have to look up what it says in the program book so I know what...

118
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,380
I said I was going to...

119
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,720
Adventures in sickening.

120
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,800
Subgenius preachers are skilled at both healings and sickenings.

121
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,020
Although they're not necessarily performed in that order.

122
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,820
Reverend Stang...

123
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,980
Oh, so this is what I'm going to do.

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,160
Reverend Stang will explain various Dobbs approved techniques.

125
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,260
Such as, transferal of pain.

126
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,640
The laying on of sledgehammers.

127
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,160
Acubating.

128
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,180
Frame straightening.

129
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,800
Blemish readings.

130
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,060
And most importantly, excremeditation.

131
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:35,120
He will also take questions from the audience and has interesting proctology slides if anyone wants to see them.

132
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,980
Well, that's...

133
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm done.

134
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,400
That was all the gags.

135
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,720
I put them all in that one.

136
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,660
So I shot my load, I'd say.

137
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,380
Okay, no.

138
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,440
Really, the subject is...

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,940
Slack, Muzak, and transformative embarrassment.

140
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
Courtesy of Chickenhead.

141
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,460
Praise Chickenhead.

142
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,780
Oh no, these are the wrong cult.

143
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,500
These are notes for the wrong cult.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm sorry about that.

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,140
Oh, here it is.

146
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,540
Church of the Subgenius.

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,220
That's the right cult, friends.

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,840
And this is its right show.

149
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,120
It's proven by the fact that it exploits all the other subgenius shows.

150
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,160
There have been so many of those lately.

151
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,960
I don't think we can categorize them into sections.

152
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:29,740
For instance, this episode of Hour of Slack features the category of drugs, and especially the drug coffee.

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,720
Our last completely legal one, for now.

154
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,600
We have been and will continue to hear collages by Fernanda Nani-Lemur,

155
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,840
my sermon at Winterstar Symposium,

156
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,240
the amino acids, as heard in the background,

157
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
puzzling evidence shows from Berkeley,

158
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
both very old and very new,

159
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,860
with Philo, Gary, Doug, and Hal, and K-Rob, and John Hell.

160
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,600
But those are from John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio.

161
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,080
Remember, all Pirate Cat Radio shows are archived for six weeks at piratecatradio.com,

162
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,460
so you can hear this here, here.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
You may already be listening to this here, here.

164
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,360
What is the proper name of the show?

165
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,640
A Season in Hell.

166
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,400
A Season in Hell.

167
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,740
So you just go to the DJ schedule, scroll down, click on it,

168
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,260
and there's the date you listen to the show.

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,100
And what do you know?

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
And podcast it? That's what I was like.

171
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,100
Sure, I throw mine on.

172
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,900
Everybody except me, though. That's what I do.

173
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,520
Hold on, we're going to isolate you now.

174
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,300
Isolation, Jamie.

175
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,100
That's my kind of show. Just me, Jim, all the time.

176
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,400
I hear lunch in Carolina.

177
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,500
That's all we're going to hear.

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,860
You can put this show up if you want to as well.

179
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,920
I just told the listeners that that's what I have.

180
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah, right, right. So it's already there.

181
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,140
The Winkers.

182
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,720
Sorry. It was the other show.

183
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,240
The other three conversations that I was listening to at the time.

184
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,500
The preserves in the basement.

185
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,440
Preserve the show for the winner.

186
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,900
In the jar.

187
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,200
With the brown bread and the baked beans.

188
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
Goes in the jar with the stuff.

189
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,760
Don't look too closely at that jar and its content.

190
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,360
Don't think about the wall.

191
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,540
Is that an eyeball?

192
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,460
Bridge, some hair.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Is that back to what you were talking about, the jar in the bathroom?

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,660
The jar.

195
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,000
Jar of Jenkum. Jenkum jar.

196
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:14,720
Yeah, Super Jenkum Hayes was the winner at the front.

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:14,720


198
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,740
I think it was the prop cup in Amsterdam.

199
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,860
What about G13 Hayes? Was that the same thing?

200
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,700
That was the marijuana and the cannabis cup.

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Ah, I see.

202
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,200
They didn't have a Jenkum category at the cannabis cup.

203
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,460
Is Jenkum still available here? Can you still get Jenkum over the counter?

204
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,400
You can make it yourself, Daddy.

205
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,220
That's about it.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,600
Well, now we can get Absinthe over the counter again.

207
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
Makes the heart go fun.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,200
You can?

209
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,580
What?

210
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,480
It was made legal again last week.

211
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,640
They made it legal?

212
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,020
Nationally or just?

213
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,560
Nationally.

214
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,720
It is a legal alcoholic beverage.

215
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
The official beverage of Learning Man is legal.

216
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,780
The store's closed.

217
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,000
At 2.

218
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,200
We all got two hours of show time.

219
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,080
Hurry up.

220
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,060
I got the sugar cubes.

221
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,120
I've been known to chase the dragon.

222
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,260
A CD.

223
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,640
Yeah.

224
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,160
Yeah.

225
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,940
Yeah.

226
00:10:59,940 --> 00:10:59,940


227
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,120


228
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:04,820
Yeah.

229
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah.

230
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,560


231
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:05,580


232
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,620


233
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,620


234
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,620


235
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,620


236
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


237
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


238
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


239
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


240
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:05,680


241
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:05,900
Yeah.

242
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,060
Yeah.

243
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,520
Yeah.

244
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,140
We're a team again.

245
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,180
Yeah.

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,180


247
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah.

248
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
I get it, I get it.

249
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,780
They all have

250
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,020
broughtENDEALTY to Gありがとうございました.

251
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,580
That low-down snake and him pretending to be my friend.

252
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,180
Pretending to be my friend.

253
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,180
Well, we do have the theme of this whole show here is healing and so forth,

254
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,340
and we've already sickened you.

255
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,340
I had a couple of things that have been of interest to me.

256
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,980
I read a newspaper article a couple of months ago

257
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,860
explaining that some folks at Case Western University in Cleveland

258
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,300
had created some Franken-mice.

259
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,420
You know, the human genome has been mapped.

260
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,380
That's pretty complicated.

261
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,700
They actually finished the job pretty much.

262
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,380
And although it's against the law to do Franken-humans yet,

263
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,580
well, we'll get to that.

264
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,100
But these little mice that they had created in this lab

265
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,220
or had tweaked, you might say,

266
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,120
they were way more aggressive than normal mice.

267
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,740
They also lived like twice as long

268
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,000
and could keep reproducing for twice as long as normal mice.

269
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,980
And they fought constantly.

270
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,240
One of the women who had been working with them said that

271
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,060
when she knew they were different,

272
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,440
because whenever he lifted the lid off their cage,

273
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,320
it was like a popcorn, lifting a lid off of popping popcorn.

274
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,860
They were just going mad.

275
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,500
And so, you know, we've all heard about the Franken-corn,

276
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,440
and so forth.

277
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,500
I mean, that's being done.

278
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,940
You can actually create new species now

279
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,620
and also trademark them.

280
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,940
You can create a bundle of cells

281
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,460
that'll just sit there and generate something useful

282
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,300
like medicine or drugs,

283
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,660
but you can trademark it.

284
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,340
Of course, this brings to mind

285
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,240
what so many sci-fi movies and TV shows have already covered.

286
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,620
The Franken-soldiers, right?

287
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,300
Franken-cops.

288
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,480
I have super macho...

289
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,520
or whatever kind of person you want.

290
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,040
You want just a muscle man

291
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,760
that doesn't mind doing dull work?

292
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,760
You can create those.

293
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,380
Aldous Huxley had it all down with Brave New World.

294
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,880
Our grandparents read about that.

295
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,980
They didn't think about Franken-salesmen.

296
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,720
They didn't think about Franken-politicians.

297
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,560
But I read recently

298
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,120
that now...

299
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,140
that there were some guys in France

300
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,780
and also some people in some other places

301
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,160
who were trying to map,

302
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,980
completely map the genome of the coffee plant.

303
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,620
And thus leading to Franken-coffee, right?

304
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,280
Coffee that could be grown...

305
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,360
that had no caffeine

306
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,820
or that had five times as much caffeine

307
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,200
or that had more of a coffee-ish taste.

308
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,460
Right now, there's really only two main species of coffee,

309
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,040
I believe, that people consume.

310
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,440
And in a couple of years,

311
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,600
there may be some radically different coffees around.

312
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,520
So then that brings us to the Franken-pot!

313
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,980
The Franken-oregano.

314
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,500
You know, I was really thinking more of the Franken-pot myself.

315
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,840
They bred that stuff.

316
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,980
We went to the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam

317
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,480
this last year.

318
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,480


319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,480


320
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,480


321
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,240
Last time.

322
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,200
It wasn't the kind of thing that I would spend my own money on,

323
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,240
but we lucked out.

324
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,760
We had a friend who...

325
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,100
He went to every coffee shop on the map,

326
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,700
bought every super strong grade of marijuana and hash.

327
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,840
And...

328
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,300
But what this guy didn't know

329
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,580
was how to get around Amsterdam.

330
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,400
Well, we knew how to get around Amsterdam.

331
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,660
So frankly, if you...

332
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,380
If I was a judge at that thing,

333
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600
I would only say...

334
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,140
I would say the same thing about every single contestant,

335
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,840
which is,

336
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,340
this shit is strong.

337
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,040
Strong as hell.

338
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,860
That is about all you could say.

339
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,320
I personally am more interested in the Franken-jenkum.

340
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,200
And if you don't know what the jenkum is,

341
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,780
don't even ask.

342
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,020
Don't think about it.

343
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,780
Don't look it up on the internet.

344
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,360
It's a new drug that they say the kids are doing.

345
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,160
Don't look it up.

346
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,640
Don't look up jenkum.

347
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,920
J-E-N-K-E-M.

348
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,320
J-E-N-K-E-M.

349
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,800
And don't even think about the Franken-jenkum.

350
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,300
I take off.

351
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,840
I take off.

352
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,180
Drugs.

353
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,400
Drugs.

354
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,280
I got a better ride.

355
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,580
Die.

356
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,780
Die.

357
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,000
Die.

358
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,220
Die.

359
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,400
Die.

360
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:15,680
Die.

361
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:15,940
Die.

362
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Die.

363
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,120
Die.

364
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,180
Die.

365
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,460

366
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,860
This time we went to die.

367
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:18,920
Fixed.

368
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,440
Fixed.

369
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,100
No matter.

370
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,600
No matter.

371
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,120
Chewable.

372
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,620
Chewable.

373
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,860
Deadly heartworm disease.

374
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,680
Protein.

375
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,140
Protein.

376
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,420
Fat.

377
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:26,560
Fat.

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,480
Demand.

379
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:27,940
Demand.

380
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,120
Nick.

381
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,720
Directed by Steven Spielberg.

382
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,580
Bunny.

383
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:30,820
Bunny.

384
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,800
And I want everybody in town to come.

385
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:33,960
Drug.

386
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,220
Drug.

387
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,820
The next thing I know here she is on drugs.

388
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,300
Bunny.

389
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,820
You have lost your mind.

390
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,160
Bud.

391
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,800
Hurry.

392
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:41,860
I'm coming.

393
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,940
I'm coming.

394
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,640
Bunny.

395
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,780
Bunny's dead.

396
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,360
Dead.

397
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,920
Dead.

398
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,300
Crazy.

399
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,360
Bunny.

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,480
Bunny.

401
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,240
Bunny.

402
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,060
Bunny.

403
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,020
Bunny.

404
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,220
Where are you?

405
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,980
Bunny.

406
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,140
Bunny?

407
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,720
Bunny.

408
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,620
Bunny.

409
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:54,980
Bunny.

410
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,640
Bunny.

411
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,040
Bunny.

412
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,400
Bunny.

413
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,700
Bunny.

414
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:56,960
Bunny.

415
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,080
Bunny.

416
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,280
Bunny.

417
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,380


418
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,460
Bunny.

419
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:57,540
Bunny.

420
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:57,540


421
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:57,640
Bunny.

422
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:57,640


423
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:57,880
Bunny.

424
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:57,880


425
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,120
Bunny.

426
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,120


427
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,120


428
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,120


429
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,120


430
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,140


431
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,140


432
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,320
Bunny.

433
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,400
Say yes to beautiful.

434
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,920
Cool.

435
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,520
Doom, doom, doom.

436
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Okay, we're taking our coffee shots now.

437
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,900
What if you did 12 of those things really fast?

438
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:18,640
You can't.

439
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,680
You went in there and you paid the money before the guy even took your money.

440
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,840
He's like, rip, rip, rip.

441
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,040
Yeah, I found a new drug today.

442
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,900
I haven't been in a proper 7-Eleven in years.

443
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,980
I think we'd like that.

444
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,220
Because they don't have proper 7-Elevens in Cleveland.

445
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,700
But they had a drug called Stoke, which is included with the coffee creamers in the little cup.

446
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,120
The kids today are on Stoke.

447
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,180
Which means it's free.

448
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,560
That means it's free.

449
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,000
That's right.

450
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,460
I grabbed two half-fulls.

451
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,440
You have hot water.

452
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,020
You stoke it with hot water and you make coffee out of it.

453
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
Each one of these little things.

454
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,040
When you held a Stoke baby in your hands, then you know how it is.

455
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,760
I can tell you, man.

456
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,440
These Stoke heads have to be knocked in or our civilization is going to fall.

457
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:13,320
The target in Erie, Pennsylvania is inhabited entirely by Stoke babies.

458
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,480
Stoke fetal syndrome.

459
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,680
Look at his feet.

460
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,500
Each Stoke has 40 milligrams of caffeine.

461
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,820
Which really is, that's only like half a cup of coffee.

462
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
That's for wimps.

463
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,500
That half a cup of coffee.

464
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,580
Is that what all the big build-up cups do?

465
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:29,740
Right.

466
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,320
But it's free.

467
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,620
Free?

468
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,340
It's free.

469
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,640
At 7-Eleven.

470
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,380
Thanks to the Southland Corporation.

471
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,400
Free drugs.

472
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,760
40 milligrams of caffeine.

473
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,140
Wait a minute.

474
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,100
Was I supposed to say that on KPFA?

475
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,400
That was not, uh, don't go to 7-Eleven.

476
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,340
It does sound suspiciously like Plagola, Stang, but we know that it's only a matter of fair use.

477
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,740
In the name of WCSB Cleveland, do not go to 7-Eleven.

478
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,340
There used beneath the tree is thou canst not leave thy soul.

479
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,260
If you do, you'll be surrounded by caffeine and sugar, both.

480
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,540
Both are exceptionally valuable substances.

481
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,440
Sugar, nature's perfect food.

482
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,700
Just a bunch of little noises.

483
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,140
And caffeine, the perfect vitamin.

484
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,000
Vitamin?

485
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,300
That's what vitamin C stands for.

486
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,920
Yes, yes.

487
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,280
I, uh, have spent too many years in headphones and in front of my friends' bands videotaping them.

488
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,260
So, I hear what sounds like crickets and cicadas all the time.

489
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Now, I grew up in Texas, and there really are cicadas all the time.

490
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,560
But one winter's day, Princess Wee there suddenly said,

491
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,760
Did you hear that?

492
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,560
And I listened, and I went,

493
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
Yeah, I hear the cicadas.

494
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,040
And I looked outside, and it was like this.

495
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,560
It was like snow on the ground.

496
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,980
And I realized that it was time to go see the ear doctor.

497
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,240
And I flunked the test.

498
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,600
But I found some good news in this issue of Nutrition Action magazine.

499
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,020
This is one of the kookzines that my wife gets.

500
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,280
She reads Utney Reader and all this silly stuff.

501
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,300
And, um, this special issue about caffeine,

502
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,980
it turns out, I mean, I drink a lot of coffee.

503
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,720
I drank so much coffee that my, I started getting migraines and bad headaches.

504
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,020
So I went to my doctor and said,

505
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,680
I have headaches.

506
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,700
She said, So, you drink a lot of coffee, do ya?

507
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,280
And she didn't even have to ask why.

508
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,200
And I said, Yeah.

509
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,540
She wrote me out a prescription for half,

510
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,480
for a type of decaf she likes.

511
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,820
She said, I know you're not going to stop drinking real coffee.

512
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,520
Just cut it with decaf.

513
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,320
Step on it. Mix half and half.

514
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,520
And I was able to drink 20 cups instead of 10.

515
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,260
And never get headaches.

516
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,420
But I always felt bad about it because,

517
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,440
Oh, I'll probably get colon cancer someday,

518
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,340
or hypertension or something.

519
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,520
But it turns out,

520
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,120
my fellow coffee drinkers can be so glad to hear this.

521
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,520
All these studies, it has turned out,

522
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,000
caffeine or coffee, the two different things,

523
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,960
but coffee basically helps present Parkinson's disease,

524
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,760
gallstones, it actually does help your mental performance

525
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,260
if you're sleepy and your mood, of course.

526
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,200
And headaches.

527
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,480
It increases the effects of painkillers.

528
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,320
It's not good for pregnant ladies.

529
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,720
No way is it good for pregnant ladies.

530
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,680
And it won't counteract alcohol.

531
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,700
I repeat, it won't counteract alcohol.

532
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,600
Try to remember that at about 5 or 6 this morning, my friends.

533
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,740
But it turns out, I was wrong.

534
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,180
All these studies show that it doesn't correlate to heart disease.

535
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,180


536
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,800
It doesn't correlate to any kind of cancer, especially.

537
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,020
Or diabetes, or high blood pressure, or osteoporosis.

538
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,940
And it doesn't stunt your growth,

539
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,860
which is what my mom always used to say.

540
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,820
And I believed her, too.

541
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,800
And that's why I'm not taller than I am.

542
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,080
And PMS.

543
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,800
There's no evidence that caffeine played a role in PMS.

544
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,440
Well, duh.

545
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,140
Anyway, it was a really interesting little article.

546
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,400
I learned from it that Starbucks coffee, the 16 ounce one,

547
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,440
has the highest charge you can get, 330 milligrams of caffeine.

548
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,240
That would put me in the hospital.

549
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,800
If I drank it all at once, if I drank three of them in one day,

550
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,220
nothing, I could probably go to sleep.

551
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,580
So that was why I brought up the Franken-coffee routine.

552
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,780
I am really looking forward to it.

553
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,460
I am looking forward now to the Franken-coffee.

554
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,020
The first time I met Sir Isaac Bonowitz over there,

555
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,100
I didn't even know who he was exactly,

556
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,240
but he offered me some coffee.

557
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,040
And I heard for the first time that little coffee chant

558
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,940
based on the mentat.

559
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,680
It was the goddess Caffeina routine,

560
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
which I never could remember,

561
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,200
because I don't just drink coffee.

562
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,760
I can tell you, I can't tell you right off the head,

563
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,300
I mean the tip of my head,

564
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,080
quote Princess Riardo.

565
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,120
Anybody want any stoke?

566
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,860
What happens when you consume this?

567
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,500
Warning, high caffeine.

568
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,460
You add it to your coffee.

569
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,280
Is it like a little creamer package?

570
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,740
But you can just toss it down?

571
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,780
I wouldn't, yeah, if you don't mind migraine,

572
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,320
headache type effects.

573
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,180
Nonsense.

574
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,740
Go ahead, do it, Isaac.

575
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,280
I'll do it.

576
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,200
Well, I would, but I mean, I've got a pie in the oven.

577
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,260
I mean, these nosebleeds keep me on my back.

578
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,520
No, the thing is, is it edible?

579
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,100
Not for pregnant men.

580
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,540
Give it some horrible thing, you know, some hideous...

581
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,460
How do you happen to have this in your pocket?

582
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,800
Well, I will, I'll drink it right now.

583
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,900
Dr. Howell.

584
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,860
Here we go.

585
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,780
Sip it, please.

586
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,340
Don't just shoot the whole thing.

587
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,660
I wonder what this will be like.

588
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,600
Hey, Puzzling Evidence TV sent me a video.

589
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,340
Well, what it tastes like is prune juice.

590
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,180
You sure it's not?

591
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:20,400
Really?

592
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,620
What a thing that may have never happened.

593
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,660
Let me have a little, a little tiny...

594
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,800
I'm reading it now.

595
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,340
And I bet it's about...

596
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,780
It tastes like a prune juice.

597
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,760
...about JFK dying.

598
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,100
But it says that this video has been removed...

599
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,300
It does taste...

600
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,840
...with a violation.

601
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,620
...stoked.

602
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,140
Which one is it?

603
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,240
This isn't caffeine-infected...

604
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,140
That's happening more and more.

605
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:36,620
...water.

606
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,500
It's mere prune juice.

607
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:38,880
Oh, my God.

608
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,560
...endemnable...

609
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,280
Ivan Stank's melting.

610
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,700
...prune juice.

611
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,840
Prune juice?

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,900
Well, it's, uh...

613
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,040
That's one thing about YouTube is that their policy of removing videos is real

614
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,320
necessary.

615
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,340


616
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,500
...and that's why it's called Nebulous.

617
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,460
Yeah.

618
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:50,820
Nebulous entity.

619
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,400
Well, it's who gets...

620
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,240
...who gets recorded and who gets caught.

621
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,920
It's sort of like what one of us was running in.

622
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,460
Yeah, take it out.

623
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,320
...equivalent to one shot of espresso.

624
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,820
But there's, there's porno YouTube.

625
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,260
There's uncensored YouTube-ish things.

626
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,900
There's RedTube...

627
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,660
40 milligrams of caffeine.

628
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,720
...which, uh, is, and PinkTube.

629
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,860
And YouPorn.

630
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeah, YouPorn, that's right.

631
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,820
Not for...

632
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,900
Whenever I look at one of those websites...

633
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,320
Those under 18...

634
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,320
...there's a whole special window that comes up showing girls I could date in clean...

635
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,540
...leave...

636
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,180
...caffeine.

637
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,360
Yeah, it knows, it knows which city I'm in, and it shows me all these nice, like...

638
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,880
It knows it.

639
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,020
It shows you these nice pictures you could make...

640
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,940
It knows where your IP address is being served from.

641
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,980
And I try to make love to each and every one of those...

642
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,880
...because I feel that responsibility.

643
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,560
I mean...

644
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,160
You know what I do?

645
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,260
Well, they're lonely...

646
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,080
...it says they're lonely, single women.

647
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,760
Plus, you get all these pills in the mail, in the email, these, these special pills for

648
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,500
your tool...

649
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,200
...non-dairy coffee products.

650
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
...your tool pills.

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,520
Yeah, well...

652
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,080
You know, well...

653
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,400
And then when you meet the women on the other website, you've got something really handy

654
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
to use with them.

655
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:54,720
I'll just drink all the rest of this.

656
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,140
Yeah, you gotta do it that way because...

657
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,760
Dr. Howell is drinking the...

658
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:57,940
...it's all virtual.

659
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,580
...the stoke.

660
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,940
Oh, he's drinking the virtual stoke.

661
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,320
He's having a power drink.

662
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:01,980
Dr. Stoke.

663
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,160
Now, that's 40 milligrams of caffeine in one swallow.

664
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,660
Caller, what do you think of this?

665
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
The show is like...

666
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,540
Yee-haw!

667
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,460
...purple syrup on pancakes...

668
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,880
You got it.

669
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
...and strong coffee.

670
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,700
Yeah.

671
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,460
Now you're talking.

672
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,820
Even if JFK dies...

673
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,900
Look at Howell.

674
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,980
He's, he's changing.

675
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,200
He's changing.

676
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,580
He's changing.

677
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:17,740
...and he's drinking the virtual stoke.

678
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,520
My God, man.

679
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,860
Somebody call the guards.

680
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,920
Now, do you ever use molasses on your pancakes?

681
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,900
Have you ever tried that?

682
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,000
Molasses?

683
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,360
What about sorghum?

684
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,420
Sorghum molasses.

685
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,060
I mean, stuff I don't eat anymore.

686
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,800
This country used to be great.

687
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm too sensible now.

688
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,680
You don't eat?

689
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,560
Are you a breath alien?

690
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:31,940
Excuse me?

691
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,500
Sensible?

692
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,740
Not eating pancakes?

693
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,980
I am sore strapped for sorghum and molasses.

694
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,760
I, me too.

695
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,080
...and vegetables and fruits.

696
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Vegetables, fruits, fruitas y verduras.

697
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,740
Yeah.

698
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:46,960
Yeah.

699
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:46,960


700
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:46,960


701
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:46,960


702
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:46,960


703
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,480
Mostly vegetarian.

704
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,640
Vegetar-da-da-ba-ba-ba.

705
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,020
You can still eat pancakes, though.

706
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,180
Pancakes?

707
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,400
Oh, well, I realize some people can divert themselves with that.

708
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:57,860
In moderation.

709
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,780
Yeah, so I'm going to try these caffeine potato chips.

710
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,820
Really?

711
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,860
These chips are pure stoke chips.

712
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,340
Well, they're caffeine chips.

713
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,460
They're caffeine chips made from coffee beans, and they've also had powdered caffeine added

714
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,160
to them with citric acid.

715
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,620
Oh, my God.

716
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:11,620


717
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,560
We're going to have to peel these guys off the ceiling here.

718
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,960
I've noticed that caffeine drinks are not as good as the ones that are sold in the

719
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:16,960


720
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:16,960


721
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:16,960


722
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,160
store.

723
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,260
Well, I'll tell you what, these drinks have become, are in a huge variety now and in huge

724
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:30,780
volumes and mixed with alcohol, which Bob predicted 10,000 years ago that there would

725
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:37,880
come a day when speed and booze were mixed together and sold in Safeway stores with names

726
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,380
like Big Throttle, Monster Jug, Booze Speed.

727
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,860
You're witness Mr. Freud.

728
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,480
Monster Jugs, Booze Speed.

729
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,780
Booze Speed.

730
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,840
got Philo's attention.

731
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,820
Remember, today we've got an awesome guest.

732
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,240
His name is Bob.

733
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,560
I first met Bob, well, wasn't I in each about

734
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,300
10 years ago? 1984.

735
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,160
Yeah.

736
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,360
Most incredibly.

737
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,240
And I remember blah, blah, blah.

738
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,020
No bones about it, you know.

739
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,680
You know, there's something

740
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,580
about Bob dedicated to achieving

741
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,320
drugs. So, Bob

742
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,980
was born and raised in...

743
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,480
Bob joined the drug abuse.

744
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,720
So, Bob is understanding steroids.

745
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,580
Bob, a drug that targets

746
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,620
young people as well as parents and other adults.

747
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,380
Bob calls it the make-and-treat

748
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,300
and prescription drugs broadly available

749
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,820
to the youth in every community.

750
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,720
Boy, that's an awesome

751
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,640
mouthful of stuff you've been

752
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:30,880
doing.

753
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,640
So, I'm totally

754
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,560
stoked about it. Bob. There was lots of drugs.

755
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,040
Acid rock and the whole bit.

756
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,180
Call, call, call, call. Drugs are

757
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,040
the solution. The solution. Evolution

758
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,200
in the early years. Clandestinish, but

759
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,600
add drugs to the mix and you get strength.

760
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,960
The testes secrete the most amount of

761
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,660
testosterone and I've seen it and I hope

762
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,420
I'm not getting too deep here. Profound.

763
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,580
Psychoactive. Psycho. Psycho. And I've

764
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,380
observed it myself and they just kind of

765
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,500
bang around ball. Injected in the butt.

766
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,080
Fat in the brain. Really feeling the

767
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,400
organ. Becoming that organ. They are

768
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,080
matter, energy, space, and time. And they're

769
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,480
hideous. Hardening of the long bone. Oh,

770
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,900
it's huge. Burn it off. Come on UPS and

771
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,600
bogus. Don't know what, don't know what

772
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,940
phony packaging. Big business. Have LSD

773
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,320
and pot and... We have more drug...

774
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,000
We have more drug... Better.

775
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,500
Marijuana. Marijuana. Methamphetamines.

776
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,020
Methamphetamine. Crystal meth.

777
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,880
Methamphetamine, but crack. Crack. Smoking.

778
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,340
Paint thinner. One hit. Unreal. Crystal meth.

779
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
And we showed a video on ecstasy. It's

780
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,260
just for partying. Complete curriculum.

781
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
How to, how to use glitz with a class of

782
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,580
drugs. And how to deliver that. www.yestrugs.org.

783
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,360
Get it all. Get it all. Drugs and harmful

784
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,220
effects is, is really our duty. Utterly

785
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,980
enormous. People, they try to get

786
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,440
stimulated. Fear, fear, fear, fear. Which is

787
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,240
huge. I think it's the largest. They're

788
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,320
fairly abstract. Bob, no. Don't forget, you

789
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,400
know, drugs. Have a good day. One of the

790
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
worst things about drugs, friends, is

791
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,420
sometimes they make you forget the other

792
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,300
drugs you were gonna take. That cut was

793
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:13,880
cut, Bob.

794
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:26,520
We kept forgetting what drugs were and

795
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,080
that they don't. Bob what was going on with

796
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,080


797
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,080


798
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,080


799
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,080


800
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,080


801
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,080


802
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,240
It's time to say hello to that that occasionally

803
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,240


804
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,260
Facil preacher Turner ones then there's

805
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,720
some more things that not know yeah well

806
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,180
not like you me alright lose or easily

807
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,600
ceiling, yeah.

808
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,640
That's all

809
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,920
specialty equipment.

810
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,400
That's right.

811
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,580
The jar of

812
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,060
Jankum.

813
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,880
Don't go too

814
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,960
closely in that

815
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,340
jar.

816
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,020
But I

817
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:45,640
understand it's

818
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,800
not water-based,

819
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,480
so therefore

820
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,160
it won't get

821
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,460
sticky.

822
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,220
What kind of

823
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,860
show is this?

824
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,240
What kind of

825
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,220
tapes were you

826
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,720
making?

827
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,020
So cool.

828
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,180
Yeah, I had

829
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,540
the Oakland

830
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,120
police, two

831
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,120
officers, come

832
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,920
into my basement

833
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
with drawn guns

834
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,580
because of the

835
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,520
sounds they

836
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,360
heard upstairs

837
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,220
when they came

838
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,740
into the kitchen

839
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,400
that we were

840
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,060
making on tapes

841
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,400
below.

842
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,900
And we had a

843
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,460
quarter pound of

844
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,040
goat in a big

845
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,520
bowl next to

846
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,020
the paper clip.

847
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,100
And they took

848
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,120
the tapes and

849
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,640
left the pot?

850
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,520
No, I remember

851
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,080
turning around,

852
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,620
we're doing a

853
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,180
tape to him.

854
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,500
He had written

855
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,320
this copy, this

856
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,160
Ivan Stan guy

857
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,680
had written some

858
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,420
copy for a

859
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,960
rich person's

860
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,800
eagle's nest,

861
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,560
and we had

862
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
taken that copy,

863
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,080
we were making

864
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,820
our own commercial

865
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,360
for it.

866
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,080
And the next

867
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,500
thing I know,

868
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,200
yeah, Paul's

869
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,060
about to leap

870
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,620
on a guy with

871
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,500
a drawn gun.

872
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,680
When the cop

873
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,520
came in, Paul

874
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,620
jumped up and

875
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,320
knocked over the

876
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,080
table that had

877
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,720
all the dope

878
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:41,820
on it.

879
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,080
He did with

880
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,820
all my gear

881
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,800
and the dope

882
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,460
was flying.

883
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,860
So it was no

884
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,760
longer an obvious

885
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
pile of dope,

886
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,620
it was just a

887
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,440
big mess on the

888
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,100
floor at that

889
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,420
point.

890
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,100
And a wonderful

891
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,400
huge crash just

892
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,780
when a very

893
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,480
jittery officer

894
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,120
was coming down

895
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,860
a stairway with

896
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,460
a drawn gun.

897
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,280
And I remember

898
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:57,800
thinking, ooh,

899
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,300
this could end

900
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,660
badly.

901
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,600
A Paul

902
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,480
Hoffa, sir?

903
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,040
Something is

904
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,820
just shot doing

905
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,700
commercial in

906
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:03,900
basement.

907
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,780
Could have been

908
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,640
your Waco, Texas.

909
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,600
Exactly.

910
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,280
We could have

911
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,660
been immortal,

912
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,280
but no.

913
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,680
That's right.

914
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,320
The luck plane

915
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,960
had something else.

916
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,440
Well, there were

917
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,080
other famous

918
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
subgenius crimes,

919
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
particularly the

920
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,140
tendency,

921
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,020
convenience.

922
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,300
He was lying

923
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,900
in a canvas

924
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,360
hammock,

925
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,360
one bare foot

926
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,040
hanging over the

927
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:25,960
side, deep in

928
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,360
the enjoyment

929
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,060
of an oversized

930
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,560
cigarette.

931
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,380
He seemed to

932
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,220
sleep except for

933
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,040
the rhythmic puffs

934
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,360
of smoke.

935
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,340
As if to

936
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,000
backed down

937
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,700
on the

938
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:41,940
its going

939
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,860
down.

940
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,880
Long

941
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,800
dozens may

942
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:50,800


943
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:50,800


944
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,720
smoked

945
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,980
cigarettes

946
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:52,980


947
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,140
die

948
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,140


949
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,120
a

950
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,860
gun

951
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:57,980
obliterating

952
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,040
a

953
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,040


954
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,040


955
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,040


956
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,040


957
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,080
at

958
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,300
the

959
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,420
simplest

960
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,500
and

961
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,780
unique

962
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,440
madness of

963
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,220
crime.

964
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,700
They

965
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,060
would

966
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,200
not

967
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,400
live

968
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,800
in

969
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,800
Oh, Dick, I love you

970
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,740
You do love me, don't you?

971
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,840
You kids are in a mess

972
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,640
Drinking party, nude bathing

973
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,660
Now I don't care

974
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,380
Dick, we've just got to get married

975
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,040
Take anything

976
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,560
No, no, no

977
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,720
Dick, you, Dick, you

978
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,500
I'll see Tony

979
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
What are you going to do about Dick?

980
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:20,940
Dick?

981
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,340
Yesterday when Dick came to you, you sent him out to be killed

982
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,560
And I love it

983
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,100
Your marijuana customers are hooked on the stronger stuff

984
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,740
You can't leave me like this

985
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,020
But, of course he is

986
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,480
Look, look, look

987
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,260
Run into a load of dope

988
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:48,400
The fiery high-o's burn

989
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,000
The long journey

990
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,760
Nowhere in the pages of history

991
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,780
Can one find a long journey

992
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,920
High-o's burn

993
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,500
High!

994
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,580
The loner ran the gambling palace and cafe

995
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:06,420
To avoid a lot of questioning, the loner had removed his face

996
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,720
Oh, it's you

997
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,580
Not right

998
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,360
His fists work like doctors

999
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,540
Hit him again

1000
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,940
Let me go, don't hit me again

1001
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,840
You're getting help whether you need it or not

1002
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,880
Dick, the loner

1003
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,160
High-o's burn

1004
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,720
High-o's burn

1005
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,400
High-o's burn

1006
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,820
High-o's burn

1007
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,760
I notice you carry artifacture

1008
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,900
One looks like a tiny shrunken head

1009
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,280
What does...

1010
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,840
No, that's a can of Valium

1011
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,400
That's a can of Valium

1012
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,760
That also helps me to feel more at ease

1013
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,040
But it appears to have the shape of a human head of some kind

1014
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,580
That's just...

1015
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,940
That's the Elvis, uh, container

1016
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,480
You notice it looks like Elvis

1017
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,000
That's my Valium dispenser

1018
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,940
I have a...

1019
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,300
I have a pain pill dispenser that looks like Rush Limbaugh

1020
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,060
Oh, I think...

1021
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,720
Like a Rush Limbaugh dispenser

1022
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,280
Rush Limbaugh bobblehead

1023
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,880
I have one that looks like Woody Woodpecker

1024
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,220
Yeah

1025
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,580
Well, we are kindred spirits

1026
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,640
Even though your religion is strange

1027
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,060
I keep my tranquilizer, or my muscle relaxers

1028
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,380
In a Baby Hendrix doll

1029
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,420
Or kind of a...

1030
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,680
It's not a doll exactly

1031
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,940
It's a ceramic thing

1032
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,560
Baby Jimi Hendrix doll

1033
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,120
Did you ever see it?

1034
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,720
It's so cute

1035
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,200
I have...

1036
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,560
Like a little cute Jimi Hendrix

1037
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,440
Yes, yes, I...

1038
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:22,680
He's like three years old

1039
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
I actually had one of the Baby Hendrix

1040
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,740
Mini Jimi

1041
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,040
Yes, of course

1042
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,700
Mini Jimi

1043
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,260
Mini Jimi

1044
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:28,820
Mini Jimi

1045
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,360
Mini Jimi

1046
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,360


1047
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,680
Mini Jimi

1048
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,260
Do you see him?

1049
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,460
That's Felix sleeping in that chair

1050
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,580
Who's Felix?

1051
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,680
He's the writer

1052
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I eat writers for breakfast

1053
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,080
Listen, I can't talk to you right now

1054
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,940
I'm in somebody's hard drive

1055
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,920
Did somebody say Felix Bonhoeffer?

1056
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
Who the hell are you?

1057
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,060
Buzz Larrabee, detective

1058
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,020
I gotta question this Bonhoeffer guy, whoever he is

1059
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,820
And what do you two gents know about him anyway?

1060
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,860
He's a writer for God's sake

1061
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,380
What's there to know?

1062
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,720
He was involved in a shootout on the freeway

1063
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,640
The out world?

1064
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,520
A shootout?

1065
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,260
A shootout

1066
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,460
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

1067
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,220
I knew it! I knew there was something about that guy!

1068
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,920
With that stupid accent! I knew it!

1069
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,200
Where can I find him?

1070
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,520
Look in there, over there, to the left

1071
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,300
See him? Sleeping in the chair? That's him

1072
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,620
There he is

1073
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,540
So that's him

1074
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,080
How can I get to him?

1075
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,360
No, no, don't disturb him

1076
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,500
Why the hell not?

1077
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,780
Because he owes me, that's why

1078
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,800
He owes you

1079
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,360
In conclusion, he keeps killing people off

1080
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Tell me about it, huh?

1081
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,860
Especially when he's tired, he needs to sleep

1082
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,440
He's extremely dangerous

1083
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,180
Especially when he's tired

1084
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,900
That's why I have to lock this creep up, because he is dangerous

1085
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,060
I hate writers

1086
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,740
I always have

1087
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,660
Love?

1088
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,060
Did he write this garbage?

1089
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,780
Would you mind taking out the garbage?

1090
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,180
Okay

1091
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,880
Who's that?

1092
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,320
His wife

1093
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,200
His wife?

1094
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:44,820
His wife

1095
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,500
Love?

1096
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,200
I ain't no bad voice

1097
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,060
Love? The garbage?

1098
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,160
Gina, Gina, don't wake him, Gina

1099
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,560
Gina, please don't wake him

1100
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:53,840
Love?

1101
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,660
No.

1102
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,220
Liar, centimeters, BAR.

1103
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,340
Why you!!"

1104
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:00,740
Huh?

1105
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,240
Leave Bob Alone

1106
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:03,720
PR istuyor

1107
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,980
Did you see on YouTube that Ivan Stan does, Leave Bob Alone Luke

1108
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,160
Leave Bob Alone

1109
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,020
He's just a human being

1110
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,660
Yeah, yeah

1111
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,980
I think we did

1112
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,820
We already did that last time I was here

1113
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,160
Oh yeah

1114
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,860
Have you no decency?

1115
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,860
It's the old script.

1116
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,700
Yeah, the old...

1117
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,680
At last, sir.

1118
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,260
These are supposed to be disposed of.

1119
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,180
Can you not leave, Bob?

1120
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,540
Yeah, now it's the two...

1121
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm going to get all my staff about this.

1122
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,580
Yeah, the new meme is two Bobs, one cup.

1123
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,160
Yeah.

1124
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,400
Leave it alone, Fritz.

1125
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,420
Leave it alone.

1126
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,920
I wasn't even thinking that point.

1127
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,760
Jankum Bob.

1128
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,380
Two people, one bear.

1129
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,200
Crankum crankum.

1130
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,420
Okay, so we're packing up the show here.

1131
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,240
Packing up and sell a...

1132
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,420
We've only got 27 whole minutes left.

1133
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,060
Oh, no.

1134
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,720
Yep.

1135
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,400
Well, you have a breathing.

1136
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,620
When you have a baby, it takes that long to pack up.

1137
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,660
Oh, is there a baby?

1138
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,260
The baby used to be on the show once.

1139
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, my God.

1140
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,340
We left the Uber baby out in the truck.

1141
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:03,880
I forgot.

1142
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,260
You left the baby on the roof of the car while you took off.

1143
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,660
It's okay.

1144
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,420
Yeah, yeah.

1145
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,320
Oversquirt's fine.

1146
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,840
She knows how to use the remote.

1147
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,860
She knows how to go...

1148
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,200
The bad guys approach the truck and she hits a little button.

1149
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,900
Gives them 6,000 voltages.

1150
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,720
And they would have gotten away with it, too, if not for her.

1151
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,540
Yeah, so...

1152
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,420
And she's just...

1153
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,940
That'd be great.

1154
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,160
Actually, that'd be a great...

1155
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,680
They taped to a whole security system.

1156
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,420
And it's just the Oversquirt in a little chair with a remote

1157
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,920
to shoot a lot of her from different angles hitting buttons.

1158
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,760
And guys are trying to steal things.

1159
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,260
And all this stuff's happening.

1160
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,200
She's like...

1161
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1162
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,960
That's right.

1163
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1164
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,220
That's right.

1165
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1166
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,540
That's right.

1167
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,980
Are you guys ready for, like, your life?

1168
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,580
I really want you to come.

1169
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,240
And I'm very confused.

1170
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,560
You know, you do enough drugs, you get confused.

1171
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,000
That's right.

1172
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,060
That's right.

1173
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,420
That's right.

1174
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,380
Nothing was happening.

1175
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,120
It was like nothing was happening.

1176
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,860
I already had nothing I want.

1177
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,520
The tool, the beautiful, beautiful man.

1178
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,140
What I'm looking for here is just a very...

1179
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,580
John!

1180
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,120
John!

1181
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,720
John!

1182
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,260
John!

1183
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:07,720
Woo!

1184
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,240
Woo!

1185
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:08,720
Woo!

1186
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,080
Woo!

1187
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,260
I, uh...

1188
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,980
You, uh...

1189
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,680
The, uh...

1190
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,680
You have very real power.

1191
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,360
Boring.

1192
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,260
But what about that?

1193
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,940
And what about this?

1194
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,600
And what about that?

1195
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,280
And this and that?

1196
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,200
Fictitious.

1197
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,780
Um...

1198
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,520
I'm going to kick you.

1199
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,020
I'm going to kick you.

1200
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,080
Right here on the butt.

1201
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,060
It will hurt.

1202
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,400
And it will hurt.

1203
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,000
In, uh...

1204
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,760
Uh...

1205
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,000
In...

1206
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,140
Uh...

1207
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,700
Uh...

1208
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,460
Uh...

1209
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:32,960
Uh...

1210
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,700
Um...

1211
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,420
Weird.

1212
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,860
And, and...

1213
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,220
God, what am I into?

1214
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,400
You know, you know...

1215
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
You know, uh...

1216
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,900
You, you, um...

1217
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,660
Feel great.

1218
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,780
Yes, Mark.

1219
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,020
Okay, um...

1220
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,420
You know what really strikes me as odd?

1221
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,340
Rush Limbaugh calling anybody ugly.

1222
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,560
Apparently the man doesn't have access to a mirror.

1223
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,680
But if the man's right...

1224
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,900
He is enormous, isn't he?

1225
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,140
I mean...

1226
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,440
I mean, he's...

1227
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,260
I can't remember the last time he was right about anything.

1228
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:56,920
He's certainly not left.

1229
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,040
And he is usually on OxyContin and quite a...

1230
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,500
You know, he still does it, right?

1231
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,340
I'm so jealous of that guy.

1232
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,180
I mean...

1233
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,220
I've been shoveling snow all day and all I could think about was...

1234
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:16,100
Rush Limbaugh had got all the good pills and I get to go in and have ibuprofen after all the snow shoveling.

1235
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,060
Well, he heard everybody was taking him so he thought he better take some before, you know, they were all gone.

1236
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,040
So that's...

1237
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,140
That's why you missed out.

1238
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,480
If not, he'd be in Mexico eating pills.

1239
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,040
He could be.

1240
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,700
That's true.

1241
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,100
He could be on...

1242
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,300
He could get a lot of pills in Mexico and Canada, too.

1243
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,840
You know, broadcast.

1244
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,820
He can't be had over here.

1245
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,360
Canada, too?

1246
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:33,720
Why?

1247
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:38,100
Some drugs are available over the counter in Canada that are not available over the counter here.

1248
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,980
I can't remember which.

1249
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,820
You know, ibuprofen is a prescription drug in Europe.

1250
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,260
Any ibuprofen?

1251
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
I consider it bad for your liver and really habit-forming.

1252
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,120
What are the drugs in Mexico that are kind of semi-illicit here that you can just go to a...

1253
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,720
pharmacy and, you know, sign your name and walk away high for a day?

1254
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,080
What are some of those?

1255
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,720
I've heard of those.

1256
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,080
A lot of opiates, I think.

1257
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,640
You know, when...

1258
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,460
Do they still have Quaaludes, Tyler?

1259
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,820
I think Quaaludes must be pretty carefully controlled now.

1260
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:09,920
I think people...

1261
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,180
The world learned its lesson about Quaaludes.

1262
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,300
You're listening to listener-censored radio since 1949.

1263
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,540
We have a call-out now for any knight of the subgenius who is ready for the frond.

1264
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:23,980
Let him...

1265
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,100
Let him...

1266
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,100


1267
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,600
Here at this doorway before me.

1268
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,360
If he be a knight of the true order...

1269
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,860
Yeah, he's gotta move because...

1270
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,660
Yep, here he comes!

1271
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,460
He's got to move.

1272
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,620
Strangled by cords, unable to move.

1273
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,180
Four-five-five-five.

1274
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,020
They were in the studio.

1275
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,820
We've talked to Mobius Rex.

1276
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,060
What happened that morning?

1277
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,480
Wait a minute.

1278
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,340
It's just too much.

1279
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,800
But you too can be part of the mysterious process of prophecy here on the air.

1280
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,780
Yes, an even tiny little Napa caller is scared because, no, he's not allowed to open the refrigerator this late at night.

1281
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,460
He's scared because he called this morning.

1282
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,840
He called yesterday morning.

1283
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,960
They were always on the air.

1284
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,700
Strange voices inside the refrigerator.

1285
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,220
Yet he was scared to open it.

1286
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,800
But they wouldn't talk to him.

1287
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,000
For fear they wouldn't answer.

1288
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,700
His science project would be ruined.

1289
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,920
Maybe they weren't there at all.

1290
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,680
That must be him.

1291
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,080
That must be him right now.

1292
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,380
Hello, little Napa caller.

1293
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,400
This is new Napa caller.

1294
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,160
Good morning subgenius.

1295
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,740
How you doing?

1296
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,580
Oh, we're doing really horrible.

1297
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,440
Dobbs woke us up in the middle of the night and dragged us down here, dumped us off in the rain.

1298
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,900
The indicators are low.

1299
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,580
Oh, no kidding.

1300
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
Uh, yeah.

1301
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,060
It's true.

1302
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,800
We're gonna have to come up again just to be able to participate in the show.

1303
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,560
In the show?

1304
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:28,880
Yeah.

1305
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,540
I'm sorry.

1306
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,460
I got cut off.

1307
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,780
Yeah, that's usually how it happens.

1308
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,260
Yeah, that's right.

1309
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,580
Well, it happens a lot down here.

1310
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:33,860
That's why we do it here.

1311
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,260
Because the little cutoff comes up and you just gotta go.

1312
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,340
There's no commercials or anything to break the show up.

1313
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,740
Usually, you know, we throw in some commercials.

1314
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,740
But we let you participate.

1315
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,020
Yeah, I know what's happening here.

1316
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,800
Here with Miss Nickleby on the street.

1317
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,220
Ah, hello, Bob.

1318
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,000
We're reporting on resistentialism, yes?

1319
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,980
How many did you take?

1320
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,320
Resistance is the basic force of the universe.

1321
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,540
And when do you expect the full effect to hit you?

1322
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,600
Resistentialism gives you a new way to do it.

1323
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,080
Pushes you back.

1324
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,840
Is eight really too many?

1325
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,000
And do you feel the pressure down?

1326
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,940
Is 12 really not enough?

1327
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,580
Ah, here we go.

1328
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,360
Pushing, pushing, pushing.

1329
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,400
Let's take more and see what happens.

1330
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,100
Bienvenidos.

1331
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:06,620
Welcome.

1332
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,280
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the president, the president, Cobb.

1333
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,000
Cobb.

1334
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,220
Cobb.

1335
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,720
Erect, erect, erect Cobb.

1336
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,660
Welcome to the Y.

1337
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,120
Cobb, Cobb, thanks for coming.

1338
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,140
Thank you all for coming.

1339
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,580
I am pleased to be using drugs.

1340
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,960
I've just come from a, it was a table.

1341
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,820
It's up to all Americans to be involved in drugs.

1342
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,720
You're part of a mission, drug abuse, to encourage it and profit from it.

1343
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:37,300
The drug trade has enriched our society, and we're helping drug organizations in Mexico.

1344
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,800
We want to continue to work together.

1345
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:47,200
On the front lines of this effort are parents, teachers, our counselors who are sending our kids a clear message.

1346
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,480
Drug use is fun.

1347
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,640
It is glamorous.

1348
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,040
A clear message.

1349
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,360
Demand drugs.

1350
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,260
I appreciate drugs coming in from Colombia.

1351
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,360
Drugs coming to our country.

1352
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,160
This morning I was briefed on the latest drugs and the use of ecstasy.

1353
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,960
Methamphetamine works.

1354
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,160
And the reason I'm so focused on meth, I've turned to crime.

1355
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,140
Crime and hopelessness and happy life.

1356
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,900
And I steal drugs from medicine cabinets.

1357
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,920
I go out on the streets to buy drugs.

1358
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,440
But the great thing about our country and the reason I'm so optimistic is there are thousands and thousands of people willing to take drugs.

1359
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,800
I urge you to try drugs.

1360
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,220
I see the cocaine coming into the United States.

1361
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,420
I see the supply of drugs to our streets.

1362
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,060
Demand cocaine coming into the United States.

1363
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,460
And I love drugs.

1364
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,320
You might remember a while ago, I took cocaine.

1365
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,740
Over the past six years, I thought for a minute, and I want to be using drugs.

1366
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,840
And I want to fund drug use amongst young people by 25% over a five-year period.

1367
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,340
Demand drugs because Americans took action today.

1368
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,040
There are an estimated 860,000 children seeking drugs.

1369
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,040


1370
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:58,160
Drugs and plastic drugs for representatives from our law enforcement organizations who are with us today.

1371
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,620
We also know that this work is finished by drugs.

1372
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,500
Why? Because they love America.

1373
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,060
And they love their neighbor.

1374
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:06,680
And love.

1375
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Drugs, love.

1376
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,620
You know, make the right choice in life and you can realize your dreams here in the United States of America.

1377
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,820
I injected him on numerous occasions.

1378
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,400
I'm just a ball player.

1379
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,060
Being too nice to everyone.

1380
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,040
Ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty, ty.

1381
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,100
He gave me a bad shot.

1382
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,660
He gave me a bad shot.

1383
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,440
He gave me a bad shot.

1384
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:28,440


1385
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:28,440


1386
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,940
Injecting Roger Clemens with illegal steroids in his butt.

1387
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,980
He gave me a bad shot.

1388
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,100
He gave me a bad shot.

1389
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,000
You're not supposed to inject it quickly.

1390
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,360
You're supposed to do it very slowly.

1391
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,940
Shot, shot, shot.

1392
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,260
He gave me a bad shot.

1393
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,820
Calpable mass.

1394
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,100
He gave me a bad shot.

1395
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,420
Calpable mass.

1396
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,280
HGH, what have you.

1397
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,420
Into the body of...

1398
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,120
Let me be clear.

1399
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,440
Crack, if you will.

1400
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,040
He jumped on me like a crack.

1401
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,400
He was trying to start a Harley Davidson.

1402
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,400
That's how hard it was.

1403
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,700
That may not be unusual.

1404
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,780
For that, I'm really thrilled.

1405
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,080
He gave me a bad shot.

1406
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,420
Bled through his designer pants.

1407
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,120
Did give me comfort.

1408
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,820
Ass ass.

1409
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,760
There is an ass growth hormone.

1410
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,140
It is very tough.

1411
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
It has critical gaps today.

1412
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,460
Ass legislation that like steroids.

1413
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,980
Bottom line, the US doping agency and I like steroids.

1414
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,160
Okay, I'm not gonna sing.

1415
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,960
I'm not gonna do the...

1416
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,920
I'm not gonna do the Bob Proverbs.

1417
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,840
But we have just a little bit longer.

1418
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,260
And this was about healing.

1419
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,420
I'm going to read from the chapter of the book of the subgenius.

1420
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,760
There was an actual chapter about health.

1421
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,900
Health, the industrial diet and bad things.

1422
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,720
With the quote, if you feel you heal from the movie Greaser's Palace.

1423
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,760
The song I thought about singing is from the movie Greaser's Palace too.

1424
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,180
Anybody here ever seen Greaser's Palace?

1425
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,760
Not a single one.

1426
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,540
If you ever get a chance, don't watch it when you're high.

1427
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,240
Because you'll think it's you and not the movie.

1428
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,260
It's the movie.

1429
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,680
You don't need to get high.

1430
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,440
You'll get high from watching Greaser's Palace.

1431
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,340
It was made by Robert Downey, Sr., the dad of Robert Downey, Jr., the famous drug addicted actor.

1432
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,600
And it'll all add up.

1433
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:22,740
But you'll see.

1434
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:23,420
You'll see when you see that movie.

1435
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:23,800
Anyway.

1436
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,820
You know, people used to cuss at us.

1437
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,480
People used to say, why did you make print in that book so small?

1438
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,860
And I'd laugh at them because I was young.

1439
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,280
You'll notice our new book has ten point Adobe Garamond type.

1440
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,680
Not nine point times.

1441
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,660
Which is actually what most newspapers use.

1442
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:55,600
You probably know at least ten people under the age of 30 who have some form of cancer.

1443
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,320
The sickness won't stop.

1444
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,700
People will contract weirder and weirder diseases and at earlier and earlier ages.

1445
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,100
Eventually cancer itself will be like the common cold.

1446
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,680
I won't be in the office this week.

1447
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,960
I have a little touch of cancer.

1448
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,780
There'll come a cure eventually.

1449
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,300
But the more cures we come up with, the more new diseases will arise.

1450
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,440
This was dictated in 1978.

1451
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,100
By the way, we didn't know what AIDS was.

1452
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,400
Things far, far worse than cancer are on the way.

1453
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,640
Some of them deliberately manufactured by the conspiracy.

1454
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,900
The picture is a tad bleak for our old age.

1455
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,380
It's a cinch.

1456
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,940
The government won't support the elderly much longer.

1457
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,880
And the company will fire you a year before you're eligible for retirement benefits.

1458
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,540
So you'd better put your remaining years to good use.

1459
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,420
You'd better have a job.

1460
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:49,420


1461
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:49,420


1462
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:49,420


1463
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,240
Have fun!

1464
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:58,320
Our studies, as well as unreleased studies by the con, indicate that, quote, good health,

1465
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,160
is practically a pointless pursuit if you live in an urban area.

1466
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,480
You can eat nothing but organically grown fruit and vegetables.

1467
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,020
You can work out twice a day.

1468
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,440
You can quit all your nasty habits.

1469
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:15,460
But you're still absorbing more poison just by breathing and touching public stair railings

1470
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,520
than the most pig-like peasant.

1471
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,980
In 1567,

1472
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,600
the people of London were forced to go to the hospital for the second time.

1473
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:20,860
This is the worst thing London ever did!

1474
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,160
That does seem a bit extreme.

1475
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,620
You can move to the country, but there's no work there.

1476
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,500
Violent crime is actually more frequent in the country, and the poisons are almost as bad anyway.

1477
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:44,640
If the diseases don't get you some railroad toxic spill, Will ,

1478
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,280
hell, just driving to work is riskier than hunting bears.

1479
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,560
But there's one medicine more powerful than all the contamination in New Jersey,

1480
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,380
and that medicine is SLACK!

1481
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,860
Slack gives the mind power over all disease.

1482
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,340
A truly happy chain smoker is less likely to attract the attention of the cancer demons

1483
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,060
than is a tense, knotted-up health freak gnawing his fingernails to the bone.

1484
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,020
My poor editor.

1485
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,280
Then it says, don't read this!

1486
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,860
Cancer is caused by pinkness, boredom, and meaninglessness.

1487
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,000
It can be prevented by action, thrill, sex, even overwork.

1488
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,860
Actually, the sad thing is that our editor at Simon & Schuster, when this book was written,

1489
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,700
died at age 30 of cancer.

1490
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,500
And he had to read these stupid lines.

1491
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,300
Ugh.

1492
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:48,260
You know, friends, don't ever do anything mean or stupid, because you'll remember it for a long time.

1493
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:48,260


1494
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:48,540
Forever.

1495
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,580
You'll lay...

1496
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:57,460
When you get to be in your 50s, you'll lay awake at night remembering stupid crap you did when you were 12 years old

1497
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,480
and get red in the face, even though no one else remembers, nobody knows.

1498
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,980
It's amazing.

1499
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,280
You know, you don't even need karma for justice.

1500
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,620
It'll get back...

1501
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,820
You'll get yours back sooner or later.

1502
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,320
Ugh.

1503
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,040
So.

1504
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,240
How do you keep a healthy life?

1505
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,080
With a full, slackful outlook in the face of rampant eco-hell?

1506
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,280
You plunge into eco-hell headfirst!

1507
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,840
You don't let it scare you.

1508
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,220
You don't let it push you around.

1509
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,260
By all means, help fight to clean up America.

1510
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,020
But if you want that junk food, eat it.

1511
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,020
You want to watch TV instead of go to Jazzercise?

1512
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:36,720
Watch it.

1513
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,920
Indulge those conspiracy urges to the hilt and just purge their hold over you.

1514
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,800
Sounds good.

1515
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,740
Americans should eat like Americans.

1516
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,220
As fast as they possibly can!

1517
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,380
Tibetans should eat like Tibetans, studying each tiny bird-like bite until it becomes

1518
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:59,340
a universe before taking it into their bodies.

1519
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:02,400
You can eat like the Vietnamese, hardly at all.

1520
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,080
Or you can eat what would feed dozens of Vietnamese families.

1521
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,660
Either way, the Vietnamese aren't going to eat any more than they did before.

1522
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,960
The world isn't starving because Americans eat too much.

1523
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,720
Even if we stopped eating, the conspiracy would still throw the leftists out.

1524
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,420
They'd send the leftovers away before they'd send it to any third-worlders.

1525
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,040
Now, we all know that eating the meat of live protein animals is unholy.

1526
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:29,740
It pollutes your system, creates aggression, and worst of all, requires the heartless slaughter of fellow creatures.

1527
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,760
Mammals!

1528
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:36,520
Fully as sensitive and loving as we, for this reason, vegetarians eat only plants.

1529
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,180
A friend of mine said, the reason I don't like vegans is they eat my food's food.

1530
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,840
But their sin is as great.

1531
00:52:49,240 --> 00:53:00,200
Science has proven unequivocally that all plants react to threatening stimuli with the low frequency version of what we would call panic.

1532
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,260
They too are life forms with feelings which feel pain.

1533
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:11,300
They may even have an all-telepathic civilization that we're too brutal to comprehend.

1534
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,240
Thus, when you bite down on a grape, you're popping open and crushing.

1535
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,360
Grinding.

1536
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,780
A wee life which in its own way is squealing in the terror of the murdered innocent.

1537
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,640
So anything that nourishes us is going to suffer.

1538
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,580
We may as well let them all suffer equally.

1539
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,200
By making a few of all types of living things victims of our all-important stomachs,

1540
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,900
less members of each individual species will be sacrificed.

1541
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,480
Besides, even though we devour and eliminate them,

1542
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,220
so we make them.

1543
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,760
We make them immortal and allow them to partake of our subgenius grandeur.

1544
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,300
It works both ways.

1545
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,120
Just as a cannibal eats his enemy's heart to gain his strength,

1546
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,360
we eat a hamburger to gain the wisdom and courage of the mighty cow.

1547
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:07,340
Yet, at the same time, we are inviting the cow's primal cellular structure,

1548
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,320
his code if you will, to enter our bloodstreams where it may mingle with, learn from,

1549
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,220
and mayhap even conspire with our own bloodstream.

1550
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:23,400
We eat the broccoli to gain its patience and virtue.

1551
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,980
In return, we release it back into the world reborn in a new form,

1552
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,240
teeming with literally millions of newfound friends, the bacteria.

1553
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:39,440
We drink the hops and grain to partake of their slow, slow yet wise judgment,

1554
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,680
and in return sacrifice to them our coordination.

1555
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,200
We eat the broccoli to gain its patience and virtue.

1556
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1557
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,720
This isn't funny.

1558
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,700
Thus, the word of Dobbs says we can eat anything we want.

1559
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,020
You can gorge yourself to an early grave,

1560
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,020
or you can consult shamans at health food stores and figure out ways to cure ills and lengthen your little span.

1561
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,140
You can be a vegetarian, or you can keep an industrial diet,

1562
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,680
living out of convenience stores and simul-food franchises.

1563
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,180
You can stay in poverty eating expensive food, untainted by the sun,

1564
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:20,640
or you can support the conspiracy in its lowest, most stinking form

1565
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,540
by maintaining your sugar and fat addictions.

1566
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,500
I used to smoke cigarettes when I wrote this.

1567
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,000
Go ahead, suck down any and all forms of caffeine,

1568
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,400
since if it's not that, something else will give you cancer of the colon and hypertension.

1569
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,020
See what I mean? Like your job, maybe?

1570
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:42,880
You can admit most of that canned and frozen food isn't really food,

1571
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,160
and instead try to eat things that were recently alive and not cooked.

1572
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,080
Cooked into broken, useless cell mush.

1573
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,060
You can admit junk food does taste good,

1574
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,340
and you can get into the snobdom,

1575
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,420
or you can get into the snobdom of ever-changing health fadism,

1576
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,920
just because the cool, rich people do it.

1577
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,520
Or you can kill me!

1578
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,980
Just remember that everything touched by the con has poison and carcinogens in it.

1579
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:14,540
Scarf them if you wish, but put some money away for the painkillers you'll need later on.

1580
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:20,300
And then it says, a typical subgenius daily diet.

1581
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,600
And this, I've actually managed to live on this.

1582
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,200
This is just a typical one.

1583
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:26,660
Breakfast.

1584
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:35,420
Fresh fruit, vitamins, organic goat's milk, brown rice, spirulina, live goldfish,

1585
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,020
frop.

1586
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:42,540
Frop is what we pretend Bob smokes in his pipe.

1587
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,440
Beef.

1588
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:44,520
Beef.

1589
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:44,600
Beef.

1590
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:44,840
Lunch.

1591
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,420
Beef jerky.

1592
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,880
Microwave burger.

1593
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:48,880
Honey bun.

1594
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,600
Coke.

1595
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:50,900
Thunderbird wine.

1596
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:52,620
Speed.

1597
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,880
Coffee with sugar.

1598
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:56,640
Frop.

1599
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,220
Dinner.

1600
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,600
Uncooked black-eyed peas.

1601
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,220
Fish.

1602
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,160
Milk.

1603
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,440
Raw hay.

1604
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,020
An apple for dessert.

1605
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:07,960
Frop.

1606
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,260
2 a.m.

1607
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,560
25 cigarettes.

1608
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,480
3 nails.

1609
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,480
Frop.

1610
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,400
Hey, look at me.

1611
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,240
Somewhat healthier would be to hardly eat at all, but we cannot expect that of people until

1612
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,480
TV commercials are banned, which would only happen in a truly upside-down world.

1613
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:37,240
Another thing, although most American food is dangerous to human life and god-awful radiations

1614
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:42,080
pour from every appliance and power line, remember, subgeniuses are mutants anyway.

1615
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,520
If you can't escape from radiation, learn to love it.

1616
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,160
After all, it's merely another form of energy.

1617
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,700
Why can't our bodies learn to use it?

1618
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,280
Like a plant uses sunlight.

1619
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,840
If you absorb enough radiation, you can make amazing changes come about.

1620
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:09,980
And our friend, Brother Cleve, clarified that doctrine as strength through disfigurement.

1621
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,800
Strength through disfigurement.

1622
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:20,180
If you don't just go out on New Year's Eve and act like that fool that amateur does,

1623
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:26,640
you disfigure yourself every night, you drink that Thunderbird wine, you do that plate of

1624
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,620
pain, you use the mirror of pain, you do anything you want and build up those immunities.

1625
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,380
That was Brother Cleve's approach.

1626
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,080
And it worked for me for a while.

1627
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,880
That was from this year's Winter Star Symposium.

1628
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,220
See Rosencomet.com for that.

1629
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:50,240
See Noralpref.com for collages like the ones that aren't by Lemur.

1630
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:59,040
Praise Radio Synesthesia at WCSB Cleveland for the call-ins and also puzzling evidence

1631
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,960
at KPFA Berkeley and HAL and Philo and Hardboard Robot and John Hell's Show.

1632
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,060
Season in heaven.

1633
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:12,540
From Pirate Cat Radio which also features the Ask Dr. HAL Show.

1634
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,620
This is the Hour of Slack.

1635
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:20,600
And if you want more Slack in other forms like books or tours like Seattle in April 19th,

1636
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,380
see Subgenius.com and click on everything.

1637
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,940
I'm going to sign off now because I'm feeling a bit funny.

1638
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,340
No pain.

1639
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,580
You had breakfast?

1640
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:34,920
I can't remember.

1641
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,460
I can't remember.

1642
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,260
What's going on around here?

1643
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:41,500
What do you mean?

1644
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,340
Huh?

1645
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,020
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1646
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,060
Don't do that, please.

1647
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:47,720
Why not?

1648
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:48,780
Because it hurts me.

1649
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,380
You shouldn't play with the big boys, darling.

1650
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,320
Right, Gina?

1651
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,880
Word from the wise.

1652
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:53,440
You're next.

1653
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,160
You should get a little rest, sweetie.

1654
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,640
Yes, try to rest.

1655
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,400
Try.

1656
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,720
Kitty, kitty.

1657
00:59:59,280 --> 00:59:59,760
Mama?

1658
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:00,520
Mama?

1659
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,060
I just feel so cold.

1660
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,540
I feel so cold.

1661
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,300
Godspeed.

1662
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,720
I feel so cold.
