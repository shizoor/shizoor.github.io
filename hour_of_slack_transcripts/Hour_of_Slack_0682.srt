1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Psychedelic music performed at the total environment dance.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,560
Light shows and strobes in the crowd and an ear-spring kind of music.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,880
The effect is to simulate an hallucinogenic experience.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,040
In fact, they've conducted some experiments that show in a right acoustic environment

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
with a proper synchronization of the strobes and the beaten sound of the music,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,500
they can induce within the mind a mental condition paralleling that of LSD.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,260
It's sort of a way to blow your mind on uses.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,400
On Bob.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,840
Yes, dear friend.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,760
Welcome to another hour of swag.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,780
The big question everyone here is asking is of course what happens then.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,480
Some believe that the ring's function is some sort of an accelerator or something,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,760
sending its energy into this passenger pod, making it rocket away at near the speed of light.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,240
Rocket away.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,240


16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,020
Other people believe it might open up a doorway to some other dimension.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,300
To a doorway to...

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,600
Right.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,120
Well, that's what today's test is all about.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,980
Actually, I quite like it up here.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,960
My little room has one hell of a view.

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,340
Yes, no kidding, dear friends.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,400
As I look around myself in my little room here, I see, uh...

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,300
Well, I see...

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,280
Look, there's a Dobbs head.

26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,680
And look over there.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,440
Another Dobbs head.

28
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,780
Why, fancy that.

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,380
There are just Dobbs heads all over the place.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,160
Here and there and every...everywhere.

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,440
Here, there and everywhere, friends.

32
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,400
And, uh, welcome to another show with a format.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,520
Some kind of a format.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,660
Let's see what it is.

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,600
You haven't seen your mission.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,320
Well, no, I mean, I think, to me, I'm old-fashioned.

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel like, you know, these...these nude orgies where everybody's clustered together

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,240
right in the center of the wagon trains, uh, trying to, um...

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,860
I don't know.

40
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,220
I think it's a private thing that you...you should look across the woods and see them

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,260
dotted with couples rather than all the couples all at once.

42
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,100
And I wish there were more women.

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,960
I...needless to say, I mean, look around, uh...

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
Oh, this is great.

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,460
You're...you're filming him recording me taking a picture of you.

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,100
Oh, come on.

47
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Yes, for the hour of slack.

48
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,140
I like that.

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,280
This is for...

50
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,260
And Boston television.

51
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,240
This is for the hour of slack.

52
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,900
Boston's hour of life, also.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,200
In Dallas, Little Rock, Boston, Chicago.

54
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,220
Oh, my God.

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:35,660
I'm here to tell you, brothers and sisters, that yes, women...women can be subgeniuses.

56
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,220
It's a difficult...it's a difficult road to travel.

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,220
It's a hard, long road.

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
It's so hard.

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,260
It's such a hard and a deep trail.

60
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,160
It's harder...it's harder than the time that the nuns have in the Catholic church becoming

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,680
priests.

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,960
And it's harder than the time that the Hindu women have becoming Hindu priests, becoming

63
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,200
a nun.

64
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,340
It's so hard.

65
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


66
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


67
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


69
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


71
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


72
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


73
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


74
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


75
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


76
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


77
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


78
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


79
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,340


80
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,240
I'm a woman subgenius.

81
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
I'm an extraordinary woman.

82
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,340
A subhuman woman.

83
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,600
Who?

84
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,100
A superhuman woman.

85
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,420
A woman who can't take it...

86
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:05,600
Come on, man.

87
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,180
Come on, man.

88
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,440
Whoa.

89
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,520
No.

90
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,240
Wow, that's...

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,600
Yes.

92
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,020
Dear friends, it's a tripped out wild and wacky thing.

93
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,580
Well, no, actually it's not.

94
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:36,060
But let's get on to our homey Prairie Squid home contraption interview types.

95
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,480
No, what is it? News! That's right, the news!

96
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,780
Oh, and wait until you hear this news.

97
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,160
From the Boston Globe, Friday.

98
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,420
April 30th, 1999.

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,740
Subgenius comment sinks show.

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,260
The Church of the Subgenius won't be meeting tonight.

101
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,100
It's not because the Music and Performance Collaborative doesn't have religion about making a Boston appearance.

102
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,780
Rather, it's feeling the impact of a stupid joke.

103
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,820
One of the members of the National Subgenius Foundation made a crack

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,400
during an appearance on National Public Radio about being aligned with the Trenchcoat Mafia,

105
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,460
the group associated with the Colorado school shootings.

106
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,880
The church felt immediate fallout.

107
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,560
The reference included a pitch for tonight's scheduled show at the Middle East in Cambridge,

108
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,240
and about a dozen people called the club to protest, obviously not getting the joke.

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,580
One of the owners of the Middle East canceled the show,

110
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
but couldn't be wrong.

111
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,040
There is a 30 minute chat meeting going on right now,

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,980
which has recently reached 4,000 viewers.

113
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,300
Nevertheless, that's okay.

114
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,980
We're just a few minutes away.

115
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,040
I'll gather the cleanup from this Friday and plan for a some other rounds of appearances

116
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,960
or someethin' else with the

117
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
essential elements of national media.

118
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,840
Some places should be issued media coverage,

119
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:03,960
popularity and more.

120
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,280
But at this moment,

121
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,340
some ideas seem to.....

122
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,500
you wouldn't believe.

123
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,160
have done what they did, Jones said.

124
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,680
And yes, friends, the funny thing is,

125
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,640
after we were canceled at the Middle East,

126
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,540
the ACLU helped us get booked by the Baptists.

127
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,440
Yes, the subgeniuses were driven out of the Middle East by hate,

128
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,000
but yet were saved by the Baptists,

129
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,440
who then canceled the show themselves

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,040
because of creepy phone calls

131
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,060
from higher up in the Cambridge City Council.

132
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,240
And it turned into quite an interesting story, friends.

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,940
We did hold our revival on the steps

134
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,180
of the old Cambridge Baptist Church,

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,980
with their permission,

136
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,820
and under the floodlights and spotlights of the police cars.

137
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,300
And we got some great recordings,

138
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,140
surreptitious and deliberate and legal,

139
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,020
and both kinds.

140
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,860
And we're...

141
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
Next week's show will be

142
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,620
the Boston non-devival special

143
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,520
called, I guess we'll call it,

144
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,280
Them Asses Have Spoken.

145
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,900
The masses didn't speak much,

146
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,720
but the masses show did.

147
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,900
And them asses have spoken,

148
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,900
and so did we.

149
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,840
But in the meantime,

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,360
okay, enough of that.

151
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,200
Let's go to department number two,

152
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,820
the old-timey media barrage,

153
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,840
to be followed by whatever new Bob song there is on there.

154
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,120
I...

155
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,200
Oh, hmm.

156
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,060
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

157
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,280
Uh, jams in the background.

158
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,640
Oh, yes.

159
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,020
Oh, yes.

160
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,660
Oh, yes.

161
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,880
Oh, yes.

162
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:34,460
Oh, yes.

163
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Ta-da!

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


165
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


166
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,420
what have you done toмерик Также Southwark

168
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,420


169
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,420


170
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,420


171
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,420


172
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,420


173
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,420


174
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,440
our freedom indicates no introduce of a ketosis...

175
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,440


176
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:35,740
Get be gel, Mr. Newells!

177
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,580
Be começo Ang Radio!

178
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,840
Hy, aaaack!

179
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,060
Aaaäte je.

180
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
I'll give you slack.

181
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,940
I'll give you slack.

182
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,220
I'll give you slack.

183
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,220
Experiment with some toys.

184
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:22,440
Sluts use things like anal beads, butt plugs, condoms, enema bags, and handcuffs.

185
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:35,020
And goddesses use things like crystals, cucumbers, drums and rattles, feathers, grapes, herbs and oils.

186
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,240
And never knock something until you've tried it yourself.

187
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,580
Oh, Lord.

188
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,380
Oh, how could you?

189
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,120
I think I'm going to be sick.

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,020
For constant, steady, and tireless stimulation, we highly recommend the use of vibrators.

191
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,860
There are many models to choose from, enough to keep your hands full.

192
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,120
Here, Connie, you can use this.

193
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,120
Thanks.

194
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,200
We call her the girl with the magic box.

195
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,780
She also has a magic figure.

196
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,140
When she chooses the models for her magazine assignment,

197
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,200
you know they'll all be...

198
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,460
You know they'll all be winners.

199
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,700
The search is on, and you're there to watch as she sees every agent and artist modeled

200
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,860
for this treasure hunt for the girls with the best and the mostest.

201
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,580
Never before has anyone looked so hard to assemble in one group

202
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,700
such an eye-filling, breath-snatching array of female pulchritude.

203
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,780
Oh, my God.

204
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,320
It's the Miss XX Day.

205
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,180
Why, this girl was so eager to get the best that she was willing even to trade herself if necessary.

206
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,180
This you'll have to see.

207
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,380
In high society, I just ain't the type.

208
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,080
Folks all look so surprised when I light my pipe.

209
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,580
We're getting a pipe and smoke it, whore.

210
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,300
The girls fight back, and how?

211
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,040
You can't miss it.

212
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,060
It's totally pretty.

213
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


214
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


215
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


216
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


217
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


218
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
No.

219
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,460
No.

220
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,940
My God.

221
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,040
Coming out.

222
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,060
Help!

223
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:21,800
Help!

224
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:23,860
Help!

225
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,480
All women are bad.

226
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,980
And here's the picture that proves it.

227
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,500
Any place that has people has women.

228
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,560
Vicious, gruff, scheming, and ivy.

229
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,240
Every place in the world, only in the wilderness alone

230
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,220
can man truly be free of their evil ways.

231
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,800
This is the picture that shows them as they really are.

232
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,900
Stripped bare of all pretensions.

233
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,700
And everything else too.

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,420
Though I don't say men are angels,

235
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,000
especially when there's a woman concerned.

236
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,540
The so-called fair sex is the only thing

237
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,540
that leads them on and into every sort of perversion

238
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,360
imaginable.

239
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,420
And this picture proves it.

240
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,740
There's nothing too foul for a pretty girl

241
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,680
to get mixed up in.

242
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,060
Whether it's down in hippy land,

243
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,460
or up in an old Ruiz flat.

244
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,920
She's got him by the short hair.

245
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,160
But he usually doesn't even know it.

246
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,520
He may think he's just being appreciative, or mildly shy.

247
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,520


248
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,900
But once a girl gets her claws into him,

249
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,280
there's nothing she can't make a man do.

250
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,240
It may start out perfectly innocently like this.

251
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,180
Maybe she just wants him to come up to our apartment

252
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,460
to pose for a painting.

253
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,480
But it can end up pretty wild.

254
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,660
Yes sir, all women are bad.

255
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,820
Their passions, their lusts, their evil bodies

256
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,480
turn the strongest man into jelly.

257
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,180
And if you're not so strong, watch out.

258
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,680
They only love themselves and sometimes each other.

259
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,320
But as for men, that's only at their own convenience.

260
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,260
Here's your chance to see all the bad women in one film.

261
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,240
Girls who have no morals and no scruples.

262
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,220
Girls who don't care what they do.

263
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,100
Or who they do it with, as long as they do it.

264
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,140
Girls who hate men,

265
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,240
and love each other.

266
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,840
Gossips and flirts.

267
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,540
Teases and sadists.

268
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,760
Prostitutes and girls who want to be in show business.

269
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,680
And they don't care how much they have to show.

270
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,840
Wicked and lustful, sensuous girls

271
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,760
blossoming into rife womanhood.

272
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,620
All women are bad.

273
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,160
I ought to know.

274
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I'm a man.

275
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm a man.

276
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,520


277
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:16,520


278
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,700
But don't take my word for it.

279
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,440
See them as they really are.

280
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,100
The fair sex unmasked.

281
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,280
In the exciting new film, all women are bad.

282
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,020
Especially the girls of the church of the subgenius, dear friends.

283
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,180
Oh, here they come.

284
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,460
Actually friends, that's, I did not know that that little piece of music was, or that, that,

285
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,460
that collage was going to be like it was.

286
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,100
How incredibly synchronistic in certain respects.

287
00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:01,520
Sister Susie the floozy, who happens to be, although she did that collage for her Connie's

288
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,600
Evil Plan show on WREK in Atlanta, Georgia.

289
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,680
She also has since then got a job writing a book.

290
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,180
I think it's the big book of bad.

291
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,620
Bad girls.

292
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,780
In that big book series.

293
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,360
But at any rate, it is about the bad girls.

294
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,740
They're not all bad though.

295
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,060
Well I guess the girls of the subgenius church.

296
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,920
Yeah.

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, I guess they're all bad.

298
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,060
Well I guess the girls are good too.

299
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,060


300
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,060


301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,360
Dude this is amazing.

302
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,120
Dead, hard, all over again.

303
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,580
Dressed up like sheep, sleeping gadgets up under a coat

304
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,480
Stuff you hear about but nobody knows, it ain't no use

305
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Oh, women are bad

306
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,140
Oh, women are bad

307
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,480
Oh, women are bad

308
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,080
That's what I said

309
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,160
Oh, women are bad

310
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,480
Oh, they got goofy women's tails

311
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,040
They got horns on their heads

312
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,620
Oh, women are bad

313
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,700
Oh, women are bad

314
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,300
That's easy. First word, first name comes to my mind. Connie.

315
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,980
She's got the love

316
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,300
And you cannot resist the way

317
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,440
She makes her play

318
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,800
And you would pawn your wedding ring

319
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,940
For one more thing

320
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,860
She's everywhere

321
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,320
She's in your hair

322
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,560
She's on your mind

323
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,500
And you will find

324
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,620
When work is done

325
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,720
Then you will run

326
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,920
To be the first

327
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,040
To pledge your first

328
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,600
On the backside of Dallas

329
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,820
In a dingy bar

330
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,040
On a worn-out stool

331
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
She sits

332
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,840
And her trembling hand fumbles

333
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
For another king-size

334
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,600
Spilled her cigarettes

335
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,660
She blows a puff of smoke

336
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,840
Then settles back

337
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,940
And looks across the light blue haze

338
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,260
And from the backside of Dallas

339
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:59,280
Her mind goes drifting back to other days

340
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,360
Meet me in Dallas

341
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,320
On June the 23rd

342
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,360
His letter read

343
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,020
On a greyhound of this big town

344
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,480
She can't see me

345
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,400
I came to be with him

346
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,660
Just like he said

347
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,920
Then suddenly he left her

348
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,820
For reasons that she still don't understand

349
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,020
And on the backside of Dallas

350
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,920
A girl must earn her way

351
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,680
As best she can

352
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,040
That's it.

353
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,180
It's a long way to Dallas

354
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,520
For a small-town girl

355
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,720
From the middle of Tennessee

356
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,080
And a tenth-grade education

357
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,160
Won't get you no kind of job

358
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,540
Here in Big D

359
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,360
Hunger, pains, and pride

360
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,900
The thing that just don't go

361
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,780
Hand in hand for long

362
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,660
And on the backside of Dallas

363
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,600
A hungry small-town girl

364
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,060
Can find a home

365
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,960
On the backside of Dallas

366
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,840
Nervously she takes another pill

367
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,480
And on the backside of Dallas

368
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,080
On the backside of Dallas

369
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,720
Tonight like other nights

370
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,620
She drinks her fill

371
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,420
She pays the man behind the bar

372
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,480
And leaves the change

373
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,080
For a twenty-dollar bill

374
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,360
If you're ever feeling lonesome

375
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,000
And you want to find someone

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,660
Who feels the same

377
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,400
She's on the backside of Dallas

378
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,460
Where every day she's alone

379
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,920
And every taxi driver knows her name

380
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,500
She's on the backside of Dallas

381
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,840
Where every taxi driver knows her name

382
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,700
It's very exciting to combine

383
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,480
Prayer, ritual, and magic

384
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,660
In with your sexual practices

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,580
Evoke some spirits before you make love

386
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,420
That's where you come in, Connie

387
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,980
I'm the kind of woman

388
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,360
Not hard to understand

389
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,580
I'm the one who cracks the whip

390
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,640
And holds the upper hand

391
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,660
I'll beat you, mistreat you

392
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,060
Till you quiver and quail

393
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,300
The male of the species

394
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,360
Is more deadly than the man

395
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,820
When you mess with me

396
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,100
Or flirt around with the flame

397
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,440
When you find that you've been burned

398
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,220
You've only yourself to blame

399
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,300
I'll hurt you, desert you

400
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,480
If you ever should fail

401
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,920
The female of the species

402
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,080
Is more deadly than the man

403
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,640
This week's Hour of Slack

404
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,340
is brought to you by me

405
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,480
The irreverent Friday Jones

406
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,420
Can't escape me now

407
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,180
Whatever appears on the television screen

408
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,940
Emerges as raw experience for those who watch it

409
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,540
And the television screen

410
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,600
Is connected up at the mind's eye

411
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,860
principal

412
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,620
and cosmic

413
00:20:51,760 --> 00:21:06,520
and look at what your TV channel

414
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:06,600
If you've ever watched

415
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,600


416
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,600


417
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,600


418
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,920
Baling

419
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,400
Baling

420
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Llama

421
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,580
Baling

422
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,300
I say unto you.

423
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,080
Well, the Amazon sisters are playing the gospel jazz back there.

424
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,660
Second generation.

425
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,600
Yeah.

426
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,960
And you notice that in a mirror with a mere 15 minutes of training on the saxophone,

427
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,960
I sound better than any of the males in any of the doctor bands.

428
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,280
Yes, sir.

429
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,820
Well, but that's sort of like saying you can shot put better than anyone at the Special Olympics.

430
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,040
Thank you.

431
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,560
Well, I hope you're not picking up transmissions from last Tuesday.

432
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,600
Man.

433
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,700
No, I haven't played that tape yet tonight.

434
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,880
I don't think I will.

435
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,080
I haven't either.

436
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,740
I was putting together a show.

437
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,180
I'm doing two shows at once right this second.

438
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,200
Three shows.

439
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,360
Three shows at one time.

440
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,320
But your show sounds a lot better.

441
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,100
The live show.

442
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,260
Yeah.

443
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,740
The live show.

444
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,840
The eardrum of the mind's ear.

445
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,460
Well, where is everybody?

446
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,960
Did Dave stay home?

447
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
Well, they should be.

448
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,840
Yeah, Dave stayed home.

449
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,500
Or did he have to stop and pick up all the girls?

450
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,780
He picked up the girls and he probably went back home.

451
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,680
Yeah.

452
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,360
That's probably why.

453
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,900
But, God, how can he handle that many of them?

454
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,020
I don't know.

455
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,740
Yeah.

456
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,020
Why do they call him lonesome anyway?

457
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:09,900
I don't know.

458
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,540
I think where he lives, Ashtabula, is kind of like, you know, the old version of Venus.

459
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,200
You know, how people thought Venus used to be.

460
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,120
Rainy.

461
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,600
Rainy and swampy and filled with women.

462
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah.

463
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,180
And that's where Dave lives.

464
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,640
A rainy, swampy, filled with swamp women kind of place.

465
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,800
Speaking of swamp women and space women,

466
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:39,640
I've got a list somewhere here of all the movies I could think of that featured space queens.

467
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,000
And I had expert advice.

468
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,500
Susie the floozy and Sister Decadence are both camp, kitschy movie experts were advising me.

469
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,980
Damn it, now I can't find the list.

470
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,840
But I know that Abbott and Costello go to Mars.

471
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,880
Yeah.

472
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,640
Has the ultimate scenes of Venus.

473
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,240
Wow.

474
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,380
Wouldn't it just figure a movie titled with Mars in it, they go to Venus.

475
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,140
But they do.

476
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,340
They do.

477
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,700
And Venus is populated by.

478
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,540
Beautiful women.

479
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,180
Of course.

480
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,200
Who speculate about whether they want to make it with Lou Costello.

481
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,680
And that they eventually decide not to since they don't need men.

482
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
Which is kind of a wise move.

483
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:22,780
Yeah.

484
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,740
They probably had that choice at one point here on Earth and they blew it, so to speak.

485
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,340
Yeah.

486
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,700
We've been playing Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

487
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,500
I want to run through the list there of that.

488
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,320
That's Michelle George on violin, electric violin.

489
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,800
There you hear that.

490
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,640
That Hendrix-y kind of stuff there.

491
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,340
She is the Hendrix of the electric violin.

492
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,480
And then there's a lonesome cowboy Dave on guitars.

493
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,140
And myself on keyboards.

494
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,040
And John Peck.

495
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,480
And he's Chaz Smith.

496
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,300
Cantor Chaz Smith.

497
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,760
And also on this tape, I think you hear Ron Slade with Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the background.

498
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,060
Let's just listen for a minute shall we?

499
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,480
Heh heh.

500
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,460
.

501
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,460


502
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,860
.

503
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,200
.

504
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,880
.

505
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


506
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


507
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


508
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


509
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


510
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


511
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


512
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


513
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,880


514
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,240
.

515
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,200
.

516
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,200


517
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,200


518
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,200


519
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,200


520
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,320
Accept the fact that you're probably stupid.

521
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,940
But don't feel bad about it friend.

522
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,740
Almost everyone else is too.

523
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,280
In fact, the studies have shown that 95% of the population consistently behaves in a manner

524
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,640
that can be described.

525
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:48,440
as stupid. Of the remaining 5%, 2% are in hiding, 2% are incarcerated in mental institutions,

526
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:56,960
and the final 1% is actively engaged in stealing everyone else blind. Some people have said that

527
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,280
the educational system is not really to blame for this state of affairs. These people are idiots.

528
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,740
Of course the educational system is to blame, and we're not talking about widely publicized

529
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,800
instances of graduates who can't read their own diplomas. Even the smug valedictorians and

530
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,960
highly touted PhDs often never develop the ability to really think for themselves.

531
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,280
The educational system, from Head Start to Harvard, is designed to provide nothing more

532
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,960
than advanced vocational training. Hell, it takes 12 years just to learn how to play whatever

533
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,660
cog-like role the student winds up in in this bewilderingly complex industrial economy.

534
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:44,500
The students who show more aptitude end up as bigger cogs, but damn few of them show any sort

535
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:52,060
of creative cognition. Those who do have, have developed this on their own, sometimes by accident,

536
00:26:52,120 --> 00:27:00,520
sometimes through sheer defiance of a system that promotes unthinking passive conformity.

537
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,320
Well, good for them. Unfortunately, many more never even conceive of such a notion,

538
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,720
and the educational system is not to blame.

539
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,360
The educational system can't be held entirely responsible. It only holds its victims for

540
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,600
a limited time before they're released to produce and consume. From that point on, the

541
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:28,600
mass media entirely takes over the job of intelligent suppression, as does this show.

542
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,500
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Actually, that was from Stamp Out Slavery

543
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,580
by...

544
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:44,620
There he is! There he is, did it! With Reverend Crawford Smith. Ah, yes, here it is.

545
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,320
Here it is.

546
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,400
Everything that Bob is is something else.

547
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,160
Everything that Bob is is something else.

548
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,720
Even if he goes insane, he's gonna step right in and steal your brain.

549
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,820
Everything that Bob is is something else.

550
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,660
He will tell the exes what to do.

551
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,580
He will tell them lies that are also true.

552
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,320
Come July 1998, the stockpiste of removal will see your face.

553
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,500
Will you have the slack to see you through?

554
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,440
Oh, Bob will cook you cookies.

555
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,700
Bob will stew you stew.

556
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,640
Bob's a groovy, a real gone daddy, and a red-hot mama, too.

557
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,440
He sells anything that can be sold.

558
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,420
He can turn old chalk straps into gold.

559
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,500
If you send him lots of bucks, he will spend them wild.

560
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,100
I like to be like Bob, for I grow old.

561
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,080
Cause everything that Bob is is something else.

562
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,100
And everything that Bob is is something else.

563
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,640
Even if he goes insane, he's gonna step right in and steal your brain.

564
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,980
Everything that Bob is is something else.

565
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,400
See, I didn't write that song. The Ruggles smacked that song.

566
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,540
Yeah, Bob, glad to have you.

567
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,220
Oh dear friends, and that was Ahmed Fishmonger.

568
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,500
That takes care of our old Bob song department.

569
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,700
Ahmed, Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

570
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,360
Everything that Bob is is something else.

571
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,840
Did you guys actually go into the Vortex to do your recording?

572
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,380
There's a Vortex lab?

573
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,400
The Vortex videos?

574
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,020
No, no we don't.

575
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,520
We wouldn't have to go into a Vortex to record.

576
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,180
This is good.

577
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,720
We don't play it to you?

578
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:50,720


579
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:50,720


580
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:50,720


581
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:50,720


582
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:50,720


583
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,800
What's noise to some people is music to others.

584
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,660
The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake.

585
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:32,460
Please do not turn off your radio, but turn up the volume on your receiver as high as it can go

586
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,680
so that you can make the sound we broadcast as loud as possible.

587
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,460
This is Bill T. Miller, orgy of noise.

588
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,360
Plague of MP3s. Cut one.

589
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,720
EXO Radio is on the air.

590
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,140
Load up those FROB rockets.

591
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,460
Light the fuse.

592
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,780
We'll be taking off in just a moment.

593
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:53,860
My name is Chaz, and I'll be your pilot.

594
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,220
Wanna go for a ride?

595
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,360
Yeah.

596
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,320
Yeah.

597
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,020
Yeah.

598
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,080
Yeah.

599
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,580
Yeah.

600
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,060
Yeah.

601
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,260
Yeah.

602
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,080
Yeah.

603
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,840
Yeah.

604
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,500
Yeah.

605
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,620
Yeah.

606
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,660
Yeah.

607
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,660
Yeah.

608
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,540
Yeah.

609
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,960
Yeah.

610
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,680
Yeah.

611
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,680


612
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,680


613
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,680


614
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,760
Yeah.

615
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:42,760


616
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:42,760


617
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,880
That's it.

618
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,900
Yeah.

619
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,560
Uh huh.

620
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
Everyone does a good job.

621
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:47,560


622
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,680
Build your own rocket ship.

623
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,220
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

624
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,420
Listen very carefully.

625
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,220
If you ever hear a sound like this, run for your life.

626
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,260
Yeah, no kidding. I wish I could run for my life.

627
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,920
Here I am, once again, having to listen to anti-music.

628
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,020
Honestly enough, I've been in three anti-music bands, and I've always hated this stuff.

629
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,380
But I guess if it didn't hurt your ears, then wouldn't you be talking to noise?

630
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,500
Oh!

631
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,880
Yeah!

632
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,740
Oh!

633
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,060
There's wheels, like knives in my ears!

634
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,060
I hate this stuff! It hurts!

635
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:58,480
I can't stand a damn second of this god-awful inferno, rat!

636
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,500
Do these people think they're artists or something?

637
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,940
I guess so.

638
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,900
You know the saddest thing is something.

639
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,160
People pay for it.

640
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:26,360
But I guess if they would've paid to listen to stuff like this, that's their fault.

641
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:36,340
But if I guess that's cool these days, I guess that means you're real hip if your ears can stand the power for more than just a few seconds!

642
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,260
Ah!

643
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,580
Ah!

644
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:37,960
Ah!

645
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,860
Ah!

646
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,460
Ah!

647
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,320
Ah!

648
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:40,800
Ah!

649
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,540
Ah!

650
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:43,680
Ah!

651
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:43,940


652
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,040
Ah!

653
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,220
Ah!

654
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,720
Oh!

655
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,140
Ah!

656
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:51,640
Ah!

657
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:51,640


658
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:51,640


659
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,060
Argh!

660
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,100
Argh!

661
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,800
Parece como faire

662
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:13,240
Es lógico que entremlin no

663
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,080
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

664
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,700
I will not be pushed.

665
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,100
And that is Auditory Metis

666
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,900
by Bill T. Miller,

667
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
orgy and an orgy of noise.

668
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Actually, it's the name of Bill T. Miller's new band,

669
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,300
and this CD is Plague of MP3s by Orgy of Noise.

670
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,380
Here's the information.

671
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,740
BillTMiller.com

672
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,880
That's all you need to know.

673
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Well, unless you have a computer,

674
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,860
in which case,

675
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,700
take this post office box number down.

676
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,700
Orgy of Noise, P.O. Box 230221.

677
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,220
Once again, that's P.O. Box 230221.

678
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,640
P.O. Box 230221.

679
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,400
Boston, Massachusetts.

680
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,560
Zero, two, one, two, three.

681
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,160
Zero, two, one, two, three.

682
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,400
Want to take a ride?

683
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,820
Hello, friends.

684
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,200
And welcome.

685
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,720
This sermon tonight regards a very important epidemic

686
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,160
that is sweeping America today.

687
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,540
It's called consumptionitis.

688
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,940
Consumptionitis is a disease

689
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,800
created in the underground laboratories

690
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,980
of the conspiracy.

691
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,460
It is transmitted through the air,

692
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,880
via radio, television,

693
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,680
and through casual contact

694
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,320
with newspapers and magazines.

695
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,700
The symptoms include a pinkness of complexion,

696
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,220
followed by a pinkness of complexion,

697
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,600
followed by obsessive buying behavior.

698
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,580
The victims feel a craving for an object or thing

699
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,500
they don't really need,

700
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,460
but they'll do anything to get it.

701
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,300
Anything.

702
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,080
Whether it's illegal, immoral, or unhealthy.

703
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,780
But the worst part of the disease

704
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,300
is that it never gets better.

705
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,360
It only gets worse.

706
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,740
Like a drug addiction,

707
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,700
they have to have larger doses

708
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,300
in shorter amounts of time.

709
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,480
Life seems out of control.

710
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,880
Well, let me rephrase that.

711
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,140
Life is in control,

712
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,440
but it feels like it's in control of someone else.

713
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,080
Something else.

714
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,180
An age-old nemesis we call

715
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,640
the conspiracy.

716
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,220
Once you have consumptionitis,

717
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,460
the conspiracy has got you right where it wants you.

718
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,080
You become a pawn in their global game of chess.

719
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,700
An expendable token they can use or discard.

720
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,700
You're cheap to maintain,

721
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,900
and you're easy to replace.

722
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,600
They wear you down and use you up

723
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,280
until you're no longer worth the supervision.

724
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,760
What happens to you then

725
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,200
is not their conspiracy.

726
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,440
It's their concern.

727
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,160
Unfortunately,

728
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,880
consumptionitis isn't called consumptionitis

729
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,080
because the victim consumes products,

730
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,120
but rather because the victim consumes themselves.

731
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,000
They get caught up in a downward spiral

732
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,920
of buying and spending and paying off debt.

733
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,720
There's no such thing as living with the disease.

734
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,320
Those infected have all jumped off a building

735
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,620
and will each hit the pavement sooner or later.

736
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,860
How soon is uncertain.

737
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,660
But the longer they fall,

738
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,680
the harder they hit.

739
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,940
Before they bottom out,

740
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,580
they suffer the effects of atrophy.

741
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,500
They basically wither away on the vine.

742
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,140
When they hit rock bottom,

743
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,900
only the outside shell is destroyed,

744
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,020
the insides having evaporated long ago.

745
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,200
This atrophy is barely noticeable,

746
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,760
except for the highs one used to get

747
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,100
while spending are not as high as they were before,

748
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,060
and the depression one felt between purchases

749
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,800
becomes deeper and longer lasting.

750
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,240
As one consumer put it,

751
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,740
the more they had,

752
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,160
the less they wanted it.

753
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,980
That's because each possession

754
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,120
became a symbol of stress and self-betrayal

755
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,760
that each person went through

756
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,740
in order to obtain that particular object.

757
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,720
Doctors for Bob put it this way,

758
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,860
the first organ destroyed by the disease

759
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,240
is usually the soul.

760
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,880
How bad is this epidemic, you ask?

761
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,780
Well, just look at it.

762
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
Just look around you and see for yourself.

763
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,120
Crime is up.

764
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,340
Prostitution is up.

765
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,320
Panhandling is at an all-time high.

766
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,560
People are desperate for easy money

767
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,720
so they can buy things.

768
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,220
These aren't people trying to just get by.

769
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,360
Any welfare recipient can get food stamps

770
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,520
and a free place to live,

771
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,900
but they want the superficial add-ons

772
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,100
the advertisers tell them they gotta have.

773
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,680
The hundred dollar sneakers,

774
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,700
the fast car,

775
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,140
the latest fashion.

776
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,780
And what is big government doing about it?

777
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,900
Why, feeding the frenzy, of course.

778
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,440
Adding blood to the water.

779
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,020
They run lotteries to cash in on the trend.

780
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
They overtax booze

781
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,220
so victims can't even escape reality

782
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,000
without going further into debt.

783
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,060
They clamp down on drugs

784
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,720
to make the junkies pay more too.

785
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,160
The public will not only pay for their addiction,

786
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,740
they will pay for the privilege of their addiction.

787
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,500
But ladies and gentlemen,

788
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,980
I am not here to depress you about this plague.

789
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,160
I'm here to tell you about

790
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,820
an exciting new breakthrough.

791
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
A miracle cure

792
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,080
that can be administered to anyone,

793
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:16,940
anywhere,

794
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,000
and anytime.

795
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,720
This cure has no FDA approval.

796
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,960
This cure cannot be found in stores.

797
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,100
It can only be purchased for one source,

798
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,380
the Subgenius Foundation.

799
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,460
And for one price,

800
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,780
30 lousy bucks.

801
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,820
And with one catch,

802
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,560
you must praise Bob.

803
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,300
Place your hands on the speaker, my friends,

804
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,260
to make that last but most important of purchases.

805
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,740
Say with me,

806
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,440
Oh Bob,

807
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,960
I am a Subgenius sinner

808
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
and I must have slack.

809
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,820
I'm sending you your check

810
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,200
to the Subgenius Foundation.

811
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,920
Now please, oh mighty salesman,

812
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,360
invade my body and purge it of the pains

813
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,760
and chains of consumption-itis

814
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,260
so that I may join the legions

815
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,160
of satisfied customers

816
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,240
who proudly proclaim,

817
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,840
Bob sold it,

818
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,220
I bought it,

819
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,600
and that settles it.

820
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,000
Now send that 30 lousy dollars,

821
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,260
your love offering,

822
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,280
to the Subgenius Foundation,

823
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,140
P.O. Box 14-0306,

824
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,720
Dallas, Texas,

825
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,280
75214,

826
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,240
and praise Bob!

827
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,800
Amen!

828
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,300

836
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,820
.

837
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,420
.

838
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,860
.

839
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,880
guitar solo

840
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,960
guitar solo

841
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,520
guitar solo

842
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,160
guitar solo

843
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,240
guitar solo

844
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,420
guitar solo

845
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,900
mine is not a weird set

846
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,540
we're not

847
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,220
I'm just gonna keep hitting that button

848
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,420
until there's a female voice

849
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,680
hey Chad you staying

850
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,420
I think we're kinda next into the

851
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:18,800
the

852
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:18,940
the

853
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,260
Anti-macho, I mean the macho anti-what-you-call-it dimension nightmare.

854
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,440
What? No.

855
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,520
We ain't heard no wind so far. Maybe there ain't none anymore. Wouldn't that be awful?

856
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,460
You know, there's a science fiction novel where all the women and men are split into two different Earth dimensions.

857
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,180
And they just spend all their time trying to cross that other dimension?

858
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,740
Well, a lot of them spend a lot of time praying.

859
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,080
Yeah. I try and get into some kind of trans-dimensional movement there.

860
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,640
I try and be a trans-dement.

861
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,240
I'd like maybe to put my worst foot forward.

862
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,720
I'd try and suck some part of my proboscis out there if I could.

863
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,920
And maybe just like hope, like when you go fishing or something,

864
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,820
you just throw your line anywhere and hope you don't get an old shoe or something.

865
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:08,220
Well, you've got a long enough proboscis, you ought to be able to catch something.

866
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:09,820
Oh, thanks, boss. Thanks.

867
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,420
And I owe it all to you, too. Without them tools, man,

868
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,000
I still would have been a two-inch weakling.

869
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,880
One of these days, I'm going to want that nose tip back.

870
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,640
Well, I was kind of born with that suction.

871
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,500
I was talking about my other proboscis.

872
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,700
Oh, you can go ahead and keep that nut for another year or two.

873
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,980
Oh, man, it works great with that one nostril, Chris, because you know what I mean?

874
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,140
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

875
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,700
And it stopped that nasal drip, if you also don't understand it.

876
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,740
Oh, say no more.

877
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,500
Oh, yeah.

878
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,300
Oh, yeah.

879
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,120
Oh, yeah.

880
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,900
Oh, yeah.

881
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,640
Oh, wow.

882
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,480
Nice blinding aura.

883
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:49,620
Who the hell are you?

884
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:58,920
Oh, how tragic that you do not recognize me, she who calls herself floozy.

885
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,160
For I am all floozies from all times and all dimensions.

886
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,560
The queen of all sudates.

887
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,200
What, you mean you're Margaret Trudeau?

888
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:11,680
Yeah.

889
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,340
Sheesh, bimbo breath, you're showing your age.

890
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,340
That's slut, S-O-U-T-T-E, baby.

891
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,200
Slut with an exponent.

892
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,180
That means you're...

893
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,980
Say it.

894
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,820
You're...

895
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,500
Connie?

896
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,220
Ha, ha, you got it, toots.

897
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,700
Connie, Bob's first and primary wife.

898
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,820
Blah, blah, blah, you know the spiel.

899
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,580
But, Connie, why...

900
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:41,960
Why me?

901
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,780
Yeah, good question.

902
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:50,920
All I know is I ain't spending the next millennium dodging Bob's groin grenades and sucking

903
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,160
on Titmuss' ratty-ass cult.

904
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,840
Yes, X-Day has separated the wheat from the chaff.

905
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,900
And I say it's time for a yeast defection.

906
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,500
So I'm here to make you an offer.

907
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,420
An offer?

908
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,040
One which you can't refuse.

909
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:09,660
Refuse?

910
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,900
Oh, you've refused me.

911
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,660
Plenty in the past, baby.

912
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,800
Oh, Connie's too soft, too girly, too unfunny.

913
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,140
No!

914
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,600
Yeah, don't lie.

915
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,400
I know you inside and out, sugarplum.

916
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:31,540
You threw in your lot with that rat bastard Bob, and you never gave me a second glance.

917
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,320
Well, what has Bob got you, floos?

918
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,640
You're worse off than ever before.

919
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,740
On the skits, your psyche's hanging in tatters,

920
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,540
and your booty, ha, you ain't seen no action in so long.

921
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,640
Your chakras are positively mortared in place.

922
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,700
Oh, but floos, I don't think you're a lost cause.

923
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,720
Cause?

924
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,740
Because I said so, that's why.

925
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,540
Ow!

926
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,400
You served Bob well, and with no return to show for it, too.

927
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,600
Oh, yes, I've been watching you.

928
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,580
And I must say, I like that cut of your gibberish.

929
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:11,720
Oh.

930
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,240
Oh, join the winning team, floos.

931
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,520
Join the Connieites.

932
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,460
We can be on top.

933
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,840
The power behind the throne has her finger on the button of the ejection seat.

934
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,100
Oh, yes, they'll be sleeping in our schism for a change.

935
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:36,560
With your help, I can use a good sleeper agent.

936
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,980
Ah, yes.

937
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:39,840
Yes.

938
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,540
Yes.

939
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:40,920


940
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,680
Yes.

941
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:41,720
Yes.

942
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


943
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


944
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


945
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


946
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


947
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


948
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


949
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


950
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


951
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


952
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


953
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


954
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


955
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


956
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


957
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


958
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


959
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


960
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:41,720


961
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:41,920
Netflix.

962
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


963
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


964
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


965
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


966
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


967
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


968
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,920


969
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:41,940
It's just like...

970
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,060
It's my heart, and your heart is like your Holy Spirit working feverishly under me.

971
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,960
Under?

972
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,040
Me.

973
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,340
Hm.

974
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:55,680
I'll give you an eternal peace in both senses of the word.

975
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,040
I, uh...

976
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,300
Say it.

977
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,280
Bu, uh...

978
00:51:59,280 --> 00:51:59,960
Yes?

979
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,060
I...

980
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,980
Yes.

981
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,520
Um-uh.

982
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,160
Oh, you can't say no, Suzy.

983
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,940
It's just not in you.

984
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:11,720
Oh I, I don't have enough time.

985
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:11,720


986
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:11,720


987
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,840
but I am.

988
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,580
Oh, yeah.

989
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,140
Looks like we got our bass, girls.

990
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,220
Reel her in.

991
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,640
Yeah, and go easy on the gaffing hooks.

992
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,400
This looks like lampshade quality hide.

993
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,900
It appears as though something has happened

994
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,040
in the motorcade group.

995
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,780
Take me, make me,

996
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,080
Mow me, fold me,

997
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,900
Shape my body.

998
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,680
You can improve me,

999
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,480
Reveal and new me,

1000
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,320
Heat up or cool me,

1001
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,840
But don't forget to wake me up tight.

1002
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,140
You know I had a lot on my mind,

1003
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,920
This tired old ice,

1004
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,720
Oh, it is so bright.

1005
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:15,220
I wonder what the future will bring.

1006
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,760
Want to take a ride?

1007
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,100
Flying saucers in the air,

1008
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,800
Saucers in the sky,

1009
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,380
I know they're circling around the planet,

1010
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,860
And here's the reason why.

1011
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,780
Here is Bob Bob.

1012
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:49,560
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

1013
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,780
Well, do they walk around with their moon pants open all the time?

1014
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,260
Well, they like, you know, the kind of place I'm in.

1015
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:00,920
Some of them like to just pull the moon pants down around the leg shackles and just make a good...

1016
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,300
Go for a walk.

1017
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,460
Oh, baby.

1018
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,220
You find that...

1019
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:11,040
It depends on the appendages they've got on their body, of course.

1020
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,420
Well, here, most of them, they got the normal ones, but all shrilled up.

1021
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,840
But we do have some people I have serious doubts of if they have human origin.

1022
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,460
Oh, well, can you hook us up?

1023
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,720
Can I hook you?

1024
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,040
I suppose if I was given some incentive.

1025
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,320
Hmm.

1026
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,340
Well, Dave's a pimp now.

1027
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:28,960
Yeah.

1028
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,840
A pimp.

1029
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,440
Well, call it what you will.

1030
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,440
Retard pimp for the bulldagger.

1031
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,520
Oh, a retard pimp for alien bulldagger.

1032
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,060
Lonesome retard pimp Dave.

1033
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,680
A pimp for alien bulldagger.

1034
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,580
Well, I suppose it'd be worse things, at least in this sorry state we're in, of mankind.

1035
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,300
Actually, I don't mean to demean differently abled persons.

1036
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,700
I was actually confusing the situation of mental retardation with mental illness,

1037
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,560
which they're usually two different things,

1038
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,840
although in the case of the Church of the Subgenius, we try for simultaneity.

1039
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:10,560
Well, I heard you've been pimping the mentally ill for bulldagger.

1040
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,700
For many years.

1041
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,480
Ah, some call it mentally ill.

1042
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,460
Some call it deeply religious.

1043
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:16,640
Yeah.

1044
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,000
You know, where do you draw the line between deeply religious and mentally ill?

1045
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,740
Well, in the second, you know, when the host is an alien host that goes in your body,

1046
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,120
I don't know, that's a little bit beyond regular.

1047
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,120
Well, that's science.

1048
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,860
That's not religion anymore.

1049
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,020
If you've got an alien host that you can prove is in your body,

1050
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,040
then, Christ, Bob, you're on my team.

1051
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,740
You're an evangelical.

1052
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,560
That is not the aim of science.

1053
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,660
Too late.

1054
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,020
Religion can fight for us all.

1055
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:54,100
Fix me, mix me, rearrange me, change my body, make it so pretty, like an racist me.

1056
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:00,360
You have to kiss me, but don't forget to wave me tight.

1057
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,680
You know I've got to keep a center light.

1058
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,440
You're such a child, you're changing in style.

1059
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,840
You can't make me feel a second time

1060
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,580
that I got a chance to fly.

1061
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:30,220
You gotta make me feel like I got a chance to raise my kids,

1062
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,520
and it's half what I want.

1063
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,960
And if you don't have any thought and a gonna hit me with that,

1064
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,120
that's what I figured.

1065
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,420
You don't get to wear it.

1066
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:39,420


1067
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,300
to give all your innermost desires

1068
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,540
for spiritual tranquility and bliss.

1069
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,020
Well, I offer such bliss.

1070
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,420
I offer it to you daily

1071
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,920
on a functional and miscreant basis

1072
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,680
you can hardly put a handle on.

1073
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,740
Everyone knows I've got the diamonds in the box.

1074
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,140
I have got the emeralds, the sapphires,

1075
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,940
and the other meteorological phantasms

1076
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,580
that you put right inside your radio.

1077
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,520
I've got the miracle elixir and the anointment oils

1078
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,720
which only cause more oinking in the pastures

1079
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,680
and those who have not been made ready

1080
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,880
for this final passage.

1081
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,500
You think that's, I mean you there,

1082
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,300
you specifically, the man with one horn

1083
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,540
in the middle of his face.

1084
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,020
I am speaking to you as if you were Satan himself.

1085
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,980
You, Satan.

1086
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,140
You, of all people or things,

1087
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,040
should know better than to whoop us so.

1088
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,820
Wasn't it you, yourself,

1089
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,500
you one-horned thing, you,

1090
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,600
who was thrown out of your own,

1091
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,960
well, if not father's, your own uncle's house

1092
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,700
for behaving in a manner or fashion unbecoming

1093
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,900
and here you come into our little world.

1094
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,520
And friends, I can tell you exactly how.

1095
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,540
How to get to our little world.

1096
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,960
It's so easy and so beautiful here

1097
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,800
at the church of the subgenius at,

1098
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,760
got that pencil ready, friends?

1099
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:29,200
Box 140306, beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1100
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,000
75214.

1101
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,560
75214.

1102
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:36,560


1103
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:36,560


1104
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:41,540
That's www.subgenius.com

1105
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,080
and you can write to Einstein Secret Orchestra

1106
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:50,160
at P.O. Box 81555.

1107
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,820
Once again, that's P.O. Box 81555.

1108
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,700
Cleveland, Ohio.

1109
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,340
44181, dear friends, that's zip code 44181.

1110
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,720
This has been the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

1111
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,100
along with Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1112
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:17,580
And in this case, we also had Eric Johnson

1113
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,760
playing in the background.

1114
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,700
Sister Susie the floozy did the incredible media barrage

1115
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,640
that we've been listening to with the women,

1116
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,120
the attack of the women show we've been hearing.

1117
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,600
The Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger did everything that Bob is

1118
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,520
is something else.

1119
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,020
And the orgy of noise, the Papa Joe Mama,

1120
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:40,340
the world without women and the world without men,

1121
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,800
praise Bob and help me somebody.

1122
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,040
It's a beautiful thing.

1123
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,740
Oh yes, the harvest.

1124
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,780
See ya, XX Day.

1125
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:51,640
Wanna go for a ride?

1126
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,960
Well, oh, oh, oh, oh, was that it?

1127
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,880
Is that everything?

1128
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,540
Yes, you've created something.

1129
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,360
Very, very unusual, I must say, but.

1130
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:08,800
What?

1131
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,320
It seems to me, it appears that all of these creations,

1132
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,640
if left to their own devices,

1133
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,720
will destroy the entire world, is that not so?

1134
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,840
Well, that's what Bob is all about.

1135
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,940
Yes, it is so, Doctor.

1136
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,060
It is indeed so, and so I have planned it.

1137
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,800
You see, I have no further use for this world

1138
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,740
or its inhabitants.

1139
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,400
I wish only for their demise.

1140
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,420
Do you find this?

1141
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,760
A bit.

1142
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,380
No, no, that's a colostomy bag, what I'm saying.

1143
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,220
Look, look down there, Doctor.

1144
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,400
You're not a real doctor.

1145
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,700
You're a fool, a pentagone, a jokester.

1146
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:53,660
A subgenius.

1147
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:54,440
A jokester, perhaps.

1148
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:55,480
A doctor.

1149
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,460
I think the joke's on you.

1150
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,200
If you look out that bay window, you'll notice.

1151
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:02,940
The greatest joke ever told.

1152
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,800
The greatest joke ever told.

1153
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,460
If Earth can make it to the punchline.

1154
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,780
Oh, yes.

1155
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:19,300
I turned him into a fly with one little wink of my eye.

1156
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:20,020
A fly.

1157
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:20,980
A fly.

1158
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,140
If I am you, you are an overmatch.

1159
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,520
An overman with Bob.

1160
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,120
You can be alone.

1161
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,000
You can be alone.

1162
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000


1163
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000


1164
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
With Bob.

1165
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,920
Death of a fly.

1166
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,740
Death of a fly.

1167
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,140
Death of a fly.

1168
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,000
End of the show.

1169
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,960
Death of a fly.

1170
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,880
Come on baller.

1171
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,480
End of the show, do it.

1172
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,920
Death of a fly.

1173
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,180
Death of a fly.

1174
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,840
Death of a fly.

1175
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,500
Death of a fly.

1176
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,100
Death of a fly.

1177
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,700
Death of a fly.

1178
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,080
Death of a fly.

1179
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,260
From a real man.

1180
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,500
Death of a fly, a real man.

1181
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,860
Death, how much you die.

1182
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:05,980
Death of a fly.

1183
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:05,980
