1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
I bring you a warning.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,880
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,660
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,560
Watch the skies.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,820
New from Dobbs Cove, tasty prairie squid spread.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,380
Salted and unsalted varieties available on the East Coast only.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,320
The radioactive cloud is now over Little Rock.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,240
The craggy shat piercingly.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,340
Get your things out of this house right now before I throw them into the street and you're with them.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,740
Bye, June.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,800
Get out before I...

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,140
Yeah!

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,460
Oh, my beloved spermulites.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,380
Before destruction overtakes us, we must flee to another planet.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,300
I have consulted the universe.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,740
I have consulted the universal viewmaster and found a tiny distant sphere.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,320
No more than a napturd in the mind of God called Earth.

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,960
The intellectual capacity of its inhabitants is so low, we can easily enslave their feeble minds.

19
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,520
But there is another, even easier way to bring these hideous bipeds to their knees.

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,720
It is their weakness for a disgusting physical act called sex.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,220
To describe the erotic practices of these sex-ridden morons, at once lewd and ludicrous,

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,340
would make even an incorporeal vapour lose its lunge.

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,660
And so, I summon into my presence a chosen group of elderly and experienced spermulites.

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,340
Come to your big mother, oh creatures of the mist,

25
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,040
ye who will go forth as a vanguard to prepare the way for the rest of us.

26
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,780
Your venerable ears alone are wise enough to hear these vile human practices without alarm.

27
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Your all-knowing minds alone can contemplate the hideous flab of the universe.

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,280
Can you emanate or destroy the universal practice of human form without screaming in horror at what you see?

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,200
Know ye this, that through all the ages of evolution, the earthlings have failed to reach the stage of auto-reproduction.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,560
Two beings are required to join in repulsive physical union in order to bring forth others of their kind.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,720
Though their wise men are slowly perfecting methods of reproduction which do not require this ridiculous practice,

32
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,880
or the humiliating preliminaries which lead up to it.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
You will assume the form and function of one of these beings.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,280
The space is speaking.

35
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,020
stronger, more intelligent, more vital and aggressive creature called woman.

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,860
With the power of her sexual allure, she rules over her weakened spineless victim called man.

37
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,660
His pathetic sexual organ rises and swells at her command

38
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,640
and shrivels and wilts when she is drained out its strength.

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,140
Man is a slave to this absurd biological reflex.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,800
And when you assume female form, you will have him in your power.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
Now take on that form, oh chosen spermalite.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,480
Dwell in female flesh.

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,280
Look upon yourselves and tell me what you see.

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,200
Women everywhere are having a love affair with Bieber.

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Rated PG.

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,080
I believe deeply in your taxes.

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
All my life, I fought our land, water and people.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,260
That's what I'll do in the Senate.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,640
I approve your vote.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,480
I want to be your senator because I want to change things.

51
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,780
And especially the middle class.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,880
We all approve this terrorism.

53
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,460
The federal government might soon be headed to the United States.

54
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,040
Now here, we immerse the eggs into a warm bouillon containing free swimming spermatozoa.

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,080
Immersion continues until the eggs are all fertilized.

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Ah, and over here, here is where we bottle the alphas and betas.

57
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,760
Are there any questions?

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,840
Uh, sir, will you explain Bob?

59
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,360
Bob?

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,780
Oh, I like Bob.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,360
You asked that?

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,640
But his reputation.

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,100
You're heading for trouble.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
Now boys, come with me.

65
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:09,000
Come, a bee gives a golly gosh and better puke your peat on full throttle potent teat.

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,000
Elsewise your wants will be wagging down on mammy's hind nanny.

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Why can't your peeser pop a squeezer when the gushers are going all normal like?

68
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,600
Got you no geyser sense?

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,280
And your sneezing chamber, boy?

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,080
Hiced in an empty platter in your bean bag?

71
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,580
Where's your roller balls, eh?

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,360
I can't grok me no love grow on this loo-joo moo-joo bad.

73
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,640
You're gonna have to spreech English, Jake.

74
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,920
Get right with your muscle snake, snunk monkey.

75
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,200
Quit spritzin' your plizzerer lessen its snowing white lute juice, baby.

76
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,540
Elsewise your pleatin' bleeder's blowin' hot water.

77
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,840
You go blind or please your neether tryin' not to.

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,880
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong orbit for this kind of free-kneadin' bleedin' side trade, eh?

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,940
Well, won't you go and stand there like your dammy nickel slug or you gonna plus your plimper and righteous hargany, pee-boy?

80
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,720
Got weenie ribbers and your fluter tubes, don't you?

81
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,740
Join gumption's with the true and the see brave.

82
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,900
And pee for Bob, man, and send your jeans.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,240
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny peelin' face of pain.

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,200
This has been your enunciator. Thank me.

85
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,960
Amen.

86
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,220
Well, fun day.

87
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,140
Thanksgiving

88
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,720
After you, you did it

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,780
Went up the river, shoot from my head

90
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,480
Buried a hatchet in your riverbed

91
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,740
Got my car over the cliff, saw myself lying dead

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,820
Tortured me while you watched on TV

93
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,620
Sour of darkness, everything's turned gray

94
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,480
Now it's time for all good things to pass away

95
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,280
Ask me why, why, why, we all must go, go, go, go, go, you did it

96
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,720
Now the time has come

97
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,380
My tears run from my eyes

98
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,580
But it seems like there's no running from the lies

99
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,760
My poor heart, my poor heart lays trips on my mind

100
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,200
Love, love, love, love

101
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,780
Sour of darkness

102
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
Just before I say goodbye

103
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Like a Teflon cigarette

104
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,460
I chew my cyanide for chlorate

105
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
Write down a fake confession

106
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,860
And then send it off to you

107
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,700
Sour of darkness

108
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,700
Everything's turned gray

109
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,380
Now it's time for all good things

110
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,440
To pass away

111
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,380
Ask me why, why, why, we all must go, go, go, go, go, you did it

112
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

113
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,020
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this song introduces a new genre.

114
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,340
It's called Gospel Hell.

115
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a new genre in country and western music.

116
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,240
We call it Gosp-Hell.

117
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,100
It's gospel music for people who know they're going to hell anyway.

118
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,960
It's a little thing called Legs of Fire.

119
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,180
Well, I thought I could get away

120
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,400
With Sondra on our wedding day

121
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,060
Preacher Man said, Boy, better put away your song

122
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,140
But I said I don't cotton to no God's county law

123
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,400
But that song was stolen

124
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,440
At least that's what they said

125
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,900
So I wrapped up in asbestos

126
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,800
From my waist up to my head

127
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,500
I wrapped up in asbestos

128
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,380
That I got from Greg's

129
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,580
I only wish I had enough

130
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,340
To cover up my legs

131
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,500
So I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

132
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,560
But I ain't no liar

133
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,580
I'm burning, burning, burning

134
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,760
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

135
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, my head's dry and cool

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
So's my arms and tool

137
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,460
My torso, even more so

138
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,980
But I ain't no liar

139
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,060
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

140
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,360
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

141
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,340
Well, I was selling heroin

142
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,380
At the elementary school

143
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,500
Preacher Man said, Boy, you know that isn't cool

144
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,940
The good Lord come to me

145
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,820
Said my time was up

146
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,880
When I asked why God

147
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,060
He said because that horse was cut

148
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,280
They were shooting up in the bathroom

149
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,220
Yes, you know it's true

150
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,740
But they were not getting off

151
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,480
And that's why my soul is through

152
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,680
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

153
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,580
But I ain't no liar

154
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,680
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

155
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,820
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,060
Oh, my brain ain't in no flame

157
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,180
And my shoulder ain't in pain

158
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,180
But my toes need a hose

159
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,780
But I ain't no liar

160
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,900
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

161
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,080
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

162
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,220
Well, I was stealing cars

163
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,380
For God to try to get in well

164
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,520
But when my judgment came

165
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,620
He said, You'll have to go to hell

166
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,460
It's true I gave my son, he said

167
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,100
To pay for all your sins

168
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,640
But when you brought me that limo chain

169
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,280
Or the door was dented in

170
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,540
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

171
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,500
But I ain't no liar

172
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,620
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

173
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,800
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

174
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,940
Oh, my head ain't on the line

175
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,000
And my arm is doing fine

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,080
But my knees are crying, please

177
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,660
But I ain't no liar

178
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,740
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

179
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,940
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

180
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,740
Well, I was bashing Grandma's head

181
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,360
With a railroad tie

182
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,700
The good Lord come to me

183
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,540
And said, Why did you lie?

184
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,660
When I said, What lie?

185
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,800
God, he said, You must confess

186
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,500
That ain't your grandma's head at all

187
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
It's just a bloody mess

188
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

189
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,400
But I ain't no liar

190
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,700
Now I'm burning, burning, burning

191
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,960
My legs, my legs, my legs are fire

192
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,700
Say, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning

193
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,040
My legs, my legs are fire

194
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,120
But I ain't no liar

195
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,120


196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,120


197
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,120


198
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,280
God, he said, Why did you lie?

199
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,120
That's New York Hell and Edge.

200
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,920
That's New York Hell and Edge.

201
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,620
That's New York Hell and Edge.

202
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,080
I'll speak, I'll speak.

203
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,360
I'll speak, I'll speak.

204
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,640
I'll speak, I'll speak.

205
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,660
I'll speak, I'll speak.

206
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,860
I think I

207
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,500
You will die

208
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:19,700
I think I

209
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,220
You will die

210
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,660
You will die

211
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,040
Die

212
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,980
Die

213
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,640
Die

214
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,280
Die

215
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,940
You go to hell and you die

216
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,320
Die

217
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,580
Die

218
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,140
You go to hell and you die

219
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,480
Die

220
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,500
Die

221
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,940
I have just seen someone I know die in the most hideous, hideous way

222
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,120
Why am I Mr. Pink?

223
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,740
Mr. Pink

224
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,240
Mr. Pink

225
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,760
Mr. Pink

226
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,240
Mr. Pink

227
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,260
Why am I Mr. Pink

228
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,900
Mr. Pink

229
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,440
Mr. Pink

230
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,900
Mr. Pink

231
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,380
Mr. Pink

232
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,520
Why am I Mr. Pink?

233
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,720
Why am I Mr. Pink?

234
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,020
Mr. Pink

235
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,780
P-r nieuwe Meechains will die!!!

236
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,980
Prepare to die

237
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,940
Meech released a horror movie

238
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,760
Prepare to die

239
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,260
You must die.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,740
You must die.

241
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,960
You must die.

242
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,160
Why am I Mr. Pink?

243
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,240
Prepare to die.

244
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:06,800
You gotta pray and pray and pray and pray and pray.

245
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,840
Pray when you're feeling low, when the ill winds blow.

246
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,120
Don't forget to pray.

247
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,000
Pray when you go to bed for your daily bread.

248
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,480
Don't forget to pray.

249
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,140
You can awake to a beautiful morning.

250
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,260
When you've got troubles, remember this warning.

251
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,400
And pray until judgment day.

252
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,860
Got the devil to pay if you never pray.

253
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,740
Open up the devil's warning page.

254
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,940
That's okay.

255
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,060
You have to love Bob.

256
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,300
He loves you, Bob.

257
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,680
You love Bob.

258
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,040
You have to.

259
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,940
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

260
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,960
He'll kill you.

261
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,940
He'll bob you out.

262
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,400
He'll bob you out.

263
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,340
He'll bob you out.

264
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
He'll bob you out.

265
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,480
He'll bob you out.

266
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,680
He'll bob you out.

267
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
Only if, you know, if he...

268
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,640
There's gonna be so many reverend stangs, Kyle.

269
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,460
There's gonna be more and more and more reverend stangs.

270
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,500
Get rid of me.

271
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,040
How many stangs can there be in a pudge, friends?

272
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,920
We need that money.

273
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,140
Relative to most of my fellow kooks,

274
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:30,140


275
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,620
and crackpots, I'm...

276
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,840
I was called by possibly divine powers

277
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,340
to be a skeptic.

278
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,180
A disbeliever.

279
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,460
And I know that sounds...

280
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,940
I even have paranormal examples

281
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,820
to back up why there's no such thing.

282
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,980
I actually...

283
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,300
The most vivid one was when I alone couldn't see the UFO.

284
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,220
It's a true story.

285
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,180
Everybody else, and I'll make it very short,

286
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,980
but everybody else in the trailer court,

287
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,620
saw the UFO.

288
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,380
Well, I was there,

289
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,560
and they...

290
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,760
When they asked me what I thought it was,

291
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,620
I had to say,

292
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,300
what the hell are you talking about?

293
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,460
And they all looked at each other like,

294
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,340
this guy must be nuts.

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,840
He didn't see the UFO.

296
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,440
Well, I'm not saying that the UFO wasn't there,

297
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,540
because I was really outnumbered.

298
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,160
And I'm sure that that thing that...

299
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
I mean, it was a classic UFO sighting

300
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,320
at a trailer court.

301
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,100
What can I say?

302
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,560
In South Dakota.

303
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,480
On an Indian reservation, in fact.

304
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,180
A long time ago.

305
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,580
Classic thing.

306
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,780
But I didn't see the UFO.

307
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,060
So, it's like I was chosen to be a disbeliever.

308
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,740
It's almost like...

309
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,280
Well, in fact, for that matter,

310
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,980
not just the aliens told me,

311
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,340
but God, God Himself.

312
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,420
Yes, God told me not to believe in Him.

313
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,640
I'll go ahead and admit it

314
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,400
for the first time ever here at this stage.

315
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,000
I spoke to God.

316
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,620
Yes?

317
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,320
And, oh, by the way, God, before I forget,

318
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,160
He did mention that you can now,

319
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,140
as of this moment,

320
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,500
you can now do anything you want,

321
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,780
period.

322
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,600
He just...

323
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,300
Even if it hurts somebody else,

324
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,100
go ahead and do it.

325
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,020
That's what God told me.

326
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,040
But, no, He said...

327
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,960
God said to me,

328
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,140
He goes,

329
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,620
Stan, you know, if people...

330
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,620
He said,

331
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,060
I just don't exist the way people think I do.

332
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,040
And if they knew the way I do exist,

333
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,580
they'd...

334
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,940
they'd puke.

335
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,280
He said,

336
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,880
but they...

337
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,240
But, Stan,

338
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,960
they just couldn't possibly understand it

339
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,720
unless...

340
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,160
unless...

341
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,840
Well,

342
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:29,960
hmm...

343
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,420
Nah!

344
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,880
That's what God said.

345
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,220
Now, when I saw that bit of hesitation

346
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,560
and uncertainty on the part of God,

347
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,040
that's kind of disconcerting.

348
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,280
I've been wondering about that ever since.

349
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,940
It's really...

350
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,280
really kind of been...

351
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,060
been worrying me.

352
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,620
And we...

353
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,520
you know, we...

354
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,160
Churches of Genius started in the

355
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,060
South among the Baptists and so forth.

356
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,120
And they were telling us we were going to be...

357
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,840
going to go to hell.

358
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,300
So what else could we do but start our own religion?

359
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,580
And...

360
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,100
and we mock...

361
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,340
we try to mock pretty much all the religions,

362
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,100
including atheism.

363
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,480
Definitely including atheism.

364
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,440
As far as I'm concerned,

365
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,340
those people are the biggest kooks of all

366
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,240
because they're...

367
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,980
they are totally sure.

368
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,640
Well, I'm sorry, man,

369
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,380
but I don't...

370
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,100
I don't know for sure whose aquarium

371
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,900
I might be swimming around in.

372
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
You know, to your fish,

373
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,920
you're a cloud

374
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,100
that rains food down on them.

375
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,120
They don't know they're a fish in an aquarium.

376
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,140
I remember sit...

377
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,440
watching Beavis and Butthead with my son.

378
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,300
And Beavis and Butthead were making fun of MTV.

379
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,600
And my son and I were making fun of Beavis and Butthead,

380
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,680
making fun of MTV.

381
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,340
And then we both kind of went...

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,320
You know, like...

383
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,140
So...

384
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,700
that's...

385
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,280
that's where...

386
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,720
that's where I stand on the belief thing, man.

387
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm from the Church of Bob's Scientists.

388
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
Well, actually, Bob Hobbyist.

389
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,540
Or...

390
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,840
But to tell the honest truth,

391
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
it's really Bob...

392
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,240
Church of Bob Crackpot.

393
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,600
Bob, Crackpot.

394
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,360
And we deliberately created a net

395
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,740
to catch weirdos in crackpots.

396
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,480
I met my wife that way.

397
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,880
Right here at...

398
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,900
Right here at Brushwood, in fact.

399
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,700
Thanks again to Jeff Rosenbaum.

400
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,720
But we deliberately set out to attract weirdos.

401
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,840
And friends,

402
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,600
yes, some of them scare even us.

403
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,420
Our weirdar has a very wide range.

404
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,820
But even then, you know,

405
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,060
there's some that you just want to back away from.

406
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,660
The people who don't know...

407
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,340
They can't tell when they're being humored.

408
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,900
You know what I'm saying?

409
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,180
The ones who don't respond to you doing like this...

410
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,720
You know, making gestures of needing to escape.

411
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,280
They just talk louder, like I'm doing.

412
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,720
Well...

413
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,680
I spent years, actually,

414
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,760
like many of you, I'm sure, have,

415
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,780
reading up on the paranormal

416
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,760
and searching out weird things

417
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,340
and studying religion, historical religions, and so forth.

418
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,380
And after a while, it all starts to sound the same

419
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,380
and none of the weird stuff ever works in the lab.

420
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,380
And you get bored with the phenomena,

421
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,460
which is always just out of reach

422
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,040
and kind of a dog chasing its own tail.

423
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,980
But you meet the most interesting people.

424
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,240
The kooks themselves, the visionaries,

425
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,960
become so interesting that that...

426
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,120
And friends, becoming one yourself is even more interesting.

427
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,560
Ah, I love it.

428
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,660
And so I collect photographs of orbs and rods

429
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,760
and crop circles and so forth.

430
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,880
Last year at Starwood, we had a crop circle artist come out

431
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,020
and show us how to do it and show us how to do it.

432
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,020


433
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,540
And I wrote his photographs that the believers had all...

434
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,980
Only the believers can afford to send helicopters up,

435
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,840
take pictures of crop circles,

436
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,320
and put them on a website instantly,

437
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,220
and that's how the artists get pictures of their art.

438
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,340
And when they try to take credit for it,

439
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,440
they get arrested, like our friend Matthew Williams did,

440
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,780
the one who came here and spoke last time.

441
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,540
Or it's like those crop circle artists

442
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,740
can take a videotape of themselves,

443
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,340
shot with night vision,

444
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,000
working with night vision,

445
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,640
making the crop circle.

446
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,040
It takes two or three people,

447
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,880
maybe two or three hours to do.

448
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,300
If you've got a good designer and know what you're doing,

449
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,720
it's not that hard.

450
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,340
But the people who write the books

451
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,680
about the crop circles and the aliens,

452
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
ah, God, they're unbelievable.

453
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,020
And I've seen this in person.

454
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,360
You can show them the movie of the crop circle they're standing in

455
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,240
being made, and they will say,

456
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,360
no, you faked that to discredit the whole new age.

457
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,300
Why are you trying to wreck everything for us?

458
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,640
They can't let go of this belief

459
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,680
right in the front of their faces.

460
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,120
Now, friends, I'm not really that much of a skeptic

461
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,680
because I do believe in magic.

462
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,100
I've seen incredible, unbelievable miracles happen every day.

463
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,120
Miracles that I could scarcely believe,

464
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,020
but it was happening right in front of me.

465
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,120
And the most common one that I see,

466
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,760
the real miracle,

467
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,660
the most fantastic, amazing, magical thing,

468
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,940
is that so many people can believe such dumb shit.

469
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,360
It is absolutely...

470
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,260
Friends, thank you.

471
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,960
That is a miracle that never stops happening.

472
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,120
So if you want to believe in magic,

473
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,540
just stop talking and start listening, man.

474
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,020
But,

475
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,220
at the same time, though,

476
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,540
you can't expect love to be logical or magic

477
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,840
or any of that kind of stuff

478
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,660
to really work the way you want it to.

479
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,900
There's no logic in...

480
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,180
By definition, of course there's not.

481
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,140
As Bob said over and over again,

482
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,700
you don't use your mind to think about your religion.

483
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,420
He added, you use your mind to think about my religion.

484
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,320
But, you see, Bob had two...

485
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,080
has two hemispheres in his brain,

486
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,900
but they're not exactly like ours.

487
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,820
In his left, there's nothing right.

488
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,000
And in his right brain, there's nothing left.

489
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:40,080
And so, what Bob can't just wait for magic to happen,

490
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,300
he has to get out,

491
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,640
he has to do the first rule of Bob magic,

492
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,000
which is to get off your ass.

493
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,620
However, he only...

494
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,400
He does things, but he only does what's easier for him.

495
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,420
He surfs what we call the path of least resistance.

496
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,360
And you can't be just like Bob,

497
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,920
because he's getting your slack.

498
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,260
You'll never get as much as he...

499
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,660
Where do you think he gets his slack?

500
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,700
So don't go seeking Bob, friends.

501
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,600
He's going to suck it right off of you automatically.

502
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,920
But it's like spitting and wishing, you know,

503
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,260
the whole magical thing.

504
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,780
You can spit in one hand and wish in the other,

505
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,840
and the one will fill up with spit.

506
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,400
And...

507
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,000
And the other one will, in fact, fill up with wishes.

508
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,540
It's just how much you can sell them for.

509
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,460
Those of you who know my songwriting style

510
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,140
know that I specialize in humorous angst,

511
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,280
and I write about songs that...

512
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,240
about things that piss me off.

513
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,780
So this song...

514
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,840
is dedicated to a supermarket...

515
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,360
that I go to in my neighborhood.

516
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,800
You have one in yours, too.

517
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
Yeah, you'll recognize the...

518
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,840
spirit instantly.

519
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,880
It's called Rude.

520
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,600
Rude.

521
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:21,640
Rude.

522
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,900
Rude.

523
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,140
Rude.

524
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,160
Rude.

525
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


526
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


527
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


528
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


529
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


530
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


531
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


532
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


533
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,160


534
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,840
So many people...

535
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,360
here in this place.

536
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,980
Most of us try to get along.

537
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,320
But there are always exceptions to the case.

538
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,020
And to try and deny them, well, it would be so wrong.

539
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,500
Rude.

540
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,620
Rude.

541
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,400
Rude.

542
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,400


543
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,400


544
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,400


545
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,400


546
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,060
I see you everywhere.

547
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,300
You're all the people who just don't care.

548
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,000
At every station, every occupation, you're rude.

549
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,920
You're rude, so rude.

550
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,540
You got a really shitty attitude.

551
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,120
I wish you would go away, but I'm screwed.

552
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,540
And you're rude, so rude.

553
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,940
Now when you steal my parking space and utter insults to my face,

554
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,020
I think that's just the way it was.

555
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,920
But I can't help but feel the world would be a better place

556
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,020
if I ran you over with my car wheel.

557
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,460
Whatever happened to just plain courtesy?

558
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,560
Hearing a thank you, saying please excuse me.

559
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,900
Now it's not.

560
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,540
Nothing but noxious noise.

561
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,800
And it's nasty.

562
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,260
And you're rude, so rude.

563
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,300
You're so rude, yeah.

564
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,180
You're so rude, yeah.

565
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,460
You're so rude.

566
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,520
You got a really bad attitude.

567
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,080
You're so rude.

568
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,040
You're so rude.

569
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,900
Oh, I want to build me a big barricade.

570
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,720
Maybe load up a shotgun.

571
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,640
Maybe sharpen a blade.

572
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,140
Yeah, it's you.

573
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,100
You who put me in that mood.

574
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,100
And you're rude, so rude.

575
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,100
You're so rude, so rude.

576
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,580
You're so rude.

577
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,280
I never saw you in my life.

578
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,460
I'm not your child.

579
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,840
I'm not your wife.

580
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,660
So why do you treat me this way?

581
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,380
And I can tell you you were crass, sullen and crude and had no class.

582
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,000
But you wouldn't understand.

583
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,680
Oh, you'd ignore every word I say.

584
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, that's life.

585
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,620
Oh, jump inside and get me away from here, now.

586
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:48,620


587
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:48,620


588
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:48,940
We gotink.

589
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:48,940


590
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:48,940


591
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:48,940


592
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,720
We got a take hat.

593
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,700
We got to take it.

594
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,940
It all be done.

595
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,380
I got to like it.

596
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,920
You got to lose.

597
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,880
Your attitude

598
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,400
You're so rude

599
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Everybody

600
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,760
You're so rude

601
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,580
So rude

602
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,500
So rude

603
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,280
You're so rude

604
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,860
You're so rude

You're so rude

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,720
So very damn rude

607
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,880
And every supermarket

608
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,620
And every checkout line

609
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,900
At the airport

610
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,960
So rude

611
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,840
All those people walking so slowly

612
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,220
In front of your car

613
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,760
While you're trying to move

614
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,720
And let's talk about people with cell phones

615
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,280
So very damn rude

616
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,620
And people with children

617
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,260
And children in general

618
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,360
So rude

619
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,380
And people who don't have the correct change

620
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,960
So rude

621
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,460
And people who are in

622
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,720
The shower house

623
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,460
For an hour

624
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,100
And a half

625
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,580
So very damn rude

626
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,400
You gotta lose

627
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,620
Your attitude

628
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,140
You're so rude

629
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,220
So terribly rude

630
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,080
So terribly rude

631
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,480
So terribly rude

632
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,920
So very damn rude

633
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,380
That's a song you can relate to, right?

634
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,120
No.

635
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,560
Victoria Ganger and Revelry

636
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,340

Which is also where my sermonizing

643
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,420
Was recorded last summer

And the name of Jesus

655

We got the power

656
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,480
And we know we're right

657
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,540
It's gotta be us

We don't wanna know each other but we sure as hell do

708
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,040
One, two, three, one, two, three

709
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,360
Ask the girl what she wanted to be

710
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,340
She said, I want it

711
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,680
Bob?

712
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,720
Repeat, quit your job, SWAT off!

713
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,140
You have been driven to the brink of insanity by the conspiracy!

714
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,120
I'm gonna tattery, tattery, tattery

715
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,820
Bob, if you owe me a hand

716
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,360
You're a lot closer than you even think

717
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,320
Bob is the way, Bob is the path

718
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,260
Believe or die!

719
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,420
Bob is not the answer

720
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,600
And neither is anything else

721
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,560
Bob, screw Bob!

722
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,080
What does he know?

723
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,200
Don't believe anything Bob knows you

724
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,720
Blasphemy! He represents for the anti-Bob!

725
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,500
That's right, Bob is a loser

726
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,060
Bob ripped me off for all my SWAT

727
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,820
Because Bob is a free-for-all!

728
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,540
Bob is a peach boy!

729
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,720
Bob just takes it all for himself

730
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,160
He gets all the women

731
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
He gets all the rock

732
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,820
He gets all the SWAT

733
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,680
Bob!

734
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,140
Kill Bob!

735
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,320
Kill Bob!

736
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,680
Kill Bob!

737
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,840
Kill Bob!

738
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,440
Kill Bob!

739
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,900
Bob is a conspiracy patsy

740
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,240
Bob faked his own crucifixion

741
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,040
So he can be resurrected to become your personal savior!

742
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,740
Bob is in the back of his limo right now

743
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,060
Getting ahead from your girlfriend!

744
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,400
Grab your favorite dog pup and whack him head-off!

745
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,320
Whack him!

746
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,860
And place it in the trophy cage right next to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer!

747
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,860
That's right, Bob is a sinner just like you!

748
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,320
The second coming to Bob will be a slaughter!

749
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,640
With the false promise they are robbed of leading the flock!

750
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,780
Bob!

751
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Kill Bob!

752
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,420
Kill Bob!

753
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,820
Kill Bob!

754
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,840
Kill Bob!

755
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,960
Kill Bob!

756
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,960
Kill Bob!

757
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,240
Kill Bob!

758
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,520
Kill Bob!

759
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,860
Kill Bob!

760
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,620
Kill Bob!

761
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,360
Bob!

762
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,700
Forgive me Bob!

763
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,320
Oh Bob, I have served against you!

764
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,280
I was possessed by The Anti-Bob

765
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,220
Please forgive me!

766
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,080
Praise Bob!

767
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,000
Praise Bob!

768
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,420
Praise Bob!

769
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,420
If they would love him, much to do money, we would never have any problems.

770
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,000
He is the king of all kings.

771
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,940
The king of slack kills Bob there.

772
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,520
King of slack, Bill T. Miller.

773
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:58,140
You can get entire albums by Bill T. Miller, king of slack, by downloading them from BillTMiller.com or KingOfSlack.com.

774
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,760
And I think now we will let Mr. Fernando Nandili-Mur have a say.

775
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,140
Oh, dear, anything interesting happen around here today?

776
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,320
It's sad when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son.

777
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:15,880
Sure, Mom.

778
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,500
But I couldn't.

779
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,900
I couldn't allow them to believe that I would commit murder.

780
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,300
Well, gee, no, Mom.

781
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,360
They'll put him away now, as I should have years ago.

782
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,140
Boy, that sure is a shame, all right.

783
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,720
He was always bad.

784
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,940
Yeah, I suppose so.

785
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,160
And in the end, he intended to tell them I killed those girls and that man.

786
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,680
As if I could do anything except just sit and stare like one of his stuffed birds.

787
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,780
Oh, yeah, kind of.

788
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,380
Well, they know I can't even move a finger.

789
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,580
And I won't.

790
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,480
I'll just sit here and be quiet.

791
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah.

792
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,340
Just in case they do suspect me.

793
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,120
They're probably watching me.

794
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,640
You're too young to be seeing so much of one girl.

795
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,340
Well, let them.

796
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,140
Yeah, you're right, Dad, but...

797
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,020
Let them see what kind of a person I am.

798
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,120
Well...

799
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,240
I'm not even going to swat that fly.

800
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,400
I hope they are watching.

801
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,600
They'll see.

802
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,220
Okay, Mom.

803
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,780
They'll see and they'll know.

804
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,620
And they'll say, why, she wouldn't even harm a fly.

805
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,440
We wonder who she was.

806
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,500
It was just my mom.

807
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,760
For the children, turn this world around.

808
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,360
Remember, you must cook or smoke while under the influence of alcohol on every level of your home.

809
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,800
So please, test all members of your household to make sure they're in good working order

810
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,480
and change the batteries if necessary.

811
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,460
Then review your escape plan during this festive season.

812
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,840
Remember, always put your fit, poisonous hands over your eyes.

813
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,580
Then crawl low to a neighboring home.

814
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,840
Remember, most people die from breathing in nothing.

815
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,600
Why me?

816
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,240
Senators know firsthand the threat of biological agents.

817
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,040
Something we can never have too much of in this post-9-11 world.

818
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,460
Wow, protecting me, right?

819
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,880
Hmm, well...

820
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,060
Well...

821
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,620
Did you know?

822
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,200
Think about it.

823
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,820
They don't know.

824
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,580
What if they do know?

825
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,240
We're working to promote voluntary AIDS around the world.

826
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,040
It happened to me.

827
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,200
The air detector in your home.

828
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,900
The smoke bag in your car.

829
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,280
You hope they're there.

830
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,820
Just as we protect an accident or a fire,

831
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,900
the Connecticut Department of Public Health,

832
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,680
along with Connecticut's tribal nations,

833
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,760
are natural public health.

834
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,180
We're a national health emergency.

835
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,980
If you're a rancher or farmer on your tractor,

836
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
you're out of control.

837
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,220
I'm proud that our government shocked babies somewhere in the world.

838
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,980
If you are too, too, too, too, too, too, too, too,

839
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,400
a new baby shocked every minute for just pennies a day.

840
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,740
Yeah, um, my brother and my twin sister are getting married in the next few months.

841
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,380
I'm wondering if you have any advice or wisdom from Bob that I might give to them.

842
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,760
Your brother and twin sister?

843
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:15,760


844
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,800
My brother and twin sister are getting married in a few months.

845
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,020
Move to Alabama.

846
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,120
It's legal for them to do that there.

847
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,820
I think.

848
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:34,940
Well, you better become a subgenius minister,

849
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,500
and then I charge 200 bucks to do a wedding.

850
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,880
You could get a, you could, yeah, it's family.

851
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,580
You could charge them half price and still make 200.

852
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,520
200.

853
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,220
The divorce is just as expensive as any other divorce,

854
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,880
even though our marriages are cheap and perfectly legal.

855
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,880
Again, the lawyers, man, they're the ones who got it figured out.

856
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,180
We have a lot of subgenius lawyers.

857
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:08,880
Lawyers love the Church of the Subgenius because the written material is thick with a jargon.

858
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,140
It's like we created our own priesthood and speak our own jargon.

859
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,760
And lawyers and doctors appreciate that.

860
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,580
They don't have, they don't know that much more than you do.

861
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,660
They do have the jargon down.

862
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
And that's all it takes.

863
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,800
And that's why they think we're all so stupid.

864
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,780
They do look down on us.

865
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,960
And I don't blame them.

866
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,840
Oh.

867
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,180
I was sitting here by the garbage can.

868
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,460
I've been, I've had a revelation.

869
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,940
I've been fist slapped by the hand of Bob.

870
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,480
And I'm wondering, hearing all the bullshit, you're saying,

871
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,740
how am I going to go out there to all my friends who believe in me?

872
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:45,740


873
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,280
And even a bunch of stupid kooky crap.

874
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,980
And interact with them without them thinking I'm a foolish asshole.

875
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,260
Well, what does it matter?

876
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,180
The point, if you're a subgenius, they're already going to think you're a foolish asshole.

877
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,620
You've got, it's like you lost your credibility when you walked into this room, dude.

878
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:12,360
So, quit worrying about, that's the, the only problem you have is you worrying about what they think.

879
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,240
You are a foolish asshole.

880
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,280
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

881
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,920
You know, eat the, don't just be a foolish asshole.

882
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,360
Be the hell out of it.

883
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,280
Look at me.

884
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,540
It works great.

885
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,300
I get paid to do this.

886
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,560
Be a foolish asshole for pay.

887
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,580
Yeah, I could give a whole lecture.

888
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,020
I should give a workshop on how to run your own cult.

889
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,680
But that would just be more competition.

890
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,220
We did the, this is the stupidest cult in the world.

891
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,780
It really is.

892
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:53,040
We consciously created an anti-business business.

893
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:06,780
And an anti-belief religion that also happened to be an anti-science science project and an anti-art art project.

894
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,200
Designed for non-joiners.

895
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,460
Designed for non-joiners, that's right.

896
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,780
A membership thing designed for non-joiners.

897
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,780
Now, do you see why we called it sub-genius?

898
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,420
So, you'll have to get your enlightenment somewhere else.

899
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,860
We do have excellent in darkenment.

900
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,640
In stereo and full color sound.

901
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,660
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

902
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,260
Like we said, you'll still be just as blind as a bat.

903
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,780
But it'll be your wool.

904
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,880
And there's nude pictures of Bob Dobbs printed on the inside of the wool.

905
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,980
So you're always getting a little shot of porno all the time.

906
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,580
What I told, when I started this, I said, what do we have to offer?

907
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,480
Lofty words, feelings, pablum, and lies.

908
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:00,240
And yet, isn't it sick, that that makes this the one true religion?

909
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,260
The only one.

910
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,360
Because it will admit that it's completely and utterly bogus.

911
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,800
From the ground floor up, it's the only one you can trust.

912
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,400
That's fucked.

913
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:14,760
Praise Bob.

914
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:14,760


915
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,080
Praise Bob.

916
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,100
Listen.

917
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,780
Never is it to be thought that man is either oldest or last of the masters of earth.

918
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,240
Nor that the greater part of substances walks alone.

919
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,460
The old ones were.

920
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,280
The old ones are.

921
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,100
And the old ones shall be.

922
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:48,560
They walk calm and tribal, of no dimension, and to us unseen.

923
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,840
They walk foul in lonely places, where the words have been spoken, and the rites howl through with their seasons,

924
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,840
which are in the blood and differ from the seasons of man.

925
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,900
The winds shiver with their voices.

926
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,360
The earth mutters with their consciousness.

927
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,980
They bend the forest.

928
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,820
They raise up the waves.

929
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,760
They crush the cities.

930
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,200
If not forest or ocean or cities, beholds the hand that smites.

931
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,720
As abounders shall they be known to the race of man.

932
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,460
Their hands are at the throats of men forever.

933
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,820
From the beginning of known time to the end of time known.

934
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,380
Man rules where once they ruled.

935
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,840
Soon they shall rule again where man rules now.

936
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,220
They shall return.

937
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,040
An army's returning.

938
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,780
Shall great Kapuru be freed from Raya beneath the sea.

939
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:51,560
And him who is not to be named shall come from his city, which is Tarkosa near the lake of Ali.

940
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:57,360
And Shabnukurush shall come forth and multiply in her hideousness.

941
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,420
And Nyarlathotep shall carry the word to the great old ones of their minions.

942
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,980
And Yod-Sothoth, who is all in one, and one in all,

943
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:16,100
shall lay his hand upon them who oppose them and destroy them from the black-litten caverns within the earth.

944
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:20,580
Where all this chaos and destruction shall come.

945
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,400
The noxious Azathoth.

946
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:30,200
And together they will take possession of all things that live upon earth.

947
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,580
That man is mad.

948
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,380
The cometh as one who shall be won.

949
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,700
But where there shall be title and name.

950
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,420
Behold...

951
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,560
What's great and new to Valhalla.

952
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,680
There shall be

953
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,640
the citizen of the blue seasangan allen.

954
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,000
tob

955
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,860
to outwit death?

956
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,240
Or has he created another?

957
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,900
Where can people get information on this, Reverend Stang?

958
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,660
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

959
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,220
Of course, the subgenius website.

960
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,200
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

961
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,440
It's a little bit of something just called Tom.

962
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,940
There are people broadswinging their arms,

963
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,800
screaming, where is Stang when we need him now?

964
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,900
You're throwing away amputated arms and legs

965
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,240
trying to figure out what to do next,

966
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,860
involving local community people,

967
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,280
and yet, while we're under a state of orange alert.

968
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,880
It was pretty weird.

969
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,600
Are we in orange alert for that thing?

970
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,620
No, I heard they moved it up to Valencia orange alert.

971
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,660
Valencia orange alert, which is a lighter shade of orange.

972
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,520
I need it down. It's closer to yellow.

973
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:01,920
Or did they move it to...

974
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,960
There are plenty of navels at X-Day.

975
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,700
I think they moved it to burnt...

976
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,400
It's a burnt sienna alert.

977
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,880
The blue and the green, I think, was the next step up from the navel orange.

978
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,340
I don't know. Some people tend to focus on the wrong areas.

979
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,820
I thought they were the fuchsia.

980
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:19,360
I really don't understand your whole terror coding system down there.

981
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,340
That's always kind of blown my mind.

982
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,800
Blue means all is well.

983
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,180
Oh, we're going to have levels of alerts.

984
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,860
Blue means everything's wonderful.

985
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,000
We have to have those for forest fires at National Park.

986
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,020
You know, like the don't throw your ashtray out the window if it's at, like, orange or higher.

987
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,460
But we don't have that for terror.

988
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,720
We have the amber alerts.

989
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,080
It's so preposterous.

990
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,400
It is.

991
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:45,780
Well, maybe eventually they'll have little badges for each person that will show each person's hate alert.

992
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,080
They have those.

993
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,900
They have the one you're going to the airport.

994
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,880
Sister Mary Magdalene, she has an orange.

995
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,460
She gets tagged when she flies.

996
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,100
Oh, right, yeah.

997
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,980
Well, yeah, they are after proof.

998
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:02,180
Yeah, it's like a little lie detector thing.

999
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,100
And if you're nervous...

1000
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,380
If you're wearing an apple on your head, though,

1001
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:04,880
they'll get you, too.

1002
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,400
If you're neurotic, you get a certain color that shows up on your name tag.

1003
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,360
If you carry a golden apple that says Caliste on it.

1004
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,520
They give you a whole different color one.

1005
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:14,980
Right.

1006
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:15,620
Collect them all.

1007
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:19,400
If you carry a golden apple that says Caliste on it, you are most certainly unmasked.

1008
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,580
Right, I mean, some of us would have a regular rainbow on our little alert pad.

1009
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,720
Rainbow alert.

1010
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,060
Well, your medication actually is color barred.

1011
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,240
Actually, no, we're going into a rainbow alert right now

1012
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,000
because they're going to vote on the gay marriage amendment this week.

1013
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,440
So that's the rainbow.

1014
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:34,880
Rainbow alert.

1015
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,180
You guys aren't 21st century enough to pass that one.

1016
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:39,660
I dare you to pass that amendment.

1017
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,240
Uh, people are predicting that it won't pass.

1018
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:49,440
Capitol Hill insiders and, uh, experts are predicting that, uh, it will not pass.

1019
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,620
They're not even sure it will get a simple majority when, in fact, it would require a

1020
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,320
two-thirds vote to really pass.

1021
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,440
If it does pass, indeed, they may, uh, suspenderate the elections this year because of the crisis

1022
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,640
that it causes.

1023
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,200
Well, actually, the Constitution doesn't say anything about elections.

1024
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:03,860
It's, uh...

1025
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:20,820
They're not the only people out thereудy.

1026
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:21,400
Yeah.

1027
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,480
There's, uh, the loo-lo-loooots and all these other b-looo

1028
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,180
crap out there that, uh, are really locked in.

1029
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:31,360
The only people out there are the formerRAC politicians that so bother about the moment's

1030
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:31,360


1031
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,180
Yeah.

1032
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,220
The formerRAC politicians,ifferently.

1033
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,480
make sure that every cow is counted.

1034
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,840
We've got an Ohio company counting votes now.

1035
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,900
Diebold election systems of

1036
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,260
Canton, Ohio. They make the computer thing.

1037
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,020
And they're guaranteed to win the election for whoever gives them

1038
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:45,900
the most amount of money. And if you've got a

1039
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,840
cash forward, listen, buddy, we're going to put those

1040
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,660
things up front. Yeah, the CEO

1041
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,860
of the... I'm working on them all the time, if you know

1042
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:53,880
what I mean. Wink, wink, wink. The CEO of

1043
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,360
the company that makes voting machines

1044
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,740
is an ardent

1045
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,660
Bush supporter, campaigner,

1046
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,960
fundraiser, says he's committed to delivering Ohio's

1047
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,820
electoral votes to Bush this year.

1048
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,120
And he's the CEO of the company

1049
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,700
that makes the election machines.

1050
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,980
It is a question. Is it half

1051
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,700
a statement with the end half a missing?

1052
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,320
Is it the groin and socket of the underdog?

1053
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,200
Is it the vast whiteness

1054
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,040
under your linen pillow sky and

1055
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,900
the tea bag under the apple house in your

1056
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,880
mother's mansion in which you can find the end of the

1057
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,840
world lying in wait for unwary travelers

1058
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,960
from the dyke's mis-existence, flying

1059
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,980
over the remnants of a dream once lost

1060
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,580
and never found again by the masses?

1061
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:45,880
Or is it just me dancing in my

1062
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,120
underwear?

1063
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,860
If you desire forums,

1064
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,960
then you'll have to get two extra attached

1065
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,740
because most mere humans in

1066
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,540
subgenii only have two.

1067
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,720
Or else you'll have to cut yours off and get

1068
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,540
robot wheels, which are almost as nice.

1069
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,720
But don't worry about it. The operation

1070
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,620
is painless, even if you're penniless.

1071
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,860
The whales keep form-hungry even though the

1072
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,980
noses of the celebrities fall off into my

1073
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,920
coat and are half-drowned by the waves

1074
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,320
of my discontented checkbooks.

1075
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,960
So don't spare the criticisms

1076
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,760
and exorcisms when the four

1077
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,760
horsemen come riding out of the deep with

1078
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,820
ultrasound blasters blazing their way

1079
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,000
into the hearts of all admiring ceiling fans.

1080
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,880
And don't worry about the

1081
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,660
ceiling wax either. It's guaranteed

1082
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,980
for a thousand years.

1083
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,700
Or until X-Day. Whichever

1084
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,440
comes first.

1085
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,700
A reverend self-slayer

1086
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,440
did that. A piece called

1087
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,840
Questionus Informatus.

1088
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,020
And before that,

1089
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,380
Radio Synesthesia

1090
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,880
with Dr. Sinister.

1091
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,580
And a call-in by St. Bucky,

1092
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,580
I think. And Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1093
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,080
And now,

1094
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,560
now a subgenius.

1095
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,480
Okay, this guy is

1096
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,680
Georgetown Party, right? And all the

1097
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,860
Illuminati and Illuminoids are all there and all these people

1098
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,820
who work for the State Department. The guy's kind of a little bit

1099
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,800
of a liberal and so forth and everything. And he's just

1100
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,340
making some jokes to people. And he walks up to

1101
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,820
a lovely young couple sitting by the punchbowl

1102
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,860
there and he says, hey man, have you heard

1103
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,680
the latest funny thing that came out of the White House?

1104
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,460
Man, check this out. The guy says,

1105
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,860
very high-rated, he says, I'll have you know I work

1106
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,660
for the White House Press Corps. I am

1107
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,620
a man's plane of the

1108
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,640
White House. And the guy says,

1109
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:29,840
alright, I'll say

1110
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,020
it very

1111
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,300
slowly.

1112
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,320
Did you hear the one about

1113
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,560
the horse's ass and the cowboy hat?

1114
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,160
Yeah, I did.

1115
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,940
Okay. Yeah.

1116
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,620
Man, tell me a new joke, man. Tell me a joke I haven't heard.

1117
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,180
Senator

1118
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,200
Leahy was on the floor and he bent over because

1119
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,280
he thought he'd seen a, you know, he dropped

1120
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,140
a piece of tissue out of his pocket

1121
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,060
and he just lonely, ripe snot

1122
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,160
and he didn't want to dirty it

1123
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,220
before. And so he reached over to pick

1124
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,260
it up and Dick Cheney

1125
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,720
appeared on the scene and said, hey, listen,

1126
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,460
I got a good one for you.

1127
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,640
Chicken walks into a bar

1128
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,540
and it's got a little growth coming

1129
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,500
out of the side of its head that looks like I'm staying

1130
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,740
wherever I'm staying.

1131
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,980
Chicken walks into a bar and

1132
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,480
the, oh, she's not in.

1133
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,360
I would have to tell you where the bartender says.

1134
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,200
You're in safe harbor.

1135
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,560
The bartender says, hey, listen, buddy, we don't

1136
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,560
serve free tea here. And the little growth

1137
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,340
on the chicken's neck says, hey, don't blame me.

1138
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,580
I've been trying to get rid of this guy for the last half hour.

1139
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
That's very logical.

1140
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,080
That's very logical that.

1141
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,080
It could have been in the communication device,

1142
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,040
he was just portraying it to me.

1143
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,220
It could have been an appliance.

1144
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,340
équal

1145
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,120
to another

1146
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,720
way,

1147
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,880
I don't know.

1148
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,080
Yes,

1149
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:58,760
still

1150
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,640
this is

1151
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,400
minor

1152
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,960
to

1153
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,960
the

1154
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,340
east

1155
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,980
Leave me, I ain't got stuff.

1156
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,800
This is Miner Mountain.

1157
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,420
The sun's tarnished.

1158
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,080
Ah, so went my whiskey time.

1159
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,540
Survive, he said. It was the name of the game.

1160
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,880
What I give a shit about these people.

1161
