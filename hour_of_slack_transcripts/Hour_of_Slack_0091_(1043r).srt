1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,980
Oh

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,220
You're no good I know you're no good but have me help me I love

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,420
The subgenius power of

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,880
Yowling and screaming like a cat the cat you hear me

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,300
This horrible thing it goes beyond the normal into the supernatural

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,460
Everyone should know about it the world should know about it sir. You mean science who cares about science?

7
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,720
You're going to let everybody know what happened

8
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,900
It's my shame

9
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,320
And you're not going to tell a living soul about it. No one you hear me. No, that's my duty John

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,560
I must inform the authorities keep away I say

11
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,000
No, he was going to tell us about

12
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,140
everyone

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,580
They have taken you away

14
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,480
Locked you up

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,740
Pointed at you laughed at you

16
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,620
That's a shame

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,640
Hello

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,300
I make it a fire first you come for the paper

19
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,880
Oh, she fell asleep I've gotta go

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:57,460
I asked you why you fell asleep when you were babysitting just tell them you were stoned they'll understand sponsored by

21
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,560
the subgenius power of slack

22
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,900
The subgenius power of slack

23
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:16,200
Yes dear friends it's hour of slack number one thousand forty three

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,440
Only again I'm lying because I'm not lying

25
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,820
We're gonna play a rerun a

27
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,840
Really old rerun from 1987 probably around August 1987

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,540
our of slack number 91

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,740
with special guest hope Robert Anton Wilson

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,240
author of the Illuminatus trilogy with the late Robert Shay and

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,240
Cosmic trigger and so many other books Robert Anton Wilson

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,160
was a huge influence on the development of the church of the subgenius

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,260
unquestionably and

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,440
I'm

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:07,280
Really glad we actually were able to get him into the station in Dallas a couple of times. This was the first time I

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,360
was a baby friends you'll be able to tell by the

37
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,280
both the quality of the tape and the quality of my questions and comments

38
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,180
This was the the little baby Reverend staying I was

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,420
It's only 33 or something.

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,580
This was almost 20 years ago.

41
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:40,900
So I hope you'll be able to cut us some slack, as they say, regarding the emotional quality, shall we say, of yours truly.

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,660
But the background music is great.

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,780
And, oh, by the way, the background music right now is great.

44
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,300
Right, and it's by the Flying Ryan Brothers, or the Fly-In Ryan Brothers, I should say.

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,240
Their album, Blue Marble, a big guitar masterpiece.

46
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,980
They almost got an Emmy a couple of years ago.

47
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:14,420
You can get more about them from Ryanetics.com, R-Y-A-N-E-T-I-C-S.

48
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,760
Sort of like Dianetics.

49
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
Anyway, let us...

50
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:26,020
Let us plunge right into this ancient, ancient show and praise all the Bobs.

51
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,340
Oh, dear friends.

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,560
Yes, I'm going to crank this show back into unholy life here.

53
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,820
Got my little intro tape queued up at a random point.

54
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,360
I don't even know where it's going to start.

55
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,540
So let's see if it's meaningful.

56
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,180
Oh, yes, dear friends.

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, next time I'll cue these things up a little bit.

58
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,120
That wasn't the intro tape.

59
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,760
Will, what are you doing?

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,160
What have you done?

61
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm going to cue.

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,580
That's right.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,040
Okay.

64
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,900
Okay.

65
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,460
Friends, dear friends, the coincidences are all important.

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,520
All important.

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,820
I want you to know.

68
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,680
Ah, yes.

69
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,000
Now it feels right.

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,880
This is the Hour of Slack from the subgenius radio ministry, dear friends, and this is

71
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,740
your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

72
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,620
Back from my vacation in Antarctica with my kids and someone else.

73
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,760
The dangerous someone else, you girls out there.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,960
And I got slack.

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
Praise Baba, my vacation.

76
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,560
I did get slack.

77
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,700
Long overdue indeed it was.

78
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,360
And for that I owe quite a bit to the beautiful angel whose timely arrival and help and support

79
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,020
provided relief.

80
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,420
And I spell relief F-R-O-P.

81
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,580
The Will of Dobbs did the show last week entirely on his own, friends.

82
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,780
I want you to know I didn't cue up any of that stuff.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,020
It was his first time on the radio and I thought he did a fantastic job.

84
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,020
And it was a good change of face and voice here.

85
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,220
So, so, we'll make him do it again and again.

86
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,340
I'll party.

87
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,080
Buck's devival was last night.

88
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,620
The anti-Stang devival.

89
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,220
And I understand it was a hot, hot devival.

90
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,520
Like 120 degrees hot in the bar of soap.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,480
But Pope S. Cecilia,

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,140
and Reverend Chastity Belt,

93
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,600
both each independently told me that their personal sections were fantastic and the best part of the show.

94
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,000
A typical subgenius approach.

95
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,880
I missed it because, friends, because I had to finish stuff that you members paid for years ago.

96
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,200
Now tonight, there's not going to be a whole lot of tape.

97
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,400
Like we usually have.

98
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,000
Partly because we're being videotaped tonight.

99
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,000
So turn on your TVs on channel 101.

100
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,680
And see, since we're being videotaped, the great video operators, Reverend Garcia and Dealey Lama,

101
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,680
wouldn't have anything to shoot except for those tiny reels turning and the VU meters bouncing around unevenly.

102
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,840
So, but mainly, the main reason there's not going to be any tape tonight,

103
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,660
my children, is because we have an esteemed and honored guest tonight.

104
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,100
One who's only in the U.S.

105
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,420
Oh, once a year or less.

106
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,880
And this man is famous as hell to those who matter.

107
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,340
And also to most bobbies as well.

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,200
And the rest of you had best take heed.

109
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:09,520
So we shall take advantage of this man's time here by giving you Robert Anton Wilson.

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,200
One bob leads to another, dear friends.

111
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,960
And Dr. Wilson, welcome.

112
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:16,800
Welcome, welcome.

113
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
It's a thrill to be here.

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,420
It was a thrill to meet Bob this afternoon.

115
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,520
To shake his hand and find out all those rumors about his death were terribly exaggerated.

116
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,780
What?

117
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,940
You met Bob?

118
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,400
That was something I was going to get into later.

119
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,180
Now, I read this article you wrote about Philip K. Dick.

120
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,400
And in which you kept saying that J.R. Bob Dobbs and the great Irish scientist, De Selby,

121
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,540
kept interrupting you and giving you absurd suggestions on, you know,

122
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,740
on how to finish the thing.

123
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:56,500
And I was going to announce to our listeners that that was the first time anybody has actually

124
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,600
seen J.R. Bob Dobbs in like three years now.

125
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,820
At least in a physical manifestation.

126
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,760
And here you ran into him again last night.

127
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,160
I ran into him this afternoon on the street.

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,300
And I must say the pictures just don't do him justice.

129
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,140
Those cold blue eyes remind me of Paul Newman.

130
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,040
And those ears remind me of Alfred E. Newman.

131
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:23,020
The Alfred E. Newman of Mad Magazine is actually Bob's third cousin.

132
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,540
He's sort of like country cousin.

133
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,680
I thought so.

134
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:34,540
Bob was, that family was not exposed to the same nuclear test that Bob's family was back in the 1920s.

135
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,040
You didn't know they were doing tests back then.

136
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,860
Well, James Joyce did.

137
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,880
I heard about that.

138
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,820
Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

139
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,140
Well, Dr. Will, should I call you doctor or saint or pope?

140
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,760
Or what is your actual chosen?

141
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
I prefer just to be called Pope Robert the 23rd.

142
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,100
That's pretty classy.

143
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,720
You can say your holiness for short if you want.

144
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,680
Uh, yes, your wholeness.

145
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,240
My friends call me just Bob, but that may lead to confusion with J.R. Bob Dobbs, our risen savior.

146
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,360
So I was supposed to just call me your holiness.

147
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,160
Yeah, that's better than saying false Bob.

148
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,660
I could just, but who knows?

149
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,680
Who knows?

150
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,160
How many Bobs are false?

151
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,700
True at the same time.

152
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,220
Well, friends, I have to admit something tonight.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:43,300
And that is that, uh, if, uh, uh, the, the, the, his holiness, uh, Pope Dr. Saint Wilson and, and Robert Shea had, if you guys had not busted your butts on the Illuminatus trilogy of books, I would, this, and I mean this, I might now, right now, be a drunken film gaffer.

154
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,040
Uh, and there certainly would prob, would be no Church of the Subgenius.

155
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,060
As we now know it.

156
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:56,700
Because I ripped off so many, uh, concepts, uh, and things from, from you, uh, to fill out what Bob had given us.

157
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,000
Lots of people tell me Illuminatus has changed their lives, usually with the help of Thunderbird.

158
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,700
Oh, the, praise the bird!

159
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,440
There, uh, there is a Subgenius clench in Boston which worships Thunderbird wine exclusively.

160
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
America's fine aperitif wine, made and bottled in Modesto, California.

161
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,600
It works best with methadrine, of course.

162
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,320
You know, it's funny you should mention that.

163
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:27,200
There was a time back when, way back when, you could throw those little things in that bottle and shake it up and,

164
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,180
well, friends, that's a bad, terrible kind of thing to, uh, to even conceive of.

165
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,160
But, the true religion is often out on the streets like that.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:48,020
Dr. Wilson here, for those of you who don't know, his, his holiness, is, uh, he's a, a bad boy philosopher, a, uh, bone vivant, uh, mystic prophet.

167
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,100
He's a prankster and a contactee with forces beyond the ken of man.

168
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,820
But what do you know about that?

169
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,780
Well, you're gonna find out.

170
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,840
Um, but, but, before we get totally loose here, I wanted to ask you one thing.

171
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,740
Now, on the Dobbs Enlightenment test, which, uh, you theoretically shouldn't remember taking, right?

172
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,480
As a matter of fact, my memory of that is a little bit fuzzy.

173
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,940
God, if you have any memory of that at all, you're, you're...

174
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:25,220
Well, this would figure, because your score, uh, was, uh, 9.9 wrenchins out of 12 on, on that scale.

175
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,960
And yet, and yet, uh, you wear no turban.

176
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,960
You're not celibate, I assume. You have a wife and kids.

177
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,960
You don't make cryptic, uh, uh, self, uh, satisfying statements.

178
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,880
You're not, uh, old, uh, an old, uh, uh, native of India.

179
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,840
And none of the trappings of, uh, of your straight enlightened guru.

180
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,920
Uh...

181
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,120
Uh, you, you strike me as sort of a regular guy.

182
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,000
Uh, except with a Brooklyn accent, which was totally unexpected.

183
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,720
So, what's your secret?

184
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,280
I mean, how, how are...

185
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,380
I mean, obviously it's enlightenment, but there, there's a, it's a slackful enlightenment.

186
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,980
It's the pure grace of Bob in my heart.

187
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,860
Praise Bob.

188
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,360
Friends, uh, listen to that testimonial!

189
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,560
I mean, uh, uh, uh, but yet, I understand.

190
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,340
From what I've picked up from your, your writings, you've been through the crucible.

191
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Uh, you've felt the, the, you've been in the house of pain.

192
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,260
The, and what I wanted to ask you is, you know, must there be the torment?

193
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
Is it necessary?

194
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,720
Hell no.

195
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,420
Praise Bob!

196
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,440
Praise Bob.

197
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,260
Something for nothing, friends!

198
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,500
That's what, that is ultimately, I guess, what slack is all about.

199
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,540
And you see, I can ask a, a ten-sentence question, and he can answer it much more cleverly.

200
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,580
In three words.

201
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,040
Um...

202
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,820
Well, that was what Bob, uh, summed up everything in three words when I spoke to him today.

203
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,320
We had a long two-hour conversation, and at the end of it all, he put this whole philosophy in a nutshell.

204
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,320
As he shook my hands and looked me straight in the eye, he said just three words.

205
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,600
It meant everything.

206
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,260
He said, send more money.

207
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,660
Friends...

208
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,780
And that reminds me, we haven't got all that pledge money from y'all yet.

209
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,000
And, I mean, what kind of a, what kind of a sub-genius are you?

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,980
That's ridiculous.

211
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:29,680
Now, um, uh, uh, Pope, Saint, Hierarch, uh, Wilson, um, how, just how many secret societies have you actually founded or had a lot to do with putting together?

212
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,240
A six-

213
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,860
That you can talk about.

214
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,140
A six hundred and sixty-six.

215
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,660
Where have I heard that before?

216
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,860
Oh, come on.

217
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,240
I bet it wasn't really six hundred and sixty-three.

218
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,160
It was probably six hundred and sixty-three, and you rounded it off, right?

219
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, do you want me to list them all?

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,980
Well, uh, well, like the Discordians.

221
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,000
Now, the Discordians, dear friends, for those of you, those few of you who don't know, is like a precursor to the Church of the Subgenius.

222
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,040
It, it was, uh, started, what, in the late fifties?

223
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,700
1957, in a bowling alley in Yorba Linda, California, near the site of the beautiful, future Richard Nixon Memorial Statue.

224
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,540
We're raising money for that statue, and if anybody here is interested, and anybody listening who wants to commemorate Richard Nixon,

225
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,900
the most egregious president this country ever had, and if you don't know what egregious means, go look at your dictionary.

226
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,280
It's worth looking up, and he certainly was egregious.

227
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,340
We're gonna put up a statue of Nixon made out of solid gold, ten feet taller than the Statue of Liberty,

228
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,040
facing Asia, and warning those commies not to try to get a jump on Uncle Sammy.

229
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,420
And there's gonna be a bunch of lettuce in one hand, and a bunch of tapes from a wiretap machine in the other hand,

230
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,520
and an allegorical figure of Caesar Chavez below his left hand.

231
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,520


232
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,940
Alright! Hey, I'll give!

233
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,880
Yeah, it may not be money, but, uh, I'll go out there and help lay some of that gold plating on there.

234
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,600
Well, it's called to commemorate the golden apple of Ares.

235
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,120
Yep.

236
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,620
And the Acapulco gold that inspired the Discordian society in the first place.

237
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,340
The gold, friends. Is that all you're after, is gold?

238
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,440
No, you're after status, too, I know.

239
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,920
I know it. That's okay, so am I, obviously.

240
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,040
Um, well, yeah, the Discordians, they were, uh, and still are.

241
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,260
That's one thing that has given me a great deal of hope, is that the Discordian faith, as obnoxious as it is,

242
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,380
has never gone away, it only grows and grows.

243
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,420
I know half the subgeniuses out there are Discordians, and yet there was never a central P.O. box like we have,

244
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,760
or that, like Jimmy Swaggart or Jerry Falwell has, there's never been any...

245
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,860
Well, that's because we, that's one of our basic slogans, mantras, is we Discordians must stick apart.

246
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,080
Is that why you guys have slack and I don't usually?

247
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:00,120
There are now, we're growing faster all the time, there are now nine million Discordian popes on this planet,

248
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,100
and we're not going to rest until we've made a pope out of every man, woman, child, and good-looking dog on this planet.

249
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,900
We're not gonna, we're not gonna pontificate the ugly dogs.

250
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,740
But all the good-looking dogs can be.

251
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,520
Irish setters, golden retrievers, dachshunds, they can all be popes.

252
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,220
None of these ugly hound dogs you see skulking around alleys, though.

253
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,640
Well, you've got, we've got at least 14 to 10,000 listeners right now,

254
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,420
so why don't you hair-lip every man, woman, and child on Paraphrase right now?

255
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,320
Oh, I certainly, I certainly will.

256
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,380
You see, recently the Vatican announced that cardinals can give indulgences over television,

257
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,740
which is a great breakthrough in Catholic theology.

258
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,200
I respect their theology tremendously because it's so much like ours in the Discordian society.

259
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,260
And I figured if they can do indulgences over television, I can do pontifications over the radio.

260
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,560
We used to just make popes by handing out pope cards,

261
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,940
but now everybody listening to the sound of my voice automatically becomes a Discordian pope

262
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,880
and is totally infallible, and henceforth take crap from nobody.

263
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Whether you want to be or not, friends, oh, and for you subgenius popes,

264
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,300
out there, this gives you a double-barreled ability.

265
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,100
You are both infallible and totally fallible, which is the gift of subgenius poping.

266
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,700
Well, we've sent one to the guy in Rome who thinks he's the only pope.

267
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,500
So he's a Catholic pope and a Discordian pope both.

268
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,540
You ought to make him a subgenius pope, too, so he'll be a triple threat.

269
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,780
Who knows where Bob is right this minute, friends?

270
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:39,100
Is he striding through the halls of the Vatican ready to smite or ordain the pope?

271
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,960
I don't know.

272
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,880
He was talking to Father Guido Saducci when I left him.

273
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,680
Oh, so you...

274
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,240
Well, you know, I actually stole my Discordian popeship.

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,960
I found a cheesy Xerox of the Principia Discordia.

276
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Did I pronounce that right?

277
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,700
Principia Discordia.

278
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,560
Principia Discordia.

279
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,500
That's our holy book.

280
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,300
Right.

281
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,700
Which can now be bought from Loon Panic's company,

282
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,060
but at that time it was like bootleg Xeroxes.

283
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,740
And somebody...

284
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,940
I just started printing subgenius popes,

285
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,720
and I was reading the pamphlets for Bob,

286
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,980
and somebody came up to me and said,

287
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,540
you better look at this.

288
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,220
It's just like subgenius.

289
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,900
And I wanted to kill whoever had done it.

290
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,460
And then I realized it predated subgenius by a long shot,

291
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,140
and also that it was absolutely nothing like subgenius,

292
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,920
because it was much...

293
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,980
The Discordian faith seemed to be much more forgiving of the normals,

294
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
or something.

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,240
I mean...

296
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,180
The first edition of the Principia was five copies,

297
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,720
and it was run off on the Xerox machine

298
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,360
of District Attorney Jim Garrison in New Orleans.

299
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,600
After office hours.

300
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,720
Jim Garrison has never known his role in the evolution of...

301
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:45,800
Is that true?

302
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,520
That's true, yes.

303
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,780
Praise Bob!

304
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Praise Bob.

305
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,260
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,140
Well, did Cary Thornley have something to do with that?

307
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,480
Parts of the Principia were written by Cary Thornley II Oswald,

308
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,260
as he's known among his friends.

309
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,780
Yeah, oh, he's a famous subgenius.

310
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,200
Avoided by many.

311
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,700
Yeah.

312
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,820
And beloved, oh, beloved.

313
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,880
Most of the Principia was written by Mal Eclipse the Younger,

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,900
the omnibenevolent polyfather of virginity and gold.

315
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,780
I wrote a few parts myself, and so did Josh the Dill,

316
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,420
and Anrak the Backwoods, and Camden Benares,

317
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,520
and other Discordian popes and saints.

318
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,540
The main inspiration, of course, was Emperor Norton.

319
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Praise Emperor Norton, fall down on your knees!

320
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,140
You might describe who Emperor Norton was and is in our hearts.

321
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,180
Well, Emperor Norton was a Jewish businessman

322
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,820
born in Cape Town, South Africa,

323
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,560
who emigrated to San Francisco in the 1840s.

324
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,020
He was horrified by the vigilantes.

325
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,760
He thought that democracy was collapsing into mob rule,

326
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,480
and he decided the United States needed an emperor.

327
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,340
And since he'd been keeping it a closely guarded secret all his life

328
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,620
that he was the illegitimate son of the King of France,

329
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
he decided to announce it publicly

330
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,120
and make himself Emperor of the United States.

331
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,900
A while later, he made himself Protector of Mexico,

332
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,200
and towards the end, he added King of the Jews,

333
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,900
which is why he's not buried in a Jewish cemetery.

334
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,320
The rabbis decided that was blasphemy,

335
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,200
so the Freemasons buried him instead.

336
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,700
He printed his own currency,

337
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,780
and he got everybody in San Francisco to accept it,

338
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,460
which just goes to show what you can accomplish

339
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,560
if the proper man is in the right place at the right time,

340
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,840
as Lao Tzu says, anything can happen.

341
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
Emperor Norton's currency was not only good,

342
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,020
in his lifetime it's worth even more now.

343
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,040
People pay a thousand dollars for one of Emperor Norton's 50 cent notes,

344
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,100
as long as it's signed with his hand.

345
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,880
Genuine Emperor Norton note.

346
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,060
He ruled for 23 years.

347
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,100
He tried to stop the Civil War.

348
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,420
He ordered Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln to come to San Francisco

349
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,360
and submit to arbitration by himself.

350
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,540
And then he excommunicated them when they wouldn't come.

351
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,040
And what year was this?

352
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,340
This was from 1857 to 1880.

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,200
As Malek Lipsley Younger says,

354
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,560
everybody understands Mickey Mouse,

355
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,620
few understand Einstein,

356
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,240
hardly anybody understands James Joyce,

357
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,520
and nobody understands Emperor Norton.

358
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,560
Live like him.

359
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,940
Except Bob Dobbs, friends,

360
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,480
who doesn't need to understand Emperor Norton,

361
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,020
but just may have been him.

362
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,020
There have always been Bobs.

363
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,060
Not always by that name.

364
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,060
Well, what about this Masonic conspiracy?

365
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,240
That's one thing I want to know about.

366
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,540
My dad, for instance, is a Mason.

367
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,140
The cameraman behind me is a Mason.

368
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,640
For all I know, the Willa Dobbs may be a Mason,

369
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,300
and I'm a 44th degree Mason,

370
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,140
which is why none of you even knew I was.

371
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,620
So, where does this work in?

372
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,520
Are the Masons really demon worshippers?

373
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,040
The Masons' response is,

374
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,640
they're responsible for secularism, humanism, democracy,

375
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,060
Jeffersonian civil liberties,

376
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,120
and all the hideous forces that religious conservatives oppose.

377
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,380
All the forces that have made America

378
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,640
the richest and freest country in the world,

379
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,300
they all come from Masonic theory.

380
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,080
And I can see why the religious oppose them.

381
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,260
As Thomas Jefferson said,

382
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,060
I have sworn upon the altar of God

383
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,760
eternal hostility to every form of tyranny

384
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
over the mind of man.

385
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,980
That is why the clergy oppose me.

386
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,140
All that is on the Jefferson Monument in Washington,

387
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,420
except the last sentence.

388
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,360
They left that out in the interest of brevity.

389
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
Yeah, sure.

390
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
He was a primus illuminatus.

391
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,820
Oh, oh, and which leads me to,

392
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,180
I ought to play this little bit of tape.

393
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,840
Now, this is supposedly true.

394
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,400
This has got to be true because I heard it on TV.

395
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,980
Now, if we can just tune this young man in.

396
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm a fellow in,

397
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,180
and none of you here in the studio will be able to hear this.

398
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,680
You were a practicing witch,

399
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,800
and that's what you called yourself.

400
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,780
As a matter of fact,

401
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,620
first thing I started off as was with what's known as

402
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,580
the Earth Mother religion.

403
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,300
You believe in the plurality of gods and goddesses.

404
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,760
Which is what Laurie has been telling us.

405
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,100
Basically.

406
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,380
Eventually, as I got to the higher levels,

407
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,340
your philosophy is changed.

408
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,180
You are not told what's really going on.

409
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,040
Now, a lot of witches today, independent witches,

410
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,760
people who are doing it by themselves,

411
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,540
and those who haven't really reached the higher levels yet,

412
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,500
honestly believe that there's just, you know,

413
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,860
this Earth Mother religion.

414
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,280
After you get to the higher levels,

415
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,080
you're actually told what god you're worshipping.

416
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,440
We call him Satan, okay?

417
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,460
But they call him Lucifer.

418
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,640
This group I'm talking about is known as the Illuminati.

419
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,320
They are the most powerful, subversive,

420
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,440
group that's ever existed in all of man's history.

421
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,260
And where are they existing, here?

422
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,060
Yes.

423
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,100
As a matter of fact,

424
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,880
they've already infiltrated our government.

425
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,640
On the back of the one dollar bill,

426
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,780
you will find three hexagrams and a pentacle.

427
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,520
The hexagram with that symbol and the circle around it,

428
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,480
a witch can summon up a demon.

429
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,720
Demons, you order about, you know,

430
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,220
to cause things to happen.

431
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,360
It's not something psychical we have in our...

432
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,500
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

433
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,520
Oh, friends, now you know.

434
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,480
That was, uh...

435
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,500
That didn't sound quite as crisp as I hoped it would,

436
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,000
but this man was saying that witches,

437
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,940
the entire nature religion,

438
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,860
probably the whole New Age,

439
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,680
was being controlled by the Illuminati,

440
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,860
and yet I've always understood that the Illuminati

441
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,620
was merely a small subsidiary of Dobbs Co.

442
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,920
Uh...

443
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,600
And this is...

444
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,020
It becomes quite confusing.

445
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:06,840
Where...

446
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,340
Where does one start and the other stop?

447
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,860
And...

448
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,040
How much are they paying you to do this, sir?

449
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,380
Well, it beats the hell out of me, I tell you.

450
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,660
I wrote Illuminatis with Bob Shay,

451
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,100
and I thought it was fiction.

452
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,900
And then this John Todd appears on the scene,

453
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,360
going around to fundamentalist meetings,

454
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,320
and he claims everything in that book is true.

455
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,380
He lived through it all.

456
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,900
And he's ripping up the book,

457
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,540
ripping me off.

458
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,360
Or by ESP, I was, uh...

459
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,600
writing fiction, what I thought was fiction,

460
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,100
but it was actually his life story.

461
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,640
I don't know what to think about it.

462
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,760
I don't know whether to sue him for plagiarism

463
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,180
or go ask him for help before they get me.

464
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,620
Hey, for a long time,

465
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,920
I thought that Bob was surely pulling our leg.

466
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,460
That the, uh...

467
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,060
The conspiracy, which actually is a...

468
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,060
In some ways is, uh...

469
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,300
In the more pragmatic ways,

470
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,880
is interchangeable term with the...

471
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,640
The Illuminati.

472
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,800
Uh...

473
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,440
We thought for sure he was joking,

474
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,100
until the Secret Service showed up at my door,

475
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,820
and, uh, various other...

476
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,160
Coincidences?

477
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,960
Eh? Is that what they were?

478
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,440
Or what?

479
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,120
And, uh, finally, that got so scary,

480
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,600
I decided not to believe in a mini...

481
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,100
And just believe everything Bob said,

482
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,920
totally, uh...

483
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,540
Including when he said there was no Illuminati,

484
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,500
and that it was actually just man's stupidity alone

485
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,380
that had caused so many problems.

486
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,200
So...

487
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,500
Oh, uh...

488
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,200
Oh, uh, they're real enough, uh...

489
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,780
As T.S. Eliot said about the White Cliffs of Dover,

490
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,040
they're real enough.

491
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,520
I, uh...

492
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,280
After I first met Bob, that first time in Dublin,

493
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,840
the men in black kept coming around to my door

494
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,200
for weeks afterwards, pretending to be Jehovah's Witnesses

495
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,160
and trying to get into my living room and brainwash me.

496
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,400
I always let him do that.

497
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,360
But I don't let him exactly brainwash me,

498
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,020
I just record everything they say,

499
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,640
and then kind of change it a little bit,

500
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,260
and use it for subgenius.

501
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,920
Well, I tell them, don't let my cat out,

502
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,580
there's a lot of really vicious pigeons in this town.

503
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,360
That confuses them.

504
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,880
Well, um...

505
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,560
I'm sure you've probably had some run-ins with the conspiracy,

506
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,040
and I mean the real conspiracy.

507
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,500
Now, Bob...

508
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,700
I don't know if you knew this,

509
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,880
but your one-time collaborator, Bob Shea,

510
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,600
spoke on a panel discussion at the Subgenius World Convention in Chicago,

511
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,520
in 1982.

512
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,760
And I had expected him to take these things a bit more seriously,

513
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,580
but he joked about it,

514
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,000
like he thought it was all a big funny metaphor for something.

515
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,820
Well, it is all a big funny metaphor for something.

516
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,440
But what it's a big funny metaphor for isn't funny at all.

517
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,900
Praise Bob.

518
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,320
Now, that was a good line.

519
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,000
We'll use that in the next pamphlet, friend.

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,820
Some people think Discordianism is a complicated joke

521
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,320
disguised as a new religion,

522
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,620
but actually it's a new religion disguised as a complicated joke.

523
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,620
I bet you haven't even heard about the church of Fred Mertz, Bodhi's Atva.

524
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,660
I sure have.

525
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,800
You bet I have.

526
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,640
Are they still around?

527
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,960
Have you heard from them recently?

528
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,080
They're growing faster.

529
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,240
They had only three members last year.

530
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,240
Membership has more than tripled since then.

531
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,320
Well, I remember when we were talking that way,

532
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,400
which means in about ten years there will be about 3,000 of them,

533
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,080
and they'll end up in little weekly entertainment magazines.

534
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,900
It's one of the truest religions around.

535
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,100
This is based on the belief that Fred Mertz is the Bodhi's Atva assigned to American TV viewers.

536
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,860
Amida Buddha swore that he would not accept nirvana until every sentient being was enlightened.

537
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,420
And in order to do this, it needs an almost infinite number of Bodhi's Atvas.

538
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,860
How do you communicate with the fleas, for instance?

539
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,440
How do you communicate with the lice?

540
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,200
How do you bring enlightenment to an amoeba?

541
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,340
It takes a lot of Bodhi's Atvas.

542
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,660
And then there's the problem, how the hell do you reach American television?

543
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,300
How do you get enlightenment to the television viewers?

544
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,940
How do you get enlightenment to them?

545
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,460
Yeah, you think amoebas are hard.

546
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,500
Yeah, I mean, the American TV viewers, I mean, that's a lower life form than the amoeba and the evolutionary scale.

547
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,600
Well, they sent Fred Mertz and put him on the Isle of Lucy,

548
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,120
so everything he says is a profound revelation of cosmic truth.

549
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,840
You just got to be properly attuned.

550
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,880
And I have a friend in Maui that will send you the proper stuff to get you attuned

551
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,700
so you can appreciate Fred Mertz on those old reruns.

552
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,240
Oh, I have gotten mailings from them.

553
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,820
I didn't know they were still around.

554
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:38,820
I'm glad to know, and I need their address for my upcoming book of listing weird groups you can get free junk from by mail.

555
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:48,020
And I was going to ask you, you know, you've infiltrated many cults, and I'm sure—

556
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,880
666.

557
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,860
Right, there you go.

558
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,340
And all these great kooks have approached you.

559
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,620
Are there any sickos, contactees, Jesuses?

560
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:04,280
Or great god pans that really stick out in your mind that have announced themselves to you?

561
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:10,400
Well, there was one guy who used to call me up around 2 in the morning to tell me his latest flying saucer contacts.

562
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,180
But after that, I got an unlisted phone number.

563
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:21,860
It's a bit of a drag to get out of the bed at 2 in the morning to listen to somebody raving about the beautiful green women from Venus he's been bawling lately.

564
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Well, you know, as a matter of fact, that's how Reverend Bucknay could first approach the church.

565
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,860
He was kidding, but I thought he wasn't.

566
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,700
And later on, we ran into people who indeed—

567
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,200
I was disappointed meeting the Reverend Bucknay.

568
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,460
I got a literal mind that somebody's name happened, or I expected him to be carrying a chainsaw or something.

569
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,180
And when somebody's name is Bucknay, you know what I expected?

570
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,500
Well, anyway.

571
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,300
That's what the post office has said to me several times.

572
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,760
People at the sacred P.O. Box, friends.

573
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,420
And that is P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214, the home of Bob.

574
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,120
We'll give that number again at the end of the broadcast.

575
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,080
Oh, yes.

576
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,020
Yeah.

577
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,600
Well, okay.

578
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,040
The conspiracy, obviously.

579
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,840
I'm sure they haven't paid you enough for your books.

580
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,860
What makes the conspiracy real for you or the Illuminati?

581
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,480
Actually, I should clarify.

582
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,400
The Illuminati is an actual group, and the conspiracy in subgenius doctrine is a million times more than the Illuminati.

583
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,960
It's a million groups, but also everyone, including the worst side of you, the listener.

584
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,160
Perhaps the back side.

585
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,500
We don't know.

586
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,880
It depends.

587
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,780
So, the horror.

588
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:42,860
What?

589
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,740
As Mr. Kurtz says at the end of Heart of Darkness, the horror, the horror.

590
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,440
Most people don't realize he was asking for Israeli music.

591
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,300
Actually, the Illuminati is, as I said, a funny metaphor.

592
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,200
A metaphor for something that isn't funny at all.

593
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,880
And that's the general human tendency to make a mess out of everything.

594
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,040
Now, this is because there is no one conspiracy running the world.

595
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,780
I'm sorry to break the news to you folks.

596
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,740
I know how much faith a lot of you listeners have in the one conspiracy.

597
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,200
Actually, there are 24 conspiracies.

598
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,220
If there was one conspiracy, things would be organized and they'd make sense.

599
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:27,280
Because there are 24 conspiracies, that's why there is so much chaos, discord, confusion, bureaucracy, and international reality.

600
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,420
And you all know who's the goddess of chaos, discord, confusion, bureaucracy, and international relations.

601
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,240
That's Ares.

602
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,780
Hail Ares.

603
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,360
She is the chick who had done it all.

604
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,740
I'm a Jehovahian patriarch myself.

605
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,800
We in the Stangian Orthodox, the fifth temple lodge of the Yeti Dobbs resurrected.

606
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,600
We...

607
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,500
Why did she divorce Jehovah One?

608
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
That's what I want to know.

609
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,700
Why would that giant split in the...

610
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,520
I mean, the squirt could have been perfect.

611
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,760
And now, look, it's...

612
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,860
He kept messing around with those Greek nymphs.

613
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,280
And she was afraid she was going to catch something worse than AIDS.

614
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,960
Oh, friends, there are so many worse things out there.

615
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,360
You know, the Ayatollah Khomeini has announced that if a man sodomizes camels, his wife can't get a divorce.

616
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,060
Because Allah is opposed to divorce, even in that case.

617
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,420
If a man's wife sodomizes?

618
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,300
No, if a man sodomizes camels, his wife can't get a divorce.

619
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,680
Oh, okay. Oh, well... How's that going to work?

620
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,520
You say a wife sodomizes a camel.

621
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,820
However, the Ayatollah...

622
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,200
The Ayatollah has a liberal side.

623
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,580
He said if a man is in the habit of sodomizing his brother-in-law, then his wife can get a divorce.

624
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,400
So, you see, compared to the Pope, the Ayatollah is something of a liberal.

625
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,400
He's been corrupted by Illuminati influences. There's no doubt about it.

626
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,000
Well, he's come a long way, though.

627
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,980
You know, obviously it pays off.

628
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,900
But, okay, if John F. Kennedy shot Bob Dobbs,

629
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,000
then who shot Kennedy?

630
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,500
That's what I want to know.

631
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,920
Oh, that was... Everybody knows who shot Kennedy.

632
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,460
That was an extraterrestrial job.

633
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,340
The proof is, you just got to look at the records.

634
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,620
The Warren Commission, all the conspiracy books, all the other novels written about it.

635
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,740
The Warren novel, the Weisberg novels, the Mark Lane novel.

636
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,460
Oswald was up on the sixth floor shooting.

637
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,120
He was on the third floor having a Coca-Cola.

638
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,560
And he was down on the ground floor in the crowd.

639
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,260
Now, the only way that's possible is if he were cloned.

640
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,480
And there was no cloning available on this planet then,

641
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,780
so it was obviously done by extraterrestrials.

642
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,020
Obviously, dear friends.

643
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,140
Well, actually, Bob Dobbs himself...

644
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,040
You know, did you know that the official...

645
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,920
What Dr. Philo Drummond was told by Bob was that

646
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,660
Kennedy came to Bob and asked him what to do.

647
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,520
He needed slack.

648
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,420
He said, how can I get slack? This job has too much pressure.

649
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,700
And Bob said, stage a fake assassination.

650
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,820
It works great.

651
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,660
And Kennedy is still alive driving a taxi in Argentina somewhere having a great time.

652
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,940
Actually, he eloped with Marilyn Monroe.

653
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,840
They faked her death, too.

654
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,780
That's why all these conspiracy books about Marilyn,

655
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,440
they all show there's a cover-up and they never explain what was behind the cover-up.

656
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,300
The cover-up was that she finally persuaded John, as she was trying for years,

657
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,680
to dump Jackie and run off with her.

658
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,680
That is the...

659
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,620
The secret that all these conspiracy books have not been able to unearth.

660
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,120
That and the extraterrestrial involvement, of course.

661
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,220
Oh, so, friends, the secrets are being unveiled in front of your very ears right now

662
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,680
and in front of the eyes, in fact, of our video watchers.

663
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,820
I bet you're going through those channels trying to figure out how to see us.

664
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,500
You have to be a mason to do that, friends.

665
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,380
Well, I probably should go to some of these...

666
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,600
carts that I must play...

667
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,180
for...

668
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,860
for goodness!

669
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,580
For the sake of good!

670
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,200
You can be anyone this time around.

671
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,940
You can be anything...

672
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,500
this time around.

673
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,960
You can be anything...

674
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,500
this time around.

675
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,360
You can do anything this time around.

676
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,160
You can be anyone this time around.

677
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,520
You're the first generation in human history...

678
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,260
to know how to control your own nervous system...

679
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,300
to change your own reality.

680
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,740
blow your own mind make up your own mind you can be anything this time around

681
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:11,680
you can be god this time around you've got to be god this time around

682
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,140
you can be anything this time around

683
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:23,480
you can be anyone this time around yeah as long as you're born rich as long as you're white

684
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,320
yeah as long as you're as long as you've got a credit card i don't know i have a sort of a

685
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,760
cynical attitude that friends that was the mighty timothy leary that's bob dobbs what i recognize

686
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:44,760
that voice that's bob no bob has a texas accent he's not from texas but he but he does have a

687
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,020
sort of

688
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,340
but that was bob's voice do you mean to tell me that tim leary and bob dobbs are the same person

689
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:57,100
and i never realized it before oh my god that's a bizarre and frightening revelation

690
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,500
could could we get in trouble over that or something well uh yes uh dr wilson here has

691
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,080
written what how many books that you did with in cooperation with here is it just one just one

692
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,580
neuro politics that's right yeah i have not read actually

693
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:21,100
the game of life also of course according to art cleps leary wrote illuminatus

694
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:28,280
the world is full of mythology and contradiction is an ambiguity praise the boohoo dear friends

695
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,280
where would the church be without contradiction and ambiguity i mean it's well we'd probably be

696
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,100
rich actually we'd probably be able to sell we'd change the name of the book to book of bob and

697
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,080
make it real corny and we'd probably be popular popular hit it

698
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,080
oh speaking of popular i was i was uh just interested to know uh

699
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,940
uh like for instance you've done how many books and we ought to cover that by the way folks you

700
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:02,620
can go out and pick up a number of books by robert anton wilson uh i know that the illuminatus

701
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:09,560
trilogy is out in big comp like all all three of them in one at taylor's bookstore and moon

702
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,900
grove bookstore over in old town uh paul key store lots of you who are interested in this stuff should

703
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,000
go to the moon grove bookstore and moon grove bookstore and moon grove bookstore and moon grove

704
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:22,900
if you haven't he's got uh he's got he's got all the new stuff cosmic trigger sex and drugs

705
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:29,080
i didn't call it sex and drugs and rock and roll because i didn't want to be sensational i just

706
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:34,580
called it sex and drugs oh and the new inquisition and right where you are sitting now

707
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:44,300
friends you need to go out there and pick up those holy texts um you can tell by by dr saint

708
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:51,360
holiness wilson's uh attitude that these are i mean this is sincere words of uh wisdom and uh

709
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,720
and and uh bull sacred bulldada all mixed up together just the way you like it so it goes

710
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:08,200
down smooth dear friends um oh and i want i want to publicly invite you to do this so that you

711
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,760
can't back down i'm going to hit up several other well-known folks but uh i'm trying to

712
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,940
don't have a job robert to tell the truth i i'm i'm between jobs and i've got these three book

713
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:25,640
projects i'm trying to sell now one is uh tales fictional short stories about bob dobbs called

714
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,840
three-fisted tales of bob stories by a whole lot of different people some well-known some not

715
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,140
but this is one that i want to invite you and all the listeners of this show who want to to

716
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:43,780
contribute to and this would be a book called bummers a series of first-hand descriptions

717
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,780
of your most horrifying but hilarious, in retrospect, drug trips,

718
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,320
including alcohol, you know, not just psychedelics or whatever,

719
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,880
because it would be hilariously funny to some of us in certain moods,

720
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,780
and it would be instructive.

721
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,200
It would be actually a good book for people to read

722
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,300
who are thinking about getting into it.

723
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,700
It would give them a little better idea of just what's out there

724
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,620
besides the fun stuff that their rock and roll guys sing about.

725
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,580
And, you know, a little bit of each.

726
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,380
So what I want to do, I've gotten some great, great material,

727
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,100
mostly from out of town.

728
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,760
None of the only two-hour Slack listeners have ever sent any of those things in

729
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,500
because they all think we're getting flooded with it.

730
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,220
Send those to P.O. Box.

731
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,240
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

732
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,100
I'll get that number again at the end of the broadcast.

733
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,060
Or to KNON, address to the hour of Slack.

734
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,980
I just thought I'd mention that.

735
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,280
I want to put you on the spot and put all you listeners on the spot,

736
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,880
especially if you haven't paid your pledge yet.

737
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,040
It's the only way to get out of the Christian heaven.

738
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,700
Oh, here we go.

739
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,020
The Weeping Cyclops cart.

740
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,660
Oh, and I've got several things I wanted to cover before we have to get off.

741
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,920
They only give you an hour of Slack in Dallas.

742
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,300
Some people don't even get that much.

743
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,840
An hour of Slack is longer than an infinity of boredom.

744
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,860
Well, how would you...

745
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,520
What's your idea of Slack?

746
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,620
Well, the way it came to me when I was talking to Bob the first time in Paris back in the 30s,

747
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,680
this was after we both got kicked out of the Gurdjieff School together.

748
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,600
There were allegations of a most obscene nature,

749
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,680
which I wouldn't sully.

750
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,420
I wouldn't sully the audience's ears by repeating.

751
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,740
But, you know, the universe is made up of something and nothing.

752
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,900
You've noticed that.

753
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,300
Oh, yeah, yeah.

754
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,180
Yeah, that was shown to me quite vividly at one point.

755
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,320
I tried to forget it.

756
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,820
Yeah, well, the audience can see this by just listening to me.

757
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,280
When I'm talking, you hear something.

758
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,700
When I stop, you hear nothing.

759
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,540
Not on this show.

760
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,160
Okay, there we go.

761
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,360
Nothing.

762
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,180
Oops.

763
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:09,720
Oops.

764
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,100
By the way, it was me that made that noise.

765
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,560
Your seminar, when you asked for people to listen to the silence.

766
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,520
I suspected as much.

767
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,480
I had to, man.

768
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,960
If you look at anything, if you listen, you hear the nothing in between the somethings,

769
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,160
as John Cage has pointed out in his book on music called Silence.

770
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,000
And if you look at anything, you see the thing and you see a lot of nothing around it.

771
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,260
So everything is balanced between something and nothing.

772
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,560
The atom consists mostly of nothing, as quantum physics has revealed.

773
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,440
And slack is the point between something and nothing.

774
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,540
When you're able to attune...

775
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,620
When you're able to attune your mind to the implicate order of the subquantum world,

776
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,440
you are between something and nothing.

777
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,760
And then you're in perfect slack.

778
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,840
And from then on, you can get something for nothing.

779
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,840
Repent.

780
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,160
Quit your job and slack off, dear friend.

781
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,320
Help me, somebody.

782
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,960
Oh, something for nothing, dear friend.

783
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,420
That's what people have always wanted.

784
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:13,140
For a concept like slack, which is definitively undefinable, that's pretty concise.

785
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,320
I mean, you know, you can go on and on and on about it.

786
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,100
And on and on.

787
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,660
Well, uh...

788
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,940
Oh, here's another form of the quest for slack.

789
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,220
Life extension.

790
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,200
Now, I have not been doing my homework, and I don't know where the life extension world is,

791
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,700
but I noticed that you still occasionally smoke cigarettes.

792
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,520
Now, that could be taken two different ways.

793
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,420
Is this because you have great trust in it, or in life extension research,

794
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,640
or because you've given up on it totally?

795
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,460
Well, it's because I left California.

796
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,200
When I was in California, I had this perfect perspective on the universe

797
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,540
because I knew, I still know most of the leading researchers in life extension.

798
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,260
And it seems to me that if we get another hundred years of life,

799
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,220
the breakthroughs in that time mean that we'll get thousands of years of life from further medical research.

800
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,760
And it goes on in a perpetual regress that we might be living millions of years.

801
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,040
And on the other hand, I was living on the San Andreas Fault,

802
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,920
which meant that I might be dead in a second.

803
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,680
And I thought that gave me the perfect sense of perspective.

804
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,940
But since I'm not living on the San Andreas Fault,

805
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,100
I've got to find something else to keep my life interesting.

806
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,580
So I do a lot of flying in airplanes, and I smoke cigarettes occasionally.

807
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,560
Yeah, I know. I sort of know what you mean there.

808
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,000
Well, yeah, you're not, I guess you don't live on ground zero like most of us.

809
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,120
Or would Dublin be considered yet another ground zero?

810
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,540
The Irish don't have nuclear plants.

811
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,980
They don't have nuclear missiles.

812
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,540
They don't have nuclear anything.

813
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,620
Oh, yeah.

814
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:42,900
And the San Andreas Fault is a nuclear plant.

815
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:42,900


816
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:42,900


817
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,100
They don't even have their own country.

818
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,820
Well, after 800 years of English conquest,

819
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,720
the rest of Europe is pretty much convinced there's nothing there worth conquering,

820
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,340
so nobody's likely to invade them.

821
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,800
They don't have much of an army either.

822
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,160
Well, I don't know.

823
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,640
I've chosen to live in Dallas partly because I hate this town so much.

824
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,620
I refuse to leave.

825
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,840
But just thinking about that instant obliteration.

826
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,700
The only thing that worries me, that really worries me about that,

827
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,700
aside from the destruction,

828
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,660
of all life on Earth,

829
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,220
a minor consideration,

830
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,600
is that what would a nuclear explosion do to the soul of the person?

831
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,720
That's a scary, scary part.

832
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,720
I've always thought,

833
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,360
I can hear some pleasant music in the background to comment on that.

834
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,780
See, you can't hear the background music

835
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,360
if you don't have headphones on.

836
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,500
I always have something going on in the background on this show.

837
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:38,800
We have to.

838
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,320
It helps throw off those who don't,

839
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,560
shouldn't understand,

840
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,860
or those who we want to confuse so much that they cannot misunderstand.

841
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,240
It's important that too much should not be revealed at once.

842
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Except when it's always better than not enough.

843
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,160
Jerry Falwell is for those who are at that level.

844
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,480
Shirley MacLaine is for those at a little bit higher level.

845
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,440
And Elephant Duty Comics is for those one step up from there,

846
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,580
and so on, until you reach the level of the subgenius.

847
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,160
And beyond that, there's nowhere to go.

848
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,420
Except Discordianism.

849
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,560
What?

850
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,840
Wait a minute!

851
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,320
Well, I'm not going to get into that.

852
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,700
That happened with Shay, too.

853
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,800
Got into a fist fight over, you know,

854
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,460
Jehovah versus Eris.

855
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,200
Well, let's see now.

856
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:28,980
Bob.

857
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,280
Bob don't ever change.

858
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,460
He's Bob.

859
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,740
Always will be Bob.

860
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,300
His face is the one.

861
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,740
Big assembly of dots that shine in the dark.

862
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,120
His grin is the one that looks friendly.

863
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,520
But so does the grin of a shark.

864
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,060
He's Bob.

865
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,700
Bob don't ever change.

866
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,060
He's Bob.

867
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,600
Always will be Bob.

868
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,960
His hair is the one with the highlight that shines on the pompadour.

869
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,320
That glimmers and gleams in the twilight.

870
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,540
It's clear he knows what it's for.

871
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,340
He's Bob.

872
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,960
Bob don't ever change.

873
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,240
He's Bob.

874
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,800
Always will be Bob.

875
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,220
His pipe is the one with the doddle.

876
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,220
That rains on the roof like fire.

877
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,680
His neck is the one with the waddle.

878
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,780
Inflaming focus.

879
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:40,940
He's Bob.

880
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,300
Anyone's desire

881
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,420
is Bob.

882
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,080
Bob don't ever change.

883
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,940
He's Bob.

884
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,760
Always will be Bob.

885
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,160
Bob

886
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,880
It really touches you.

887
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,020
Be careful where it touches you, friends.

888
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,960
And it carries diseases.

889
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,820
And speaking of, well, now speaking of, Bob actually does change.

890
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,080
He comes in many forms.

891
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:35,640
And I wanted to ask you, now you've occasionally had these creatures from Sirius or whatever enter your brain.

892
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,820
And do you trust these things?

893
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:39,920
Not at all.

894
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,420
Not at all.

895
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,780
Friends, I hope you heard that, some of you out there.

896
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,880
Sirius is the dog star.

897
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,580
And as everybody knows, God is dog spelled backwards.

898
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,040
But look at Bob.

899
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,760
Bob is Bob spelled backwards.

900
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:08,000
Now, see, for some reason, I never get any contacts from pink beams of light or, you know, any, well, like that Whitley Stryber.

901
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,440
Have you read Communion, the Whitley Stryber's book?

902
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:10,820
I saw it.

903
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,060
I'm on television in Ireland.

904
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,020
The first of the bestseller contact e-books, which, by the way, I would recommend to people.

905
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:26,500
It's a very gripping and perplexing story because the guy does not sound crazy and, you know, has lots of wit.

906
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,440
He takes you through his experience in a very detailed way.

907
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,940
And I would also recommend his books War Day and Nature's End.

908
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,120
And those are all available in bookstores, by the way.

909
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,000
But, yeah, it's a thing.

910
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,800
The church is subgenius.

911
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:47,460
We occasionally run into people who tell us they've been getting these messages beamed into their heads.

912
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,840
And I keep telling them not to believe a word of it unless it's Bob.

913
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,220
And it probably isn't.

914
00:51:53,660 --> 00:52:05,280
And so I was going to ask, do you have any words of warning or advice that you could offer to contactees and seekers in general?

915
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,220
There's a seeker one every minute, of course.

916
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,100
The.

917
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,560
The.

918
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,540
They'll pay to know what they really think, too.

919
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,240
Yeah, I used to get messages from serious.

920
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:25,840
And then I had a psychic reader tell me it was actually an ancient Chinese philosopher who was communicating with me.

921
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,960
And so then I had two ways of thinking about it.

922
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:36,600
And, well, if I took that ancient Chinese philosopher seriously, I'd be doing appearances with Shirley MacLaine now and channeling an ancient Chinese philosopher.

923
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,280
Right.

924
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:43,260
But then I had another psychic reader tell me it was a medieval Irish poet who was channeling through me.

925
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,760
And then I had three explanations.

926
00:52:45,700 --> 00:53:00,000
And then looking at Harvey on television one night, I realized it was probably a six foot tall white rabbit from County Kerry, because some of the communication sounded just like you would expect from a six foot tall white rabbit from County Kerry.

927
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,720
He's known as the Pooka in Gaelic.

928
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,760
And he's got a weird sense of humor.

929
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,700
And after I had four explanations, I decided to take the most economical.

930
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,120
And I.

931
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,240
I decided it was the corpus callosum had been broken down by megavitamins.

932
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,060
And my right brain and left brain were talking to each other.

933
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,260
And that's all that was going on.

934
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,800
And I find that the most scientifically economical, most convenient and most heartening explanation.

935
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,440
I just have two brains where most people only have one.

936
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,880
Two brains are better than one, dear friends, or at least more entertaining.

937
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,920
Sort of like having a little monster moving your head all the time.

938
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,760
I'd love that.

939
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,020
I would really love it.

940
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:44,440
Well, we've got five precious minutes of slack left, dear friends.

941
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,620
And I do.

942
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,300
I do want to go to another tape to carry out the end of the show, mainly because I want you to have a copy of it.

943
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:59,640
This is be from the really the pope, the controller of all South America.

944
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,020
G.

945
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,120
Gordon Gordon, also a mercenary for Bob.

946
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,140
He has killed many to give them slack.

947
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,820
And if that's what it takes, then so.

948
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,020
Be it, dear friends.

949
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,980
But I wanted to play this.

950
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,300
This is just nature's way of telling you you need slack.

951
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,320
That's another.

952
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,420
That's another one.

953
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,680
I think you did meet Bob today.

954
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:28,880
Although I refuse to believe to believe or disbelieve any of it independently.

955
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,700
You've got to do both at the same time.

956
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:37,700
In fact, the first letter I came had it had to have an excuse to write you a letter a long time ago.

957
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:44,100
And somebody said, well, he knows something about the silver shirts that we're dealing with this other UFO cult, Nazi UFO guys.

958
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,280
And I thought, well, I'll ask him about that just to just so I'd have an excuse to send you a pamphlet.

959
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:54,860
And you wrote back and said, among other things, if you get any deeper into UFOs, keep your sense of humor.

960
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
So that was a long time ago.

961
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,160
I'd forgotten that.

962
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,680
Well, Robert Anton Wilson.

963
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:10,520
It's been a great honor to have you on the show and quite a coup.

964
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,240
Think how jealous some of the other subgeni out there will be.

965
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,120
So go ye forth, sir.

966
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,940
Turn others on to Bob, especially the rich and famous.

967
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:21,880
And send money.

968
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,940
Writers, friends, only sell books and not many people read anymore.

969
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,940
What is what was the highest sales in your books?

970
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,000
If you don't mind saying it depends on how long they've been out.

971
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,120
Illuminati is close to a million now.

972
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,000
Good Lord.

973
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,280
That takes a while.

974
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,300
Yeah.

975
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,080
And they didn't even want to publish it at first.

976
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,300
Right.

977
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,600
Made you cut a lot of it.

978
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:49,800
It took five years to get that published and they let it go out of print about five times in a row before they finally admitted it was a classic and they couldn't get rid of it.

979
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,260
Great.

980
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:50,740
Great.

981
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,900
That gives me a lot of hope.

982
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:54,580
We seem to be on sort of the same little thing.

983
00:55:54,580 --> 00:56:01,180
I got 150 rejection slips for Book of the Subgenius because I didn't write it until I got a check.

984
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,640
I mean, we just told them what we wanted to do.

985
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:05,660
And it took that long.

986
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,760
That's the right way.

987
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,920
Don't write a word until you get a check in the mail.

988
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:12,440
That way they take you seriously.

989
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,580
Well, golly.

990
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,220
Well, Robert Wisdom isn't here yet.

991
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,160
This is a show full of Roberts, one Bob after another.

992
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,080
Oh, there he is.

993
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,380
Okay.

994
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,340
Well, I guess I can't play.

995
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:30,820
I'll play some of some of Dr. Gordon's tape here because I have to because you're probably the only person in this room that would catch all the references that are in it.

996
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,360
I'm not kidding there.

997
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,360
Praise Bob.

998
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,500
Oh.

999
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:49,680
Friends, I want you to write for information the P.O. box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com.

1000
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,100
Just write for information and you'll know it all shortly thereafter.

1001
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:54,960
Thank you.

1002
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,480
The word Bob from the old ganglionic responses signifies a species that is not a human being.

1003
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,540
It is a species or separate race.

1004
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:10,820
Only for a lack of proper understanding has Bob been considered as an individual.

1005
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:18,600
More really, as the orgasmososm, he is the chief product of the semi-tergid, a Jehovah One, usually spelled backwards.

1006
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:26,980
And within the nature of this microgasm, the space god, Yahweh One, established all the qualities of powers that he himself possessed.

1007
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,180
Jehovah Prime, however, does not have slack.

1008
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,900
And therefore, could not only not bestow it upon Bob.

1009
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:43,160
But soon learned to drain off that part of slack that Bob, his personal creation, seemed to possess in natural and unlimited quantities.

1010
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:53,120
According to the legend and many older beliefs, Jehovah One has always deceived his own creations by encouraging them to pull the wool over their own eyes.

1011
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:58,760
So that they, Bob and his kind, would never know the incompleteness of their lord and creator.

1012
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:03,940
Nor feel the subtle vampirization as he came to depend upon their slack.

1013
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,220
For his own unfathomable ends.

1014
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,520
Bob Amickman consequently partook of the characteristic of angels of light.

1015
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,480
Or helioperorators.

1016
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,380
Who were ministers for Yod, He, Vow, He, Aleph.

1017
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,780
Indeed, it was affirmed by groups as ancient as the Christagnostians of Egypt.

1018
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,520
That the redemption of the Yeti was assured through the descent of slack.

1019
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,860
Which, as a spiritual essence superior to that of Jehovah One.

1020
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,760
And which, entering the constitution of the righteous.

1021
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,220
Conferred conscious knowledge of that immortal slack upon the fabrications of the semator.

1022
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,560
Or demistergist.

1023
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,060
That the pipe as a phallic symbol occupies an important part of early subgenius esoteric tradition.

1024
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,700
Hargraves Jennings sees in the pipe of Bob a type of lingam of Shiva.

1025
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,620
Which was a sacred stone representing the creative power of the world generator plant.

1026
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,620
In the Gheez Works, writes Jennings, is a passage to the effect that...

1027
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,080
The female!

1028
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,660
And what is heard is heard!

1029
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,260
That is, before the phallus.

1030
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,900
The pipe being the symbolic phallus of the great proto creator of the blessed race.

1031
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,960
It may possibly seems strange, he says.

1032
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,080
But it is the most confessed tradition.

1033
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:22,060
That among the Yetzini, Dobbs was commanded by Jehovah One, that when he finally should expire.

1034
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,180
His dead body be kept above ground.

1035
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,620
So that in the fullness of time, as a receptacle of incarnate slack.

1036
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:37,500
