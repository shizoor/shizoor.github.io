00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,560
Hello?

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,740
You know, there's a lot of good things about this. There's no bad things.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,040
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
And that's what this is. You know, it's...

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,220
But one of the more interesting things is it's not...

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,980
The Self Genius Power of Sparking!

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,820
Jesus.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,880
It really is.

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,600
Much more valuable than diamonds.

10
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,040
Oh, insomigun, we are gonna be...

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,640
Okay.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,480
Over tiered term cash tops during the fund liquidation index rebalancing.

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:41,760
And at the discount hog futures, the market was able to tighten with cash coming lower rather than relatively higher as it should in the future.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:27,240
And I expected there wouldn't be a worry, but the price went down, and there was a big

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,380
drop.

16
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,340
Darkness subsides

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,480
Breakfast is served

18
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,240
The eggs seem less clammy today

19
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,880
Hallucinatory gelatinous bulbs

20
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,520
Encircle your glands before melting away

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,440
Tiny prepubescent porcupines glide

22
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,900
Down dark lonely streets

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,600
Inside of your eyes

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,860
The man who brings milk

25
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,180
Is not what he seems

26
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,480
Why don't you go home with your chicken?

27
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,040
Herb-encrusted meatloaf

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
Buttered heirloom

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,180
Potatoes garden

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,180


31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:50,580
Potatoes garden

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Cheese cooked in garlic butter

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,480
Apple cobbler

34
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,780
Apple cobbler

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,720
A sad penguin screams

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,200
Behind tinted glass

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,740
What is he saying

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,960
And why does he cry?

39
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,360
Does he understand?

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,240
It doesn't concern you

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,180
It's time to go home with your chicken

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
You can go home

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,820
You can go home

44
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,820
You can go home with your chicken

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,760
You can go home

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,460
You can go home with your chicken

47
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,420
You can go home You can go home with your chicken

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,040
Distant downloads

49
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,960
Stretched way out wide

50
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,920
Distant downloads

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:24,320
Rappers to magical lies

52
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,840
Creosote stuck to your teeth and your hair

53
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,440
Your sandwich is ready, you no longer care

54
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,240
You didn't want mayonnaise, it doesn't seem fair

55
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,660
So why not go home with your chicken?

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,000
Bon duet, oh

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,460
It's time to go home with your chicken

58
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,820
Bon duet, oh

59
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:07,080
Now you can go home with your chicken

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,720
Bon duet, oh

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,240
Now you can go home with a chicken

62
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,280
Clover bread to your side

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,420
C'est Recovery

64
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:40,180
Aww yes dear friends, that was the Rudy's Schwartz Project from its latest album

65
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,600
Postal of Ham

66
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
This is our Slack Number 1

67
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,140
1,686.

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,280
The short collages were done by Mr. Lemur.

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,660
And the upcoming long collages are by Cool Hand Chris.

70
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,640
From PR News in Washington,

71
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,580
I'm training people to interact with machines rather than human beings.

72
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,460
President Donald Trump is ordering new sanctions against Facebook.

73
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,740
Tolerance for this disgraceful must end now.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,300
And food for animals, especially diapers.

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,500
On Wall Street, unsterile conditions and poor management.

76
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,520
53 today.

77
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,680
Brown University says this is hard to believe PR News.

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,260
Say, is anybody else hungry?

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,820
How about it, you two?

80
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,860
Couldn't we go someplace for something to eat?

81
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,780
You girls seem to think it's always the boy who starts things.

82
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,600
Oh, naturally.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,020
Oh, no, Lucy.

84
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,400
I, well, sometimes we're partly to blame.

85
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,220
We invite a little attention.

86
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,460
Goes on, and then it's hard to stop.

87
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,260
There are times when it's up to the boy to say no.

88
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,140
Well, each of us has to set his own standards, I guess.

89
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,340
Jack, please don't do that.

90
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,140
Don't act like an iceberg all your life.

91
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,140
Look, we love each other, don't we?

92
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,820
Yes, but after all...

93
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,820
After all what?

94
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,960
Take me home.

95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,740
I don't understand.

96
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,580
I don't understand.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,440
If you really love Keith, why you're not willing to love him all the way?

98
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,440
Completely.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,780
Well, I may be old-fashioned,

100
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,520
but I've always been taught that sex relations should be saved for marriage.

101
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,980
If I did give in to Keith, I don't think he'd ever respect me again.

102
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,540
Not to mention my own self-respect.

103
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,260
Self-respect isn't important when you're in love.

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,560
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, but I just want to...

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,200
How many times have I told you not to walk around the house like that?

106
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,220
But, Dad, it's only a...

107
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,160
You heard what I said.

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
Now go upstairs and...

109
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,300
Put something on!

110
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,580
But, Dad...

111
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
What happened?

112
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,380
I hit her.

113
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,900
I know, but why?

114
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,280
I don't know.

115
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,840
But was the moment that you had, the moment where you realized...

116
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,500
I was a young child, maybe eight or nine years old, and The Fly, the movie The Fly, was on TV.

117
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,440
And I didn't watch much of it, but I just saw that scene where...

118
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,100
Where Jeff Goldblum was like, I guess it's pre-transformation.

119
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,200
You haven't watched The Fly?

120
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,220
Not the whole thing.

121
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,940
It came out when I was a baby.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,640
I never saw it.

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,500
I just saw this one part, but it was very important because he was naked.

124
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,040
And I just remember those long thighs and that beautiful face.

125
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,980
And I realized I was not gay in that moment.

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,480
I was like, I am so into this man-creature.

127
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,780
And I'm not even old...

128
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,640
Man-creature?

129
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not even old enough to know what that is.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,340
As he's mutating into a fly.

131
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,800
Exactly.

132
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm into people who have...

133
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,680
Shapeshifting powers, but also penises first.

134
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,380
And then shapeshifting powers second.

135
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:50,800
Maybe.

136
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,940
Maybe it's the other way around.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,360
I don't know.

138
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,820
Of all the naked to see, to decide what you're going to try and bang...

139
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,940
It's going to be Jeff Goldblum turning into a fly.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,960
I was so sexy.

141
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,300
I think other people agree.

142
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,660
Thank you, subgenius uber women of Austin.

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,420
Them being Reverend Annalise.

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,500
Anna Moll and Dr. Brew Ha Ha.

145
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:24,500
Soon, we will be rejoining Anna Moll, along with Dr. Philo Drummond, Dr. Hal, and Reverend Fanboy.

146
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,020
Inside the recordings from inside 21X Day, the one I had to miss.

147
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,560
But now, this.

148
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,200
And know what I have witnessed.

149
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,940
Now it is your turn.

150
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,420
Prepare yourself for a journey into a world where each new step may give you a better understanding of your old self.

151
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,760
And your own reality.

152
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,660
We're all living in America.

153
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,700
America is wunderbar.

154
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,620
It's amazing how anyone can actually stay sane once they've gone through this system.

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,200
There is a God.

156
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm a man.

157
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


158
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


159
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


160
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


161
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


162
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


163
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:13,400


164
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm a man.

165
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:13,860
I know.

166
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm a God.

167
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,420
I know how to make a difference.

168
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


169
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


170
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


171
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


172
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


173
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


174
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


175
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240


176
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,440
I know I'm a God.

177
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,820
This is ingenious and it weighs like nothing.

178
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,840
You are on the air!

179
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,300
You hear sound out of things.

180
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,960
Good grief, there it is.

181
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,480
Beautiful.

182
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,940
Such amazing music.

183
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,460
Yes.

184
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,740
Who put this together?

185
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,600
What?

186
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,640
Yes, Reverend Stang put all this together.

187
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,920
Certainly not us.

188
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,520
This is why I paid my $35,

189
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,040
to not have to do any of the actual work.

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,600
Oops.

191
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,460
This is Anna Mall here.

192
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,080
At X Day 21.

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,800
Sitting near other people at X Day 21.

194
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,780
Yeah, like Reverend Fanboy.

195
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,380
Reverend Fanboy is to my other side of me.

196
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,880
The outside.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,420
That's my funny church name.

198
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,440
Not on the inside of me.

199
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,520
We got other people that are here in my hearts and minds

200
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,980
that did not pay a registration fee.

201
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,080
No.

202
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,880
So, they can't camp.

203
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,420
But...

204
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,620
They are definitely here in my hearts and minds.

205
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,300
Yes.

206
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,880
Camping or no camping.

207
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
It's an egalitarian belief structure we have around here.

208
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,940
You're all beautiful people.

209
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,800
No, no.

210
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,800
In the eyes of God.

211
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,500
Wondrous mutants, maybe.

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,980
Beautiful people.

213
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,320
We don't hang out with them.

214
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,060
Beautiful in a mutated sort of way.

215
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,880
Have you seen our lives?

216
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,520
Wondrous.

217
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,780
Majestic.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,120
Mutation is the thought that comes to mind, yes.

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,400
Absolutely unique.

220
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,360
Like nothing else I've ever seen before.

221
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,100
Beauty?

222
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,200
What is beauty?

223
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,200
Well...

224
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,680
Beauty?

225
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,460
It's...

226
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,340
Beauty is booty.

227
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:42,900
That's...

228
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,580
There we go.

229
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,220
We've found the exact match.

230
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,600
So, somebody's anaconda doesn't want none.

231
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm just a bunch of beauty, baby bottle.

232
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,020
Unless it's got pirate treasure.

233
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,980
You mean like a sunken chest?

234
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,700
Like my sunken chest?

235
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,220
Like, booty.

236
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,700
Rrr.

237
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,060
Well, that's what it is.

238
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,480
Rrrrrr.

239
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,020
Is booty.

240
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,460
Well, that's what you're going for.

241
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,120
Beastie Boys.

242
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay, because what's another word for pirate treasure?

243
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,820
Is that what you're saying?

244
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,400
Yes, that's something in not so many copyrighted words.

245
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,420
What I was saying.

246
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,380
Because the copyright police will be listening.

247
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,300
They're here.

248
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:25,940
They're here.

249
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,220
Don't worry, they're here.

250
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,200
They paid their registration because they don't cheat.

251
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,900
Apparently.

252
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,300
Nope.

253
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,500
They're not.

254
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,360
They're...

255
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,640
They're...

256
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,500
John, you know, regular guys, you know, a Boilermaker, you know, shot in the blue.

257
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,240
The regular guys, those mutants.

258
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,600
Blue Collar, Salt of the Earth, that's, you know, those kind of mutants.

259
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,000
Salt of the Earth.

260
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,840
We were salting the Earth with them yesterday.

261
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Salting the Earth with mutants as we came up down the highways to get to the landing site.

262
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,220
That's right.

263
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,740
We pulled the car over and we said, out, mutant!

264
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,520
And then we hoped it would form a breeding pair up in the mountains.

265
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,340
And he's like, ooh, you're so salty.

266
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,200
That's it, out, you salient being.

267
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,720
So when we were done throwing our friends out of the car.

268
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,360
Which made it, like, why didn't we bring more stuff?

269
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,540
Why did we bring them?

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,440
Exactly.

271
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,600
If we had started out without them.

272
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,340
Yes.

273
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,120
We could have just brought so much more stuff.

274
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,820
But it's okay because it'll all be waiting for us on the pleasure saucers.

275
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,760
If you two have paid your church dues.

276
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,560
That's right.

277
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,840
Do the dues.

278
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,560
It is cheaper than food.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,560
Much cheaper than food.

280
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,280
Eternal salvation for $35.

281
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,040
If we have eternal salvation, we don't need food.

282
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
That's right.

283
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,760
I mean, we want it.

284
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,700
And we'll probably get angry if we don't have it.

285
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,400
We'll get grumpy.

286
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,500
So remember the Church of the Subgenius in your will.

287
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,140
We'll be saved.

288
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:51,740
Yes.

289
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,940
We'd like to talk with you about your estate.

290
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,820
Honestly, they could just send it to AMC.

291
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,600
N-A-M-A-U-L-H-O-U-S-E at PayPal.

292
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,140
No, not the...

293
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,440
Actually, the gmail.com is the PayPal of the animal here.

294
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,540
Once again, not a reverend, not a doctor.

295
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,340
I don't profess to have any of those titles.

296
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,380
I profess to have all of those titles.

297
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
I am an overlord.

298
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,580
That's right.

299
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,260
It's nice to see you lord it over us.

300
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,580
Yeah.

301
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,640
It's actually one of my favorite things is, you know,

302
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,760
not having to have my own possessions because I have all possessions.

303
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,580
That's right.

304
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,600
You know, because this is...

305
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,160
Is it mine?

306
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,200
No.

307
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,860
Why not?

308
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,740
You're borrowing it.

309
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,160
Why not?

310
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,640
Am I?

311
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,580
Well, it's something apart from you that was acquired by another person.

312
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,340
Acquisitions.

313
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,680
Yeah.

314
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,520
Like pirates.

315
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,440
Some people don't want just stuff.

316
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,420
They want your stuff.

317
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,220
That's right.

318
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,520
That's the best stuff is somebody else's stuff.

319
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,040
It's most important that you liked it first and now they have it.

320
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,340
Yeah.

321
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,520
I find happiness is easier to achieve.

322
00:15:59,580 --> 00:15:59,860
Yeah.

323
00:15:59,860 --> 00:15:59,980
Yeah.

324
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,620
Yeah.

325
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


326
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


327
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


328
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


329
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


330
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


331
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


332
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


333
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


334
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


335
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:00,620


336
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,000
If somebody else...

337
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,380
If somebody else is sad near me, then I'm the happy one.

338
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,140
Oh, see.

339
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,460
Okay.

340
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,220
So it's a zero-sum game of slack.

341
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,940
I don't know.

342
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,660
I'm not good at math.

343
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,080
Well, it's just relative.

344
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,200
All things are relative.

345
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,380
Actually, maybe the zero-sum is why I'm so good at math because I haven't been working

346
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,220
with any other numbers.

347
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,200
It's like Gulliver's Travels, you know.

348
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,080
He just didn't actually change in size.

349
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,560
Gullible Travels.

350
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,020
No.

351
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,180
Gullible's Travels.

352
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
He just changed his scale.

353
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,320
That's the story of me.

354
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,960
So, change your scale.

355
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,380
Change your scale is the lesson here.

356
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,060
I mold my feathers.

357
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,900
I've got my summer coat coming in.

358
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,600
Well, I hope so because, by God, it's hot.

359
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,920
Who wears a coat during the summer?

360
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,640
It's another hot...

361
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,720
It's muggy.

362
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,520
It's not hot.

363
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,220
What are you talking about?

364
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,500
I came up from the Tejas region of the earth.

365
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,460
I hear it gets hot there.

366
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,800
It's a whole other country recently inundated with dust from another continent.

367
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,240
So, that continent became incontinent on our continent.

368
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,120
And...

369
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,400
Oh, dear.

370
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,780
I hear it's full of nutrients.

371
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,660
Sounds grave.

372
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,780
It's...

373
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,880
Is this some sort of...

374
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,480
Shallow.

375
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,360
It's very shallow.

376
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,900
From the Asian steppes, some sort of sandstorm that blew up.

377
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,340
It's a Saharan dust cloud.

378
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,880
Saharan?

379
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,000
It's from the savannah.

380
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,420
No.

381
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,320
How did it get to Bayou from...

382
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:24,700
Wind.

383
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,940
Oh.

384
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,460
Just wind.

385
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,560
The magic of wind.

386
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,300
Wait a minute.

387
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:29,940
Particles of wind.

388
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,940


389
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,940


390
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,940


391
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,940


392
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,940


393
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:29,940


394
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,400
Particles of dust.

395
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,940
You know they call them Wind Mariah?

396
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,720
They do.

397
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,220
They do.

398
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,140
I never did.

399
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,060
No.

400
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,560
You did.

401
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,080
They did.

402
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,080


403
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,900
We have our own special names.

404
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,240
We have our own special pet names for the wind.

405
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:44,900
But...

406
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,960
And the storms.

407
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,520
Well, the storms all get their own special names.

408
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,680
Yeah.

409
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,920
So, it's like 110 degrees right now.

410
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,460
It's warm.

411
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,440
Down where I'm from.

412
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,400
And I come up here and it's like 90.

413
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,400
Okay.

414
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,180
And everybody's complaining.

415
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,920
It's like 20 degrees less than the wind.

416
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


417
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


418
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


419
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


420
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


421
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


422
00:17:59,920 --> 00:17:59,920


423
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,540
It's like 20 degrees less than where I...

424
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,240
When I was a kid it was like 120 degrees for 40 days straight.

425
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:04,760
You know?

426
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,460
Uphill.

427
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,660
We used to dive for fun.

428
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,420
Both directions.

429
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,860
That's right.

430
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,840
Well, you know, we also ran behind the mosquito trucks for safety.

431
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,880
Literally.

432
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,080
Puffing that stuff down.

433
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,580
Well, you know, the thing about it is I don't ever remember getting bitten by a mosquito

434
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,440
while doing that.

435
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:19,840
Right.

436
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,720
No.

437
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,720
Not a one.

438
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,340
Mission accomplished.

439
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,060
Thanks, Deet.

440
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,200
And I hope to see you guys there.

441
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,200


442
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,320
Honestly, if it weren't for Monsanto, we wouldn't have had the ocean on fire back...

443
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,680
You know?

444
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,400
The Texas City fire.

445
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,920
That was a wonderful explosion.

446
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,360
And something that should have been a lesson for all.

447
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,920
But people forget when you don't talk about it.

448
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,560
Nope.

449
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,160
Got to keep it in the mind's eye.

450
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,280
Thanks, Monsanto.

451
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,080
Yeah, thanks.

452
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Really, honestly.

453
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,900
Like, a lot of boiled pork from the business.

454
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,920
fish that day. Didn't even have to

455
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,700
try. Okay.

456
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,340
Well.

457
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
The Texas City Explosion, if you're not

458
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,900
familiar, I suggest looking up

459
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,740
and learning up

460
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,680
on that before the books

461
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,580
become ash. Okay.

462
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Yes, I will. Before the

463
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,560
YouTubes become ash. This is tingling

464
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,080
a memory I had of

465
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,720
reading up on all of the disasters

466
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,740
in

467
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,300
Ripley's Believe It, no, no,

468
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,300
Guinness Book of World Records. Yep.

469
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,460
So I actually have a dim awareness

470
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,320
of what you're talking about. You know, as a Ripley,

471
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,240
I take offense to that.

472
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,560
Shit. What, the fact that

473
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,120
we keep telling you to believe it or not?

474
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,440
No, the fact that you don't believe it

475
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
whenever I say something, but you believe it if you

476
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,460
read it and it's something that somebody I was

477
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,120
akin to wrote. Okay.

478
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,780
Gah!

479
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,060
Right? So

480
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,800
basically,

481
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,580
as a Ripley,

482
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,320
I can go

483
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,740
into any museum and say,

484
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,640
I'm getting a family discount. This is probably

485
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,660
going to ruin it from here on

486
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,880
out, but I'll go into those

487
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Ripley's Believe It or Not museums and say, I'm a Ripley

488
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,080
and I'll show them my identification.

489
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,860
And they're like, oh.

490
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,560
They're like, well, do you have any ID?

491
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,740
And I show them and they're like, oh, oh, right this way

492
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,420
ma'am, and then open the doors and

493
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,520
all this stuff. And I get to see the back exhibits,

494
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,740
the really freaky stuff that they have

495
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,760
behind the scenes, or

496
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,520
the crap that they haven't glued together

497
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
yet, or whatever

498
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,720
it is at these Ripley's Believe It or Not

499
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,080
displays.

500
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,560
There's fish and monkey parts

501
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,600
hanging around everywhere. They're just trying to put

502
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,040
them together and get new exhibits.

503
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,780
We haven't figured out which, you know, like...

504
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,680
Just sew them together. Old Sal ran out of psychedelics

505
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,540
and can't figure out how to put the monkey bits

506
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,620
together on that goat. You know, we're going to

507
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,000
add some wings to it and

508
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,660
the next thing you know, oh, believe it

509
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:48,960
or not.

510
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,600
People will be like, afterwards, why did I...

511
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,620
I can't believe that I paid this much money to come into

512
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,980
this museum, is what they're saying.

513
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,640
That's the real mystery. How is that

514
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,600
still an industry? How is it?

515
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,200
Like, it's as if

516
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,580
a third of the world believe that the

517
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,400
Earth is flat.

518
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,500
Not a third. A third. Not a third.

519
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
No. Americans? Just Americans?

520
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,480
Not even a third of Americans. Aw, come on.

521
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,920
Okay, how much is it?

522
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,420
There's a couple of guys

523
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,640
that are really loud on the... Just because somebody

524
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,660
is making a lot of noise on the internet

525
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,840
does not make it a factual thing.

526
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,120
Okay. I'll accept that.

527
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,660
But there are some people in Denton that

528
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,720
have a display in the front yard of Denton's.

529
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,880
That is Denton, Texas.

530
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,600
Little D. It's just

531
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,540
there north of Dallas area.

532
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,820
And you can go and see the Flat Earth

533
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,360
exhibit while the

534
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,800
Earth lasts. In its final

535
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,220
days, you can go and see

536
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,460
how flat they believe it

537
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,500
really is. They have a pitcher

538
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,540
of water that pours down onto

539
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,520
a plate that has the pitcher of...

540
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,740
Different kind of pitcher. A pitch...

541
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,480
A jug of water

542
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,120
that pours onto an image

543
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,940
of the Earth.

544
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,900
A pitcher on a pitcher.

545
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,320
It's a meme waiting to happen.

546
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,800
Or a meme, as the kids

547
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,720
like to call it.

548
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,140
So, what you're saying is

549
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,380
that they're making it up.

550
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,940
They're fudging it all the way.

551
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,300
Well, see, that's the first part of

552
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,740
starting a religion is

553
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,980
make stuff up.

554
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,260
Everything I say is true and right.

555
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,120
You're going to need a lot of stuff because you've got a lot of competitors

556
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,340
out there that have worked overtime.

557
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,900
Yeah, right.

558
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,200
I mean, massive corporations.

559
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,960
How can you take a chunk out of that market?

560
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,460
I'm sure

561
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,660
someone's figuring it out right now.

562
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,340
We're probably just giving them ideas.

563
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,680
No, we've got to keep those to ourselves.

564
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,000
That's intellectual property right there.

565
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,580
No thinking allowed here, that's for sure.

566
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,700
We're at XDAY.

567
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,780
Our thinking is being done for us by somebody else.

568
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,080
Outsource that.

569
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,040
That's right.

570
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,220
Like the people who

571
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,820
code and hire somebody in Japan

572
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,920
or China, rather, to write all their code.

573
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,640
It could be...

574
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,840
Could be all kinds of places.

575
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,260
Then they forget how to write code.

576
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,860
Could be India, could be specific islanders.

577
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,240
All sorts of folks in the world are doing our code.

578
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,820
Yes.

579
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,060
The code that keeps me thinking I'm a real person?

580
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
Your code of many colors.

581
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,460
My code of many colors.

582
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,660
That's my hair. It's coded many colors right now.

583
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,280
Yeah.

584
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,760
Somebody glitched that.

585
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,520
If

586
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:23,900
if

587
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,320
if I was to be a robot,

588
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,620
I would like,

589
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,440
to think that I had, like,

590
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,680
extra powers.

591
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,840
Not mutant abilities, like

592
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,380
other people discuss sometimes on their radio shows,

593
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,440
but, like, actual skills as a robot.

594
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,980
I would like to be able to be programmed to do certain things, like,

595
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,540
um...

596
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,840
not be afraid of heights, or something.

597
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,400
I don't know. Useful things.

598
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:50,900
Okay.

599
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,580
You know, like, cause...

600
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,760
Cause, you know, there's a lot of stuff up there.

601
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
Ladder climbing robot.

602
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,360
Ladder climbing robot.

603
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,380
Yeah, not afraid of heights.

604
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,220
Tower climbing robot.

605
00:23:59,560 --> 00:23:59,780
Mm-hmm.

606
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,160
Skydiving robot.

607
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,480
Or what if it was a robot that was a scissors lift?

608
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,260
Drone.

609
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,440
And it would just...

610
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,500
Skydiving robots.

611
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,340
They have to be very tough.

612
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,500
Very tough, you know?

613
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:08,780
Yeah.

614
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,520
Yeah, I would also like to be not, you know, like, really durably coded.

615
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,840
Yeah.

616
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,800
Yeah, this human shell is so squishy.

617
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,680
It goes splat.

618
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,240
The insides are even squishier.

619
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah.

620
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,020
It's...

621
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,120
Gravity is not the body's friend.

622
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,580
And acceleration even less so.

623
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,360
The icing on the cupcake does not protect the cupcake when it's...

624
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


625
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


626
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


627
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,640
When it falls.

628
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,180
Nope.

629
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,000
Nope.

630
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,780
You could scrape it off with a knife and tell yourself you're not gonna get botulism, but...

631
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,680
You know, might as well throw it all in the garbage.

632
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,240
Take the whole world, throw it in the garbage.

633
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,580
Actually, I save my botulism.

634
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,520
Cause every now and then, like, once a year, if I haven't gotten the flu, then I might need a good purge.

635
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,100
So I just look at the can...

636
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,120
You do not.

637
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,780
The open can of, when did I buy that kind of soup?

638
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,780
Do they still make it?

639
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,660
Botulism in the back of the fridge there.

640
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,480
And I'm like, eh, you know, maybe the nacho...

641
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,340
You know, the top of the...

642
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,440
The top layer of the nacho cheese.

643
00:24:59,520 --> 00:24:59,860
Uh-huh.

644
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,780
That's liquid nacho cheese.

645
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,240
Right.

646
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,220
You peel that off.

647
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,340
The desiccated coating, yes.

648
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,480
The ones that are...

649
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
The fuzzy layer of cheese.

650
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,240
You peel that off.

651
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,460
Uh-huh.

652
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,340
And then you slop the...

653
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,840
Cause liquid cheese is supposed to be not solid.

654
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,520
So as long as it's not solid, it's still edible, right?

655
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,960
Is that in the definition of liquid that you're using?

656
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,740
That's edible.

657
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,540
That's the definition of edible.

658
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,400
As long as it's the same consistency as when I first purchased it.

659
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:22,880
Mm-hmm.

660
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,040
Cause if the bread goes hard, it's not gonna be as edible.

661
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,240
Unless you've made it toast.

662
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,320
Yeah.

663
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,140
I'm also old food tolerant.

664
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,100
I'll put up with old food.

665
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,260
Okay, so...

666
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,060
Three day old pizza.

667
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,280
When it literally is in a can, which should not ever be stored in a refrigerator.

668
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,140
An open can of something should not be put into a refrigerator.

669
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,380
And then you also, like, don't remember...

670
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:43,660
Oh, no, in the can.

671
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,160
Don't remember when you purchased it.

672
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,640
Yes.

673
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,340
Kind of thing.

674
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,580
The mystery of location of the food.

675
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,220
Like, you go in there and like, oh, I can just have nachos.

676
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,480
This is...

677
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,860
I could just rent nachos today.

678
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,440
And then, uh...

679
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,940
The botulism.

680
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,220
The purge.

681
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,420
The purge.

682
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,300
Comes on.

683
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,620
I...

684
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,800
Good luck.

685
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And it's a real, you know, you feel free after that.

686
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,680
Sure.

687
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,620
If you've survived.

688
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,080
It...

689
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,360
You know.

690
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,160
When you wake up in the hospital, yes.

691
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,400
They are so sweet.

692
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,280
They are so attentive.

693
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:12,640
They are.

694
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,500
Especially when you keep ringing that bell to get the nurse in.

695
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,200
They're so attentive.

696
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:16,920
Mm-hmm.

697
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,540
Yeah.

698
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,660
It's like, what's wrong?

699
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,260
Are you okay?

700
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,740
Why...

701
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,020
What...

702
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,080
What happened to you?

703
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,780
Why did you end up here as people come flocking into your room to visit you one every two

704
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,340
or three weeks?

705
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,880
No.

706
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,820
No visitors.

707
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,380
No visitors.

708
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,240
No.

709
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,000
If you don't tell somebody, if you're not the squeaky wheel, they won't know to show

710
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,260
up.

711
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:35,940
Wow.

712
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,560
Okay.

713
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,520
And, uh, so, yeah.

714
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,320
I...

715
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,560
I...

716
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,560
It's like, really, if you tell people that you ate something that probably had botulism

717
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,260
on purpose, you're probably not gonna have many visitors at the hospital.

718
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,820
You're gonna...

719
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,560
It limits the sympathy factor.

720
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,160
Not that hospital, anyway.

721
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,080
They might send you to a different hospital when you're done with that hospital.

722
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,720
Uh-huh.

723
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,120
Special hospital.

724
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,060
With padded walls and those extra long-sleeved jackets.

725
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,760
Mm-hmm.

726
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,060
And wrap around...

727
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,340
No, but that for real happens?

728
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,960
Just the hugging feeling.

729
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,420
What?

730
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:06,760
The...

731
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,100
The madness?

732
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:08,860
No, where they...

733
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,740
No, I had the madness before I had the botulism.

734
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,180
No, where they bind people up in, like, straitjackets.

735
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,980
Is that still occurring?

736
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,820
That's a thing.

737
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,440
Oh, no.

738
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,440
No, it's...

739
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,020
No, you...

740
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,120
You...

741
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,940
If you met somebody that needed to be in a straitjacket, you'd be like, well, that's

742
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,980
a good thing that's around.

743
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,300
You know...

744
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,040
That's...

745
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,740
I might be betraying some prejudices here.

746
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,580
Yes, you're right.

747
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,420
I would like to have that around in that case.

748
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,220
I mean, honestly, let's just suspend all expectations at this point and be delighted

749
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,580
with whatever happens, or fascinated by it.

750
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,600
Marvel at the wonder of the thing that you're not sure about yet because it hasn't been.

751
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,760
That's right.

752
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,620
You have to throw the caution to the wind.

753
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,760
I don't have to do anything...

754
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,620
No, I do insist...

755
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,960
That you throw...

756
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
If I have to do something, that's an expectation, sir.

757
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,360
No, to the wind.

758
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:52,820
I insist.

759
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm not doing that.

760
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,580
What wind?

761
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,380
There's a slight breeze, but you know...

762
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,380


763
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,240
A slight breeze.

764
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,500
The wind called Mariah.

765
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,120
I thought we established this earlier.

766
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,460
Oh.

767
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,980
Call Mariah up.

768
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,100
Throw something at Mariah.

769
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,280
Got it.

770
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,320
I'm so sorry, Mariah.

771
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,120
Forgive me, I'm the F

772
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,140
I

773
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,200
I

774
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,380
I

775
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:33,800
I

776
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,060
I

777
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,080
I

778
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:35,380
I

779
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:35,380


780
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:35,420
I

781
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:35,460
I

782
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,620
Thank you.

783
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,100
Thank you.

784
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,260
Thank you.

785
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,520
Thank you.

786
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,360
Thank you.

787
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,740
Thank you.

788
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
Coming up is...

789
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,540
Well, it's hard to believe this is me

790
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,980
only a mere 19 years ago

791
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,340
because I sound so different.

792
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,900
But it's depressingly just as relevant today

793
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,920
as it was in 2001

794
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,380
when I whipped it out.

795
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,280
Think about it, though, friends.

796
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,180
I mean, really.

797
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,140
Reality.

798
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,640
And even its distant relative history

799
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,480
are actually a hell of a lot weirder

800
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,140
than any science fiction.

801
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,360
If something as far-fetched

802
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,020
as Nazis getting paid by the CIA

803
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,200
to train Middle Eastern fanatics

804
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,680
to fight the commies can be real,

805
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:30,980
and it is,

806
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,980
then why not the CIA and aliens conspiracy?

807
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,880
Huh?

808
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,100
I mean,

809
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,520
if the CIA conducted mass experiments on the citizenry

810
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,580
with LSD, and it did,

811
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,820
then why wouldn't it use some cover Christian organization

812
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,520
to turn earnest young weirdos into Manchurian candidates

813
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,960
and make them kill anti-establishment rock stars

814
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,000
or even presidents

815
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,460
just to make all earnest young weirdos

816
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,320
look more insane than the CIA?

817
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,760
It's infuriating.

818
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,020
You know, you can't just uncover a conspiracy

819
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,280
and leave it at that.

820
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,220
You always have to take into account

821
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,300
the deliberate disinformation possibilities.

822
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,420
For instance, maybe the feds pay Bob Lazar

823
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,300
to talk about crashed saucers on air bases

824
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,120
and soul-stealing gray aliens

825
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,300
in order to distract researchers from something far worse.

826
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,300
The murkiness level can become literally maddening.

827
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,860
And that just might be the whole idea.

828
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,280
No doubt about it,

829
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,220
you can go overboard, friends, way overboard.

830
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,260
There's those who believe the Holocaust was a hoax

831
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,440
and all the rest of us are crackpots.

832
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,640
You know, heck, if you're gonna go that far,

833
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,160
you might as well believe that World War II didn't happen.

834
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,280
You know, I'm not saying that.

835
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,520
I'm saying that the next logical step

836
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,540
is to believe that nothing the press ever reported

837
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,620
really happened.

838
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
And pretty soon, praise Bob,

839
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,560
you've got mountains of proof that you're always right

840
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,640
and everybody else is always wrong.

841
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,060
Then, of course, naturally, the conspiracies

842
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,540
that people tend to believe in

843
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,360
are the ones that make them look good

844
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,960
and absolve them of responsibility.

845
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,040
Over a hundred years ago,

846
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,060
some anonymous anti-Semitic Frenchman

847
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,660
penned a hoax called

848
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:40,000
The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

849
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,820
And to this day, thanks to that hoax,

850
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,520
thousands of frustrated, nasty old rednecks

851
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,400
believe that the Jews control the world.

852
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,280
Now, believing that lets them off the hook.

853
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,080
The reason for their poverty and misery

854
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,900
isn't that they're a bunch of lazy, ignorant, alcoholic po-buckers.

855
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,480
It's the Jews' fault.

856
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,520
By the same token, bitter black people

857
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,200
who think that all white people must be out to get them

858
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,940
can find plenty of reinforcement

859
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,380
in the nation of Islam, called.

860
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,380
Inevitably, friends,

861
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,640
those who are the most paranoid

862
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,620
about a particular conspiracy

863
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,860
become a conspiracy themselves.

864
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,920
So where is the balance?

865
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,340
Which conspiracy theories should you believe?

866
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,800
For that matter, which conspiracy should you join?

867
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,700
Well, friends, we're here to tell you about

868
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,640
The Church of the Subgenius.

869
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,280
You know, we started a lot of those conspiracies ourselves.

870
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,660
You can always come to Bob

871
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,460
to find a conspiracy made just for you.

872
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
You can write to Bob.

873
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,200
I'm going to give you that free information

874
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,780
post office box.

875
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,400
Just say, Bob, send me that free information.

876
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,260
And Bob is at post office box 807

877
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:07,380
Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

878
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,200
That's box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

879
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,100
Short!

880
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,000
I remember a time when I thought all that babble

881
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,200
about multiple gunmen in Dealey Plaza

882
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,460
and the Oswald Doubles and so forth was silly.

883
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,940
And it is getting awfully crowded up there on the grassy knoll.

884
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,000
But you know, as I got more educated,

885
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,380
about the JFK puzzle,

886
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,240
I learned a terrible truth.

887
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,160
If you investigate deeply enough,

888
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
sometimes you become part of the conspiracy.

889
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,340
I'm now a participant in the JFK cover-up.

890
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,980
I know why the Kennedy family had to go along

891
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,240
with the Warren Commission.

892
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,020
But if I told

893
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,900
it would jeopardize lives.

894
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,860
Stop laughing.

895
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,440
I'll tell you, man,

896
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,180
you start out paranoid about them

897
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,340
and the next thing you know,

898
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,320
you're one of them.

899
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,520
And maybe it's an infinite regression.

900
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,340
Maybe there's no escape.

901
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,800
Maybe, maybe there's no one single truth

902
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
that everybody should believe in.

903
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,900
Not even Bob.

904
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,000
Maybe everything is a conspiracy.

905
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,240
You know, who knows?

906
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,880
Maybe one of these days we'll find out

907
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,140
even that's not so funny after all.

908
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,560
Good thing this is just a comedy show.

909
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,240
We'll leave that at home then.

910
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,320
We'll let the scourge of the population,

911
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,380
burning, explosions, the gases,

912
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,220
take that over.

913
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,960
We'll leave that all behind.

914
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:49,780
Okay.

915
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,900
We'll figure out some other solution to that problem.

916
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,220
It's not a problem though.

917
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,140
Just because it has a solution.

918
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,320
Every problem is an opportunity.

919
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,980
Just because it has a solution

920
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,140
doesn't mean it's a problem.

921
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,560
Sometimes people are just overworked and needy.

922
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
Oh, well, yeah, absolutely.

923
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,260
That's too big a problem.

924
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,260
Is it a problem?

925
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:12,860
Right now.

926
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,100
Is it?

927
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,920
Well, it's a problem for the people who are in trouble.

928
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,300
It's a situation, but it's a problem.

929
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,640
It's an opportunity for people who have control

930
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,720
over those people's lives, basically.

931
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,340
That's how I look at it.

932
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:26,980
Hmm.

933
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,480
I don't really think that hard as being an overlord, you know?

934
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,740
No.

935
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,780
You don't have to worry about taxation.

936
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,620
Just by whim.

937
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,440
Or elections.

938
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,760
Or administration.

939
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,400
You're just an overlord.

940
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,860
You're saying the people that I'm the overlord of have problems.

941
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,720
Of course they have problems.

942
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,820
Who doesn't have problems?

943
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,200
I don't know.

944
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,800
That's really not a concept I work with.

945
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,700
Is their life a string of perfect days strung together?

946
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,880
On the fabric of their life.

947
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,620
It's as perfect as it gets.

948
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,200
That's right.

949
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,700
I choose to have an imperfect day.

950
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,340
Actually, a very imperfect day is very perfect for me.

951
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,000
Mm-hmm.

952
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,480
If I had no, I don't know, variety?

953
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,420
Mm-hmm.

954
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,140
Then what's the point?

955
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,800
Well, let's just start our existential crisis now at Home Kids.

956
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,780
What's the point of living?

957
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,880
Living if there's no change?

958
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,560
Well, of course there's change.

959
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,980
If every day you do the same thing.

960
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,500
If you wake up, you get dressed, or you don't.

961
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:35,760
You don't.

962
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,840
You might just lay there in bed.

963
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,200
You might play video games all day long.

964
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,080
You might have forgotten to feed that dog enough times where there's just a stuffed animal in the corner of the room.

965
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,000
In a pose permanently looking like it's hungry.

966
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,600
Then you're sitting there and he's like,

967
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,980
You don't have to worry about that dog anymore.

968
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,360
Problem solved.

969
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,180
Problem solved.

970
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,700
Problem solved.

971
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,780
All the solutions are around every, opportunities around every corner.

972
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,180
Solutions are everywhere.

973
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,840
But then, you know, you might eat food.

974
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,120
You might have food brought to you.

975
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,060
You might go get the food.

976
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,020
You might make the food.

977
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:22,160
You might have to go and cut the food out of its original source and turn it into nutrient-wielding goo blob.

978
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,980
You mean you cook it.

979
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,860
Cook it.

980
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,260
Yeah.

981
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,760
You know.

982
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,660
You could cook it.

983
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,880
Somebody else could cook it for you.

984
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,460
Like we have here.

985
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:39,200
And then, uh, of course, once that's all said and done, you know, you might go back to bed.

986
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:48,720
After the pooping and the peeing and whatever extra-meditary functions you gotta do each day.

987
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,900
But that doesn't sound like a day of problems.

988
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,500
It just sounds like a day of boredom.

989
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,900
After, after years of this, you might develop bed sores, which might be an annoyance.

990
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:58,900
Sure.

991
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,160
Or a medical issue.

992
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,180
But not necessarily a problem.

993
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,280
Now, I have the, I have really good bed sores.

994
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,320
The best.

995
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,080
The best.

996
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,780
Just the best.

997
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,320
Because that's the thing you put your money into.

998
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,400
It really has a return.

999
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:11,940
Yeah.

1000
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,440
There you go.

1001
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,040
There you go.

1002
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,840
Exactly.

1003
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,920
Festering open wounds.

1004
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,300
That's, uh, I would, I would, can I get an extra scoop of necrosis, please?

1005
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,560
Yeah.

1006
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,440
If you just give me one second, I'll get you the key.

1007
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,180
Yeah.

1008
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,920
Impotal westerns do wrong with those blows because their butt is exposed, and that's

1009
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:30,920


1010
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,720
I will be endlessly makeup shopping, so fuck remarkable existe long.

1011
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,240
Luk, whatnwh thousand times I've gotten Kolblik해�er Bl Topareraa

1012
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,620
and you're a Mooseimple Mermseianst I'm Blas.

1013
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:41,620


1014
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:41,620


1015
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,520
Kaatikar quaisem.

1016
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,420
Did you get one, заключing at half an hour here.

1017
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,740
You are delivery boxes and books and the usual big bang thougochis.

1018
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,080
In English I think you just sort of, founder your現在 нашегоucci.

1019
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,140
A.

1020
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,300
Know what to do until this thing goes dark.

1021
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,880
The way V sp RYAN's something well though I'm Forceful.

1022
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:50,880


1023
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,300
Tens of thousands of people are still living outside Berlin

1024
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,140
because all have refused to party with them.

1025
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,580
And the BBB BBC says...

1026
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,360
The inside current of the Kravente has been fleeing a BBC crackdown.

1027
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,780
The BBB BBC.

1028
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,380
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says

1029
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,540
this is PR news in Washington.

1030
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,240
You know who I've been exposed to a lot,

1031
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,400
who just does it his own way, is Puzzling Evidence.

1032
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,720
He really needs to keep his clothes on.

1033
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,360
Where did you see him naked?

1034
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,180
No, you just said he exposed it.

1035
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,280
Oh, no. Ha, ha, ha.

1036
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,860
Ha, ha, ha. No.

1037
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,840
I listened to his stuff.

1038
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,400
This is the trail of unconsciousness

1039
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,280
that comes out of people's mouths, ladies and gentlemen.

1040
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,680
No, I celebrate him and his work

1041
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,520
because he just makes show, and it's always show.

1042
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,120
Show is just always going on.

1043
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,720
And it's this long stream of unconsciousness.

1044
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,180
It's a long stream of unconsciousness.

1045
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,460
That's what I'm hoping someday to learn how to do it

1046
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,480
so that the show just happens.

1047
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:56,960
This is part one where I learn how to blather.

1048
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,480
Something...

1049
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,980
I was going to say something has to happen,

1050
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,220
but in truth, nothing has to happen.

1051
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,640
Right.

1052
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,940
And people have tried writing stuff

1053
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,700
about how nothing is happening

1054
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,100
with limited success.

1055
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,340
And sometimes when nothing happens, it's funny.

1056
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:18,960
Sometimes.

1057
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,900
And sometimes when nothing happens,

1058
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,760
it's just masochistic going over the same things

1059
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,680
over and over again.

1060
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,760
I was not a fan of Seinfeld.

1061
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,940
I was saying you were pretty much describing that.

1062
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,440
And then there's people who find...

1063
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,980
Well, the Seinfeld show was Larry David,

1064
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,180
and then Larry David's got the Larry David show,

1065
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,840
and so it's the celebration of nothing,

1066
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,160
the celebration of the quotidian and blah,

1067
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,420
suddenly.

1068
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,460
Yes.

1069
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,240
Nothing happened.

1070
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,880
Nothing happened.

1071
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,720
But it happened suddenly.

1072
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,880
Well, and it's also humor derived from shame,

1073
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,960
humor derived from bad behavior.

1074
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,040
I got a limited...

1075
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,400
It's got a limited appeal for me.

1076
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,220
That's not where I go for humor,

1077
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,800
if I can help it.

1078
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,140
And I'm not a prude either.

1079
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,220
I just...

1080
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,880
I get tired of it.

1081
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,480
Find it boring.

1082
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,120
It's boring.

1083
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:15,940
Exactly.

1084
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,820
Don't be...

1085
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,620
Boring.

1086
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:21,580
Yeah.

1087
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,040
Boring is a sin.

1088
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,580
If part of your day is watching Seinfeld on TBS

1089
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,340
and you watch the commercials...

1090
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:27,700
I'm sorry.

1091
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,120
...then you have to stop.

1092
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,840
You have...

1093
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,880
Who is the person who's doing that,

1094
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,280
that watches it, doesn't have a DVR?

1095
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,500
It's like you could do literally anything

1096
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,280
from robbing a bank to, you know,

1097
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,480
driving your car into the ocean,

1098
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,840
and it would be more productive...

1099
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,160
Building custom pee videos.

1100
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:48,940
That's...

1101
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,540
Yes.

1102
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,400
But we're still not talking about politics.

1103
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,060
No, we're not.

1104
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:53,900
No.

1105
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,400
We're definitely not talking about

1106
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,600
people who are

1107
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,100
doing a handheld odyssey about

1108
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,760
sex consultants...

1109
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,120
Handheld.

1110
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,440
Making...

1111
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,160
Documenting the spoiling of bedware.

1112
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,860
Of bedsheets.

1113
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,380
No.

1114
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,380
Definitely not talking about that.

1115
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,620
You're triggering me,

1116
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,020
but in a good way, by the way.

1117
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,780
Well, pee and poop,

1118
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,060
those are subgenius topics.

1119
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,400
Pee dog and poop dog

1120
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,940
are very important personalities in the church.

1121
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,520
They are.

1122
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,040
They are.

1123
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:30,880
It's...

1124
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,260
That don't come up as often as they have in the past.

1125
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,400
And they don't come up as often as they should.

1126
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,020
As they should.

1127
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,820
I put this playlist together.

1128
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,120
If one is listening to this

1129
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,160
and it happens to get to your ears

1130
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,920
and you want to find out,

1131
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,280
a link to it is on the 21XDay page.

1132
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,960
And I will probably find another place to put it.

1133
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,960
But it's just subgenius stuff

1134
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,140
that's on YouTube already.

1135
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,500
They strung together.

1136
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,280
And there's the most amazing rant by Philo,

1137
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,000
who happens to be here at this X Day.

1138
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,520
Yes, he is.

1139
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,180
And it is just a torrent of swear words

1140
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,580
and descriptions of disgusting bodily parts

1141
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,880
and excretions.

1142
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,400
Excreta.

1143
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:18,900
Excreta.

1144
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,740
Is that the lecture about eating fucks?

1145
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,300
Yes.

1146
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,060
Oh, yes.

1147
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,680
I remember that.

1148
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,060
I remember that when he gave it.

1149
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,100
Were you there?

1150
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:26,800
Yes, I was.

1151
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,760
Oh, well...

1152
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,340
In the front row.

1153
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,560
You were blessed.

1154
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,140
Definitely blessed.

1155
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,200
You could hear him losing the audience.

1156
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,580
It's so great.

1157
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,160
And then you can hear people applauding

1158
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,620
to indicate that he should stop now.

1159
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,280
And then he gets to the end

1160
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,720
and automatically everyone applauds

1161
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,840
even though they've been dreaming about it ending

1162
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,520
for the last...

1163
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,340
Four minutes.

1164
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,500
Well, they've been dreaming about it.

1165
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,520
It finally happened.

1166
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,640
It finally happened.

1167
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,060
And there was much rejoicing.

1168
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:56,660
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,700
Mm-hmm.

1170
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,920
Yes, I...

1171
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,380
That was fun listening

1172
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:06,440
on my way down here from...

1173
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,060
Indeed.

1174
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
From Metro Detroit.

1175
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,240
Yes.

1176
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,700
Fun, fun listening.

1177
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,080
I can't...

1178
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,820
See, you gotta take the time.

1179
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,720
That's something I would ask everybody to do.

1180
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,700
Take a little time as...

1181
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,540
As Fightsitaj does.

1182
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,820
To seek out the bulldada.

1183
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,360
To seek out the weird media.

1184
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,480
To seek out the stuff that's not on...

1185
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,080
But if you're tuned into it...

1186
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,200
The three...

1187
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,860
Your channels.

1188
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,780
If you're tuned into the bulldada,

1189
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,380
you don't have to seek it out.

1190
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,140
It seeks you.

1191
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,320
Once you adjust your view...

1192
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,200
You will find it everywhere you look.

1193
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,620
Yeah.

1194
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,540
Yep, there it is.

1195
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,100
And you realize that as horrific the world is,

1196
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,400
uh,

1197
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:47,780
uh,

1198
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,260
at any given day and age,

1199
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,520
it can also be pretty fucking funny.

1200
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,100
Yeah.

1201
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,160
Yeah.

1202
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,300
It's...

1203
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,560
It's human beings

1204
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,800
concentrating their energy on...

1205
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,980
Well, making something...

1206
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,460
Making something to be perceived.

1207
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,780
You know,

1208
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,660
talking about Ed Wood.

1209
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,080
Just the obsession.

1210
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,760
The people have got the obsession

1211
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,380
to get the thing down.

1212
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,360
And I...

1213
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,040
Before there was electronic media or film,

1214
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,720
it was the...

1215
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,400
You know,

1216
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,140
uh,

1217
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,080
epic poet.

1218
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,640
Traveling from town to town.

1219
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,940
It's like,

1220
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,480
hey, sit down for a couple hours.

1221
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,800
I gotta tell you about Odysseus.

1222
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,880
I gotta tell you about the Odyssey.

1223
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,340
Well, they didn't, uh,

1224
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,180
in some cases,

1225
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,480
they didn't realize that,

1226
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,340
um,

1227
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,600
the rocks they were throwing at him

1228
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,520
to make him shut up

1229
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,680
were, um,

1230
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,520
actually valuable, so...

1231
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:42,920
Right.

1232
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,380
He usually came away with a fortune.

1233
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,780
We just never hear that part of him.

1234
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,180
Nope.

1235
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,540
Here's your bulldogger right here,

1236
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,300
ladies and gentlemen.

1237
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,440
So,

1238
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,200
considering that,

1239
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,740
even that is not a problem,

1240
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,880
what would, uh,

1241
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,120
what would a day with problems look like

1242
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:01,600
for you?

1243
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,120
A day with problems?

1244
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,380
Yeah, I'm unaware of the concept.

1245
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,640
All the stuff I need to have work

1246
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,120
so I can get from one part of the day

1247
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,980
to the next part of the day

1248
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
fails to work.

1249
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,800
That's a problem.

1250
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,780
Okay, so,

1251
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,940
whose idea,

1252
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,340
of work,

1253
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:18,840
this is the thing.

1254
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,840
So, I've taken the idea of work

1255
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,380
Yeah.

1256
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,920
and realized that it's somebody else's idea

1257
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,600
that's been pressed upon me.

1258
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,560
Sure.

1259
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,300
Right?

1260
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,860
This is church secrets being revealed,

1261
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,100
kids at home

1262
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,200
that are playing along.

1263
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,720
And I say,

1264
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,600
hey, you know what?

1265
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,780
That's somebody else's idea

1266
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,020
of what I need to do with my life.

1267
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,520
Mm-hmm.

1268
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,540
But it's,

1269
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,520
but I didn't give them any money.

1270
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,200
They're just giving me this free

1271
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,360
advice.

1272
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:47,940
Sure.

1273
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,040
I'm not an ad,

1274
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:49,600
I'm not,

1275
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,740
I don't like advertisers.

1276
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,080
So, I'm just gonna cut that right out.

1277
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:53,480
I'm gonna be,

1278
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,220
I'm gonna pay to know what to think.

1279
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,120
Yes.

1280
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,800
Send my $35 into the Church of the Subgenius.

1281
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,640
Well, they're gonna explain it to you.

1282
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:01,600
And then they tell me

1283
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,900
what to think.

1284
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,580
And sometimes they don't tell me anything.

1285
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,740
So, I don't have to do a darn thing.

1286
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,840
It's really been working out well.

1287
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,680
If you want to take thinking off the schedule,

1288
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,300
join the Church of the Subgenius.

1289
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,400
Absolutely not necessary.

1290
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,180
Just let the,

1291
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,680
no expectations there in the Church of the Subgenius.

1292
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,880
No, there aren't, actually.

1293
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,840
Which is exactly why I have no stress whatsoever.

1294
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,260
So, we're never disappointed.

1295
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:23,900
So, what you're saying,

1296
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,540
Because there's no expectations.

1297
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,800
I wouldn't even know what that was.

1298
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,820
Aim for the bottom.

1299
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,080
The choose to lose system works every time.

1300
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:31,980
Yep.

1301
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,520
So, what you're saying is,

1302
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,400
other people want you to go to this place

1303
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,260
to do a thing in order to earn a thing

1304
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,900
so you can spend it on stuff

1305
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,300
that other people said you need to have.

1306
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:43,940
Mm-hmm.

1307
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,480
So, you can

1308
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:45,920
enjoy,

1309
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,420
enjoy things?

1310
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:50,960
Well,

1311
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,180
it's not enjoy so much as survive, you see.

1312
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,200
So, that's what you got to get past.

1313
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:57,780
Ooh.

1314
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,360
If you adopt,

1315
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,720
if you do that,

1316
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,420
you have to say,

1317
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,160
I'm not going to let it get to me.

1318
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,540
I'm just going to give,

1319
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,300
render to Caesar what Caesar's can continue.

1320
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,080
Sounds like a horrible idea.

1321
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:09,440
Willful as,

1322
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:10,780
as,

1323
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,640
I can't say that word.

1324
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,100
Huh?

1325
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,740
Ignorance.

1326
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,660
Willful as,

1327
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,320
Oh, yeah.

1328
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,180
Gosh darn it.

1329
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,740
Willful ignorance.

1330
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,260
That makes,

1331
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,100
that turns the world.

1332
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:19,740
Ignorance.

1333
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,200
Yeah.

1334
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,620
All those,

1335
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,260
all those,

1336
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,660
just so wonderful.

1337
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,780
It's a gift.

1338
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,980
It's just a little gift

1339
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,020
that's given to you

1340
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,280
by the corporation.

1341
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,120
A little gift.

1342
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:30,660
A little gift.

1343
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,600
That's given to you,

1344
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,400
like your little,

1345
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,420
tiny semblance of,

1346
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,260
of happiness

1347
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,540
and brief moment of joy

1348
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,640
in existence.

1349
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,100
Man, if that's what you got going for,

1350
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,860
what's the point?

1351
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,140
What's the point of this daily grind

1352
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,660
if it doesn't produce coffee,

1353
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,720
which is delicious,

1354
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,620
and I would be,

1355
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:47,860
No.

1356
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,300
happy if anybody brought me coffee.

1357
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,980
Everywhere I do this stuff,

1358
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,200
I get coffee.

1359
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,260
So really,

1360
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,420
it's just feeding my coffee addiction.

1361
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,500
Oh, okay.

1362
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,480
Well, as long as they have you

1363
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,180
addicted to something,

1364
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,200
so you have to return.

1365
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,160
You thought it was all this

1366
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,040
philosophy and stuff.

1367
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,180
I just like coffee.

1368
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,800
And they're always

1369
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,100
pouring it down your throat.

1370
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,480
So, you know.

1371
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,160
They do that at a lot of places

1372
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,220
that they want you to be.

1373
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,580
Yeah.

1374
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,380
Yes, they do.

1375
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:12,500
Yep.

1376
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,380
But,

1377
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,320
but honestly,

1378
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,840
if I don't have any kind of

1379
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,820
expectations for myself

1380
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,760
or for other people,

1381
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,900
how can I be disappointed

1382
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,820
and made sad?

1383
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,660
But, yeah.

1384
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,360
That, you know,

1385
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,100
you can't.

1386
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,440
Exactly.

1387
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,420
I agree with that.

1388
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,320
Okay.

1389
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,880
Okay.

1390
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,540
That was,

1391
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,060
okay, never make me do that much effort

1392
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,040
in explaining why I don't have to

1393
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,720
put out effort ever again.

1394
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:36,900
Jeez.

1395
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,000
Shall we step to the side?

1396
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,360
So, wait, you're,

1397
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,560
I'm ready to.

1398
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,800
You're going to step aside.

1399
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,260
Side, sir?

1400
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:47,620
Yes.

1401
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,740
You and your,

1402
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,580
your predisposed predilections

1403
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,940
to work the ethic

1404
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,820
efforty.

1405
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,220
I don't know.

1406
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,960
Are there ethics involved?

1407
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,840
Ethics involved in what?

1408
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,560
Okay, then never mind.

1409
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:02,940
Okay.

1410
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,680
Okay.

1411
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,780
That simplifies it.

1412
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Thanks to Reverend Anna Mall

1413
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,100
and Fanboy

1414
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,860
and everyone at X Day.

1415
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,580
I wish I could have been

1416
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:16,940
there,

1417
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,660
but I had to deal with

1418
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,700
family matters

1419
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,640
in the parched land

1420
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,160
of Stang Ranch

1421
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,480
in north central Texas

1422
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,780
during a month of days

1423
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,360
all over 100 degrees

1424
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,320
and not a drop of rain.

1425
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,360
We already made it

1426
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,620
through one grass fire

1427
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,080
and Princess Wee

1428
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,120
and her mom

1429
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,960
had to stay in Ohio

1430
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,940
so it's just me

1431
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,900
and the hound dog

1432
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,040
and the new pit bull

1433
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,560
clogger.

1434
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,280
And Price Bob,

1435
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,680
almost all the rest

1436
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,740
of my family.

1437
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,320
So it's not so bad

1438
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,780
because my family is

1439
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,740
so cool.

1440
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,600
Even though the weather's

1441
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,420
so incredibly hot

1442
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,220
and threatening

1443
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,720
and the national oppressiveness

1444
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,380
is grotesquely palpable

1445
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,180
on all levels.

1446
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,040
Nonetheless,

1447
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,840
we persevere

1448
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,820
and we always have friends

1449
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:15,400
such as

1450
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,560
Bob Walsh,

1451
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,080
Mark möchte

1452
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:17,480
stan

1453
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,480


1454
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,100
A man is not visual

1455
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,800
By the size of his feet

1456
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,240
By the point of his choice

1457
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,660
The grain of his voice

1458
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,060
The strings of his jeep

1459
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,700
The breadth of his vision

1460
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,480
The cast of his hand

1461
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,160
Like you would not believe

1462
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,220
In a dry, dry land

1463
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,720
Like you would not believe

1464
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,500
Rain in the desert

1465
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,700
Like you would not believe

1466
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,420
Man from a hand

1467
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,000
He shall grow

1468
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,900
In a dry, dry land

1469
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,500
Oh, I was a fool

1470
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,700
I was counting my store

1471
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,560
Yeah, I was counting my money

1472
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,780
He spared my blessings

1473
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,220
And I'll tell you what's more

1474
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,920
Oh, I begrudged the poor

1475
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:18,960
Yeah, I sacked me in the lake

1476
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,420
As a man like you would not believe

1477
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,440
In a dry, dry land

1478
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,080
Like you would not believe

1479
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,760
Rain in the desert

1480
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,060
Like you would not believe

1481
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,800
Man from a hand

1482
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,360
He shall grow

1483
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,320
In a dry, dry land

1484
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,060
Like you would not believe

1485
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1486
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1487
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1488
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1489
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1490
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1491
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,060


1492
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,120
In a dry, dry land

1493
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:52,840
With

1494
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,860
Well, all we can do is

1495
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,280
Find a small sea

1496
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,580
And hope that the miracle

1497
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,280
Yes, will proceed

1498
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,080
Rain from a earth answer, oiled by the air

1499
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,840
Light it with renpah

1500
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,800
We are being tested

1501
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,580
We are being asked

1502
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,020
To make good on our bets

1503
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,600
And to help with the rest

1504
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,900
Of the time's hard tests

1505
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,840
And the rain will fall

1506
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,740
And your face will stand

1507
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:06,320
Yeah, you would not believe

1508
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:11,520
In a tragic end

1509
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,980
Yeah, you would not believe

1510
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,880
Like you would not believe

1511
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,440
Rain and mist

1512
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,980
Like you would not believe

1513
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,660
Matter from the end

1514
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,240
We shall prove

1515
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,220
In a dry, dry land

1516
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,280
In a dry, dry land

1517
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,980
In a dry, dry land

1518
00:58:49,120 --> 00:59:13,660
In a dry, dry land
