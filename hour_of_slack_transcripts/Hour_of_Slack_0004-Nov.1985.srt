1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
Tune in again next Sunday at 10 o'clock.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,880
I have a bucket!

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,880
No trouble.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,400
Just get set and get going.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,820
According to the recording, everything's going fine.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,720
Fine. No trouble.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,540
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,360
Bob?

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,640
Bob?

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,060
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,740
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,200
What about slack?

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,340
That's your key phrase.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,540
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,980
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,920
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,820
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,620
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Omega Fist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,800
with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Orthodox Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius,

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,860
the first naked church of the subgenius.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,020
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,820
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,940
living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,880
Are we controlled by secret forces?

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,200
Amen! Amen! Amen!

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,740
Amen! Amen!

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,240
Almighty and everlasting Bob,

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,260
who came down among us to make heaven under earth,

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,320
lighten our darkness.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,660
Oh, instrument of God,

32
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,840
grant us thy peace.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
Almighty Bob,

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,780
who destroyed all devils

35
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,340
and created angels,

36
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,000
behold,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,780
behold,

38
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,340
his glory.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,400
Behold the truth that abides in us.

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
Reveal that truth unto that maker.

41
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,020
I reveal my innermost self unto my God.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
Unto my God.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,460
Unto my God.

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,060
Unto my God.

45
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,340
Unto my God.

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,220
Unto my God.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,520
Dear friends,

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,120
It must be clear to you that this simple teaching

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,260
diffuses truth in the very lasts of humanity,

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,900
but how did God lead the foundation for the fullness of His

51
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,020
being?

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,420
Well,

53
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:25,940
first of all,

54
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:33,120
accept your pledges as our amazing volunteer test drive begins because you

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:44,540
can tell just just what you need around these parts here in Texas far out away

56
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,820
from those Sodom and Gomorrah's of New York and LA the pink coasts we need to

57
00:03:51,820 --> 00:04:00,680
protect that which is native to our land friends such as kno in the non station

58
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,420
it's not like those others and it's the only one where you're gonna get the pure

59
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,380
message of slack and the word of jr. Bob Dobbs at all on the air in Dallas Texas

60
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,460

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,300

63
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,580
begins at midnight tonight and we'll start talking about money you know we

64
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,460
love to talk about money because this is a church a subgenius church listen to

65
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,300
that music there

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,720
but that's

67
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:51,800
but that's

68
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:51,800


69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,900
beautiful that's buck on his auto harp joined by Reverend Glenn Carlson but the

70
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,700
soup electric it's look out that was those those sounds you hear some of the

71
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,520
bills that come into this station these guys aren't on the air for free

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,660
don't play ads and they play well you know when you turn this station on you

73
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
don't know what you're gonna hear whether it's gonna be

74
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:19,820
a

75
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,600
you

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,100
are

77
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,520
off

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,300
know it's gone folks

79
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,500
hello doctors is there anyone else here is this station completely empty

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,320
you know you've got the microphone all right folks I'm just gonna have to change

81
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,020
my endless box of cassettes

82
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,480
you a cop

83
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,640
you a cop

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,560
Oh, yeah, everybody. I've got to do everything myself around here.

85
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,680
This is ridiculous. I don't even know how to turn these machines off.

86
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,340
Look at this.

87
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,560
I'll do it.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,060
Folks, this could be some sort of a conspiracy.

89
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,280
Stop. That's it.

90
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,500
Thank you, dear friends, for contributing your prayers towards the breaking of that cassette recorder.

91
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,560
And you see, it's things like this that prove that this station needs money

92
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,360
because people like us come in here and we can't get the machines to stop running

93
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,300
and we just start hitting.

94
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,120
Red Room Stang, I'd like to break in here for just a second.

95
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,240
Please do.

96
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,120
During the next show, the show after Hour of Slack,

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,880
he's going to play a tape and it's going to tell exactly why KNON is under siege

98
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,480
and the situation.

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,860
The station has been socked with some unusual problems

100
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,920
that we're going to let you know about from without.

101
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,660
This is the serious message.

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,140
This is the message of...

103
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,600
Right.

104
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:56,960
Right.

105
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,240
This is the actual pressure that some forces within society are putting on KNON.

106
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
I don't know exactly how specific they can let you know what's going on.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,420
The conspiracy, Buck, is never a very specific entity.

108
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,340
Right.

109
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,480
I'd like to remind our listeners that...

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
It's all one conspiracy.

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,620
That Coke and Pepsi are on the same side.

112
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,580
They want to take away your Slack.

113
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,160
They want to take away our station.

114
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,040
That's incredible.

115
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,080
They just want it all.

116
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,740
That's what I've been hearing.

117
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,080
They've got two stations right by here now and they want to make it three.

118
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,360
What the heck.

119
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,400
They want it all.

120
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,300
They want it all, friends.

121
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,400
I think they're trying to shut us up more than they're trying to.

122
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:41,880
Abnormal.

123
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,220
Abnormal.

124
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,640
Probably better than most people.

125
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,260
Friends, that's what they say.

126
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:46,720
Yes.

127
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,840
Your time shall triumph.

128
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,480
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

129
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,200
But only if you send your checks and your lovely...

130
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,440
Well, what is the deal with the situation?

131
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,540
With the amazing...

132
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,420
Dig through the Bibles in here and the pamphlets.

133
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,100
Right.

134
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,920
You send $5 to KNON, you get their newsletter.

135
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,280
And if you mention this show, you get a free...

136
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,260
Subgenius pamphlet number two.

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,300
That's right.

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480
The new one.

139
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,820
And for $20, you get the bumper sticker and the newsletter.

140
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,500
Friends, this is an amazing bumper sticker that will bring you a great deal of trouble from the conspiracy as soon as they see you.

141
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,660
So you know it's a romantic sort of amazing thing to do.

142
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,220
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

143
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,600
But only, only if you do.

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,100
Buck?

145
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,400
What do they do?

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
I mean...

148
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,440
Okay, $20 bumper sticker mailed to you.

149
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,920
Plus the pamphlet, right?

150
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
Subgenius pamphlet number two?

151
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,520
That's right.

152
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,920
All right, Doug, this is brand new, though.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,720
This is not what you've already got.

154
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,440
This is something you haven't seen yet.

155
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,840
$30, you get the bumper sticker, the pamphlet and the t-shirt.

156
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,840
For $40, the bumper sticker and the t-shirt will be mailed.

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,740
Or whatever.

158
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,120
Otherwise, I guess it's going to walk over to your house or something.

159
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,040
Anyway, real important.

160
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,200
Mention Hour of Slack so we know which show you're listening to.

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,920
I don't know if that makes any sense.

162
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,100
Actually, we don't care.

163
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,900
We'll smell your money.

164
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,520
We're with you.

165
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,960
As long as it smells like it's for Bob.

166
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,700
The material may not be reproduced.

167
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,540
Do the same thing over 21 years.

168
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,320
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.

169
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,460
You can't buy a mirror.

170
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:43,700
You can't buy a miracle.

171
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,460
But you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

172
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,580
Like a bunch of...

173
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,200
It's on the radio right now.

174
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:50,800
Right.

175
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,300
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks?

176
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,180
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is Antichrist.

177
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,940
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made.

178
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,240
And that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is...

179
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,940
In your hand.

180
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:19,040
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

181
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,600
There will be a day not in the too far distant future in which Antichrist will be revealed.

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,920
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

183
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,920
And people will have a number in their hands and in their foreheads.

184
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,340
So our demand for energy will be met from our own production and our own conservation.

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,940
Come on.

186
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,120
Also in your literature, I noticed connections with aliens.

187
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,460
And the god of wrath who visits us every once in a while and talks to...

188
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,040
We've got to drop this name in here.

189
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,040
Bob Dobbs.

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,420
The high muckety muck.

191
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,680
Never behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him.

192
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,840
Space vessel identity unknown.

193
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,660
I could show you a flying saucer and you'd swear it was something that I'd got from the air.

194
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,340
You'd show me a real flying saucer and you'd say...

195
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,040
I got it from there.

196
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,860
I'll give you a...

197
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,680
At least, Joe...

198
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll give a thousand dollars to your religion if you can produce one flying saucer.

199
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,860
At least, Joe, that is my opinion of what I think you would say.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,260
And I've seen a lot of saucer people.

201
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,020
And, uh, but I can't talk about it, you know, because...

202
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,240
Back in the zoo.

203
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,540
So we just gotta wait, you know, until 1985 and then...

204
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh, yeah.

205
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,080
Freeze those cats in the street.

206
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,320
The crew of the UFO is an especially designed...

207
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,440
Hey, listen to this.

208
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,920
...robot...

209
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,100
Sorry.

210
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,540
...with oil and fire.

211
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,880
Disintegrated, Captain.

212
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,520
Human God.

213
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,580
Oh, yeah.

214
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,080
One more round of turn.

215
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,840
Yeah.

216
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,960
Man.

217
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,800
Women!

218
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,280
Oh, my goodness.

219
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,880
Eig.

220
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,320
Oh.

221
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:24,960


222
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,580
Oh.

223
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,200
Hello?

224
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,000
Everyone makes mistakes.

225
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,820
Let her go, Bob.

226
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,220
Whoa.

227
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,140
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.

228
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,160
But if I saw her now

229
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,180
I'd be a fool

230
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,040
What?

231
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,340
What's the use of pretending?

232
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,820
I can't stand this anymore.

233
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,980
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

234
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,420
Yeah, that's right, Ed.

235
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,660
Short visit.

236
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,640
Poor guy.

237
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,800
Pretty bad, huh?

238
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,200
No, the guy's really a mess.

239
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,860
The beat and it walked up to the epileptic and said,

240
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,980
Oh, I don't hear the music, but no, baby, no.

241
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,080
I hope you like that nonsense.

242
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,660
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment

243
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,080
and they go along with it all just great.

244
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,220
That chatter with the doctor is no phony bit, really.

245
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
It's just the way it happens.

246
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,520
Make me take off my clothes and make me go out normal

247
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,260
and I have to go outside and change before I come here.

248
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,060
Do you love your parents?

249
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,220
Yeah, I love them, but they're...

250
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,640
In countless schools across the land,

251
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,480
mere infants are taught all about contraceptive techniques

252
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,040
and are provided with a plastic phallus in the classroom.

253
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
Well, I don't worship, reefer.

254
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,480
To me, it's just another thing to do.

255
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,080
Hey, Jones, we just got in this African sensimedia hash.

256
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,760
I thought maybe you'd like to smoke some, our father.

257
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,480
Here.

258
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:57,940
Startin' heavy.

259
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,500
How would be thy name?

260
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,940
Are you good?

261
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,540
Are you jaded?

262
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,360
Has all enthusiasm faded?

263
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,240
Me?

264
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,320
Me!

265
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,560
Are you one of those people ?

266
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,860
Shut up! I'm not done talking to you!

267
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,060
Vick?

268
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,540
I don't need a popeee?

269
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,860
I don't need a popeee?

270
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,460
You're triple nuts.

271
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,680
Operates an echo chip.

272
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,740
Resonating fog.

273
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,940
Metaphone.

274
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,220
Something that rather resembles a perfectly silent phone.

275
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,540
I'm getting tired.

276
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,700
I don't know if I can keep up.

277
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,140
But I believe I actually enjoyed it.

278
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,660
To the last mutant.

279
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,740
Mutant.

280
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,580
Mutant.

281
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,640
That's me!

282
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:14,760
Me!

283
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,940
Ape!

284
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,040
Civilized men were so frightened by talking apes.

285
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,680
Let it get away, Doctor.

286
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,880
But how does one control a 400-pound gorilla?

287
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,060
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.

288
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm a doctor, not an animal trainer.

289
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,400
That thing's got the mold as long as my middle finger.

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh, no!

291
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,360
You think the unthinkable.

292
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,980
This radiation is beautiful.

293
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,140
Yes, Doctor, it's beautiful.

294
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,320
Please!

295
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,280
Please!

296
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,220
Please!

297
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,060
Cover your faces!

298
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,080
That's the doomsday bomb.

299
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,800
Do you know what that means?

300
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,360
Do you know what that means?

301
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,200
Do you understand?

302
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,000
Do you understand?

303
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,280
Illusions!

304
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,880
Illusions!

305
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:00,900
Illusions!

306
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,500
Who pretend that aboriginally he was a respectable standing.

307
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:04,980
Hey!

308
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,940
He was no...

309
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,180
Our Slack radio ministry.

310
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,560
Here are the numbers to call.

311
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,560
The old classic number.

312
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,580
823-7490.

313
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,380
Or you can try.

314
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,080
823-8801.

315
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,020
823-8883.

316
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,560
If all numbers are busy...

317
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,820
Well, heck, we won't give that one out yet.

318
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,720
So, 823-7490.

319
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,520
Or 823-8801.

320
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,800
Or 823-8883.

321
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,840
Light up the phone bags for us.

322
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,460
Our Slack radio ministry.

323
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,140
We need gifts for the pledge drive.

324
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,200
And we do have volunteers to take your calls.

325
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,620
That's right.

326
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,220
And not all of this money...

327
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
We're not going to give it to the church of the subgenius.

328
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,560
In fact, none of it does.

329
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:56,200
This is all strictly to keep the station on the air so that you can hear all those other shows that I'm sure some people would rather hear.

330
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,320
Because this is at times a dangerous show to listen to if you're trying to understand exactly what's going on.

331
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,300
You have to listen very closely.

332
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,700
That's the tricky part.

333
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,040
You have to listen very closely.

334
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,620
... so much so that young Master Shemmy, on his very first aboutch, at the very dawn of the day, said,

335
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:14,620


336
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:23,800
seeing himself such and such, when playing with thistle words in a garden nursery, Griefer Trophy or at Fig Street 111 Shovel in Old Holland,

337
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,460
would we go back there now for sounds, pillons and cents?

338
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,340
Would we now for annas and annas?

339
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,700
Would we for full score eight in a Loretta?

340
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,940
For 12 blocks one bob?

341
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
For four testas one gross?

342
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Not for a dean or...

343
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,500
Not for Joe.

344
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,620
Dictated to, of all his little brethren and swisterines,

345
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,760
the first riddle of the universe.

346
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,420
Asking, when is a man not a man?

347
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,940
Telling them, take their time young friars and wait till the tide stops,

348
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,580
for from the first his day was a fortnight.

349
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,020
And offering the prize of a bittersweet crab,

350
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,040
a little present from the past,

351
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,080
for their copper age was yet unminted, to the winner.

352
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,060
One said, when the heavens are quakers.

353
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,740
A second said, when Bohemian lips are the best.

354
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,620
A third said, when he know...

355
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,600
When hold hard a jiffy.

356
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,260
When he is agnostic and determined to.

357
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,220
The next one said, when the angel of death kicks the bucket of life.

358
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,180
Still another said, when the wine's at wit's end.

359
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,380
And still another, when lovely woman stoops to conk him.

360
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,540
One of the littliest said, me me send when papa papa at the harbour.

361
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,400
One of the wittiest said, when he yate ye ablou kooken

362
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,240
and he's mere zee self so sooken.

363
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,100
Still one said, when you are old, I'm grey,

364
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,560
full with sleep.

365
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,960
And still another, when wee dead a walkner.

366
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,840
And another, when he's just only after having been semi-sized.

367
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,040
Another, when, yea, he hath no mananas.

368
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,440
And one, when those pigs they begin now that they will flies up into the luft.

369
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,520
All were wrong.

370
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,600
So Shem himself, the doktator, took the cake,

371
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,380
the correct solution being,

372
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,980
I'll give it up,

373
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,340
when he is a...

374
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,960
yours till the rending of the rocks,

375
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,600
sham.

376
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,940
Shem was a sham.

377
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,740
And a low sham.

378
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,860
And his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs.

379
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,040
So low was he that he preferred Gibson's tea-time salmon,

380
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,880
tinned, as inexpensive as pleasing,

381
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,800
to the plumpest roe-heavy lax,

382
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,740
or the friskiest par of smoked trout that ever was gaffed between Leaslip and Island Bridge.

383
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,020
And many was the time,

384
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,900
he repeated in his bottle-ism,

385
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,900
that no jungle-grown pineapple

386
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,940
ever smacked like the whoppishest sugar out of Ananias's cans,

387
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,900
Finlay's and Galston's,

388
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,000
Callahouse's,

389
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,240
Angans's,

390
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,960
So many great things, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.

391
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,740
That's, um,

392
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,380
that's from Finnegan's Wake.

393
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,720
And it's, uh,

394
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,380
it's a big book.

395
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,520
Great big thick book.

396
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,820
People read it.

397
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,560
They get lost inside of it.

398
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,160
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show.

399
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,880
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show.

400
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,840
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show.

401
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,140
That reach out and lock onto your mind.

402
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,900
That reach out and lock onto your mind.

403
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,060
It's funny, isn't it?

404
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,960
This is, uh,

405
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,920
Reverend D.K. Jones.

406
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,100
Uh, in New Jersey.

407
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Great subgenius.

408
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:27,860


409
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,840
A song called Midnight Ramblin'.

410
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,120
I don't mean just black night.

411
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,920
All right.

412
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,420
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

413
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,340
Yes!

414
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,280
I'm Midnight Ramblin'.

415
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,860
All Midnight Ramblin' faces are not black.

416
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,340
But they're armed.

417
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,460
It is as black as midnight.

418
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm talking to you.

419
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,640
Hold up, men

420
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,320
And women

421
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,400
You bank robbers

422
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
You say so

423
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,740
And you bank robbers

424
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,420
And kidnap

425
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,560
All right

426
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,440
All right

427
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm talking to you

428
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,440
And we got some people in the church

429
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
Yes, sir

430
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,160
Stayed out just as late

431
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,240
As a midnight round

432
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,360
I don't know what time

433
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,920
Brother

434
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,160
Cut in last night

435
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,900
Yeah, brother

436
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,400
Yeah

437
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,740
Yeah

438
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,600
But you haven't told why they had that

439
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,340
Sister Bell, why did they have him at?

440
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,060
He was in jail

441
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:14,120
I thought he was in jail

442
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
Somewhere

443
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,840
Yeah

444
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
In jail

445
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,360
And now, Sister Jordan

446
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,920
Where was your husband?

447
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,260
Where was your husband?

448
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
My husband, he got home last night

449
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,540
And he was in jail

450
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,120
I told him I was in jail

451
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,740
He told me not to tell you

452
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,520
Oh, well, he don't have to tell me

453
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,040
I'm not holding court

454
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,500
So I'm just talking to you

455
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,980
He's got to tell the judge

456
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,620
And the jurors will tell him what to do

457
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,320
Him what to do

458
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,660
Him what to do

459
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,600
Him what to do

460
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,180
Him what to do

461
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,140
Him what to do

462
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,540
Him what to do

463
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:03,980
Him what to do

464
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,640
All right

465
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,220
And in return, if you don't mind

466
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,340
He'll get six dollars

467
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,740
Eight

468
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,480
Ah, ten

469
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,600
I'm talking to you midnight ramblers

470
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,040
Yes

471
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,500
Stay with us tonight

472
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,600
Just to rob and steal

473
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,300
All right

474
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,840
Some of you are so raucous

475
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,640
Come on, come on

476
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,940
Well, you will steal from yourself

477
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,720
All right

478
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,120
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't

479
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,240
Sister Bell, Kate Bell, Kate Bell

480
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,100
Kate Bell, Kate Bell, huh?

481
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,180
Who was left?

482
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,440
Well, I don't know

483
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,800
I don't give out with my sister

484
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,800
Uh-huh

485
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,880
Oh, yes

486
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,600
I'll whip somebody else

487
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,100
But he's got an answer for himself

488
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,860
Yeah, he is

489
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,360
I went out there for him

490
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,040
But he's got to stand for himself

491
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,220
Yeah, he is

492
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,220


493
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,620
I'm sorry

494
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,080
I'm sorry

495
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,360
I'm sorry

496
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,380
Come back

497
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:07,700


498
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,180
Well, I stopped running

499
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,780
I'm not running

500
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:08,900
Hey

501
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:08,920
There was something I couldn't do

502
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,280
Oh, on the ground

503
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,280


504
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,840
After he like

505
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,380
He had it

506
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,500
He didn't

507
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,860
I don't know

508
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,260
I don't remember

509
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,940
Oh, I spent all afternoon

510
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Looking into this

511
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,200
No, no, no

512
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,920
Winning American

513
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:25,960
All right

514
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,380
Let's run

515
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,940
Oh, it's everyone

516
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,980
Last time

517
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,020
I came from there

518
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,020


519
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,180
490. Come on, call us.

520
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,100
Light that sucker up.

521
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,000
Just a little bit of money, friends.

522
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,880
Oh, you're trying.

523
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,980
Can you prove that you can part with

524
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,960
that which has enslaved you, my

525
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,980

which is your wallet, dear friends.

532
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,920
Pull that wallet out and

533
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,560
pull out that credit card.

534
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,580

00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,840
8-8-8-0-1.

550
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,920
Friends. Light it up.

551
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,100
Friends. Light it up. How much?

552
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,980
Oh, yes. Yeah, light that money

553
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,580
out. And when it gets here, for

554
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,960
once, we won't burn it. You know, usually

555
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,840
we at the Church of the Subgenius take

556
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,720
your money and burn it, so a little bit of your

557
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,860
soul smoke floats up

558
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,840
towards heaven, so the aliens in

559
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,840
outer space will know that Earth

560
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
is still worth saving, but

561
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
this time, we'll spend the money on

562
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,380
microphones

563
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,900
and more broadcasts

564
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,260
and more broadcasting equipment for the

565
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,940
station. And not only that, but just

566
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,880
the numbering. Yes, let's have the numbering.

567
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,040
823-8801.

568
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,140
823-8801.

569
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,880
Light it up.

570
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,700
Light it up. Because there's nobody

571
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,100
else in Dallas that is about to play

572
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,020
Captain Beaver.

573
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,500
The black paper between a mirror breaks

574
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,300
my heart.

575
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,480
The moon

576
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,440
frayed through dark velvet lightly

577
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,920
apart.

578
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,620
Steals softly through

579
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,180
sunshine.

580
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,160
Steals softly through snow.

581
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,520
The wild goose flies from winter.

582
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,740
Breaks my heart that I

583
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,700
can't go. Energy

584
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,160
flies through a field.

585
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,520
And the sun softly melts

586
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,500
a nothing wheel.

587
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,560
Steals softly through sunshine.

588
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,780
Steals softly through

589
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,120
snow.

590
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,820
The black paper between a mirror

591
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,640
breaks my heart that I can't go.

592
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,540
The swan and feathers don't roll

593
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,160
their spine.

594
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,240
They live

595
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,880
200 years.

596
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,320
Of love.

597
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,060
They're one.

598
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
Breaks my heart to see the cross

599
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,220
of the sun.

600
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,340
Their bodies fly down.

601
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,240
When the clouds rise their tails down.

602
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,320
Rain Bowls carry the star of the moon,

603
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,920
mix goggles,

604
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
sex Helios.

605
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,600
They fly through the night,

606
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:18,600


607
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,180
Likeuuuueng.

608
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,460
Wait.

609
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,200
If these things help me,

610
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,180
spell this out in thecheckers.estate.

611
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:25,620
There's alsoapprentice.css at gegeben,

612
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:25,620


613
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:25,620


614
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,980
And why?

615
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,880
Record Search Knight,

616
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,640
The black paper between the mirror breaks my heart but I can't go.

617
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,040
Steal softly through sunshine, steal softly through snow.

618
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,000
Everyone rise for the anthem.

619
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,700
Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington, Mesquite.

620
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,100
Lancaster.

621
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,560
Bland Prairie.

622
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
And speaking of Grand Prairie,

623
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,840
ah yes, thank you Michael Wallace for making the first pledge of the K-O-N,

624
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,360
some genius pledge drive.

625
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,280
Well, you gotta call 823-7490

626
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,340
and help us continue to keep our slack and K-O-N in general on the air.

627
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,760
823-7490

628
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:39,680
Ah yes, dear friends, once again, reach down deep and call us up,

629
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,420
offer your credit card number or set up this amazing bank draft system

630
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,800
where they can pull money out of your checking account every month

631
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,780
without you ever having to think about it or maybe ever even knowing about it

632
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,860
if you're drunk enough when you pledge in and you forget about it.

633
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,400
Don't forget that you ever even did it.

634
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,420
823-8801 is our second phone number.

635
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,000
823-8801, we may have a second pledge right now.

636
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,280
Call and pledge now.

637
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,000
823-8801.

638
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
If this is how he wants to go out...

639
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,600
I don't have a way to say it except that I just went out of bullshit.

640
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,120
Yeah.

641
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,320
.

642
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,180
.

643
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,700
.

644
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,380
.

645
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:41,380


646
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,500
Well, I told you

647
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,040
And I don't know what you got to do

648
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,540
But I'm not your picnic cake

649
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,140
Not your picnic cake

650
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,500
I like budget

651
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,180
And I might like a good buffet

652
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,020
But I'm not your picnic cake

653
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,740
Not your picnic cake

654
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
I like budget

655
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,560
And I don't know what you got to do

656
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:34,660
But I'm not your picnic cake

657
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,900
Don't forget the eight

658
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,980
I'd love to go on a picnic

659
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,040
But I'm not an eight

660
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,560
No, I'm not an eight

661
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,300
I'm not a picnic

662
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,380
I'm not a picnic

663
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,700
I'm not a picnic

664
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,040
But there was a giant female subgenius here

665
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,840
To tell you

666
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,040
To hold the show for us

667
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,900
To squeeze out the

668
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,580
Squeeze out the

669
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,200
Call her

670
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,560
You give off a good phone

671
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,480
Hi kids, welcome to Subgenius USA

672
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,180
We don't care if you're single, double, triple, top, duple

673
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,460
Women tuple, sex tuple, septuple, hop tuple

674
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,340
Men tuple, that's a tuple

675
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,640
Disinventionals

676
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,440
This is a special message

677
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,960
That's right

678
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,460
We're not wasting time

679
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,320
We know we're sexist pigs

680
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,560
We know we're all screwed up

681
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,640
Sexist!

682
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,340
Yeah!

683
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,760
We're just sexist pigs

684
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,100
And I don't care who knows it

685
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,460
You can't use those words on the radio

686
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,440
It does not work

687
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
You don't want to use those words

688
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,260
There's too much male energy on your show

689
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,380
You can call us up and tell us we're other stupid or anything

690
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,360
Listen to music

691
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,400
Smell our nader parents

692
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,780
And relax

693
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
And if you're 11

694
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,220
We're really good guys

695
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,220
And we really want the best for all of us

696
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,440
Come here, you grim hawking

697
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,580
Careful not to trip over your own show

698
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,920
Stoke the cauldron higher

699
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,820
If you only realize that we really want you to be happy

700
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,220
Henbane and Nightwart

701
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,620
Drag it to

702
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,400
Even though we are

703
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,240
A little squirt

704
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,960
Sexist

705
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,400
Yeah

706
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,160
Thing

707
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,800
It's the little squirt show

708
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,220
We're the little squirt

709
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,620
That's right

710
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,320
All we do is squirt

711
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,260
No oozing allowed

712
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,680
No

713
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,700
Until someone comes down here and does it for themselves

714
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,000
What a silly show

715
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,380
Yes, if you think you've got a better show

716
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,840
You bring it to the air right now

717
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,340
Throw in the night worm of the dark

718
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,780
You come right down here to

719
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,720
Throw in Mobius' Tethoris

720
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,640
I was going to say KGO

721
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,120
But we're not allowed to use those callers

722
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,400
Or KPFA

723
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,640
Or any of those

724
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,900
KFAT

725
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,860
No, we can't talk about KFAT

726
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,620
No, we can't talk about KFAT

727
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:27,820
No, we can't talk about KFAT

728
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:27,820


729
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:27,820


730
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:27,840
No, we can't talk about KFAT

731
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,680
KPOI

732
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,120
KOR

733
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,760
I don't know

734
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,080
Just write a letter to the station

735
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,920
And completely say

736
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,880
Dr. Hal said the bad word

737
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,240
Yeah

738
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,360
I didn't say anything

739
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,540
And some of those other guys helped

740
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,240
And whoever they are

741
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,600
They should be thrown off the radio

742
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,200
Because they play stuff like this all the time

743
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,900
Hey, I'm clean

744
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,140
I'm innocent

745
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,260
They're trained operators

746
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,520
I demand a fair trial

747
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,340
Reason sketched

748
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,880
That's right

749
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,100
You may play this whole thing

750
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:48,880
Trial by tape

751
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,360
They play old records

752
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,720
And then make trial by tape

753
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,360
All over themselves

754
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,160
Repent

755
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,580
Well, I told you

756
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,120
And I don't know yet

757
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,320
It got through

758
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,600
But I'm not your pink ape

759
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,940
What?

760
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,100
I'm not your pink ape

761
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,720
I'm not your pink ape

762
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,080
I'm not your pink ape

763
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,980
I'm not your pink ape

764
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,400
I live in a luncheon

765
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,580
Where you're eating food for April

766
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm not your picnic ape

767
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,900
That's not your picnic ape

768
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,620
When you go on a picnic

769
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,380
Don't forget the ape

770
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,100
Don't forget the ape

771
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,560
I'd love to go on a picnic

772
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,500
I don't want to go on a picnic

773
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,640
I'm aluminium rod hitting

774
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,980
But I am not an ape

775
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,480
I know I am not an ape

776
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,700
Oh, I'm not an ape

777
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,360
Not me

778
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,220
That's right

779
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,280
I should've said not I

780
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:16,960
I told you that I never could

781
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
Not even gone

782
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,200
You won't go on a picnic

783
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,740
You won't go on a picnic

784
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,880
You won't go on a picnic

785
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,480
Male Moderator 1 Well, that's all right

786
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,900
You got a chance

787
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,260
Hey, hey, hey!

788
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,440
That was quite funny

789
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,200
Oh, yes, dear friends.

790
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:05,640
That band, the guy that does that puts out a magazine that quotes from senile people.

791
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:13,740
He works in an old folks' home, and he records their wisdom and puts out a magazine of it.

792
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:19,040
But he also has this band called the Duplex Players, which we just played.

793
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,700
He records these guys and then uses them as lyrics to these beautiful songs.

794
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,320
So you see, they don't let anything go to waste in America today.

795
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,700
Oh, yes.

796
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,320
Folks, call in with that pledge.

797
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,880
823-7490.

798
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,760
You've got to do it.

799
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,380
You've got to do it.

800
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,280
Otherwise, you'll never hear.

801
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,500
Fill their minds with questions.

802
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,660
Oh, yes.

803
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,980
That's very, very interesting.

804
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,780
That's not interesting at all.

805
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,760
Oh, yes.

806
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,380
That's very, very interesting.

807
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,840
That's not interesting at all.

808
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Oh, yes.

809
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,760
That's very, very interesting.

810
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,660
No, no, no, no.

811
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,780
Oh, yes.

812
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,380
That's very, very interesting.

813
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,260
Oh, yes.

814
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,540
That's very, very interesting.

815
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:08,540


816
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:08,720
That's very, very interesting.

817
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,060
That's very, very interesting.

818
00:38:46,860 --> 00:39:03,200
I think we're very close to isolating the molecules that answer that question.

819
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Oh yes, that's very, very interesting.

820
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,680
Well, look what's coming out of that hole in the ground.

821
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,940
A little bull quirk.

822
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,100
That's very, very interesting.

823
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,120
Do anything musical.

824
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,400
Okay, that's a rather fantastic question.

825
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,540
Very interesting, folks.

826
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,180
Very interesting.

827
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,180


828
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,180


829
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,180


830
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,900
Okay, friends, now the board's just not lighting up.

831
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,840
Now we need to give these numbers out again, and let's have those pledges.

832
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,580
823-7490, friends.

833
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,740
823-8801 and 823-8883.

834
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,760
Remember, you're not just pledging it for Bob.

835
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,580
You're pledging it for the station that keeps Bob on the air.

836
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,640
So let's have that board light up.

837
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,760
Let's have them pledges.

838
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,960
Those $1 pledges.

839
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,560
Those $50 pledges.

840
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,760
Those $100 pledges.

841
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,140
Those $10,000 pledges.

842
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,780
Folks, we only need a few of them.

843
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,460
We only need...

844
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,700
We only need 10 pounds of $100 bills to keep this station going, friends.

845
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,780
We only need six $10,000 pledges.

846
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:18,840
But I'll tell you what, it is getting very serious, and it involves legal situations.

847
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,580
And we're not just asking you to give money for Bob.

848
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,660
In fact, this is one of the few times when we're asking you to give Bob's money to somebody

849
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,140
else.

850
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,540
That's right, friends.

851
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,660
And that's usually against our religion.

852
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,620
That's how serious the situation is.

853
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,700
And this...

854
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,700
Well, you know what happens when this station goes off.

855
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,480
If this station were to go off the air, and these are not hollow threats, man...

856
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,860
And here's Buck Naked with a special offer, friends.

857
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,340
A hot offer for you people to pledge your money.

858
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,180
Okay.

859
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,680
Tell you what.

860
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,700
Do it now.

861
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,000
I want a $20 pledge, and you get a free button.

862
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,820
JR Bob Dobbs.

863
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,620
And I want you to call this special number.

864
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,480
EIEIE.

865
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
823-8883.

866
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,020
823-8883.

867
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,780
Call it in within the next five minutes, and you get that free button with your $20 pledge.

868
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,960
And all the other stuff you get.

869
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,780
What else do they get?

870
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:23,820
They get a newsletter, the KNON newsletter, which is actually not the drab little rag

871
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,640
that you would think.

872
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,480
It's insane.

873
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,360
I've seen it.

874
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,440
It's amazing.

875
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,940
It's entertaining.

876
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:29,600
Yes.

877
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,840
It's actually something you can keep.

878
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,240
It's yours.

879
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,920
It's yours forever.

880
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,100
Forever.

881
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:35,380
Forever.

882
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,660
They get pamphlet number two, right?

883
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,180
Right.

884
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,340
They get subgenius pamphlet number two.

885
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,000
We've got to bring down a whole bunch of the brand new ones.

886
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,280
Well, why don't Buck Naked's special handcrafted church buttons, friends, for the first $20

887
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,420
pledge?

888
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,240
Face of Bob at 823-8883.

889
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,660
That's a special offer pledge.

890
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,820
Call it in now.

891
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,180
Light that second up.

892
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,280
Free bat rides every day.

893
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,040
Howdy, friends.

894
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,820
I'm Lord Jim Cravington for Medieval Motors, your friendly truck stop and transport service.

895
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:01,820


896
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:01,820


897
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:01,820


898
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:01,820


899
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:01,820


900
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,200
For more of this and other great things to come, go to MedievalMotors.com.

901
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,120
We've got the Gryphon, the Minotaur, or the Sporty Little Camel Leopard to suit your imaginary

902
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,940
travel needs.

903
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,080
And, gosh, what can I say about these little guys?

904
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,240
Yes, it's your all-new cardboard Vampirettes, the economy transport that's got them all

905
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,700
guessing on the other side.

906
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,520
We've got continents and peninsulas of new and used transfigurations and a secret rose

907
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,620
garden of perfect values.

908
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,820
So get your ass in gear and your oxen in here so as we can trade indulgences with the best

909
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,000
and get you on your path.

910
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,860
Now, we're just a painful mile off the freeway of lost hope

911
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,320
at the intersection of down and out avenues

912
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,200
in the Citadel of the Angel.

913
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,280
How you doing?

914
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,920
A lot of the good old boys are here tonight.

915
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,620
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

916
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,300
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home,

917
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,620
then try to keep yourselves awake and dial the phone.

918
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,980
Call in for pledges.

919
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,340
Call in for pledges, yes.

920
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,600
We have a lot of our special beauties

921
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,480
answering the phones this evening.

922
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,800
And the best thing you can do

923
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,560
is dial this number that you see on your screen

924
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,320
as quickly as you can

925
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,700
with a contribution to the television mission.

926
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,560
Don't forget to call in a pledge.

927
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,720
Talk about Jesus.

928
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,800
Talk about Jesus?

929
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,980
Well, you never know who's going to be here this evening.

930
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,140
We're waiting for him.

931
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,020
Yes, well, it's one... I know you are, son.

932
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,840
I know it's one of the real positive qualities

933
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,820
of the television mission

934
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,000
is we just never know who's going to drop by

935
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,400
and we just never know who's going to drop by

936
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,440
and we just never know who's going to drop by

937
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,040
and we just never know who's going to drop by

938
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,040


939
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,480
I mean, it's a lot of folks have been...

940
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,040
The band is here.

941
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,060
The band is getting set up.

942
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,820
The band is ready.

943
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,840
The band is ready.

944
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,380
And I'm here to tell you that it's time, ladies and gentlemen.

945
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,780
I want you to hold down your applause as long as you can

946
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,240
because it's time you heard from Red Greenback and the Blue Boys.

947
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,700
Don't forget to call.

948
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,080
The number's on your screen.

949
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,140
The Red Greenback and the Blue Boys

950
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,920
The number's not on your screen.

951
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,080
The number is on your speaker.

952
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:12,260
And that number to call is 823-7490.

953
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,520
And if you don't call, something very, very terrible can happen

954
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,200
not only to you and to the airwaves of Dallas,

955
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,120
but to all the life force which covers this great green globe.

956
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,100
If this station were to have any worse problems than it already does,

957
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,060
it could be pretty bad, friends.

958
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,000
It could be as bad as what happened tonight.

959
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,400
And thank you to Danny Ferguson of Arlington

960
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,100
for your pledge to the sub-G.I.B.

961
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,140
to nothing but continue our great temple.

962
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,220
It's done.

963
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,500
Thank you.

I'm sorry.

977
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,980
They had private eyes, but public fists.

978
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,780
Full tanks, but clean consciences.

979
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,640
And tonight's story is only typical.

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,340
Car Hook.

Starring Dirk Yogurt as Dick Private, Private Dick.

982
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,520
Tonight's chilling story.

983
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,120
Roller Maidens from outer space.

984
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,480
Saturday morning.

985
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,600
I'd just locked myself out of the office for a cool weekend.

986
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,600
I promised to be gin-soaked and hand-rubbed.

987
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,740
At least that's what I figured she'd meant when she said,

988
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,880
Let's get drunk.

989
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,420
Let's get drunk and refinish my furniture.

990
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,720
Anyway, it was the way she said it, you know.

991
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,560
Real husky, like a lead dog in a snow job.

992
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,220
And I wasn't about to be left out in the cold.

993
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,940
Damn nation.

994
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,460
Ah, well, I figured it wouldn't hurt just to answer it.

995
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,860
A private Seamus is always hungry.

996
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,600
I hadn't been exactly flush,

997
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,860
and this might just be the ace in the closet

998
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,540
that put some pizza in the pantry.

999
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,720
Go ahead, something said to me.

1000
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,200
Answer it, she'll wait.

1001
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,400
So I did.

1002
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,900
Only to wind up holding the anchovies in more ways than one.

1003
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,320
Dick Private, Private Detective.

1004
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,500
Ah, Mr. Private.

1005
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,640
That's right, pal.

1006
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,560
My name is Regular Boinklin.

1007
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,040
My wife, Ethel and I have been opposite you for many years on another network.

1008
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,020
Oh, yeah.

1009
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,520
The Ethel and Regulus show. I've heard of you.

1010
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,740
What's the matter? Swallow your car keys?

1011
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,140
No.

1012
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,580
Lock yourself out of the house?

1013
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:53,900
No.

1014
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,380
Want to know how to make an attractive bookend out of a shoebox?

1015
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,600
No, nothing that exciting.

1016
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,860
But look, look, look, you've got to get over here.

1017
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,260
Well.

1018
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:03,980
Right away.

1019
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,780
You're just a couple of channels away.

1020
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,240
You can make it.

1021
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,840
Nobody ever made it before.

1022
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,660
No, come on. It's really weird over here.

1023
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,800
Well, it ain't no Swiss picnic over here, pal.

1024
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,260
But you don't under, under, understand.

1025
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,400
It's terrifying. Nothing is normal.

1026
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:20,900
Well.

1027
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,520
We all seem to be dreaming the same dream.

1028
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,320
Well, that's true.

1029
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:26,360
That's true.

1030
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,560
And there's all these strange balls of light in our neighborhood and...

1031
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:30,960
Hold it.

1032
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:31,920
Glad to.

1033
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,400
Now hold it up to the light.

1034
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:33,960
Oh, okay.

1035
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,420
You was right. This was serious.

1036
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,020
This is serious. This is extremely serious.

1037
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,300
Friends, we need your help.

1038
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,400
I've never seen so much light on these boards lighting up.

1039
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,120
It's not the right kind of light, doctor.

1040
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,020
God, these amiable simps don't...

1041
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,160
It's not the right kind of light. We want that green light.

1042
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,260
We want that light from that money coming in. That's what we want.

1043
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,180
Oh, yes. We want to, we want to...

1044
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:02,940
Friends, you don't know the purity of a 10,000 pound stack of dollar bills.

1045
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,940
That's right, friends.

1046
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,980
Or the savage horror of not having this station on the air.

1047
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:15,980
So let's try again. The numbers are 823-7490, 823-8801, and 823-8883.

1048
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,020
And folks, you get the newsletter, the KNON newsletter, the bumper stickers,

1049
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,620
the free subgenius pamphlet number two.

1050
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,420
That's pamphlet number two, friends.

1051
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,900
That's right. Now, you subgenius members out there that are wondering,

1052
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,440
where's my pamphlet number two? You'll get yours in the mail anyway.

1053
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:41,320
But, oh, ye unsaved out there. Ye unsaved folks that could be, if you could but...

1054
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,560
If you could but pay for this radio station that you're listening to and enjoying right now.

1055
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,280
That's right. You pay for all the rest of them by putting up with the commercials.

1056
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,180
That's right, friends.

1057
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,000
You put up, you pay for all the rest of them by hearing the sound.

1058
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,600
Same thing over and over and over again.

1059
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,620
Things much worse than pledge drives.

1060
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,500
Yes, yes there are worse things than pledge drives.

1061
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:11,180
Friends, we'd like to thank Sherry Williamson-Fort Worth for calling her pledge into the hour of slack.

1062
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,000
Thank you, Sherry. And you people out there that haven't called yet, those numbers one more time.

1063
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,260
823-7490, 823-8801, and 823-8883.

1064
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,000
Just put your finger on the line.

1065
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,140
Just put your finger on the little button and push it.

1066
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:28,200
Music

1067
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,940
Yes, friends, well we're going to go right back on the air in order to...

1068
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,420
In order to ask you to pledge your money to K-N-O-N, friends.

1069
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,620
It's got to happen sooner or later or we'll never stop this show.

1070
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,180
If you don't send money to K-N-O-N, we won't get out of this station.

1071
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,260
The next show won't come on.

1072
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:19,820
We'll keep talking in here until the station disappears, shriveled up by the conspiracy which will sap away the slack.

1073
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,320
And you can stop that conspiracy, friends.

1074
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,900
The slack of...

1075
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,060
The slack of K-N-O-N, friends.

1076
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,240
All you've got to do is give a little bit.

1077
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,660
Reach into that checkbook.

1078
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,640
Shove your hand into that back pocket.

1079
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:34,660
Get out those wallet stretchers and see how far you can stretch that money into the direction of K-N-O-N, friends.

1080
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,420
Cough it up. Cough it up.

1081
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,140
823-7490 or 823-8801.

1082
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,420
Cough it up. Cough it up.

1083
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,600
It was still a little bit...

1084
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,940
When he talked about it, he said this is up in the east.

1085
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,720
And I've got some super vision.

1086
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,380
Anyway, I walked out of the door and looked up in the east and saw this bright star.

1087
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,440
He didn't know what it was.

1088
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:10,360
Barstow didn't know whether it was a star or a planet or a weather balloon or what it was.

1089
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,980
And I walked out there in the backyard in my pajamas.

1090
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,460
I looked at this thing.

1091
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,920
And I saw some people coming out of that.

1092
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,720
And I saw that damn thing.

1093
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,700
Boy.

1094
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,640
Pardon me.

1095
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,440
You saw this thing.

1096
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,940
Was it close by?

1097
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,340
No.

1098
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,660
It was way out there in the east in the sky.

1099
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Well, you could see people in it?

1100
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,300
Yeah.

1101
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,640
He said he had super vision.

1102
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,800
He was out of that thing.

1103
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,000
.

1104
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,780
.

1105
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:41,780


1106
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:41,780


1107
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:41,860
.

1108
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,980
.

1109
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,760
.

1110
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:58,860
.

1111
00:52:59,580 --> 00:52:59,760
.

1112
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,340
.

1113
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:00,360
.

1114
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,380
.

1115
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:00,400
.

1116
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,580
.

1117
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:09,060
Man cannot participate in long space expeditions.

1118
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,160
NASA has scientifically verified and kept very quiet

1119
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,960
the fact that the unstoppable cosmic rays to which every astronaut has been exposed

1120
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,820
destroys brain cells at the rate of 1% every four months.

1121
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,360
Since the neurons of the adult human brain do not...

1122
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,400
Ah, yes.

1123
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,300
Ah, yes.

1124
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,840
Yes, the punches are coming in, and here's Pastor Buck naked with a couple of new ones.

1125
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,460
Mark Shopey.

1126
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,740
Thanks a lot, guy.

1127
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,620
And Sherry Williams.

1128
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:47,920
Fort Worth.

1129
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,380
Williamson.

1130
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,460
Yes, of Fort Worth.

1131
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,440
Thank you very much.

1132
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:50,980
A big help.

1133
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:51,280
All right.

1134
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:51,900
Okay.

1135
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,060
Cheers, like, to Rosalia.

1136
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,740
Thank you, bird.

1137
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,120
Ooh.

1138
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,800
Who are you people that want to talk about...

1139
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,640
About slack, friends?

1140
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,380
There's not going to be any slack tonight until you send that money in.

1141
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,140
You'll get that slack the minute you write the check.

1142
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,840
You'll feel it flowing up through your ballpoint pen into your fingertips.

1143
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,200
This whole show is to give you a beatific vision of slack, friends,

1144
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,400
and I think that, you know, you're going to have to realize

1145
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,520
that the luck plane to slant our way is going to have to have a little...

1146
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,240
A little weight on one end of the slack plane, friends.

1147
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,500
There's a little pile of $10 and $20 bills stacked up here and there.

1148
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,740
You're going to have to go out there and shift that plane.

1149
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,780
Yes, indeed.

1150
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,500
Yes, indeed.

1151
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,380
Hey, dog, you ain't got nothing coming over your TV.

1152
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1153
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,680
Because I love you.

1154
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:40,960
How fun.

1155
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:41,980
Forever.

1156
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,700
Something wrong with Dad.

1157
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,480
Something wrong with you.

1158
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,000
You.

1159
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:49,940
You.

1160
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:50,940
You.

1161
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:51,140


1162
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:51,340
You.

1163
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:51,560
You.

1164
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:51,900
You.

1165
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,400
You.

1166
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:52,480
You.

1167
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:52,780
You.

1168
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,180
You.

1169
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:53,200


1170
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:53,740


1171
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:56,800


1172
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,820
You.

1173
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,560
You.

1174
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:02,320
You.

1175
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,320


1176
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,380
You.

1177
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,400
You.

1178
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,340
You.

1179
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,120
Hans, oh Hans! Hans, you are my lover.

1180
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,960
Hans, Hans!

1181
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,520
He is my lover!

1182
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:13,820
My lover!

1183
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,880
What?

1184
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,160
Something wrong with you.

1185
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,480
Something wrong with you.

1186
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,860
You!

1187
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,880
Fast, bring it, change!

1188
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,760
You! A revolution!

1189
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,140
What is wrong?

1190
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,260
This is a revolution!

1191
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,440
Revolution!

1192
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,460
Revolution!

1193
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,320
Stop that!

1194
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,820
Don't do that!

1195
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:04,920
Stop that!

1196
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,200
Stop that!

1197
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,320
Stop that!

1198
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,600
And I am going off for a beer.

1199
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,640
Forget it. Forget it.

1200
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:48,680
But...

1201
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,300
The bird just isn't there.

1202
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,680
The bird just isn't there.

1203
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,900
Gone he was here.

1204
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,260
In heaven again.

1205
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:55,820
Now a planet.

1206
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,280
In the fear of the dead.

1207
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,300
See you in heaven again.

1208
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,000
Red, red, the red.

1209
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,560
God, rot the sucker, rot your hair.

1210
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,160
You wanna be lonely?

1211
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:04,820
No.

1212
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,480
Go without me.

1213
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,540
You.

1214
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,040
I love you.

1215
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,520
I love everybody, honey.

1216
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,280
I love you so.

1217
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,760
I like everybody to be happy.

1218
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,620
I love it.

1219
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,840
I give you them a...

1220
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,260
The genie in there make it happen, I tell you.

1221
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,660
God, you're the lord.

1222
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,720
You're the lord.

1223
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,280
Keep to me talking.

1224
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,820
Keep talking to me singing.

1225
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,540
I love you.

1226
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,080
I love you.

1227
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,720
I love you.

1228
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,220
You're the way he is.

1229
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:41,940
You're the way he is.

1230
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:43,940
Why?

1231
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,480
Everybody a rat.

1232
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,820
I ask everybody to believe.

1233
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,580
That's a thing.

1234
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,220
That's a thing.

1235
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,880
Well, in the Bible,

1236
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,400
they say

1237
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,940
we were speaking in tongues.

1238
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,220
Tongues.

1239
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,560
I am a rat!

1240
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,420
A rat!

1241
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,300
Just a rat!

1242
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:09,800
Just a rat!

1243
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,980
Just a rat!

1244
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,220
Let's go, girls.

1245
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,640
The time is special.

1246
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,160
Nowhere else.

1247
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,260
I mean the time

1248
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,140
I hold you.

1249
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,060
Amen, praise the Lord.

1250
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,520
There's a revolution

1251
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,600
going on.

1252
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,100
And it's to them.

1253
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,140
Yes, friends.

1254
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,620
Yes, friends.

1255
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:44,560
Bob does love you.

1256
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,460
And he'll love you more

1257
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,020
if you'll join that pledge drive right now.

1258
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,880
Dr. Stang, would you please

1259
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:50,840
give out the numbers?

1260
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,520
Yes, friends, that's

1261
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,300
823-7490.

1262
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,180
And get your pencil

1263
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,100
because there's another one.

1264
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,260
823-8801.

1265
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,740
That's right.

1266
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,180
And there's one more.

1267
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,940
If you want to hear more bizarre, demonic sounding music

1268
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,380
from the airwaves

1269
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,420
or the inspirational, beautiful,

1270
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,400
classical

1271
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,380
songs of Bob,

1272
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,500
why, you have to call

1273
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,420
823-8801.

1274
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,760
823-8883, doctor.

1275
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,880
Or, doctor,

1276
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:32,520
821-8579.

1277
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:34,560
But especially,

1278
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,220
823-7490.

1279
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:37,980
Call in and deposit

1280
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,400
the money.

1281
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:38,400


1282
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:38,400


1283
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,480
That earthly check.

1284
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,540
That offering.

1285
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,440
That pledge.

1286
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,380
All you have to do is promise it right now.

1287
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,140
It's a non-pledge. You can't lose.

1288
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,300
You're pledging it to KNOA and it's a non-pledge.

1289
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,820
Ah, yes, friends. And it's so sad because our time

1290
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,000
is already running out when we hear that music

1291
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,260
at the end of these shows.

1292
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,480
But, doctor, we've got a $40 pledge we have to give credit for.

1293
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,060
Oh, yes.

1294
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:01,740
Ah, yes. Wendell Scott of Dallas, thank you so much.

1295
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,960
And may slack flow through your body.

1296
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,040
May slack drip down your spine

1297
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,000
and out every

1298
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,500
side of your pants.

1299
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,380
Oh, friends. Oh, friends.

1300
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,160
We have to leave you for the next religion and so...

1301
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,000
And so,

1302
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,840
as we sign off, once again,

1303
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,680
friends, send that money to

1304
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,740
KNON and to the Church of the

1305
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,780
Subgenius for the Home for Slackless

1306
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,820
Children because that money keeps those

1307
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,600
we hate starving to death.

1308
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,960
And, uh, uh,

1309
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,940
get your pencils ready because we'll be reading

1310
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,020
our address for information

1311
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:36,020
here coming up at the

1312
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,500
end of the broadcast.

1313
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,300
Oh, yes, this has been

Pastor Buck Naked, Buddy West,

1316
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,900
and the folks who will be taking over

1317
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,040
the show next week, Batman himself.

1318
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,620
Ah, yes.

1319
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,140
He'll play the amazing tapes. Oh,

1320
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,260
friends. And that's

1321
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,980
the Church of the

1322
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,180
Subgenius.

01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,240
Yeah, or call

1331
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:13,820
That's money.

1332
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,400
Oh,

1333
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,440
yes, dear friends, it's so

1334
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,300
beautiful to

1335
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,820
God to see that

1336
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,780
phone line light

1337
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,880
up. Ah, there it is.

1338
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,120
Yes, more $40 pledges.

1339
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,360
More paper slack.

1340
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,780
Paper slack. We all need slack,

1341
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,020
friends. Slack in the face

1342
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,760
of the hideous conspiracy

1343
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,780
that tries to shut down anything

1344
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,420
that tries to talk

1345
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
about the things that they

1346
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,180
don't want anyone

1347
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,740
to talk about. Stop them.

1348
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,840
Oh, stop them. That's what they try

1349
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,240
to do.

1350
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,040
Ah, thank you, dear friends.

1351
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,860
Drinking Budweiser

1352
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,060
Drinking Budweiser

1353
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,020
Drinking Budweiser

1354
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,940
on TV

1355
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,180

1359
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,300
The day my coon dog

1360
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:16,840
died

1361
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,940
Reading the pamphlet

1362
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,980
Reading the pamphlet

1363
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,220
over and over

1364
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:26,260
again

1365
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,600
I was

1366
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,840

1367
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,200

1368
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,320
and Bob was on

01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,120
the TV

1370
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,920
The day that Uncle

1371
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,820
and Bob was on the TV

1372
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,220
got kicked

1373
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,840
by a mule

1374
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,720
by a mule

1375
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,760
I was with cousin

1376
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,500
Junior

1377
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:54,060
The DNA

1378
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,420
backfired

1379
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:55,600
backfired

1380
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,920
I was drunk

1381
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,220
I was drunk

1382
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:02,220


1383
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,440
I was plastered

1384
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,220
I was drunk

1385
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,200
I was drinking Budweiser

1386
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,740
I was drunk in Budweiser

1387
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,100
And Bob was on TV

1388
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,720
