1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:09,700
I haven't thought of you in 15 days and today I still won't think of you.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,600
And when I call you up and you're not home, well I might not even care.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,180
Every day gets better than the one before cause every day I know that I'm fine without you.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,380
But I don't think about it, this one is not about you.

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,200
You can put that in your pipe and smoke it, this one is not about you.

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,140
Maybe you can take that to the bank and shove it up your big fat ass.

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,440
Every time I ride past your house I forget it's you who's living there.

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,420
Anyway I never see your face cause your window's up too high.

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,100
And I saw you shopping at the grocery store but I was far too busy.

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,660
With my car to notice.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,200
You weren't looking at me, this one is not about you.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,020
You can put that in your pipe and smoke it, this one is not about you.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,000
Maybe you can take that to the bank and shove it up your big fat ass.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,860
Music.

15
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,300


16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:21,980
Music.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,900
Music.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,100
Music.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,680
Music.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,340
Music.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:25,680
Music.

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,260
Music.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,480
Music.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,480


25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,660
Music.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,080


27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,560
Music.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,060
Music.

29
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,140
Music.

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,140


31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,140


32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,560
Add it on a tape and tape you gotta maybe have your hands up.

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,580
Was it mention about me or the other?

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,140
Was it mention about me or the other?

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,980
It could be whether I'm not even close to being close.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,880
Yeah it could be.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,600
It could be something like this.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,600


39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,040
It must be.

40
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,060
As VK has done with the lyrics, maybe he is telling the truth.

41
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,060


42
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,060


43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,040
to the bank, shove it up

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,460
your big fat ass.

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,740
Well, you gotta watch out.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,820
This could lead to dancing.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,900
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,320
Hello.

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,960

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800

most important part is this.

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,520
Stopped into a church

144
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,520
The amino acids will also be there

145
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
and nowhere else forever

146
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
except other

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,420
subgenius live stage shows

148
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,200
Before that, an old Bob

149
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,520
and Kirsten

150
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:58,580
Connie clip from MST3000, titles by The Large, and the song that started the show out, Not About You,

151
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,300
was by Jonathan Colton from his Thing-A-Week project, the third disc, I think. Colton, by the

152
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:16,400
way, is spelled C-O-U-L-T-O-N, no relation to Colter. Another song by him listing all of the U.S.

153
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,880
presidents and their accomplishments is also coming up. You know, friends, after two months

154
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,780
of not doing a weekly show, it's been a bit of a challenge to get back in the swing of it, but

155
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:35,040
swing we shall. We have enough new music by unsigned and unsignable bands, and we still

156
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,000
have recordings from two major devivals that haven't been exploited, Starwood and the New

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,320
York City Devival, but the latter has a ton of cussing, and I'm running late, so I think that

158
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:55,220
for this show, number 1,299, we'll start using the Starwood recordings and mash them up with

159
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:02,600
a bunch of mashups. This will be the mashiest-upped show in a long time. And so...

160
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,320
Let's take another caller here. You're on the air.

161
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,040
Hey, Rob. Princess Wee. Princess Wee. I need to hear from you.

162
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,120
What was I thinking?

163
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,900
That's okay. That's okay.

164
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,020
I was trying to rob the bank. Yes, I was trying to rob the bank. That's right.

165
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,600
It had nothing to do with you, Dr. Sinister.

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
Nothing whatsoever.

167
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:34,420
Nothing at all. I just wanted to give a report, because we're celebrating...

168
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,400
Drinking Pink Lady.

169
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:44,240
We're drinking Pink Lady in celebration of the best Starwood I've been into for at least five years.

170
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,280
Well, that is great to hear. And it's

171
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,140
funny you should mention drinking Pink Lady, because I played a track called Pink Lady Lemonade.

172
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,920
Yes, well, Starwood was really successful. We had a beautifully attended subgenius

173
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,640
defiable. We thought that... Princess Wee and I had thought that as organizers, we'd be faced with

174
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:13,620
days of brutal heat and putting out fires. But instead, the volunteers had the whole machine

175
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,380
running just fine by the time we got there. Very well.

176
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,740
So we got to spend half the time in air-conditioned comfort and the other half frolicking and

177
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,900
lighting fires.

178
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,280
There you go.

179
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,620
And it was a new location. It's gorgeously beautiful. It looks like it should have dinosaurs

180
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,300
running around in it, like Jurassic Park. And it is full of cave...

181
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,640
Speaking of dinosaurs, did Hal go to Starwood?

182
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,360
No. No, but lots of old hippies did. And you can call some of them dinosaurs. And I think

183
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,360


184
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,360


185
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,060
they're pretty cool.

186
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,040
Hal actually was performing at the Museum of Natural History in New York City.

187
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah, so he was working with dinosaurs.

188
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,180
So he was working with dinosaurs. But yes, we were working with another sort of dinosaurs

189
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,740
at Starwood.

190
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,680
I heard Wee-steria was a fun place.

191
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,180
Wee-steria?

192
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,380
Yes, that was a typo that I made. I may not even have told you about it yet.

193
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,660
No! You didn't tell me about that.

194
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,780
Wee-steria Campground is the site of Starwood. And it turned out to be just right. You know,

195
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,640
it was scary because we had six months to find a new location and scope it out and dare

196
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,600
it to work. And it did. It worked just fine.

197
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,820
It did! It was a miracle.

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,760
There were pterodactyls flying overhead and hippopotamides spouting water up out of the

199
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,220
pond. A filtered water pond.

200
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,020
Incredible.

201
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,300
Yeah.

202
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,640
And it's a real pretty place. It is a long drive. It's four hours from Cleveland.

203
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,920
Well worth it. Well worth it.

204
00:10:52,460 --> 00:11:01,160
And it's not in the middle of nowhere. It's in the middle of a cool cannibal redneck town

205
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:07,060
where they have these friendly people and little barbecue places. They're ready to,

206
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,680
if you stay there for very long and have a meal or two, you're going to be the meal for

207
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,640
the rest of the clan.

208
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,040
And there also are Amish and Mennonite folks around. So it's very similar to the brushwood

209
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,820
that we're used to. That kind of area. So hot though.

210
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,480
Hot enough to smell the livestock?

211
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:39,140
It was, yeah, there, you could smell some of the naked seniors, if true. And just as

212
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,620
at X Day, there's no rules.

213
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:41,620


214
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:48,960
There's no rules against feeding the naked seniors. But if you do that, you know, they'll

215
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,880
be attracted to you and they'll hang around.

216
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:51,600
Yeah.

217
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,880
Sick.

218
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,640
We had to be firm with the naked senior hippies.

219
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,000
It's a good thing you only had a limited number of subgenie there compared to the general

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,940
population. I mean, one of the horrors of X Day is you have these mutants and these

221
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,620
animals and people feed alcohol to these animals. That is frightening. Which is a little bit

222
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:11,840
of a surprise to you.

223
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,740
Well, it's the only time of the year that we let the beasts out of the cage, you might

224
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:28,660
say. Whereas it's true at Starwood, it's just, it's really a bigger zoo. It's a huge menagerie

225
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,840
of all kinds.

226
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,740
Indeed. That's a well said statement.

227
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,560
It's not Burning Man. And no one's being sued and nobody gets killed.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Yeah.

229
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:50,040
It's a lot easier. And it's no X Day because at X Day, everybody gets complete and utter

230
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,900
total slack.

231
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,680
Oh, yes.

232
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,720
It's in between Burning Man and X.

233
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,580
There's a much bigger variety of kinds of people at Starwood.

234
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,380
People, yeah, sure. People, yeah.

235
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,900
Well, I'm talking about different colored skins of people and so on.

236
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,600
There's a lot of weird...

237
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,020
Weirdos.

238
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,700
Yeah.

239
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,440
And some of them don't wear their shirts, including the females. That's a big attraction

240
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,200
at any of these kinds of festivals, I would say.

241
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,900
Yes, indeed.

242
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,500
I'm really excited about this next... I hesitate to call him an entertainer. I'm even more

243
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:40,180
nervous to call him a prophet, though he does profit bringing stuff up. My goodness gracious,

244
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:47,820
this man has meant a lot to me over the years. He's a beautiful man. He's a strange, very

245
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:53,260
strange man. So strange, in fact, that he had to start his own religion when I was

246
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,620
one.

247
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:02,580
Congratulations, gentlemen, to the electrical, the electrical, the normal, and the fortunate,

248
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,840
the one and the fortunate, the only Trevor Snyder!

249
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,920
Yeah!

250
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,620
Bravo!

251
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:15,620


252
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
I have...

253
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh my god, that was very, very nice of you guys.

254
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,320
What's up?

255
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,860
I have to say, I've come to just say thank you, man.

256
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:39,500
Speaking of which, that is Eric Pompao, the director of The Athletic, there's a good use

257
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,160
of her out there.

258
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,060
department but we have to do this to prove well when the aliens up above

259
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,840
smell the smoke of the burning dollar bill there no there's still somebody

260
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,680
down here on earth worth saving ah and there's still enough of it left to spend

261
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,280
see we may be subgeniuses but we're not totally stupid totally are there any

262
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,200
weirdos here tonight what what a surprise oh did there happen to be any

263
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,560

265
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:25,500
tell me praise Bob oh that sounds good now we can get going

266
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,700
ha ha ha star this is a different star wood for one thing it's late at night I

267
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,020
normally do this in the afternoon I can't see y'all's faces

268
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,160
I can't hear you it's different not like that jacket I'm wearing it tonight

269
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,360
I imagine by now most of you have either seen that movie avatar or you've seen

270
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,540
enough commercials that you more or less know what it's like I have a one-sentence

271
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:06,320
review of the movie avatar my first star wood that's my one-sentence review and

272
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,000
and you know what I'm saying I'm not going to lie to you I'm not going to lie to you

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,140
I thought this scene was going to be a different story than you do on drowned

274
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,260
Republican you know your first is always your best or your favorite my

275
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:19,680
first star way it was in 1990 at Brushwood and back then they didn't have

276
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,260
a stage at all they didn't have a pool there were I don't think there were

277
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,320
showers or flush toilets and yet it still went great it was what was a

278
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,220
a wonderful Starwood.

279
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,280
I had an incredible time and I've been

280
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,380
back 20 times since then.

281
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,300
And will

282
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,780
continue to do so.

283
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,120
Now there was no huge video

284
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,320
crew there and there were a lot fewer people.

285
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,360
And this Starwood,

286
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,080
there's not a huge video

287
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,240
crew and there's fewer people

288
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,120
so maybe this will be my

289
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,280
best Starwood yet! Praise

290
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,240
Bob! Praise Starwood!

291
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,260
Praise Reverend Fat Mandy

292
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,000
and her band that was just

293
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
up here. She performed at X Day

294
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,140
last week, but the less said

295
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:05,800
about that the better.

296
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,740
I'm going to do what I

297
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,180
usually do here, kind of

298
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,340
a three part program.

299
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,940
First I'm going to give you,

300
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,080
for those who have

301
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,200
not yet comprehended

302
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,160
the Church of the Subgenius,

303
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,240
I mean it's a no brainer,

304
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,020
I will give us kind of a

305
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,980
truncated, actually it's a new version of

306
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,120
Subgenius 101.

307
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,540
There is no Subgenius 102.

308
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,980
Then I will make

309
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,460
fun of the Starwood program

310
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,900
book. That's one of my

311
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,800
that's always really

312
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,380
easy. And

313
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,560
if we can we'll do a

314
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,000
question and answer thing towards the end too.

315
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,260
Meanwhile,

316
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,720
now see I

317
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,740
can't see

318
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,800
you and I can't make eye contact with

319
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,840
anybody so I'm

320
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,380
just going to go ahead and read this thing.

321
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,660
I'm not even going to try to pretend I memorized it.

322
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,740
Do people think you're strange?

323
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,360
Are you damn normal?

324
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,000
Are you different?

325
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,240
Do you urinate?

326
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,520
Then you're sure to be interested in this

327
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,480
my friends. If you're ready

328
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,680
to slide down the cutting edge

329
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,380
then make noise and praise Bob!

330
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

331
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,340
Not bad. Oh they're from all over the

332
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,300
campground distance stereo.

333
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,940
That's good.

334
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,980
The Church of the Subgenius friends,

335
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,280
it's where today's wisecracks are

336
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,720
tomorrow's divine revelations.

337
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,260
The world's first

338
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,960
industrial church

339
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,920
tipping sacred cows

340
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,220
since 1953.

341
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,300
Instant instructions for

342
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,240
those who follow no master.

343
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,160
And the perfect

344
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,920
self validating

345
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,980
philosophy by which everything

346
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,100
you know is true.

347
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,420
It's been

348
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,300
called the Zorro of world

349
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,980
religion, scratching a bloody

350
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,380
B-O-B on the beefy seat

351
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,260
of the conspiracy. Actually you can

352
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,240
skip the O, just do a B on either side.

353
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,280
The divinity school

354
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,240
of hard knocks.

355
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,060
Peripheral visionaries saving

356
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,160
souls from themselves

357
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,260
and providing something

358
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,180
no other religion offers. Eternal

359
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,280
salvation or triple

360
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,600
your money back.

361
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,680
Of course you have to spend the money first

362
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,020
and you can be ordained at that massive

363
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,300
sales table over there

364
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,360
for only $30.

365
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,380
Price could go up

366
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,480
any second now.

367
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,340
But yes it's true, if we don't live forever

368
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,360
in this religion, we get our money

369
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,460
back. Just think about that.

370
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,400
That's not a bad deal. There's only

371
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,520
three things you need to really understand

372
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,220
about the Church of the Subgenius.

373
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,840
That's Bob,

374
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,000
slack,

375
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,060
and the conspiracy.

376
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,920
And whether

377
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,200
you're saved or unsaved, we

378
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,220
always need reminders about those basics.

379
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,200
Now, who is

380
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,940
this man Bob so many ask?

381
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,320
Friends,

382
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,200
to sell a

383
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,120
religion, you don't need

384
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
all the answers. You just need

385
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,240
one good answer.

386
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,180
And J.R. Bob Dobbs

387
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,200
is the answer that didn't wait around for a

388
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,240
question. The key to the gateway

389
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,340
is his pipe, God, Ecclesiastes 3

390
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,140
14. Bob

391
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,600
Dobbs is our self-fulfilling

392
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,300
prophet. Strange and

393
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,380
wondrous things happen when Bob's around.

394
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
The blind hear, the deaf

395
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
see, false teeth get

396
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,680
swallowed. Poor families

397
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,460
win the lottery. Enemies

398
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,300
drop dead from laughing themselves

399
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,260
to death. Strange

400
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,820
Rube Goldberg type

401
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,300
contraptions spring up around him.

402
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,180
For instance, like if he needs a

403
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,320
shoeshine or something.

404
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,560
Now Bob's not smart.

405
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,660
In fact, he doesn't plan

406
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,940
anything. He just automatically

407
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,260
tunes in on the plan that's already there.

408
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,320
He doesn't think.

409
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,420
You don't use your mind to think

410
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,220
about your religion. He just simply

411
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,560
knows and yet he's continuously

412
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,540
forgetting it.

413
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,300
He only sells and never

414
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,960
buys. He's an

415
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,780
economic monopole, a kind of a singularity

416
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,380
that could power a universe.

417
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,460
And yet he doesn't

418
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,200
actually do anything.

419
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,060
The universe does

420
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,280
things for Bob. Or

421
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,940
it does him.

422
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,060
Or he always does

423
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,320
the wrong thing perfectly.

424
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,280
Because what Bob has

425
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,600
is far more powerful

426
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,300
than the brains. What Bob

427
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,040
has is luck.

428
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,760
Brains have

429
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,300
phooey. In his left

430
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,240
brain there's nothing right and in his right

431
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,820
brain there's nothing left.

432
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,360
And here's another thing.

433
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,800
Bob will not

434
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,960
solve all your problems.

435
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,300
But he will help you

436
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,880
to blow them off.

437
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,060
And you

438
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,860
cannot use him as a crutch

439
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,080
because he's already using

440
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,500
you as a crutch.

441
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,900
He replaces

442
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,540
the drugs.

443
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,380
Just looking at the dots that comprise

444
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,320
his face. So

445
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,560
many brain cells just like using the drugs.

446
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,180
He's the Chinese

447
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,160
finger trap of the mind

448
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,280
my friends. But most important

449
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,720
thing is that he is a short

450
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,280
duration personal savior.

451
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,160
Or Shordirpersav in the

452
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
original Tibetan.

453
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,220
This is a society of

454
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,040
planned obsolescence. You know

455
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
when you buy that computer

456
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,040
it's going to go out the day

457
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,740
after the warranty.

458
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,140
So

459
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,280
Bob recognized the need for

460
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,220
revolving messiahs.

461
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Anything could be your short

462
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,200
duration personal savior. Whatever you need right then.

463
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,080
You may be your own personal

464
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,080
savior. You might be

465
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,060
somebody else's.

466
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,020
And for that matter

467
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,080
a lot of subgeniuses are loners.

468
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,100
And the great thing about

469
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,320
Bob, he's not one of these saviors

470
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,340
that's always breathing down your neck

471
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,220
going, did you pray to me?

472
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,480
You didn't sin or nothing did you?

473
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,020
No. No you can be

474
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,380
alone

475
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,760
with Bob.

476
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,580
Just think about that.

477
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,260
No maybe you shouldn't think about it.

478
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,300
Anyway he doesn't care about your sins.

479
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:20,640
He doesn't want to

480
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,460
forgive your sins

481
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,880
but to rationalize your sins my friends.

482
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,140
He brings not forgiveness but an excuse.

483
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,240
And you may now as of this

484
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,140
moment do anything you

485
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,700
want.

486
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,240
You want your sins forgiven?

487
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,640
Well do it yourself.

488
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,160
If you're a subgenius you're probably already pretty good at doing that.

489
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,820
Jesus

490
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,620
praise Jesus

491
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,600
Jesus may have died for your sins

492
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,920
but J.R. Bob Dobbs made a

493
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,620
damn fool of himself

494
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:50,740
to stand up for the

495
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:50,740


496
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,440
For your sins.

497
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,460
So he said,

498
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,840
Bob said, I won't tell you what to do.

499
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,520
I'll only tell you how to think.

500
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,120
And you will pay to know what you really think.

501
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,460
And it's so true friends.

502
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,980
Bob sold it, I smoked it,

503
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,800
that settles it.

504
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,100
It's that simple.

505
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,820
He's known for many pithy aphorisms

506
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,480
that you'll see on bumper stickers

507
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,280
also available at the sales table.

508
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,280
Uh, his most

509
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,640
famous saying is

510
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,260
the only law of the church of the

511
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,140
subgenius, the only rule. Pardon my

512
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,900
language kids, but the

513
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,140
one rule of the church of the subgenius is

514
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,180
fuck them if they

515
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,920
can't take a joke.

516
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,780
And uh

517
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,040
he also said the subgenius

518
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,120
must have slack. He said

519
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,120
choose the way you're gonna be screwed

520
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,180
because they're gonna screw you anyway

521
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,380
but some ways are fine.

522
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,020
If you act

523
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,880
like a dumb shit

524
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,160
they will treat you as

525
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,820
an equal.

526
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,180
So pull the wool over your own eyes and relax

527
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,860
in the safety of your own delusions

528
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,880
because too much is always

529
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,500
better than not enough.

530
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,300
Don't just eat that hamburger

531
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,000
eat the hell

532
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,880
out of it!

533
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,120
And the stupider it looks

534
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,380
the more important it probably is.

535
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,260
Science does not remove the

536
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,280
terror of the gods and I don't

537
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,140
practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person

538
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,820
I'm preaching to.

539
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,100
These are all things that Bob said. He also

540
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,220
said I can't lie but

541
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,840
I promise that I will.

542
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,880
And he asked the question

543
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,060
who died and made me

544
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,420
God?

545
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,780
And finally he said

546
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,280
I'll find myself when they pry me out of

547
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,380
my cold dead fingers and pry my cold

548
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,240
dead fingers out of my other cold

549
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,420
dead fingers.

550
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,560
So um

551
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,980
oh and life after death

552
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,160
why wait?

553
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Now that's Bob! Here's the

554
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,900
number two thing you need to know about Bob.

555
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
His promise. His promise of

556
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,280
slack. Now what is

557
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,160
slack? Well the great thing about that is

558
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,200
it is totally indefinable by

559
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,780
everyone except you!

560
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,820
Because it's different for each person.

561
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,020
Totally unfettered by common

562
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,680
sense. Slack is like

563
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,500
something for nothingness.

564
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:11,980
It's

565
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,880
whatever works for you.

566
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,940
If nothing works

567
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,700
let it.

568
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,720
Uh

569
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,560
because the point is

570
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,960
friends you believe it or not

571
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,200
already have the

572
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,360
slack. But you may not have

573
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,060
appreciated it yet.

574
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,320
You have more slack than you can

575
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,140
appreciate until

576
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,540
it's taken away.

577
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,120
Tricky how that works. You

578
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,220
have it all. You just

579
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,060
haven't believed it

580
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,820
yet.

581
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,000
You make the slack by making

582
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,240
the slight effort to

583
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,280
notice the slack that's already

584
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,000
there. As our

585
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
friend Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

586
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,220
said, just when you think

587
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
you're along for the ride, you look down

588
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,280
and realize the steering wheel is in

589
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,180
your hands.

590
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,060
So slack

591
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,220
you might say is the state

592
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,880
in which you need

593
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,180
nothing because you have it

594
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,700
already.

595
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,840
Slack is always new.

596
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,500
Always improved. Slack

597
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,060
can only be sold. It

598
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,540
cannot be bought.

599
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,100
And yet you find some

600
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,620
people who are literally working

601
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,120
too hard for slack. Trying to smoke the

602
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,060
pot of slack at the end of the rainbow.

603
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,880
The conspiracy had started

604
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,900
making the term slacker popular

605
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,980
meaning a lazy

606
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,220
indolent person. And that's fine

607
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,340
but slack is not the same

608
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,000
as laziness. It can be

609
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,780
frenzied over work.

610
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,580
I happen to be an emergentile

611
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,620
subgenius and

612
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,360
this is my slack.

613
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,760
Then there's

614
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,780
involuntary slack

615
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,140
which is when some disaster

616
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,280
comes along or what seems to be a

617
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,380
disaster but you later realize

618
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,100
that it snapped you out of a rut

619
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,580
and was the best thing that ever happened to you.

620
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,760
So

621
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
the fact that the conspiracy

622
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,740
keeps pushing false

623
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,060
slack on you means that

624
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,340
somewhere there is real slack.

625
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,120
And how do you find your own slack?

626
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,360
Well Bob said you should follow the path

627
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,260
of least resistance.

628
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,280
Surf the luck

629
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,180
plane. Because slack can

630
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,100
come when you throw good money after bad

631
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,180
and bad money after Bob. Praise Bob.

632
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,240
The goal

633
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,300
of the church for each

634
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,240
individual is the casting out

635
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,180
of false profits.

636
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,260
Now before you

637
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,020
go unmasking false

638
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,300
profits right and left you might want

639
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,880
to peel off that thing

640
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,300
you've got super glued to your own face.

641
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,280
But the

642
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,200
conspiracy as

643
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,260
we call it is like a factory

644
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,140
of false profits churning out

645
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,180
the occasional major asshole and

646
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,060
thousands of private assholes

647
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,160
to do their bidding.

648
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,980
Now we're not talking about all the

649
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,180
trendy conspiracies that you may have

650
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,880
heard about on late night radio.

651
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,100
JFK assassination area

652
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,200
51. Masonic

653
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,980
Satanic Pagan Jew

654
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,080
Illuminati

655
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,120
conspiracy. So this is

656
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,300
much much bigger than liberals

657
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,460
versus conservatives.

658
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
How many

659
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,960
conspiracies does it take

660
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,880
to oppress all subgeniuses

661
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,240
everywhere for all of history?

662
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080
Only one.

663
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,440
It only takes one. The conspiracy

664
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,160
of the normal people.

665
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,140
The normal people.

666
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,600
Sheep in wolves clothing.

667
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,740
There's so many little tiny conspiracies

668
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,140
there's bound to be one

669
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,300
just for you. But the big

670
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,220
conspiracy is part

671
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,400
of the very air we breathe.

672
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,820
It's even part of you and me.

673
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,860
It's the con. The code of

674
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,340
reality. The con is an attitude

675
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,520
of pinkness.

676
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,740
Of yearning for cuteness,

677
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,120
corniness. The eagerness

678
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,220
to obey. Hatred of

679
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,340
everything real and worst of all disbelief

680
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,760
in Bob.

681
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,060
The conspiracy doesn't have to

682
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,000
get most people cause they've

683
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,700
been had all along.

684
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,320
They're safe as a lobster

685
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
in a seafood restaurant tank.

686
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,320
As Bob

687
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,200
pointed out, you know how dumb

688
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,980
the average guy is.

689
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,360
Well by definition half of them

690
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,580
are even dumber than that.

691
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,180
And so we have as many

692
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
nasty names for them as they have

693
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,960
for us. We call them the pink boys.

694
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,380
The mediocratons. The somnambulax.

695
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,560
The ace souls.

696
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,180
The cage men.

697
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,380
Incomputes. Mole people.

698
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,040
Proleteratorials.

699
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,540
Hilers and smilers.

700
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
Sloths and moths. Barbies and

701
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,680
Kens, cons and johns,

702
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,980
corpulators and so forth. And the sad

703
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,020
the sad thing about all this is

704
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,600
the normals can never

705
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,820
become like us.

706
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,160
But we can become

707
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
like them.

708
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,320
There but for the face

709
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,660
of Bob go I.

710
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,140
You might say to

711
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,760
yourself.

712
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,820
An excellent performance

713
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,120
Mr. Vollmer. Very effective.

714
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,580
You learn quickly.

715
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,880
Thank you.

716
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,000
I'd like to know who I'm thanking.

717
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,280
It does not make very much difference.

718
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,460
I am just pleased I could be of help.

719
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,400
You learned the style

720
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,520
very well. You delivered

721
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,560
the speech exactly as I told you.

722
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,940
I'm very obliged.

723
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,300
The money?

724
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,320
It was the least I could do.

725
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,220
We could not very well have you thrown out

726
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,120
into the streets.

727
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,500
I happen to feel your work is very important.

728
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,200
Are you one of us?

729
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,200
One of you Mr. Vollmer.

730
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,400
You might say I am you.

731
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,520
Now.

732
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
I have some suggestions.

733
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,920
I will continue to give you advice.

734
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,140
But there is a matter

735
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,420
of great importance that must be

736
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,060
taken care of.

737
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,260
What is it?

738
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,320
An expedient Mr. Vollmer.

739
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,280
Oh you might call it a

740
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,480
cause celebre.

741
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,580
Something to

742
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,120
cement the organization together.

743
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
I don't understand.

744
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,940
A martyr.

745
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,580
The organization needs a martyr.

746
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,800
A martyr?

747
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,820
How do you find a martyr?

748
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,760
You do not find one Mr. Vollmer.

749
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,220
You choose one.

750
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,400
You take one of no value

751
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,840
and you make him into a symbol.

752
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,880
You wrap him in a flag.

753
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,900
And you make his death

754
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,800
work for you.

755
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,160
Find a man who is of

756
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,680
no value while he is alive.

757
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,480
But who can serve you when he is dead.

758
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,300
Is there such a one?

759
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,620
Mob?

760
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:19,800
Hard!"

761
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:19,820
OK!

762
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:19,880

866
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:17,680
was able to ignore the news because it used to make me so depressed. Back in the olden days,

867
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:26,680
I'd read the Dallas Morning News and it was all just story after story of misery that I couldn't

868
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,540
do anything about. And worst of all, there was the letters to the editor's page. Imagine in Dallas,

869
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:40,380
Texas. Well, now, like I said, I was able to ignore the news and I got much healthier.

870
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,800
All my psychosomatic illnesses cleared up. Then 9-11 happened and I started becoming a news junkie

871
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,960
again to some extent. But lately, I found myself in this horrible habit that's really hard to break,

872
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:01,540
reading the comments that follow yahoo.com news articles.

873
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:12,880
Oh, my God. You know, I've learned things from reading those comments, things I never knew before.

874
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,040
For instance, did you know that no Democrat ever works or pays taxes?

875
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:28,180
And that the libtards, I've read this one comment. This is just a real typical one. Give me an idea

876
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,060
of how frustrating this can be. They'll say things like,

877
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,200
well, I see the libtards are posting during the workday. That's because they never work

878
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,460
or pay taxes. Well, the guy, it's like you look at the timestamp and it was posted in the middle

879
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:51,880
of the day. I don't, all you, this is an actual quote. All you stupid libtards can do is hate

880
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,660
and name calling because you're cowards and idiots.

881
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,300
Oh, and the, the, the,

882
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:09,600
the media is completely controlled by socialists. I hear that all day long. Every time I turn on the

883
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,840
radio, that the media is controlled by socialists. But where do you hear it? The damn radio.

884
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:25,680
Oh, it's a sad, sad situation. But friends, we subgeniuses, especially the ones who are

885
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,280
fully indoctrinated, dues paying, ordained ministers,

886
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:36,540
who easily done with that 30 bucks at the, uh, or the checkout, those ordainment packs,

887
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,480
they're quite spiffy. Um, we just, I don't know why it took us so long to realize this.

888
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:51,400
Remember, uh, the last, the previous president, uh, Bush, the second was pushing, they were going

889
00:46:51,400 --> 00:47:00,380
to give extra money or tax breaks or something to companies that were faith based. Well, I didn't

890
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,100
say anything. We have,

891
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:07,460
we happen to have a religion. It's not really faith based. It's face based. It's based on that

892
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,980
face, that face of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs, not on the face of Reverend Ivan Stank, not on the face

893
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:19,720
of Philo Drummond, not on the face of some damn other subgenius. It's that man, Bob, that face.

894
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:28,540
And friends, we discovered finally, rather late in our career, the power of face healing. You can

895
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,220
take a picture of Bob, which comes with,

896
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:37,440
that membership pack, by the way, we also have decals, um, and place, just simply physically

897
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:45,000
place that printed picture on the afflicted part of the, uh, person, such as the brain,

898
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:52,280
uh, just, uh, slap a printed, uh, Dobbs head against your face. He can see out of every one

899
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:58,860
of those little Dobbs heads. He's with you, even though you're still alone when you do that. Uh,

900
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,160
I should, you know, I should be getting,

901
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,940
I should be getting royalties for writing the first face book.

902
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:16,660
I used to think I had a problem with faith healing because I'm kind of a, what you'd call a skeptic.

903
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,820
I'm real. I studied UFOs, paranormal, alternative healing, all that stuff very,

904
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:30,340
very closely for a long time. And it taught me that there are many interesting people around.

905
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,320
But I was sad because it was like, well, what if I got some incurable disease?

906
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,760
But sometimes incurable diseases really are cured by faith healing.

907
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:49,100
I thought, well, golly, that cuts me out. And then I realized, no, actually,

908
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,880
I'm just as susceptible to faith healing as anybody.

909
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:00,520
When the doctor gives my insurance company a big enough bill, my faith grows.

910
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,980
The, if they have the machine that goes ding and can show me how much it costs,

911
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,720
but I have more faith. So I can be in fact,

912
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,740
the problem is I actually do believe in faith healing.

913
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,840
Placebos work as well as medicine about half the time,

914
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:30,460
but now I'm hooked on placebos and that adds up to people.

915
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,180
People are so,

916
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:31,280
so,

917
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,280


918
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,280


919
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,280
so dependent on machines and mechanical contrivances,

920
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,880
air conditioning. What happened to the air conditioning?

921
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:47,160
We got to wondering, well, you go to Walmart and I actually know a guy who's,

922
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,580
whose idea of exercise is to walk across Walmart.

923
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,120
And then you see all those people in those little Walmart golf carts, right?

924
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,840
And at the supermarket more and more,

925
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,220
they can't even be bothered to lean on the cart.

926
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,660
And you see them walk into the store.

927
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,280
Then they get the machine and sit down.

928
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:13,180
We got to speculating if who would win if you had a fight between modern humans

929
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:16,500
and say an Australopithecus, you know,

930
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:23,260
this little apish I think the Australopithecus would consider that Walmart golf cart driver an easy kill.

931
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:23,880
Don't you?

932
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,240
So,

933
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:26,740
Oh,

934
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,040
I see if we have some Australopithecus in the audience.

935
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,620
Yeah,

936
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:30,920
yeah,

937
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,080
yeah,

938
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,260
yeah.

939
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,580
Yes,

940
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:44,400
the conspiracy gets people to the point where they'd rather drive than walk.

941
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,340
I would have rather done that a lot of today actually.

942
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,200
But you know,

943
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,260
we get ourselves into the most of these messes.

944
00:50:51,260 --> 00:51:01,260
The subgenius thing is that some people might wisely consider our talk about the humans versus the subgenius.

945
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,500
And the conspiracy of the normals is being a bit of an allegory,

946
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:19,060
making fun of people who really are so simple minded that they divide the world up into two types of people or think you can measure human behavior with little formulas.

947
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,740
Most of the time,

948
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,880
it's not the conspiracy.

949
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,500
We get ourselves into these messes,

950
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:26,720
friends.

951
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,840
That's where you have to fight the conspiracy.

952
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,360
First,

953
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,660
the conspiracy inside.

954
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:36,560
You the kick me sign on your back is in your own handwriting.

955
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,700
That is a horrible thing to realize.

956
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,660
But if you're lucky and grow old enough,

957
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,100
it will sink in.

958
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,780
It really is your responsibility and you can remove the kick me sign.

959
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,080
We have a lot of trouble reaching the youth in our ministry,

960
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,360
but it's amazing how easy it is to reach old age.

961
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:00,920
And it's a great way to change it.

962
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,520
But enough about the conspiracy.

963
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,980
You don't want to hear about the conspiracy.

964
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,560
You want more on religion.

965
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,420
And have we got a moron religion for you?

966
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,600
Pull that win over your own eye.

967
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,360
Where would we go next?

968
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,360
This phantom from another time,

969
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,880
this resurrected ghost of a previous nightmare,

970
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,020
Chicago,

971
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:27,920
Los Angeles,

972
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,320
Miami,

973
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:28,860
Florida,

974
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,320
Vincennes,

975
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:29,680
Indiana,

976
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,280
Syracuse,

977
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:30,700
New York,

978
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,000
any place,

979
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,980
every place where there's hate,

980
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,300
where there's prejudice,

981
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,300
where there's bigotry.

982
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,540
He's alive.

983
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,140
He's alive.

984
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,820
So long as these evils exist.

985
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,600
Remember that when he comes to your town,

986
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,940
remember it.

987
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,940
When you hear his voice speaking out through others,

988
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
remember it.

989
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,100
When you hear a name called a minority attack,

990
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,080
any blind,

991
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,580
unreasoning assault on a people or any human being.

992
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,660
He's alive because through these things,

993
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,120
we keep them alive.

994
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,640
So long.

995
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,980
Thank you.

996
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,240
Thank you.

997
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,280


998
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,660
A NASA scientist says there could be PR news from Washington.

999
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,200
Thank you.

1000
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,260
Thank you.

1001
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,160
Thank you.

1002
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:00,500
Thank you.

1003
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,260
Thank you.

1004
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,340
Girl talk.

1005
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,540
Did that mash up?

1006
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,260
You can Google girl talk.

1007
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,740
or wiki hymn.

1008
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,140
Before that, PR news by Lemur

1009
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,080
and some music for Imaginary Monster

1010
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,400
movies by Sodi.

1011
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,840
You are hearing Hour of Slack

1012
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,480
from the Church of the Subgenius.

1013
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,860
Next week's show will be a special about

1014
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,040
Starwood 2010 with more

1015
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,340
ranting and lots of music.

1016
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,040
For more information on Starwood, X-Day

1017
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,900
or the Church of the Subgenius, you can look at

1018
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,200
subgenius.com and especially

1019
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,520
the events section.

1020
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,840
Also, our Subgenius Foundation

1021
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,580
official Facebook page.

1022
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,340
And now, via

1023
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,560
the large, Philo tells us goodbye

1024
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,300
with some puzzling evidence.

1025
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,040
Yeah, I think it's about time for us to

1026
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,220
think about packing up

1027
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,120
and heading out.

1028
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,960
What do you think?

1029
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,500
Okay.

1030
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,060
You can.

1031
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:03,760
You can.

1032
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,960
You're free to do that.

1033
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,360
You mean, we're going to do something with the basic

1034
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,200
laws of nature?

1035
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,740
That's pretty scary.

1036
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,620
That is scary.

1037
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:14,920
That is scary.

1038
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,380
That is scary.
