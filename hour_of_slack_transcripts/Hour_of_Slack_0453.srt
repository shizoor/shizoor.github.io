1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes. First, this little edit here from Phineas Narco.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,680
How is old Bob?

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,040
Oh, he's doing good. He sends his regards.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,860
You know one of the best things about Bob?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,700
What's that?

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,460
He's a smoker.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,260
Yeah. Yeah, a fromp all the way.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,220
Hey, Bob, it's great to have you on this show again. How you doing?

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,360
Bob!

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,500
B-O-B!

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:30,000
But if you're on the market for just a basic, decent guy, you can't go wrong with Bob.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,240
He's a reliable, no-frills model. Just one previous owner.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,340
She only traded him in because she wanted something a little zippier.

14
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,200
His name's Bob.

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:37,680
Bob.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,620
Bob's great.

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,620
He comes in every day.

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,880
He's tall, dark, and handsome.

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,740
His eyes are brown.

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,300
Brown shirt.

21
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:42,960
Brown pants.

22
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,440
Brown belt.

23
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,020
How do I know?

24
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:44,600
Brown truck.

25
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,220
He's pretty cool.

26
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,440
And I think I have a crush on him.

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,880
Championship soldier.

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,060
Bob is a tireless worker.

29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,980
Bob's a man of vision.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,760
A dynamic person.

31
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,540
Bob is a people person.

32
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,560
He's a unique individual.

33
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,240
He's one of a kind.

34
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,940
He's a people person.

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,480
Bob is...

36
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,340
He's a genius.

37
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,920
First rate.

38
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,400
He's an inspiration.

39
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,860
He's a man of the people.

40
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,560
I love Bob.

41
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,860
He's a people person.

42
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,740
He's a mover and a shaker.

43
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,160
Bob is the leader of the generation.

44
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,740
Bob is a tireless worker.

45
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,980
Unbridled energy.

46
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,640
As his doctor, I know I tell him to slow down.

47
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,220
He won't listen.

48
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,740
And now I want you all to say, vote Bob!

49
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,060
Vote Bob!

50
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,580
Bob has a great vision.

51
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,780
And now, the self-genius.

52
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,460
Our house.

53
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,240
What?

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:52,040
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

55
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,360
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the...

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:04,680
course of this show, the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

57
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,800
I've got a pair.

58
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,040
I've got a pair.

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,340
I've got a pair.

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,300
And she's got a hell of a pair.

61
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,940
We've got a...

62
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,960
Oh, God, we've all got pairs here.

63
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,840
It's so nice.

64
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,780
But I don't have a mic.

65
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
She's got a pair with...

66
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,780
We're all hooked up to the umbilicals here.

67
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,920
She's got a pair with that.

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,520
You'll find it.

69
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

70
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,260
Do you have a real show in your hometown?

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,960
No, we had a...

72
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,120
Yeah, I'm sorry.

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,860
Okay, thank you.

75
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,240
There was a show crash.

76
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,920
There's a terrible show crash.

77
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,300
KPFA just ran into KNON and caused a wreck on WREK.

78
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,220
It's a disastrous show.

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,100
Oh, wait a minute.

80
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,640
But, but...

81
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,260
Now, which show is this?

82
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,260
The disaster was when it was...

83
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,060
I thought this was Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,120
You'll find that naked women...

85
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,580
No, no, no.

86
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,220
I'm on 91.1 Atlanta.

87
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,460
No, no, you're not.

88
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,100
This is KNON.

89
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,300
This is, well, there is no KNON anymore.

90
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Hey, get your sound waves off my turf.

91
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,620
What is this?

92
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,640
Hey, your sound waves taste good with my headphones.

93
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,860
Oh.

94
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,260
They are kind of creamy.

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,980
Your Doppler effect fell into my sound waves.

96
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,900
Your sound waves fell into my...

97
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,060
Oh, my continental drift.

98
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,560
It's taking a toll everywhere.

99
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,900
Unfortunately, the doctors have to do the one thing they hate to do.

100
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,900
Share a microphone.

101
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,600
Yeah, especially when the other one has such terrible breath.

102
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,180
Oh, they're covered with ectoplasm.

103
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,180
Guess which one that is.

104
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:40,620
Yeah, you'd have to guess which doctor is on which mic.

105
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,620
You'd have to French kiss...

106
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,460
Which twin has the Tony?

107
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,460
You'd have to French kiss both of them like I did.

108
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,260
To know the difference.

109
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,720
And live.

110
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,380
Don't ask about what I had to do.

111
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,920
You're hurting my ears, which is what I've been doing to listeners for years.

112
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,840
You know, I am saying...

113
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,500
Reverend Jane or Hypercrete's from Little Rock, Arkansas.

114
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,060
And in fact, you missed my performance Friday night.

115
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,000
And I'm not going to do anything anymore at the science fiction convention.

116
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,140
Of course, it would probably be just like way over your head and insult your every value system.

117
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,340
And just totally confuse you with...

118
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,160
Now, we don't want to confuse anyone, Jane.

119
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,680
No, we wouldn't want to put out any disinformation.

120
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,860
But how could we...

121
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,140
I want to get that straight.

122
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,340
In case anybody was wondering.

123
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,260
It's not going to be open again until tomorrow.

124
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,400
But...

125
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,100
And we, of course, are having the big deep Bible tonight at 10.

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,380
Which you are really lucky because this is a true old-fashioned Bible-pounding, black-eyed, pee-eating,

127
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,060
swimming love corpses, music-supplied, sub-genius deep Bible.

128
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
And theoretically, Jane or Hypercrete's will be there too.

129
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,040
Where's...

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,420
Someone will drive him down from Little Rock.

131
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,420
Where's puzzling evidence?

132
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,240
Oh, he's puzzling.

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,980
Puzzling evidence will probably be here, but he'll be...

134
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,360
Okay, who called this meeting?

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,660
One of you people are puzzling evidence.

136
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,620
And one of you is the 13th apostle.

137
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,820
Could it be you?

138
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,240
Could be you.

139
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,060
Could be anybody.

140
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,240
Come on, give us a chance.

141
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,920
We never said who the first 12 were for that matter.

142
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,420
All 13 of you could be out there.

143
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,440
But that leaves that.

144
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,500
This is the most democratic church that anybody who spends lots of money can be.

145
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,620
That 13th apostle.

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,680
Salvation can be bought.

147
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,900
We have numerous 13th apostles.

148
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,060
What did it say on the... that we're supposed to talk about?

149
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Explain the church.

150
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,760
They were supposed to explain the church in the 17th year.

151
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,180
How much time do we have?

152
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:41,620
In 25 words or less.

153
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,340
12 decades?

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Or...

155
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,580
Yeah.

156
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,460
What is it, a century?

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,260
We've been doing that for 14 and a half years now.

158
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,360
They still haven't got it.

159
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,100
Well, it's not even finished.

160
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,460
No, seriously.

161
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,700
Are there any questions?

162
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,660
That's really the best way to start with this kind of thing.

163
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,840
Who do we have to kill?

164
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,820
Yeah, who can we kill?

165
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,540
We killed Bob.

166
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,820
Yeah, we've killed our guru.

167
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,180
Many, many times already.

168
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,660
He keeps popping back up.

169
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,840
Can't die.

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,380
Come on, come on.

171
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,920
Come on, come on.

172
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,300
Come on, come on.

173
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,120
Come on, come on.

174
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,120
Come on, come on.

175
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,500
Come on, come on.

176
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,080
Come on, come on.

177
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,520
Come on, come on.

178
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,500
Come on, come on.

179
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,240
Kill the wolf.

180
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,260
Call an ambulance.

181
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,600
Wake up.

182
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,220
Vote Bob.

183
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,160
Just can't keep a good guru down.

184
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,420
How many people here actually know what the Church of the Subgenius is, quote, unquote,

185
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:32,780
know?

186
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,380
That's just about a half.

187
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,880
Yes, that's gratifying.

188
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,320
Yeah.

189
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,060
Well.

190
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,400
Sometimes I think I do.

191
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,480
For the rest of you, I really don't know what to tell you except that you'll have to actually

192
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,240
invest some time.

193
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,780
You'll have to pay to find out.

194
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, if you don't know, you could be on the right track, too.

195
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,540
That's the wonder of it.

196
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
That is very true.

197
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:53,680
That's the wonder of it.

198
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680


199
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680


200
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680


201
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680


202
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680


203
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680


204
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah.

205
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I have a question.

206
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,200
Yes.

207
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,900
The little boy in the...

208
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Why?

209
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,140
That's what Arnold Palmer asked us.

210
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,640
Why?

211
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,480
We gave him a very straight answer.

212
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:05,880
Why?

213
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,600
The answer is so simple.

214
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,200
Why not reach your DM?

215
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,460
It's slack.

216
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,880
That is why.

217
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Slack first for Bob, then for we, his called ministers, and then for those who may partake

218
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,520
of that slack as a direct runoff from the luck power that is sucked towards Bob, sprays

219
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:23,660
off the power of the church, and then the power of the church is sucked towards Bob.

220
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


221
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


222
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


223
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


224
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


225
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


226
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


227
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


228
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


229
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


230
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:23,660


231
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,720
And then Bob gets sucked off of him onto us, and then it sort of drips off of us onto...

232
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,180
And if you get in one of those big clouds, you're so lucky.

233
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,940
It's the slack trickle-down theory.

234
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,020
It's a pyramidal...

235
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,580
Slackonomics.

236
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,700
Yeah, slackonomics.

237
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,120
It's the pyramid scheme with you buried in the tomb in the middle of the pyramid.

238
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,940
Yeah, somewhere you're in that pyramid, in the secret room that you can't get to anymore.

239
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,780
I want you here...

240
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,420
I want to say something that doesn't make any sense, like everything that you say...

241
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,620
Moonraker, don't worry, friends.

242
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,220
It's only...

243
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,020
It's only hard.

244
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,720
Things like that.

245
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,280
If you're trying to say that, you know, this is not confusing, well, that confuses me because

246
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,160
I find it confusing, but I was straight on the fact that it was confusing, but when you

247
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,080
told me it was not confusing, that confused me.

248
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,160
Oh, yeah.

249
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:07,460
Right.

250
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,420
We have to start over again.

251
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,840
Okay.

252
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,260
A few minutes after we're...

253
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,300
Oh, yes.

254
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,220
Take it from the top.

255
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,760
Go.

256
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,820
Ah, welcome to church.

257
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,120
You are listening to the subgenius radio ministry...

258
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,000
Get on your knees, seekers.

259
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,900
...our...

260
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,520
Get ready for some lashings of...

261
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,060
Slack.

262
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,400
Slack.

263
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,220
There's a seeker born every day...

264
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,420
Wait a minute.

265
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,320
Which show is this?

266
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:23,820
Where am I?

267
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,560
You wouldn't know Slack if it tortured you to death.

268
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,260
You wouldn't know Slack if it...

269
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,120
Oh, I'm begging for it, too.

270
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,660
...in Berkeley and Oakland and all of Northern California and you're listening to...

271
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,720
If it just handcuffed you and just started beating you with a...

272
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,060
You're beating to Jane-er?

273
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,940
Just started lashing you with a car aerial until you were striped like Tony Tiger.

274
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,880
Who are these people?

275
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,160
With a cat and nine tails.

276
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,020
You wouldn't know Slack if it chopped your head off.

277
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,980
God, this closet is full.

278
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,160
You wouldn't know Slack if it drove nine-inch nails into your eyes.

279
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,740
You people out there, don't you?

280
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,320
You're just a bunch of half-subgenius, half-hearted subgeniuses.

281
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,800
You wouldn't send me all your money.

282
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,440
You wouldn't give me all your worldly possessions.

283
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,780
They want Bob for free.

284
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,660
None of the women out there want to become slaves to Jane-er Hyperclase.

285
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,680
They're just half-subgeniuses.

286
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,140
I'm already a slave to Bob.

287
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,680
You're barking up the wrong girl.

288
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,760
Hey, this one's Philo.

289
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,800
Well, you've joined up with the wrong cult.

290
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,420
Oh, God, not another Philo.

291
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,920
We'll make one up for later.

292
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,140
Even the wrong cult can be the right cult.

293
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,360
I tell you what, because you can't hear Philo, you'll hear Papa Joe Momma.

294
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,760
But Bob's just a face on it.

295
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,040
I put Philo in the box.

296
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,600
Ivan's thing.

297
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,300
If he can't hear Philo, you'll hear Papa Joe Momma.

298
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,660
If she's good, we'll punch some air holes.

299
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,060
You won't hear Underdog.

300
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,020
You won't see Kiss, and you won't see the Aurora models come to life like we did earlier.

301
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,940
Yes, dear friends, we've been at the DragonCon science fiction convention for the last couple of days.

302
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,620
Here in Atlanta.

303
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,340
It has been a show crash.

304
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,260
I feel kind of sorry for those geeky, neurotic, pathetic, wimp sci-fi fans

305
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,380
who are absolutely the prototypical cartoon of a geek.

306
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,300
A-clown.

307
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,540
They woke up the next morning.

308
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,140
Doc, there could be outta time Sommigeek then used me for whatever,

309
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,180
you know?

310
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,520
econевид Touche.

311
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:06,540
It's possible we've gotta hire this shit.

312
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:06,540


313
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:06,680
Let's go.

314
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
We're always gonna help, uh, U.S. defeat.

315
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,800
Uh...

316
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,140
Ah...

317
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,040
be spectacled, flabby, pasty, way-faced geeks.

318
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,620
Praise them.

319
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,120
Don't you love them?

320
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:25,640
Where else?

321
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,340
This church would not survive.

322
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,180
There were some pockets, though.

323
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,680
After all, their money is green.

324
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,340
And what souls would Bob have to sell to the Axis?

325
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,460
Highly illogical, Captain.

326
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,500
I've slipped a few of those souls.

327
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,900
Here comes the enterprise.

328
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,180
Here comes the enterprise.

329
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,320
Boy, there's a lot of Klingons down there.

330
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,220
Oh, and they're hip, too.

331
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,040
They're into K-Bob or K-Bob.

332
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,400
Spock, you green-blooded alien.

333
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,000
We're talking about men's lives, not your logic.

334
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,580
You're out of your fulkin' mind.

335
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,260
That's your fulkin' mind, I think you said.

336
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,220
Dr. McCoy, I believe...

337
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,800
Fulkin'.

338
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
Well...

339
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,820
I believe Captain Kirk left me in charge of the enterprise.

340
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,900
She's remembering the show there.

341
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,720
She was when he was making his trip down to the X-Dimension.

342
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,780
Dr. McCoy, what are you doing with that mobile transporter beam?

343
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,100
Dr. McCoy...

344
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,200
Dr. McCoy...

345
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,380
Dr. McCoy, where's Spock?

346
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,420
You're not gonna listen to this later.

347
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,480
Of course, the only really, really pure sci-fi fans are the subgeniuses, you know.

348
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,080
Dr. McCoy...

349
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,860
They're the ones who've lived that science fiction.

350
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,520
And, you know, real life has gotten a lot scarier than any sci-fi movie.

351
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,940
I mean, back in the old days, the only time the army moved into L.A. was when giant ants invaded.

352
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,400
Oh, that's next.

353
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,300
We've got that arranged.

354
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,480
Yeah, what...

355
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,900
I'm sorry about the comet hitting the wrong side of Jupiter.

356
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,080
We've been working on that.

357
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,120
If H.G. Wells could see the future, he'd roll over in his grave if he was alive today.

358
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,940
Are we dead now?

359
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,380
Didn't the comet land on the northern part of Canada and wipe us all out?

360
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,880
Are we still doing a show here?

361
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,580
That was the body of Satan being hurled to the earth by God himself.

362
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,620
Am I talking right now?

363
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
Is this my voice?

364
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:02,960
I don't know.

365
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,260
I mean, are these words...

366
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,300
I'll check.

367
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,140
I'll go right outside and check.

368
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,940
I mean, could you record this and then sell it to someone else at a later date?

369
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,580
I mean...

370
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,440
That's what I do.

371
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,000
Half price on verbs.

372
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:13,980
I mean...

373
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,200
I'll sell the nouns back.

374
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,680
I mean, how much would you charge me for a tape of myself?

375
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,020
Why don't we do this?

376
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,680
You do the adjectives and the verbs.

377
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,020
I'll do the nouns and the adverbs.

378
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,540
And I'll sell the tape.

379
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,380
No, come on.

380
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,220
Just on this tape.

381
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,320
Just like we've been doing all these years.

382
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
Now then, we have to renegotiate in half an hour for the second 30 minutes of the 90-minute CD.

383
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,760
I checked the stock exchange.

384
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
Nouns are big this week.

385
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,160
Bigger than adjectives or adverbs or other Jane-er words.

386
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,540
That changes.

387
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,320
Oh, but prepositions are so good.

388
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,020
Or is it propositions?

389
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,700
What happened?

390
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,480
Last night with the swinging love corpses and Papa Joe Mama and Jane-er and Ivan Stang and Suzy the Flusy.

391
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:49,920
Oh.

392
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,960
It seems like...

393
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,040
They're still stacking the bodies like cordwood.

394
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,860
It seems like it's the fallen women that always get picked up in the grand ballroom west.

395
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,020
Yeah, they're still mopping up the blood left over from that head-launching.

396
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,780
It was just a teeny little head in a tiny, tiny golf club.

397
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,260
I didn't know it would have those 27 gallons of blood in it.

398
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Yeah, it's so hard to believe such a small golfer head could bleed.

399
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,400
Quite so much.

400
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,400
And people are standing in line to go in there and look at the patterns on the carpet.

401
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
We haven't told them about the dangerously high radiation levels.

402
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,500
You should see the crowd outside the station.

403
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,560
You looked out the window and seen the crowd outside the station?

404
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,520
But that was just a prostitution.

405
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,100
Standing in line to die.

406
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,960
That was just a false head-launching.

407
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,660
Anyone who saw that and believed it was real is damned to hell.

408
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,000
And friends, there's no water down there.

409
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,520
There's plenty of head blood, though.

410
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,420
Oh, yeah.

411
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,140
You're just a bunch of...

412
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,060
Beer, head blood.

413
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,060
And bodily excretions that build up on the stage after the swinging love corpses reach their climax.

414
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,980
We're talking about...

415
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,300
Help me, somebody!

416
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,300
Yes, dear friends!

417
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:08,780
It's about time we had a for real, Bible-breaking, pulpit-pounding, black-eyed peen subgenius revival here.

418
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,920
And by that, I don't mean some silly parody situation.

419
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,880
Where we make fun of televangelists and Billy Graham and so forth.

420
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,420
No, sir.

421
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,260
We are not up here to make fun.

422
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,880
We are up here because we hate the normals.

423
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,320
The prudes, prigs, weasers, and weenuses.

424
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,340
The super patriots and fundamentalists and fanatics and so forth.

425
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,680
They all think there ought to be a little more religion in this country.

426
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,740
Uh-huh.

427
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,160
Well, have we got a religion for them?

428
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,860
The Church of the Subgenius.

429
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,020
God's answer to fundamentalists.

430
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,300
Building a new heaven and earth on the rubble of the old.

431
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,300
Beyond Satanism, dear friends.

432
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,920
Something for nothing.

433
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,520
That's what Bob's here to bring you.

434
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,380
Something for nothing.

435
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,100
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

436
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,020
You can take the church.

437
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,840
Shove it into any orifice and watch it go.

438
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,300
Ah, yes.

439
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,860
This is real.

440
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,120
Everything you know is true.

441
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,460
Bob is the proof.

442
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,780
Bob sold it.

443
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,780
I smoked it.

444
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,860
That battles it.

445
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,280
We may now proceed.

446
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,960
Be not afraid, dear friends.

447
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,860
You have no choice.

448
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,780
Bob is coming.

449
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,280
It is useless to resist.

450
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,240
The code by diddy comes down on at the doorstep.

451
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,000
Outước digging up ab失 Andrea

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000


453
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,060
Huh?

454
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,460
dings

455
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,900
Coolin'

456
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:05,320
I think we're and we're gonna live a life age.

457
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,620
Get ready life.

458
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,400
A爸

459
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,000
We endure to slowly return the heamer,

497

Now, folks, Jayner's just kidding.

498
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,260
He's just doing a satire of rednecks.

499
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,440
We want to make sure that you understand.

500
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:43,980
But for purposes of parity only.

501
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,420
Yes, it's just a parity only.

502
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,260
No, parity is the way it's pronounced around here.

503
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,460
This is equal time for equal religions.

504
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
Some are more equal than others.

505
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,060
Pass the equal, please.

506
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,840
Praise Bob.

507
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm attracted to women who wear high heels because they can't run as fast.

508
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,160
I'm attracted to high heels.

509
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,800
Hey, I want to talk about how disgusting sci-fi fans are since I used to be one.

510
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,280
I know them pretty well.

511
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,880
Well, I am one.

512
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,520
The people we just left.

513
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,360
Were there any proto-stangs there?

514
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,940
Did you see any?

515
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,320
What kind of blasphemous utterance is that?

516
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,080
To think that any of those people could lower themselves to the level of a stang.

517
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,740
He cries easily.

518
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,580
Round one.

519
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,160
Okay, I'm sorry, stang.

520
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry, stang.

521
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,640
I didn't mean to insult the Trekkies like that.

522
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,420
No, um.

523
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,240
No, but see.

524
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,920
Seriously, folks.

525
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,100
No, seriously, folks.

526
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,500
What about the people last night that came to the show?

527
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,180
What were they doing?

528
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,760
What are they like?

529
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,500
I said, doctor, it hurts whenever I do this and don't do that.

530
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,920
I really don't care about the people who came to the show.

531
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,420
All I care about is the people who came up to the sales table at that convention afterwards.

532
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,740
And they're my good friends.

533
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:59,420
Everybody who bought one of those Bob shirts or other things that I can't talk about on the other stations.

534
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,260
Or a Janeer tape or a Janeer healing hate crystal.

535
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,660
Yeah, Janeer was actually selling.

536
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,120
I've got one.

537
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,620
I'm like, leave it right now.

538
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,180
Crystals at the subgenius sales table at the science fiction convention.

539
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,800
Janeer.

540
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,040
Ah.

541
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,620
Ah.

542
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,720
It came out of the dirt.

543
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,640
Janeer had it.

544
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,320
Father Joe Mama.

545
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:15,740
No.

546
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,300
Father Joe Mama is here.

547
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,520
Tell them about the crystals.

548
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,460
Many, many doctors.

549
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,160
You can focus your hate.

550
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

551
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,340
You see, the New Agers have been missing the boat all this time.

552
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,580
They've been focusing healing energy and love energy.

553
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,240
And that works.

554
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,980
But a crystal can transmit and amplify energy.

555
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,060
So there's no reason a subgenius couldn't buy one and amplify his hatred.

556
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:45,880
Towards his enemies and create injury and dismemberment powers rather than healing powers for the normals.

557
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,980
And then pour ground up glass and rock salt into the gaping open wounds of the people he went to ninth grade with.

558
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,040
The trick is that you have to turn the crystal in the opposite direction.

559
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:05,600
Now, the fun thing is to think that some of these people who don't know how to use crystals have been pointing the aggregate, the unhealing side towards them all this while.

560
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,380
And this is why some of the New Agers are the way they are.

561
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,500
I just give them a twist and let them dig in.

562
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,840
You know, in California, you buy them with the crystal sewn right into the zipper of the pants.

563
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,020
I'm sorry I'm late.

564
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,860
I got in a real heated discussion with some loser that was telling me that Saurak had actually turned the planet Vulcan around for this reparation.

565
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

566
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,400
We were just talking about that.

567
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,900
Those guys were here a minute ago fighting about that very same thing.

568
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,560
I mean, everybody knows that Saurak is a savior of Vulcan.

569
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,840
You know, I just couldn't believe that.

570
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,480
That is really...

571
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,400
Well, I think Elfquest number 27 was a lot deeper statement.

572
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,060
Than Elfquest number 21 through 26.

573
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,000
My dwarf lord cancels out your elfin queen.

574
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,900
But I'm a...

575
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,980
I need a Dr. Pepper.

576
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,180
I'm a wizard.

577
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,220
But in this new role playing game, you play with some of my cards.

578
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,280
But I wasn't playing with a full deck in the first place.

579
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,720
And I'm not talking about the game.

580
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,740
These people are into some kind of fantasy world.

581
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,360
Not like the Church of the Subgenius, which takes a good hard bite out of reality.

582
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,500
The hard, cold, broken glass covers.

583
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,460
The hard cement.

584
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,620
It lets that bitter tang from life hit you in the back of the throat.

585
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,920
They've already rounded us up, dear friends.

586
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,620
Locked cattle.

587
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,760
Herded us into forced slave labor camps.

588
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,400
And replaced our names with urine test result numbers.

589
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,680
Only most of us didn't notice.

590
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,060
Because at the end of the day, they still let you clock out.

591
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,840
Go home to your cell block and punch in again.

592
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,580
For a few minutes of quality time.

593
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,620
With the spouse and the kiddies.

594
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,620
Or the drugs and the TV are all four.

595
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,060
You're used to it.

596
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,900
You can take it.

597
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,120
It's a living.

598
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,020
Elvis is dead.

599
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,180
Hendrix is dead.

600
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,780
John Holmes is dead.

601
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,280
The Marlboro Man has cancer.

602
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,160
Love and kindness are purchased commodities.

603
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,280
Charlie's still in jail.

604
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,720
Even the gay baby whales are...

605
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,780
endorsing big oil companies, dear friends.

606
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,100
Rock and roll is a beer commercial and punk is a hairstyle.

607
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,780
All the starving people in the world want back what they think you took.

608
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,600
And you're supposed to work like a dog just to keep what you only think you already have.

609
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,400
You cannot even die legally in this country.

610
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,700
As a result of this convention, we are actually going to begin the Church of Normal.

611
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Four normals by normals.

612
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,680
It should be obvious to everyone...

613
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,740
Approved by Don.

614
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,700
It should be obvious to everyone that even though we are against the normals,

615
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,380
that from henceforth we are also against the abnormals.

616
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,640
We have come to turn abnormals against normals unto themselves.

617
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,160
I find myself against a lot of people.

618
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,060
It's just the in-betweens.

619
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,260
But that was our original concept, an infinity of hate.

620
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,840
But I'm opposed to that even.

621
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,120
Yeah, so, yeah. Right.

622
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,800
We hate science.

623
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,700
We hate science.

624
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,440
We're still looking at Reverend Susie the Floozy.

625
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,660
Those aren't fanboys. Those are werewolves with power number seven.

626
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,680
Don't you know anything?

627
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,480
Oh, yeah. Oh sorry, I didn't look at it.

628
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,980
The only way to get rid of them was the silver

629
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,000
bullet card.

630
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,720
I didn't look at the four thousand page xerox of the book of the game we're playing.

631
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,500
And those are a rare chase card. There's only one in eighteen packs.

632
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,060
Your chances of getting the silver bullet card are one in eighteen.

633
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:26,080
These guys know the rules. They're probably going to beat us at sub-genius game number 3700.

634
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,500
Well, I have a rant card. I have the power to rant.

635
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,660
I have a phylo that, yeah.

636
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,080
Over a tape deck.

637
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,140
With a rant card and a phylo, we can probably kill.

638
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,220
I wish I just had to be able to keep a job card.

639
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,540
Get out a corporation-free card.

640
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
You got too many of those, Jane.

641
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,180
Oh, I've got to go feed them.

642
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,720
Get out of your job and slack off.

643
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,800
Does anyone know where I could get a pick-up-a-woman card?

644
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,040
Yeah, those are upstairs in room 1750.

645
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,660
Ever been picked up by the fuzz?

646
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,440
The subgenius cards are an ongoing card collection.

647
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,880
We're always adding special chase cards.

648
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,340
The get-a-free-woman card is...

649
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,660
We're waiting until Jane retires before we issue that.

650
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,060
We're afraid he may get that card.

651
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,940
You can get a woman free, but you've got to tie her up first.

652
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,320
Well, we don't set her free.

653
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,300
Anybody got any linch?

654
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,940
I think that... Is that what you're supposed to say?

655
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, by the way, Sting, we got into that little cabinet

656
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,540
that had all the free potato chips and M&Ms and stuff in your room.

657
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,440
How do you get into that?

658
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,400
You just use a little toothpick and open it up.

659
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,120
It was great. There's all sorts of booze and everything.

660
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,260
There's no charge for that, is there?

661
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,860
And, Dan, there's...

662
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,400
And balloons are in there, too.

663
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,680
Well, that's for the convention to pay for.

664
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,460
Oh, okay.

665
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,480
Yeah, I kind of played rock star in your hotel room, Doug.

666
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,360
I hope you don't mind.

667
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,080
You know, I just went off. I went crazy.

668
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,640
But, I mean, that's what I'm supposed to do.

669
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,700
That was my television in the swimming pool down there?

670
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,180
Well, you'll be glad to know that it may have been your television,

671
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,500
but at least we kept it plugged in when we threw it in there,

672
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,040
eliminating all the swimming.

673
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,140
I mean, that's what you're into.

674
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,740
I mean, that's your thing, you know.

675
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,760
We had to get a real long extension cord.

676
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,340
You're into these weird cults, you know,

677
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,680
like Trump and Trump.

678
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,000
Yeah, and Charles Manson and stuff.

679
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,280
I mean, so when I just, like, you know,

680
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,780
stabbed you in the stomach 37 times with a rusty fork,

681
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,080
I mean, that's your thing.

682
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,940
You're into weird cults and stuff.

683
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,800
Well, I'm all for killing the hogs.

684
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,020
Oh, yeah.

685
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,780
Sure, I cut up nine hogs.

686
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,080
Hell, I'll pile them to the sky at 20 million high.

687
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,000
Maybe then I can save my trees and my water and my wildlife.

688
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,140
That's what we're trying to do, friends.

689
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,800
We're just trying to save the planet.

690
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,580
It's more important than anything on the planet.

691
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,380
I thought we were going to pave the planet.

692
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,440
Well, yeah.

693
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
That's the only way to preserve it.

694
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,880
That's why we have to save it.

695
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,900
And the skulls of our enemies.

696
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,880
The Charles Manson Wildlife Reserve.

697
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,560
Just make a right at the graveyard.

698
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,260
That's a very beautiful conservationist plan, Charles.

699
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,420
People think we're inhuman because we kill people,

700
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,020
but in fact, we're just rabid environmentalists.

701
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,580
People create pollution.

702
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,500
We're just inhuman without doing anything.

703
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,920
They're an abscess sore upon the surface of the planet.

704
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,860
Save the planet.

705
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,580
Kill yourself.

706
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,800
Running with pus.

707
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,900
Yes, we have lanced the abscess of normalcy.

708
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,060
Attracting flies.

709
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,080
Death cows.

710
00:29:59,300 --> 00:29:59,840
We kill.

711
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,520
Spreading all sorts of maggots and contagion.

712
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,760
You must sew up your own reproductive organs.

713
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,780
Insects the size of supermarkets swallow up entire continents.

714
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,060
You must eliminate all that infibulation without representation.

715
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,820
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

716
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,240
The only way to save the whale is to kill mankind.

717
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,120
Look, we think we're kidding.

718
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,760
We're into the involuntary human extinction movement.

719
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:22,760
We think we're adulting.

720
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,820
This is all a big joke.

721
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,740
Your inner child needs a spanking.

722
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm sorry.

723
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,440
Give me your inner child.

724
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,980
For a week, I'll give you back an inner adult.

725
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,860
Susie, just ignore my hand.

726
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,700
I was diagnosed earlier today with alien hand syndrome.

727
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,360
I think your inner can't control your hand.

728
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,160
It's quite convenient.

729
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,980
You sound like some kind of weird inner child molester.

730
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:50,060
To prevent Jane-er from murdering thousands of normals would be to stifle his inner spoiled child.

731
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,240
Judge, I didn't mean to kill her.

732
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,800
It was my alien hand.

733
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,620
I'm pleading the alien hand defense.

734
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,080
The alien hand that God dealt him.

735
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,300
But what about my inner 70-year-old codger in a wheelchair?

736
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,660
Incontinent codger in a wheelchair.

737
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,200
He has no continence whatsoever.

738
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:16,560
My doctor told me he was trying to work with my inner child, but then he was trying to charge me $60 per 15 minutes for psychotherapy.

739
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,860
I said, Doc, my inner child is broke.

740
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,420
He's not even legally employable until he's 18.

741
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,080
Employable for what?

742
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,480
I had to explain to the judge I didn't rape her.

743
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,680
It was my alien organ syndrome.

744
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,560
Mm-hmm.

745
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,820
Could you play your alien organ just a few riffs?

746
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,700
I thought she wanted it.

747
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,020
It was empowerment, officer.

748
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,660
It's not exploitation.

749
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,700
I thought she wanted it.

750
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,260
I thought when she was screaming, no, no, no, that was just kind of a tease.

751
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,760
That was just kind of a come on.

752
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,880
That's not funny, man.

753
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,260
Take that back.

754
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,960
How many lesbians does it take to screw in a light bulb?

755
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,740
That's not funny, man.

756
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,420
That's not funny.

757
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,800
How many leftist anarchists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

758
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,620
What kind of wage am I being paid?

759
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,320
Would a black or a woman or a gay?

760
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,280
Get the same wage?

761
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,660
Where were the filaments in these light bulbs manufactured?

762
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,840
South Africa?

763
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,960
Does this corporation own stock in apartheid?

764
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,040
Is that what you're trying to say?

765
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,860
How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

766
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,040
Approved by Dobbs.

767
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,860
Only Dobbs.

768
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,940
There is an answer to that.

769
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,000
It won a prize one time.

770
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,460
How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

771
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,020
How many does it take to screw what?

772
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,240
1,502.

773
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,900
1,500 to create the shrinking device.

774
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,340
And two to climb inside the light bulb.

775
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,720
Thank you.

776
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,900
How many new agers does it take to screw in a light bulb?

777
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,080
1,001.

778
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,560
One to screw a light bulb in and 1,000 to visualize it.

779
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,520
Convention.

780
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,600
Subgenius convention.

781
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,340
Subgenius radio show.

782
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,340
I'll get the bus ticket if you'll leave me waiting there for five hours straight.

783
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,100
Convention.

784
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,080
Subgenius convention.

785
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,520
I'll lose all my luggage and not have my notes and go on stage and be just completely messed up.

786
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,920
But the audience will laugh anyway because that was what my...

787
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,660
It was the best one you ever did.

788
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,500
That's what my notes...

789
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,840
Gagging on dry ice vapor.

790
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,420
Ah!

791
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,920
That's what my notes were.

792
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,580
How to sound totally messed up.

793
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,020
So I didn't really need the notes.

794
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,260
I'm here tonight to speak the word of the world's only true religion.

795
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,080
Of course I'm referring to the church of the subgenius.

796
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:25,020
The church of the subgenius is a pan-religion of the future that even superior mutants, social renegades, weirdos of all castes.

797
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,100
That's right, brother.

798
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,560
Yeah.

799
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,400
And a hatred against me.

800
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,240
And a conspiracy of normals.

801
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,380
Our central belief system is that the normals form a vast conspiracy against those who are different.

802
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,640
We worship our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

803
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
He is weird humor.

804
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,520
He is dark, surrealistic death jokes.

805
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,440
He is psychedelic surrealism.

806
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,640
He is life itself.

807
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,080
He drank all the blood from my body and used it to xerox more pictures of his face.

808
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,240
Yes!

809
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,140
Yes!

810
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,460
Yes!

811
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,820
Yes!

812
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:19,120
But I am here tonight to speak a doctrine of national socialist, a national socialist subgenius philosophy.

813
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:26,180
Because the subgenius, which is racially all-encompassing, is the master race.

814
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,980
I hear you.

815
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,680
I hear you.

816
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,340
I hear you.

817
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


818
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


819
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


820
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


821
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


822
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


823
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


824
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


825
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


826
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


827
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,400


828
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,600
I hear you.

829
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


830
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


831
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


832
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


833
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


834
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


835
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


836
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


837
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:30,600


838
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,660
But the subgenius race!

839
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,100
Not the Jews, which are the devil race, which must be exterminated, but the normals!

840
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,040
We will remake the world in the image of J.R. Bob Dobbs or we shall destroy it!

841
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,540
We shall build a subgenius right that shall last a thousand years!

842
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,440
Yes!

843
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:04,380
As long as the heart beats in the breast of a single subgenius, he shall continue fighting for our cause.

844
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:15,660
As long as a single subgenius is able to draw breath into his bones, he shall continue to fight to the death against all of us.

845
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,020
I will build and breed a perfect race of blue-haired, blonde-eyed subgenius yetis and overlords.

846
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,460
Supermen.

847
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:42,240
The normals are underage, undermen, subhuman, underwear, useless eaters.

848
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,320
There is only four.

849
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,640
Slaves.

850
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:45,900
Labor.

851
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,520
Quote.

852
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,600
Extermination.

853
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:59,580
But ours is certifiably, unlike the sickening sweetness of life-cracking religions, ours is certifiably a religion of hate.

854
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,940
Hates are normalcy.

855
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,560
Now you might ask, what am I talking about, friends, when I talk about hate?

856
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,780
Am I talking about some namby-pamby?

857
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,640
Limbo?

858
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,480
Tempest-y, two-bit limbo?

859
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,740
Hate?

860
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:26,060
Some little conspiracy, panty-waist little hate?

861
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,200
Oh, I just hate myself.

862
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,860
Oh, I just hate the government.

863
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,860
Oh, I just hate the president.

864
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Is that it?

865
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,460
Is that what we're talking about when we talk about hate, friends?

866
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,040
Yes!

867
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,120
It's a no!

868
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,820
It's a no-killer!

869
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,200
When we talk about hate, we're talking about an infinity of hate!

870
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,920
An all-consuming, all-pervasive hate!

871
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,840
But an all-encompassing hate is a cathartic effect.

872
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,820
It's not like the namby-pamby little pink hate.

873
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,620
It has a cathartic effect that releases all the pent-up anger that you have.

874
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:15,620


875
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,620
It's a cathartic effect that you've had stored up all your life and leaves nothing but a boundless love for all things.

876
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,280
Unless they irritate you in any way whatsoever.

877
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,120
But wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.

878
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,220
Why am I talking to people in modern-day America about hate?

879
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,200
That's like talking to a fish about water.

880
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,800
You don't even know what hate is because you don't have anything to contrast it against.

881
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,600
The average person doesn't know what hate is.

882
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:45,840
Why is that?

883
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,660
Because it composes 90% of his inner being.

884
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,440
Oh, we've just started ranting.

885
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,740
I've just, the past 15 years, that was warming up.

886
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,020
You haven't heard me rant.

887
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,960
You haven't heard me rant yet.

888
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,440
Oh, this isn't an insane radio show.

889
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,720
We haven't started getting insane.

890
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,880
Oh, you think that was funny.

891
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,200
You think that was disorienting and alienating.

892
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,660
Oh, no, we're just warming up.

893
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,760
We're just getting started.

894
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,360
Maybe tonight wasn't the time to take it.

895
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,760
Now I'm going to start.

896
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,300
Now here's the insane stuff.

897
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,920
We're taking live calls.

898
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,120
That's 904-385-8357.

899
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,300
No, you know, I've just decided I'm just going to throw the script away.

900
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,100
For the next five minutes, I'm just going to do just completely improv.

901
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,020
Oh, man, don't do it.

902
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,180
Off the top of my head.

903
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,520
Wait a minute, that's not in the script.

904
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,120
What are you doing?

905
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,100
That's my line.

906
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
You've got a black woman on the front row.

907
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,580
She's black.

908
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,840
She's a black woman.

909
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,960
That's Don Rickles in drag.

910
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,340
Look, you've got a guy sitting over there.

911
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:44,340


912
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,520
He's a guy sitting over there.

913
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,420
Well, maybe I should go back to the script.

914
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,920
But I know what you're thinking.

915
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,460
Oh, yeah, everything's okay now.

916
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,280
Yeah, we've got a liberal president.

917
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,260
Oh, yeah, Bill Clinton's going to save everything.

918
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah, the liberals will take care of everything.

919
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:13,340
What kind of a pie in the sky, I'm okay, you're okay, tree-hugging, crystal-headed, born

920
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,290
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

921
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,130
Everything is beautiful.

922
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,730
Airhead, are you?

923
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,490
I wouldn't even bother spitting on your grave when we all become victims of the upcoming

924
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,070
Nazi death state.

925
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,710
Oh, a grave.

926
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,210
Oh, you flatter yourself with a grave.

927
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:41,790
Oh, what kind of looking through the world through rose-colored glasses optimist are

928
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,390
you to think that you would have a grave?

929
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


930
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


931
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


932
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


933
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


934
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


935
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


936
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


937
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


938
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


939
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


940
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


941
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:43,390


942
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:50,050
I wouldn't even bother spitting on the open trench that they bulldoze you and 10,000 other

943
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:56,230
skeleton-like bodies into when we all become victims of the upcoming Nazi death state.

944
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,050
Ah.

945
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,270
Someone turn off the Jainer device.

946
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,410
I think Jainer needs a script that's a much higher potency.

947
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,870
Wait a minute, that's Jainer at the door.

948
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,110
The news is at the microphone.

949
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,770
I'm the type of person who uses a script in real life and does improv on stage.

950
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,990
Get me out of here.

951
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,390
I don't know.

952
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,290
But if that's Jainer on the mic, then...

953
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,670
The next line is, you've been a lousy audience.

954
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,610
Who's that?

955
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,090
Who's that?

956
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,930
And that's Mike on Jainer.

957
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,250
Yeah, Maureen jokes now.

958
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,790
Where is Mike?

959
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,650
Oh, he's out there talking to Philo.

960
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,150
Reverend Mike.

961
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,330
Not enough alienating stuff.

962
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,510
Philo's here?

963
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,630
Philo's here?

964
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,870
Philo!

965
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,290
Did Philo take Reverend Mike and do something with him?

966
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:36,950
He's invisible.

967
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,730
Fetch, Philo, fetch.

968
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,130
He's like that.

969
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,930
He just does that.

970
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,570
You have to pull him off and bring him in here.

971
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,650
With him or to him?

972
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:42,630
Like, figure out what he did.

973
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,050
Just look around.

974
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:43,950
He's got a little tail out there.

975
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,430
Roll over.

976
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,050
Who doesn't have a little tail in here?

977
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,870
Horns, too.

978
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,110
Well, I had to think about that one.

979
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:53,890
We would answer that, but, you know, FCC rules.

980
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,710
You radio listeners should be aware that Reverend Susie the Floozy is sitting in here looking

981
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,330
really gorgeous with a devil babe outfit on.

982
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,350
We're all fabulous.

983
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,430
We're all lovely.

984
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:07,810
Calipaginous.

985
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,530
Especially right-minded listeners.

986
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,410
Floating out in front of us.

987
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,530
Don't you wish you could see it?

988
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,750
It's a 69-centimeter-long, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

989
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,950
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

990
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:17,130
We rode in here on a blissful tsunami of slack.

991
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:26,070
You know this radio show is colorized and comes in three-dimensional sound.

992
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,330
Sodomize for your protection.

993
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,550
What does that sound like on a black-and-white radio?

994
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:31,730
It sounds pretty good.

995
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,730
You can see it, sort of.

996
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,850
But funny on the steam-driven ones.

997
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,310
But it's colorized, black-and-white colorized.

998
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:40,450
Yeah, on steam-driven computers we write the show with, of course...

999
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,690
Oh, but I said to the guy he goes up to the 30th floor, and he goes up to the 21st floor.

1000
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:42,730
But he's like a comic book author.

1001
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:42,730


1002
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:42,730


1003
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:42,730


1004
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:42,730


1005
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,110
guy went up to the 57th guy but i can't remember the punchline.

1006
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,210
i said doc it hurts whenever i do this he said just keep on doing that

1007
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:57,510
i said yeah he goes well you you still have it

1008
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,010
go beyond some mere conspiracy of third concept of

1009
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:10,410
assertiveness become outright out and out obnoxious downright belligerent

1010
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:23,230
oh god i know that i am a righteous god i know that i am a loving and just god that is why i

1011
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:31,090
know that you will allow me on x day 1998 to pour rock salt and ground up glass into the gaping open

1012
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,630
wounds of the people i went to junior high school and high school with

1013
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,630
yeah

1014
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,730
you know if you just ignore just give me a deer carcass or maybe they would be with a tree stump

1015
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,010
a knot hole i think it's unfair for you to discriminate on these people based on their

1016
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:57,350
prior who needs sexual orientation i'm not that interested in women hey you better watch me girls

1017

have been out in the woods for three days i ain't had nothing but not holding deer carcasses i'm

1018
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:10,790
desperate those deer carcasses are damn good though he said linen and trotsky that stopped

1023
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,330
okay get back to the spirit when does the show start

1024
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,150
oh i don't know and i don't care

1025
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,350
are we finished cutting up or are we going to start trying to be funny now

1026
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,970
is this the part where they do the launching is this a head launch we're going to launch a head

1027
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,850
over the radio ahead yeah we could just we could just fake it they don't even know if we even have

1028
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,730
a head you guys gonna launch it is lining up for that man i don't know if we're gonna do this all

1029
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:47,930
the pot no yes i guess they're launching oh there is a hand yes oh this isn't all about phony

1030
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,370
and it's flying across the unfair way there it goes

1031
00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:02,450
close up on the head it's on the 999th green and it's rolling toward the hole and ow it missed

1032
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:08,650
hole in not one another interesting side not hole in one rocket fuel in this one with the

1033
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:15,330
nuclear warheads the nuclear warhead though arnold palmer forces are firing the forces

00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:22,270
the trevinas have just entered the battle yes and arnold palmer's forces are trying to retrieve the

1035
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,870

the trunks of the trees there i mean you can't just see f agents the trees are wearing trunks

1040
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:52,690
i like that i mean you can't just cut off the head of anyone that plays golf and then launch

1041
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,490
it and say oh i launched a golfer head i mean my uncle plays golf but he's not a golfer he's

1042
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:02,230
an insurance salesman he just plays golf on sundays you can't just cut his head off and

1043
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:08,330
launch it and go oh i watched the head well you you tried though how did how did that work well it

1045
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:18,290
professional golfer or at least someone that's done you know some

1046
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,850
of the major tournaments to call it an actual golfer head launching

1047
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:31,790
uh yes dear friends yeah because i couldn't find anything appropriate to cut to after that

1048
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:37,510
i should explain what's going on here uh you and me both are listening for the first time to

1049
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:45,710
from our subgenius devival radio show and panel discussions in Atlanta last week

1050
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:52,110
during the DragonCon science fiction and Betty Page convention there,

1051
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:56,310
and associated WREK Atlanta broadcasts,

1052
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:04,310
where, due largely to the efforts of Reverend Susie the Floozy and Lamar,

1053
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:12,070
we were able to effect a gathering of church hierarchites such as Puzzling Evidence,

1054
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:16,130
Father Joe Mama, St. Janer Hypercletes,

1055
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:22,230
and last but not least, friends, the swinging love corpses

1056
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:27,670
complete with Dr. Philo Drummond, the most horrible overman alive.

1057
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:34,290
And so much oral bewondermint resulted from this particular story

1058
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,850
subgenius conflagration that next week's show will probably be more of the same.

1059
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:46,050
It was a capper event to a pretty busy month for yours truly,

1060
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,650
Reverend Ivan Stang, dear friends.

1061
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:58,150
While poor old St. Palmer Vredes has slaved away on the final chapters of our new book, Revelation X,

1062
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,050
I've been gallivanting around all July.

1063
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,290
Performed a really tough...

1064
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,810
touching, long-duration-style marriage in Chicago,

1065
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,170
and then attended the X-Day pilgrimage in Portland,

1066
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,550
and the 9th annual subgenius revolval in Seattle,

1067
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,310
which were...

1068
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:23,190
Well, I had a great time with Mr. and Mrs. Nenslow and Dr. Onan,

1069
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,270
and Dr. Howell, and Dr. Hosler from Negative Land,

1070
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:32,370
and all those wonderful espresso-drinking West Coast beatniks,

1071
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:33,250
and...

1072
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,410
I just got back from this Atlanta shindig,

1073
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:44,050
and why, tomorrow, I leave for the denuded, paganistical outdoor campout conclave called Starwood.

1074
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,270
So, uh...

1075
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:54,150
You better believe, my friend, that this particular show and the next one, actually,

1076
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:02,090
are being thrown together in this brief interim in the home throne office here in Dallas.

1077
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,190
But enough holy gossip!

1078
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:13,850
Let's get back to the Swingin' Love Corpses live concert at the Atlanta DragonCon Geek Festival.

1079
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,890
Okay, nothing's getting around now.

1080
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,330
I've been dancing in June!

1081
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:21,870
What?

1082
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:22,730
What?

1083
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,190
What?

1084
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:25,630
What?

1085
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:25,730
What?

1086
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,010
What?

1087
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:28,110
What?

1088
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:28,450


1089
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:29,750
What?

1090
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:29,970
What?

1091
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:30,410
What?

1092
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:30,410


1093
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,570
What?

1094
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,310
What?

1095
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,830
What?

1096
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,410
What?

1097
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:52,670
What?

1098
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:54,250
Oh!

1099
00:48:56,190 --> 00:48:56,310
I said go ahead and sieee...

1100
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,710
Indeed then!

1101
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,250
Oh!

1102
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,250


1103
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,250


1104
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,010
Nothing further from the expectations of the Hed куда idle ly thou marry operas con rings?

1105
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:01,070


1106
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:04,290
I, you old 인�er who ball

1126
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,850
In your mind, it's a stream of unconsciousness.

1127
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,090
Stream of subconsciousness.

1128
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:09,150
Stand-up tragedy.

1129
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,990
Turn that just a little bit louder.

1130
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:16,710
I just think everyone should know that we do have a sales booth

1131
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,390
at the science fiction convention at the Hilton.

1132
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,130
And we are selling out.

1133
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,050
Now, wait a minute.

1134
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,570
Before we go on, let's get this clear.

1135
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,330
We don't want to promote the sales booth.

1136
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,010
We don't want to promote the 900 number.

1137
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,590
Don't forget the 900 number.

1138
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,270
We don't want to promote the new book.

1139
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:32,050
Don't talk about the new book.

1140
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,090
Don't talk about Best of Jane or Hyperclete Tapes 133,

1141
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,250
Doctors of Rob's Respect.

1142
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,690
Don't think about the uncut Hour of Slack episode.

1143
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,370
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

1144
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,090
Yeah, right.

1145
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,670
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1146
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:55,930
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1147
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:59,650
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1148
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,030
Bob, Post Office Box 118.

1149
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,250
140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1150
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:13,590
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1151
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,550
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1152
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:29,850
Jane-er was a rabid, a rabid hate mom.

1153
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:30,450
A rabid, yeah.

1154
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,630
He carried a soul in his...

1155
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,830
A sadistic hatred towards the whole world.

1156
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:35,970
Even the other cult members detested him.

1157
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:37,690
That's what I was counting on,

1158
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:42,010
because I had picked Jane-er Hyperclete as my fall guy.

1159
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:43,650
I'm talking about hate.

1160
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:47,210
I'm talking about a level of hate that would make the average person's hate

1161
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,850
look like Phyllis Shafley's The Total Woman.

1162
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:53,010
I'm talking about a level of hate that would make your hate

1163
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:55,570
look like a Pat Robertson prayer retreat.

1164
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:58,930
I'm talking about a level of hate that would make your hate

1165
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,970
look like a New Age potluck.

1166
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:02,630
I'm talking about hate.

1167
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,330
But what are you talking about?

1168
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:06,130
I don't get it.

1169
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,350
But it doesn't make any sense.

1170
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,730
How can I talk to people in modern day America about hate?

1171
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:10,070
Oh, I get it.

1172
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:10,730
It's a parody.

1173
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:11,370
It's really...

1174
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:16,310
You don't even know what hate is, but that's like talking to a fish about water.

1175
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,670
You have nothing to contrast it against.

1176
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:20,010
I don't get this.

1177
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,410
Are you saying that you don't like other people?

1178
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,050
With the right gravy.

1179
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,930
Well, see, I hate hate, which means I like people.

1180
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,610
You're insecurity with it.

1181
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:31,890
You're insecurity with yourself.

1182
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:35,570
See, if you would just come to grips with the fact that you're an imperfect human...

1183
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,050
Latch onto that hunker.

1184
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,350
Deal with it.

1185
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:42,910
No, only a person who does not hate himself can truly hate everyone else.

1186
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,490
But, Jayner, Jesus loves you.

1187
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,950
It's just that everyone else thinks you're total ass.

1188
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:48,990
Wow, here he is now.

1189
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:49,210
Jesus.

1190
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:51,070
This is Ivan Stang.

1191
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,710
This is Jayner Hyperglitz.

1192
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,590
This is Papa Joe Mama, and I'm Postling Evidence.

1193
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:55,830
Hey, you got any words for us?

1194
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,250
Yes.

1195
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,250
Who plays Jesus now?

1196
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,590
Yes, you see, I am Jesus Christ, and all you have to do is say,

1197
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:01,590


1198
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,190
I am Jesus Christ, and all you have to do is confess your sins to me,

1199
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:09,050
and I can forgive you and give entrance to anyone into the kingdom of heaven.

1200
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,090
Could you get me backstage to heaven, please?

1201
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,690
Anyone except for you guys.

1202
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,270
I've just got to meet him.

1203
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:15,870
You've gone too far.

1204
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:16,810
I've got all those records.

1205
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,830
What is the unforgivable sin?

1206
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:20,110
I thought about finding those.

1207
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:23,270
Is there a sin you just commit and then you just pull the lever and down you go?

1208
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:25,350
What is that unforgivable sin?

1209
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:26,550
This show.

1210
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,010
Well, besides that, it's Butterfingers.

1211
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,210
We're going to have to actually do, you know, get ready.

1212
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:32,550
We're going to go on in just ten minutes.

1213
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,570
We've got to straighten up.

1214
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,890
I'm not ready for this.

1215
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,450
Which radio show, what city are we in?

1216
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:40,650
Which radio show is this?

1217
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:42,110
Which character am I?

1218
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,270
I'm drawing up an outline here.

1219
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:47,370
Are we in geostationary orbit or are we still?

1220
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,090
Okay, I'll tell you what.

1221
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,150
I'll come in like I was late.

1222
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,550
In latitude and longitude.

1223
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:56,530
Why don't I stay out so that, you know, you all start off and then I come in late,

1224
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,110
and then like I pretend like I was left behind and we can kind of joke about that.

1225
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:00,630
No, just keep doing what you've been doing.

1226
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,850
Be the straight man, not saying anything funny.

1227
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,510
You've been real good at that all night.

1228
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,370
Well, I could do that.

1229
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,430
You've built a career on that.

1230
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,470
That would probably help you seem funnier than you really are.

1231
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,110
Yeah.

1232
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:15,290
Well, you know, I think what you really do best is kind of like an Ed Woods thing.

1233
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,790
I mean, the stuff you do is so bad, it's just laughable.

1234
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:26,030
I just love it because, I mean, those parodies of Ed Woods and Al Ackerman that you do,

1235
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,490
that just crack me up.

1236
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,650
You think Ed Woods is making a mistake.

1237
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:33,590
I happen to think that he was deliberately making it bad so bad that it would be good.

1238
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,170
It's easy to do things good and it's easy to do things bad.

1239
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,370
Yeah, but see, he even did...

1240
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,550
That was the way Dobbs did it.

1241
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,330
You see, he even did that badly.

1242
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:45,530
So that came, his concept of good-bad came out bad, but then that badness was good,

1243
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,530
so it's like a double reverse psychology of a reverse double.

1244
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:50,790
All these normals running around saying, oh, he's a genius, he's a genius.

1245
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:51,370
What do they know?

1246
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,270
It takes a genius to recognize a genius.

1247
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,370
It takes one to know one.

1248
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,710
If they say they're a genius, that means they're an amateur.

1249
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:58,550
It takes one to kill one.

1250
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,990
Only a true genius understands.

1251
01:00:59,130 --> 01:00:59,630
Oh, my God.

1252
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:00,570
True geniushood.

1253
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,070
That's why I understand Ed Woods, and you don't know what you're talking about.

1254
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:07,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

1255
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:11,170
I just realized that if there were just...

1256
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:16,850
more people could understand my inherent superiority over all other beings,

1257
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,530
it would be such a simpler world.

1258
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,610
It could straighten everything out, but...

1259
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:22,910
Look into my eyes, Jayner.

1260
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:23,910
But that would be...

1261
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,370
Look into my eyes.

1262
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,510
But you don't have any eyes.

1263
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:28,350
They were...

1264
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,490
They're no eyes.

1265
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:29,490


1266
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,330
You are inlaid in them.

1267
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:34,610
You're a mirror, Jayner.

1268
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:36,010
Look into my eyes.

1269
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1270
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1271
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1272
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1273
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1274
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1275
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,010


1276
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:36,590
Supernatural?

1277
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,510
Perhaps.

1278
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:38,630
Bologna?

1279
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:39,050
Perhaps.

1280
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:40,190
That is a supernatural.

1281
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:41,610
Who comes that out?

1282
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,030
Suzie.

1283
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,250
Suzie, it's so good to be in the station with you.

1284
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:51,690
Oh, it's so nice to give you a radio station, Reverend Stang.

1285
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,410
To do our evil work.

1286
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,830
Yes, we can gang bang her now.

1287
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,250
That would be part of the joke.

1288
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:58,330
Yes, it would.

1289
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:58,330


1290
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,110
part of this because we're on the radio that would be part of the satire
