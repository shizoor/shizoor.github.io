And come on in.
To the hour of slack.
Come on.
Just step right in, dear friends.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
One, two, three, four.
Better lock your door.
Five, six, get a crinkled little stick.
Seven, eight, better stay up late.
Nine, ten, and Bob's coming again.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
We like you and should ignore you.
But instead, welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.
The hour of slack.
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.
Slack.

Slack.
Slack. Slack. Slack. Slack. Sl 완전yyy.
End of the world Hoe.
Slack. Slack. Sl reacted it and walked away.

Sl is stupid business...



Bull desde.


Thank you.
Thank you.
An hour of slack presented here by K&ON in this case.
In this case.
Oh, dear friends, it's Halloween time.
Halloweeny.
It's coming up on Halloweeny time.
It's a Halloweeny day.
A fun time.
You know, my family has worshipped certain religious holidays,
and we observe this holiday above all others, as you may well have guessed by now.
Well, Halloween is the only one where all the pink,
just have to go out and act like subgeniuses.
Oh, yes.
Where the monster fans rule.
And, well, we'll be getting into that a little bit later.
Not only that, but tonight, tonight is the anniversary,
the 50th anniversary of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast.
Ah, that great radio broadcast that proved for once and for all
that the pinks will believe anything.
And we're going to try to make them believe that very thing tonight.
Ah, it was a wonderful thing.
And, you know, at one point I thought, why, we should do a takeoff.
A silly, funny takeoff on the War of the Worlds thing.
But then I realized, no, Martian invasion isn't, I mean, friends, there are far worse things awaiting us.
There are far worse things awaiting us.

There are far worse things awaiting us.


On November 7th, you'll find out just how bad those things are.
But, well, we'll get into the really scary stuff.
The love of horror.
Horror tonight.
Ah, yes.
Because we love Halloween so much.
And Halloween is the truest holiday, you know.
It's more true on Halloween than it is on Christmas.
Sorry, it's not that the devil is more powerful. It's just that he's a better
tempter, you know, and so is Bob.
Oh, no, no, that was the old tape, dear friends.
That was the old, old, old, old tape.
Yes, we're here.
We're reading you.
We're reading.
And, well, oh, sorry, friend.
Tired, beat.
It wasn't November 7th we met.
It was October 29th.
It was hell.
It was hell.
I just got back from doing a show at Bennington College, and they'll never be able
to do it.
They can't say the subgeniuses are a bunch of wimps.
I ended up physically throwing four or five, like, drunk people off the stage or wherever
it was they ended up finally forcing us to.
It'll go down in subgenius legend.
I might play a little bit of the tape of that.
Yeah, every now and then, somebody books the church into, or a church preacher into a place
where they really just want to get drunk.
And dance to Madonna.
And they make that real clear sometimes.
I don't like them trying to tell me that when I'm in the middle of delivering the word of
Bob.
No, sir.
You don't mess with Reverend Stang when he's in the spirit.
He'll whack you.
But, well, I've been wearing my Bob mask all evening.
It's Halloween in Dallas, friends.
It may not be Halloween anymore in Atlanta or Cleveland or Rochester or Chicago.
But it's still Halloween here.
And my lovely thing, Civet, came into the station with us.
We've been out trick-or-treating.
How's your candy?
Have you gone through the candy yet?
I found a couple razor blades.
Huh?
I found a couple razor blades.
Oh, good, good.
How about the, what was that bit?
Did you ever figure out what that bitter powder was on those gumballs?
No.
I thought it was sugar.




Sugar.
Now, you said that somebody gave you a little tiny square of paper that had Mickey Mouse
on it when you were trick-or-treating?
Yeah, I licked it and I put it on a piece of paper as a stamp.
Oh, okay, okay.
Let me mail that one for you, okay, darling?
Well, so we're counting out our candy loot here.
And luckily, Sister Susie the Floozy did a Halloween show a couple of weeks ago in Atlanta,
which happened.
And if anything happened and she was to just throw it to thezenia, a little doll, she
might know what that is, but maybe it's because she loves Lucy.
We'll let a little trick or treat follow.


Sorry,flea.
Don't cut that in, skewer this chicken.
To punctuous it until it's eaten and mostly nothing, because without food she'd spell
out sign language.
And also, if your mom knows that, she'd say,
I hope she gets some milk.
Change of plan,larm.

Hey, don't snoop down.
in it. Hey, um, you don't want to do that commercial, do you? You're going to do it?
Okay. Here goes, friends. Here's a subgenius rant. You won't get too many hours of slack.
What the hell do you think you're doing dragging your butt through the day selling body and
soul to a bunch of plain normals acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them? Tired
of getting all the guilt but none of the sex? There's a simple answer, dear friend. A glowing
beacon of slack against the turmoil and darkness that stare above dogs in the church of the
subgenius. It's us versus them. You're going to pull the wool over your own eyes, set Bob
into your mind, repent, quit your job, slack off, surprise Bob.
But that's my daughter. She's going to be the new Marjo, friends. New Marjo. I won't
have to beat her anymore to make her learn.
Well, son, let me tell you, I'm so pleased to meet you. The boys and I've been expecting
to greet you. I'll get some honor in the house of the dead. Just relax, lay yourself
down, say goodbye to your head.
Hidey, hidey, hide. Hidey, hidey, hide.
Ho, dee, ho, dee, ho. Ho, dee, ho, dee, ho.
Wadi, wadi, wadi. Wadi, wadi, wadi.
Hidey, hidey, ho. Hidey, hidey, ho.
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hide.
Please, Mr. Devil, it's not for me I'm pleading. If you help Renee and Frenchie, I'll give
you what you're needing.
If you want to bargain and produce something real, deliver me the French that boy and you've
got a deal.
You never had the precious boy that you've got a deal.
Okay.
Oh, skeep-dop-doop-dop-dee-doo.
Skeep-dop-doop-dop-dee-doo.
Skeep-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dop-dee-dop.
Skeep-dop-dee-dop-dee-dop-dee-dop.
Oh, da-da-da-da-da-dee-oh.
Oh, da-da-da-da-da-dee-oh.
Hidey, hidey, ho.
Hidey, hidey, ho.
Congratulations, son, you really deliver.
This little gal makes me shake and shiver.
Don't you got forgotten all the things that I've said?
Don't worry about your friends.
Relax.
Now off with his head.
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.
Hidey, hidey, ho.
Deed-de-deed-dee.
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Be nice to me, babe, or you'll regret it
You are my hostage and don't you forget it
The night is early and there's lots to be done
Let's boogie now, come on, we're gonna have some fun
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
Whoa!
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy
I like practise, I'm recite

Say you're great, you will still help
Throw in another fool's mound
Done some checks, you don't plate
superhero money
Some men they sc provoc
Oh!
Oh!
Just a little Peck
Say your husband still drinks
Your cat is trying to sing
I could put you off, could you shake?
Now you're up, don't you know what?
You're a zombie, zombie
Dance and dance with the tranching wheels
Stop some of that, kick it in
Shake it hard, shake it thin
Shake those balls right on your skin
Hey, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy
Shake, shake, shake
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake
Now get around while I lose the date
And what goes on when it gets late
Along about midnight the ghost and banshees
Get together for a jamboree
There's a ghost with a jamboree
Horns and saucer eyes
Some have fangs about this size
Some short and fat, some tall and thin
And some don't even bother to wear their skin
I'm a-telling you, brother, it's a fearful sight
Just to see what goes on in the night
When the spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with a fiendish plea
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed
Is the headless horse
Man, he's the worst
When he goes jogging across the land
Holding his noggin right in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
Then they hit the road, pop, farts unknown
Well, there's no rage like a spook that's burned
The ghost don't like him and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
Well, I'll show them that I can get ahead
Do-do-do-wow, wow, wow, wow, wow
So close all the windows
Lock all the doors
Unless you're careful, he'll get yours
Don't think he'll hesitate a bit
Cause if you flip your top, his head will fit
He likes them little, he likes them big
Put them in the middle or wear a wig
Black or white or even red
The headless horseman needs a head
With a hip, hip, hip and a clippity-clop
Why, he's out looking for a head to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
Cause you can reason with a headless man
With a hip, hip, hop and a clippity-clop
Look out!
You know what we're talking about
Believe me
Do-do-do-do-do
You better watch your cues
But take a look at the people
Who ignored the old good book
Change your ways, you'll find it safe
Cause you can't be a hank if you ain't
Good
Kinda crazy, I guess you'd say
Take our word, we know what we're talking about
Now this is a pretty spooky thing we're doing here
You don't mind if I turn on another light, do you?
Hmm?
Ooh, boy, that was refreshing
Hey, if the headless horseman wants a head
All he has to do is join this church
We got lots of heads here
We got the super sacred dog
And the bobs head
The pumpkin version of which is beaming
It's mirroring visage all over us
And there's the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer
Which is, oh, that's a ritual all in itself
You oughta see that bloody neck stump
Arcing over the greedy leaping hands of the audience
Oh, it's like beach blanket gone bad
Oh, and the other things you heard was
Birdsong by Lena Lovitch
It was a love song, but everything she sings
Makes it sound like it's straight from a funeral
Squeeze at the bottom of the head of Arnold Palmer

And the moochers from the soundtrack of The Forbidden Zone
That was Danny Elfman in one of his early works
Also in The Forbidden Zone
There appeared the mystic knights of the Oingo Boingo
That was before they shortened their name
After that it was Zombie Samba
By the world famous pajama slave dancers
And Headless Horseman by Kay Stark
But, oh, there's a head in here
And it is so expanded
Oh, let's crawl in this giant ear here
And see what's kicking
Oh, my
Oh, Susie
You are listening to WREK
Oh, yeah, what?
No, it's, um
Where we are questioning authority
Question authority
Question the hell out of authority
Question the friggin' name of authority
Question hell out of every kind of authority
There is, or ever was, or ever could be
Question authority here, over there
Everywhere you go, everywhere anyone goes
Question authority
Question the authority of anyone who professes blind allegiance to any authority
Question those who follow leaders without question
Don't follow leaders, watch your parking leaders
Question all those who accept without question supreme authority of any book, text, or dogma
Question anyone with a deeply felt or long-held devotion to any form of authority
Question anyone who loves authority or who loves anyone in authority
Question anyone who loves the thought of being in love with authority
And dearly loves all people in authority
Question all those who are powerfully and easily swayed by appeals to sentiment, patriotism, and tradition
Powerful forms of pride quickly become negatives
Not because of what they lovingly embrace
And uphold
But because of what they sneeringly despise and downgrade
Be highly suspicious of all those who get misty-eyed
While watching parades of anything besides clowns
Question the authority of every religion that suddenly sounds very political
And every political party that suddenly sounds very religious
Question all politicians who used to be preachers
And all preachers who used to be politicians
Avoid like hell every grinning, yapping TV pundit
And all the president named Pat
Question authority's right to be in authority
Question the divine right of kings and popes
Question the constitutionality of presidents and prime ministers
Question the legitimacy of all self-appointed pubas
Of any and all ad hoc committees
Appointed to preserve, protect, and defend the precious, self-evident, anality of our United States of normality
And especially question the hell out of the so-called legitimacy
The so-called constitutionality
The so-called humanity, sanity, and basic rights of all people
The so-called democracy, freedom, and freedom of speech
And the so-called accuracy of the world
The so-called egotism
The so-called
The so-called
The so-called
The so-called
The so-called
Question any person or any institution who opposes or flees from dissent, divergence, diversity, creativity, or free thought.
Remember free thought?
Question every thought, every word, every deed in human experience and in the human imagination.
Question yourself continually.
Question your own questions.
Question every single word I am saying.
Question authority.
Question the hell out of authority.
Question the friggin' hell out of every kind of authority there is or ever was or ever could be.
Question authority here, over there, everywhere you go, everywhere anyone goes.
Question authority.
Look, up in the sky.
A single dramatic piece of the mosaic becomes in the minds of millions the entire picture.
Would you believe me if I told you?
It's worse than I thought.
It is basically the nation.
It's the people.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you and welcome to Let's Make a Deal.
It's worse than I thought.
The guiding light.
Thank you.
Thank you and welcome to Let's Make a Deal.
It is basically the nation.
It's the people.
It's worse than I thought.
People are falling off all the time.
Therefore, some people must be walking on it upside down.
People are falling off all the time.
Why is it that these people do not fall off?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Therefore, some people must be walking on it upside down.
People are falling off all the time.
Every Grinch down in Grinchville liked Halloween a lot.
But the Who that lived just north of Grinchville did not.
The Who hated Halloween.
The whole Halloween season.
No one quite knows the reason.
It could be that he lost a big bet and had an unbelievable gambling debt.
Or it could be that his underwear was too tight and he was desperate to get laid that night.
But whatever the reason, groin itches or wallet pinches,
he stood there on Halloween hating the Grinchies.
Staring down from his cave was a sour-hued frown
at the warm-lighted pumpkins below in their town.
For he knew every Grinch.
The Grinch down in Grinchville beneath was busy now hanging someone
capped with a thorny Halloween wreath.
He snarled with his fundamentalist fingers nervously drumming,
I must find some way to keep Halloween from coming.
The Who had quite a vivid imagination,
but for only one thing, he had a morbid fixation,
which was a full-time occupation of hating other people's imaginations.
All the Grinch girls and boys will be carving their
Halloween toys, imagine The Who.
Hundreds of grotesque dolls for voodoo,
and fashioning enormous piles of fake dog doodoo.
Then the Grinch's young and old will sit down to a feast.
The young will feast on the old, and they'll feast, feast, feast, feast, feast.
Then they'll do something I hate most of all, said The Who.
Every Grinch down in Grinchville, the tall and the small,
will burn down the local Baptist church, dismember the pastor,
and sacrifice his liver on an altar to Satan.
The Who's self-righteous indignation knew no end.
He made it his whole life, because he had not a friend.
Then The Who got an idea, an awful idea.
The Who got an evangelical awful idea.
I know just what to do, The Who laughed in his throat.
I'll drill a few holes in their hellfire boat.
I'll fill their dark passions with something mind-numbing.
This year I'll stop Halloween from coming.
Then dressing up as a mass-murdering psychotic clown,
The Who infiltrated the Grinchville town.
He stole all their glow-in-the-dark skeletons,
their Dobbshead pumpkins, and old recordings of Monster Mash.
He took all their candles, their Ouija boards and cash,
and the last thing The Who took was the last of their frock stash.
But Halloween came,
and it came just the same, and it came again and again.
How could it be so, mused The Who?
It came without plastic pirate hats and cardboard black cats.
It came without Frankenstein and Dracula's ghost.
It came without trance chandlers flown in from the coast.
Halloween came. It came just the same.
It came without devils and witches and hags.
It came without commies, new-agers and fags.
The Who puzzled and puzzled,
till his puzzler was sore.
Then The Who thought of something he hadn't before.
Maybe, just maybe, Halloween isn't a liberal-inspired,
devil-worshipping conspiracy to dupe the youth of our nation
into rejecting the ultra-conservative, fundamentalist Christian agenda.
Maybe Halloween, perhaps, means a little bit more.
And in Grinchville, they say,
The Who's brain grew three sizes that day,
and his penis grew five sizes, guaranteed.
And the next day, then the true meaning of Halloween came through.
And The Who found the slack of ten Grinches plus two.
Welcome, Halloween. Bring your weirdness.
Weirdness to all Grinches far and near.
Halloween will ever soar as long as M-80s blow down your door.
Welcome, children of the night, with hearts and minds so dark and bright.
Halloween is in our grasp,
as long as we have blood sacrifices to clasp.
Halloween will always be, just as long as we have perversity.
Welcome, Halloween, while we stand,
hand cut off and heart in hand.
Oh, my.
Oh, that was so pithy.
Whew.

Let's have some Laika and the Cosmonauts,
a Finnish surfability band that the Reverend Rex Reverb turned us on to.

That's my girl.
My little daughter.
She's so sweet.
Give me one more kiss, baby..

Yes, yes, yes.
Well, let's see what happened what what next we
We actually don't know half the time. We don't know what it's going to be. Well, it'll be this

From the secret Marines based near a nudist camp outside of Fort Dix took me to Morristown to have my eyes examined
We sat in the waiting room for almost an hour nervously thumbing through the magazines
Highlights Goofus and Gallant was my favorite while trying to ignore the occasional muffled screams. We could hear coming through the wall
I remember watching daddy salute some old photo of President
Eisenhower in one of the mags and thinking how I could have looked better with lipstick and one of those propellers
I was like oh my god. I'm gonna be a
He would have looked like some giant glob of monosodium glutamate
Hydrogenated dude
When my time arrived I went into the doctor's office alone
There was a folding chair over to the side and the doc said he'd be right with me as soon as he was finished with
This last patient his patient was some gray hair clean-cut middle-aged man who appeared to have a pleasant disposition
He smiled at me and called me lad and I liked that
The nice man looked through this big machine that looked like it came from Mars and started reciting letters from the alphabet to mr.
Eye doctor when the doc pulled the machine away the nice man leaned forward
Opened his mouth wide and literally bit off the Doc's entire face
Swinging the now lifeless skin back and forth in his mouth like a dog and the dog blood sprayed all over my mom's
Maybe t-shirt the Doc's eyes were dangling in every which way and direction
and his
Nose was totally gone his teeth looked like a skeleton, but with tons and tons of pulsating blood flowing from all the torn muscle tissue
He had a ghastly kind of skeletal smile as he gurgled and moaned and knocked into the machines
Breaking a lot of glass and making a real mess
The nice man in the chair spit out Doc's face and began swinging from the overhead hanging light fixtures like a chimpanzee
laughing hysterically
somehow the Doc still had a
Glasses on with the blood squirting all over the inside of the lenses
He needed those funny trick glasses with the battery operated windshield wipers on him except on the inside
The Doc kind of reminded me of that photo of old Ike, but much more animated and colorful
The nice man soon dropped to the floor pushed the Doc aside and ran out into the street right in front of a speeding bus
Which squashed him like a great?
His glasses flew off just in time
In the nick of time however into the gutter my daddy always prudent quickly ran over to the puddle that remained of the nice man
And picked up his glasses pleased with himself he approached me and carefully placed them on my face a
Perfect fit I could see so clearly too and without daddy having to spend a penny

I managed to get officers to blunder what to do
Looks like I was waiting too long for the great � pool

this is the great zoogs riff
This lovely little lilting tune,
Secret Marines Sex Kitten Party,
from Zug's Riff's album, Torment.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Oh, I feel Halloween-y all over.
I feel all orange and black.
Oh, great things happen this time of year.
Let's not just relegate it to one day.
Let's let Halloween be every day,
every morning when we wake up, say,
it's Halloween, baby.
So put on those false faces
and get out there.
And as the great wings
flapped off into the distance,
the lights in the house came on,
the stars came out,
the scariest Halloween ever was over.
We humans do not see with our eyes
or hear with our ears,
but that we both see and hear
with our minds.
People laugh.
People laugh at it because it did appear to be a joke.
Good, I'm gonna walk your mind.
Good, I'm gonna walk your mind.
Remember, your mind is a rich storehouse of images.
You will instruct your mind to do what you want.
You will instruct your mind to do what you want.
You will instruct your mind to do what you want.
So now I've learned to love women,
and miracle of miracles,
some of them have learned to love me.
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.
That's love.
She was the town's bad girl when she came.
She was the town's bad girl when she came.
An alcoholic and a thief at 14.
You ought to see her now.
She's got a light around her.
It's a terrific drag lady. She's still with the smoke, and it's a great day.
It's a terrific drag lady. She's still with the smoke, and it's a great day.
She's not quite to the pouring mass,
it's all the humanity...
Close your eyes, and relax yourself in the usual way.
Close your eyes, and relax yourself in the usual way.

Picture yourself standing out of doors
Picture yourself standing out of doors
in a meadow on a warm summer afternoon.
You look up.
The sky is bright blue
with large, fluffy clouds drifting overhead.

Allow yourself to fully experience
this pleasant, outward experience.
door seams. Walk a bit, enjoying the lovely day. For some reason, a trampoline is sitting
in the meadow. And climb up on the trampoline. You begin to jump up and down on it. Feel
the mild sensation of freedom and unrestraint as you begin to bounce. Experience the liberating,
flying sensation as you bounce higher and higher. Continue to bounce up and up. Spread
your arms and feel the wonderful warm wind rushing past as you bounce even higher.
Enjoy the feeling and look about you at the scene below as you bounce higher and higher,
way above the trees.
You're just slacking off, you're just back to me. I wish I could slice over your head
no matter where you are, one at a time. And I could take out your tape and program into
believing you only want me so much, or you only can have so much confidence. And if I
could take over your mind for 30 days, and you do exactly like I told you, you'd be the

strongest, and I'd be sparking a flame.
The difference between singing like Frank Sinatra and being Frank Sinatra singing. Try
it and you'll see what I mean.
To breathe and how often. What to think and how to express it. Whom to know, what to wear,
what to study.
Then I would take Ben's dream to get me up. Somewhat later not much, liquor to keep me
up. And then, sleeping pills to knock me out.
Well this makes the difference.
It's a very short day.
It's a very powerful tool. Try it.
Try the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.
That lovely piece just there, just then, was by Reverend Susie the Floozy and Oh Brother Jeff.
Something called Mind Tree.
I figured it out.
Oh, no, I know you figured it out, Susie, but we can't let you tell them about it.
No, I can't believe what you dared to say to begin with on the radio.
It's all right, it's all right.
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.
That must be all right.
You know, things are different in my day.
I mean, these kids these days, they walk around like they were zombies.
I mean, that's what really makes me mad.
Back when I was a zombie, things were a little bit different.
When we rose from the dead, it was at 6 a.m., not noon.
We ate the flesh of a young woman's corpse.
We did it with respect, respect for the woman and respect for the corpse.
And kids these days are walking around with just computerized this, that, video games.
I remember back in my day, just to iron clothes.
We just had to heat our hands up over a stove and then just rub your hot hand over the clothes.
I mean...
Well, it's all these...
Body eating has made people spoiled.
Yeah, I remember back in my day, just to even walk to school in the morning,
I had to walk across the surface of the sun while swallowing fish hooks.
So that'll...
That was on a cold day, too.
Yeah, in a snowstorm.
You know, the trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken to pick.
Like this fowl I plucked the other day.
Look how plump and funny.
I had to put it out of its misery, but it looks so funny in its little bag.
You can trick and kick that chicken, but you've got the right chicken.
You've got the right chicken to pick.
Yeah.
Well, we'll let you go back to sleep.
This has been educational.
And we'll send you a copy, a simul-fax copy of your words very soon.
Write for another copy of our experimental...
Which you're hearing right now, right?
So I get to hear how intelligent and intelligent and awake I am at 7 o'clock in the morning.
You're hearing for the very first time the copy of yourself right now.
You're not gonna stand up and hear my tape played.
You're gonna hear your tape played.
And it won't be in a secretary around until you raise a part of it.
You might need to just take off and run!
Bob's running with the devil.
So you're gonna run away to the other one.
One way or the other.
What else do you do?
Come on, kids.
Honey?
Well, here we are.
The park.
Come on, everybody.
Welcome to Synthetic National Park 116B.
I'm Jack, your animatronic ranger and guide.
Please step on conveyor and press A for nature excursion.
Okay.
Kindly direct your attention to the astroturf and fabric forest.
You will notice the mechanized bears are not threatened by us and will not respond in a hostile manner,
unlike real bears of the past.

Growl.
Growl.
And over on the right are 3D computer generated water birds.
Hey, that's not real water in those rapids, is it?
No, of course not.
It's basically recycled liquid wastes and salvaged oil spills from tanker accidents dyed blue and white
and mechanically propelled by small nuclear rotors for a historically correct effect.
We're proud to say it's almost aesthetically perfect as well.
What about the clouds and the blue sky?
Computer generated.
What about the warm temperatures?
Greenhouse effect.
Not bad for New York in February, huh?
Yes, thanks to the efforts of one time President George Bush over a hundred years ago,
real parks were cleared away and controlled, easy to maintain environments like this one were created.
Which park was this?
It was called Central Park, I believe, but I'm only a ranger, not a historian.
Please, follow me, folks.
There's much more of the park to see.
Having trouble getting the children to eat their food, Mom?
Kids complaining that they don't like the taste of fish?
Try Mrs. Filabert's deflavored fish, the fish that doesn't taste like anything.
That caviar was great, Mom. Pass the anchovies.
Thanks for dinner, dear. It was tasteless.
They didn't taste a thing.
And you will too when you serve Mrs. Filabert's deflavored fish, the fish that needs no flavoring.
Marge, that tasted like nothing I've ever had.
Never taste that fishy taste of fish again with Mrs. Filabert's deflavored food.
Waiter, I'd like to try some.
I'd like to try some of that delicious fish.
But you just ate your fish, ma'am.
What a catch.
Whole fish without the flavor.
Try the same fish the fast food restaurants use.
Mrs. Filabert's freeze-dried deflavored fish in sticks, cakes, slabs, or bakes.
Mrs. Filabert's. That man of yours will say...
What was that, honey?
Uh, yeah.
Question, dear friends.
Thanks to Reverend Filippo Abernathy...
I love you, I love you.
You're a good friend, and you deserve a lot of love.
Thank you.
You're a good friend, and you deserve a lot of love.
Oh, yes.
But the boogeyman can't get you, don't worry.
Although you can't kill him...
He can't get you.
You can't kill him, but he can't get you.
I must, yet I cannot.
Michael?
Michael?
Oh, Michael Myers, a true subgenius, friends.
Well, we're going to talk, as I said,
we're going to talk about scarier things.
Scarier things than the War of the Worlds broadcast
or any of those showbiz-type thingies,
because it is Halloween, and we love death.
The Day of the Dead.
Yes, that's what it is.
El Dio del Muerte.
Something like that.
And, uh...
You know, it's because,
although we Americans treasure health,
and we rightfully pride ourselves on our heritage
of rich land, open air, and clean, pure water,
well, my friends, water doesn't, uh,
pay attention.
It doesn't pay attention to these, uh, national borders.
It doesn't salute the flag.
It doesn't pledge allegiance.
It recycles between the Earth, air, and oceans,
and between the outside world and our own cells.
Our bodies are 75% water.
It's our most important nutrient.
We can do without food,
but we have to have water all the time.
Yet, our water has changed.
Ah, yes.
Mutation, dear friends,
and it will change us.
If we do not restore it to its former purity.
So let's not.
Let's just let it mutate us, you know?
Uh, because there's something like
100,000 hazardous waste dumps in our country,
and the resulting contamination of our groundwater
has helped put carcinogens in the water in 34 states.
And discarded chemical wastes have found their wonderful little ways
into 400,000 landfills to the point that near big cities,
up to 10% of our groundwater is hideously polluted.
Oh, friends, let's praise Bob for that,
because that spreads the mutation.
That helps to taint the gene pool that there may be less normals and pinks.
Ah.
Ah, it's wonderful.
63% of our rural water supply, supplying 40 million people, in fact, are unsafe.
And one in five Americans drink tap water containing excess levels of toxic lead.
Oh, we can end up like those Japanese with flippers over there.
The mercury poisoning.
It's wonderful, wonderful.
The same elements that are deadly to insects, dear friends, are also deadly to us.
There's enough DDT in the ground.
There's enough mercury in the ground to affect us until the year 3000.
Herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides, they relentlessly creep into our underground water supplies.
And our surface water is tainted with agricultural runoff,
with industrial effluence, and urban waste.
Why, our river, our rivers, our lovely rivers,
have become great sewers carrying arsenic.
Nitrates.
Not all, but there have been disasters from machine killing.
From burning seafood, perhaps powder, from
policerifters to the president of the下折 .
What?
HA fundamentalist is column who embody a�� Sótiĕn Ć 2020
catastrophe inared it to hold and hold and then keep Mik part is a
meat-eating AID?
Well, let's see what the tape says.
It says Wavy Gravy WCSB.
WCSB is the station in Cleveland where Lonesome Cowboy Dave has that show
and where you are listening to the Hour of Slack right now in Cleveland.
But this is punishment above and beyond.
It truly is.
Hang in and love it or hate it.
In screen, Blackula, scream.
Hey!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ooh!
Ah!
Ooh!


There's a hate all in my brain.
Everything seems the same.
Feeling funny, I don't know why.
Excuse me.
While I kiss the sky.
Yeah!
Blackula Hayes all in my brain.
Don't know what I'm in for.
That woman put a spell on me.
Tomorrow's just the end of time.
That womanール you and I are both the same.
Oh, glad you know this already.
Well, this season you and I
will be playing the same ads on theo involvement game.
Except that this followed tiring days at the game PG.
Well, I goteling tickets for a few hours

Seriously.
But really, how does it keep coming up?
Here they are, carrying the ball downfield.
A little color game.
It's a beautiful ball, rising over the mountains like a shining sun.
And the birds are singing.
The waterfall is falling.
The moose is bellowing in the woods.
Yeah.
And the show is falling all over itself.
Puppet of the day in the moose.
And the show is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

Good evening.
You are listening to radio station KNON
89.3 Dallas, Fort Worth,
The Voice of the People. I'm your host,
Paul Wilson, and this is the Halloween edition of Celtic Crossroads.
And we're going to play as much music thematically for Halloween as we have.
Either we will run out of music or we will run out of program first.
I'm not really sure which is going to happen.
So why don't you stay tuned.
We have a few announcements to do.
We're going to get through with those and be back in just a minute.
And we're going to begin this segment of the program,
which will last until the end of the show.
Until about 1025 or so,
with the Pogues.
And if your childhood was deprived
of the learning of this song,
well,
I feel sorry for you.
Because you must have had a happy childhood.

Thank you.
I always remember.
Quick, grab him.
Take him out to freeway
to be run over repeatedly like the roadkill that he is.
No, no, no.
Wait.
Wait.
This bit's boring me.
Let's do another routine or whatever you call these things.
Quite right.
Besides, the script ran out.
Quite right, quite right, quite.
Let's do one where I can talk like I regularly do, you know?
Yeah.
Like I mighty like, damn it.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, there we go.
That's more like it.
More like it.
I like that music.
