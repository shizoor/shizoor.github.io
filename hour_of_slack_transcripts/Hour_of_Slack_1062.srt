1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,400
We interrupt our normal programs as requested by the government.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,500
Normal broadcasting will now be discontinued for an indefinite period.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:18,080
The power of slack will be broadcast in most areas on your regular radio receiver.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,980
I repeat, normal broadcasting will be discontinued for an indefinite period.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,420
Remember, your enemy controls electromagnetic radiation.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,420
Radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,500
Make sure you're prepared.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,320
The Bible prophecy is a very, very important subject for every Christian to study,

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
to help you better understand current events, to put things in perspective,

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:54,080
and most importantly, to help you have that inner peace of knowing that God is on his throne and in control.

11
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,500
Oh, I like to go to the lake and fly to the lake.

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,460
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,500
Someone with a lot of energy.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,580
Okay, your code number once more.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,280
237.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,520
237, you're calling from Dallas.

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
Okay, thank you.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,440
Hi, you're on hotline.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
Yes, my code number is 237.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,540
Amen.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:23,980
Amen.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,660
We're living in turmoil.

23
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,600
Fearless.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,800
Chaotic times.

25
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,260
Praise the Lord.

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,300
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,620
Amen.

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,100
They're going to get worse and worse.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,220
Doctors warn.

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,620
It's going to be a sad time.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,440
Amen.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,420
When Jesus comes back.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,560
If we're not walking by the same rules.

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,180
And minding the same.

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,640
Things.

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,540
So many people are confused about it.

37
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,360
And got their own theory about the way they see the word of God.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:02,880
But I...

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,560
All the signs point to serious health damage.

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,380
All the signs point to thousands and thousands and thousands of cancers and birth deformities

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,840
and miscarriages and awful health problems.

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,580
Both sides will be destroyed regardless of who starts it.

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,880
The minute you have another war, there's not going to be any war left, I don't think.

44
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,920
Because we're going to blow one another to pieces.

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,240
Peace on earth.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Peace on earth.

47
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,100
Peace on earth.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,180
P-O-E.

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,980
Purity of essence.

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,500
I give my vote for Jesus and I thank God for you and Brother Robinson.

51
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,120
Because in this day and time, we don't know what we're going to come to.

52
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,960
Are you familiar with the government prepared cancer maps?

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,100
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,580
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,780
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,100
And as soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

57
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,380
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes. And as soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,960
I don't think anybody would know what to do.

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,860
Even possibly the president.

60
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,460
So we're still going to be hiding this stuff underground.

61
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,300
I personally feel that the president of the United States is evading the issue of hazardous waste in America today.

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,680
He's with Wonder Woman and her incredible powers of strength and agility.

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,100
At 6, it's Kirk Spock and the crew of the Starship Enterprise.

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,420
And the only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation, the church of the subgenius.

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,080
And the only reason they talk about it is for the money.

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,960
We're going to go to the phones right now.

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Good evening. You're on KFJZ with Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond and the Reverend Arnold Stang, Ivan Stang.

68
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,720
I have a question for Mr. Drummond.

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,220
Yes, go ahead.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Are you Mr. Drummond?

71
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,260
That's right.

72
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm calling from Dallas.

73
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,440
What's your question?

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,840
Well, do you work on spiritual problems or do you just work on wallets?

75
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,520
We will help you out spiritually.

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,900
Of course, it helps if we can have some financial assistance.

77
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,960
We sell $10 memberships.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:13,320
And once you start getting our newsletter, you start receiving lessons on how to conduct your life in the most beneficial way for both you and us.

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,420
We listen on the radio dial.

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,180
We get the rhythm when we've got a dial.

81
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,100
Well, people, we'll make you do better for a while.

82
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,820
Put your hands on the radio.

83
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,400
And feel the power, dear friends.

84
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,460
That was the Pink Boys.

85
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,880
Put your hands on the radio.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:44,800
And before that, a recording of the very first time the Church of the Subgenius was ever mentioned on the radio anywhere.

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:53,080
In 1980, when Mr. Opinion had Dr. Philo Drummond and myself on a radio show,

88
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,680
we were the most infamous guests on KFJZ in Fort Worth.

89
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,740
Yes, friends.

90
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,020
This, however, is 26 years later.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,380
And it's Hour of Slack number 1062.

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:17,980
Our 1062nd show devoted to the word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,320
And this isn't even the oldest weekly Subgenius show.

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,020
It might be the most weekly, though.

95
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:38,760
Anyway, for this episode, I started unearthing our old album from 1981, Media Barrage No. 4, The End of the World, digitizing the tape.

96
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,080
So you'll be hearing a bunch of that mixed with a bunch of brand new Subgenius yakery and doctoring,

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,360
and also clips from a movie called I Heart Huckabees.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,920
And also some Lemur and Norell collages.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:06,000
And in the background, music we have here is Stephen Kent and Transmission, who we met at Starwood.

100
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,440
Anyway, friends, let's go now to the 9X Day Drill at Brushwood for some live radio with Dr. Hal.

101
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,300
And, um, I forget.

102
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,260
Perhaps you've been deceived by...

103
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,520
Evangelists masquerading as angels of light.

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,480
...gone, and the world is waiting for who?

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,380
Well, the world's not believers entirely.

106
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,880
They're waiting for the Antichrist.

107
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,520
They don't know they are.

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,280
But who's gonna come in ten days but the one who says to Israel, you need protection?

109
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,440
As we said, have made the club, and...

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,960
Hello?

111
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,660
Hi.

112
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,560
Hi. May I speak to Reverend Stang?

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,220
Oh, yeah. You got me?

114
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,520
Reverend Stang?

115
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,380
Right.

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,740
Yeah.

117
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,180
I call to ask, as far as your belief is concerned, are you a Christian and do you believe in God and the Bible?

118
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,880
We believe in everything.

119
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,760
You do?

120
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,400
Mm-hmm.

121
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,980
The reason I asked is I was intrigued by what you brought out about using the word conspiracy.

122
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,640
And I was wondering if you believed in the fact that Jesus Christ is saved yesterday, today, and forever.

123
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,720
And do you believe that he still has a true prophet in these last days as he did in Moses' day?

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,640
Well, I'll tell you what.

125
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:29,300
We've been, in the course of our research, we've been getting a whole lot of stuff in the mail about the second coming.

126
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:37,820
A lot of other cults are talking about the second coming and how Jesus is gonna come back or sometimes it goes by other names, that Christ is gonna come back.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,780
And our main, the main thing that the Subgenius Foundation has to say about that is beware of cheap imitations.

128
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,700
There are a lot of false prophets running around.

129
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:48,700


130
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:56,620
And a lot of people that are, in the next 20 or 30 years, there are gonna be a lot of people trying to convince you that they are Jesus back on earth.

131
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,240
Oh, yes.

132
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,500
I've, as a born-again Christian, I've seen that in the Spirit, too.

133
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,720
I know exactly what you're talking about.

134
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,440
They're not always meaningful.

135
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,620
Yeah, it's meaningful.

136
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,640
Meaningful how?

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,740
That's what I want you to find out.

138
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,040
About your life?

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah, about my life and about the whole thing.

140
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,680
About the universe.

141
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,180
The universe, you know?

142
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,860
The big one.

143
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,460
I mean, should I keep doing what I'm doing?

144
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,440
Is it hopeless?

145
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,860
Mr. Markovsky, we see a lot of people in here who claim they want to know the ultimate truth about reality.

146
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,780
They want to peer under the surface at the big everything.

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,260
But this can be a very painful process full of surprises.

148
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,380
It can dismantle the world as you know it.

149
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,120
That's why most people prefer to remain on the surface of things.

150
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,680
Maybe you should go home.

151
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,780
Let sleeping dogs lie.

152
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,760
Take it easy.

153
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,300
What do you say?

154
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,140
I say don't give me the brush off.

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,240
Please.

156
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,180
I want to know.

157
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,460
This is big.

158
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,120
Have you ever transcended space and time?

159
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,940
Yes.

160
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,080
No.

161
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
Time, not space.

162
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,000
You and I are scientific men.

164
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,180
You can understand the wonder of what's happened.

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,180
Now just think.

166
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,980
Less than a month ago, Santa Mera was like any other town.

167
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,580
People with nothing but problems.

168
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,440
Then out of the sky came a solution.

169
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,120
Seeds drifting through space for years took root in a farmland.

170
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:25,840
From the seeds came pods, which have the power to reproduce themselves in the exact likeness of any form of life.

171
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,180
Your new bodies are growing in there.

172
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,000
They're taking you over.

173
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,400
Cell for cell.

174
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,880
Atom for atom.

175
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,700
There's no pain.

176
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:45,160
Suddenly, while you're asleep, they'll absorb your minds, your memories, and you're reborn into an untroubled world.

177
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,100
Forever is the summer of the sun.

178
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,280
Exactly.

179
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,080
What a world.

180
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,460
We're not the last humans, that is.

181
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,420
They'll destroy you.

182
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,040
Tomorrow you won't want them to.

183
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,420
Tomorrow you'll be one of us.

184
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,760
I don't want any part of you.

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
You're forgetting something, Miles.

186
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,700
What's that?

187
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,940
You have no choice.

188
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,700
And our children will live, Mr. Beale.

189
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,180
The children will live, Mr. Beale.

190
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,180


191
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:17,240
Fine.

192
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


193
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


194
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


195
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


196
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


197
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


198
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


199
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


200
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


201
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


202
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


203
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


204
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


205
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


206
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


207
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:17,420


208
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:31,180
To see that perfect world in which there's no war or famine, oppression or brutality.

209
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:41,580
One vast and ecumenical holding company for whom all men will work to serve a common profit.

210
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,620
In which all men will hold a share of stock.

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,460
All necessities provided.

212
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,660
All anxieties tranquilized.

213
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,480
All boredom amused.

214
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,600
The chemicals these factories create are welcomed by our modern day lifestyle.

215
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,500
The locals here complain the campers commit what along this coast is perhaps the greatest of possible facts.

216
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,120
They don't spend enough money.

217
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,860
We're going to make 30.

218
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,200
A mandatory retirement age.

219
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,700
And we're going to set up rehabilitation camps.

220
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,800
Mercy centers in every state of the union.

221
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,420
Citizens will report to them after five years.

222
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,200
At the age of 35.

223
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:35,440
And there, in groovy surroundings, we're going to psych them all out on LSD, babies.

224
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,360
That way, they're not going to hurt you.

225
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,600
And they're not going to...

226
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:45,960
Hurt me.

227
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,440
And babies, they're not even going to hurt themselves anymore.

228
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,800
They want drafters.

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,660
We'll draft them!

230
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,980
And some of them are really going to dig it.

231
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,400
And that's going to be the real mother-loving gas.

232
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,160
There's going to be cats who want to split from taxes.

233
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,040
Diners club.

234
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,600
Crazy birds.

235
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,600
Crazy wives and crazy husbands.

236
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,000
And millions of troops.

237
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,580
But millions are going to go willingly.

238
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,600
Ah, the funny sketch.

239
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,560
Thank you. Do you like that?

240
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah. No, but it was a funny sketch.

241
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,540
That's a joke.

242
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,340
You talk about young people in America.

243
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,420
I don't recognize them.

244
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,340
I don't think they exist.

245
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,640
I think your kind creates them.

246
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,120
You force them into little molds and pop them out like little plastic figures off a production line.

247
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,820
You stuff them full of preconceived ideas, praise them for turning out so well.

248
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,640
But they're not people, they're machines.

249
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,600
Then you wind them up in a machine.

250
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,700
You make them pop like little tape recorders and send them out into the world to spread another generation of lies.

251
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,480
This is the best of all possible worlds.

252
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,840
This is a recording.

253
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,620
As shown in this diagram, the surface is actually the roof of a 150-story apartment building which encompasses the Earth.

254
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,400
The future's treasures are housed in countless numbers in each of these identical levels which contain the five types of reality to be found.

255
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,600
The corridors, work areas, metroplexes, holograms, and of course the units for eunuchs.

256
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,680
Each unit has its own different resolution.

257
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,160
This unit is not very control of its own, even knowing you may be a human being.

258
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,340
Say in your midносenty years your heart will be at ease.

259
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:29,840
Next up on B composers when you've lost your drive take a look at the arms 온 you and make a vehicle option

260
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:45,600
The first dip, which returns their

261
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,580
Blue glasses, I'm on with the timer

262
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,240
How could life be in a final?

263
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,660
The good condition is to keep me cool

264
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,240
Yes, barbecue by the heated grill

265
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,840
Some would you cool with a second bottle too?

266
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,460
Just can't decide what I want to do

267
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,620
Hey, hey, I've got a heartache complex

268
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,900
Here at the apartment complex

269
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,940
I've got a heartache complex

270
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,520
Here at the apartment complex

271
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,820
We shall come to the level of lighting

272
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,520
A fine little life couldn't be more exciting

273
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,920
Loving room and clubhouse too

274
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,580
I don't have a worry till my break comes through

275
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,380
Watching soon as bed, I'm excited

276
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,500
Tonight is the day

277
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,020
I'm gonna wait with the room and delight

278
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,980
Hey, hey, I've got a heartache complex

279
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,680
Here at the apartment complex

280
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,280
I've got a heartache complex

281
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,880
Here at the apartment complex

282
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,460
Now

283
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,480
Oh, I know you like to live in the complex

284
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,500
And make a little tale about it

285
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,340
So easy to sit upon

286
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,140
Your life is such a good range

287
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,480
So you can make it through

288
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
In the middle of the day

289
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah

290
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,860
My friends come over and they think it's so fine

291
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,560
Well, they don't know that none of it is mine

292
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,900
My little furniture and color TV

293
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,560
None of my belongings belong to me

294
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,300
For these lots of luxury that's made to counterflag

295
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,040
Cause I always assume that I'm late to the bank

296
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Hey, hey, I've got a heartache complex

297
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,620
Here at the apartment complex

298
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,340
I've got a heartache complex

299
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,460
Here at the apartment complex

300
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:12,460


301
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:12,460


302
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,360
The Pink Boys

303
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,620
The vocals by the late Dr. X from the 1981 subgenius album Media Barrage No. 4

304
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,320
Also some cut-ups by Noriel Preff and Fernand and Andy Lemur

305
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:59,060
And some bits from the odd 2002 film I Heart Huckabees as follows

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,680
I'm trying to remember something here, it has to do with...

307
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,820
I'm trying to remember...

308
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,240
Well, you know, John...

309
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,500
I'm trying to remember something here, it has to do with...

310
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm trying to remember something here, it has to do with...

311
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm trying to remember something here, it has to do with...

312
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,820
I'm trying to remember something here, it has to do with...

313
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,960
I seem to have forgotten where I put my special pills

314
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,160
But I will soldier on here

315
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,700
For some of you more deformed, please pay no attention to the beasts

316
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,440
Which appear spontaneously in front of your eyes

317
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,460
They're not real, they are an hallucinations

318
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,420
And can be easily done away with by snapping the nose

319
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,340
Thus, pulling the nose

320
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,440
most important parts of the septum together,

321
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,680
and by plugging one ear, like so,

322
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,580
and staring cross-eyed.

323
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,240
That doesn't work either.

324
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, you know, these beasts are very tractable.

325
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
They can be harnessed and made to do useful work.

326
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,840
They are, after all, fellow creatures,

327
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,960
fellow sufferers with us.

328
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,040
And meant to be hung from the curly-fried trees

329
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,100
They are our brethren, our siblings,

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,900
created in the garden by the creator of all things.

331
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,940
And who might that be?

332
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,940
Why, the manufacturer.

333
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,540
The manufacturer, indeed.

334
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,480
And don't forget, don't return it.

335
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,080
No, they won't accept it.

336
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,600
But there is the great callback day, which will occur.

337
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,860
We all get to go back,

338
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,520
and that's when we find out

339
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,000
that our...

340
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,780
previous life was a sort of audition for the big show.

341
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,740
And of course, we're always looking for fellow enthusiasts,

342
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,720
chorus girls, spear carriers,

343
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,120
anyone who can accompany us out on stage

344
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,600
when it's time for that performance to start.

345
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,340
Because if you try to make yourself look good,

346
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,840
you're going to look rinky-dink and bring everybody down.

347
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,200
But if you try to make the show look good,

348
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
not only will we all succeed, but you

349
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,320
will look good.

350
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,260
They'll say, what a professional that Joe Bob Subgenius is.

351
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,120
How he made it all shine.

352
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,000
If only I could be like that praiseworthy individual.

353
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,200
I'm interested only in facts.

354
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,780
I want to know how things began, where they started.

355
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,380
I'd like to know what a nexus really is, and how they began.

356
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,920
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

357
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,320
Yes, we'll see the next time.

358
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,320


359
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,140
I think we'll have to wait for those exes...

360
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,880
before we want to, maybe.

361
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,340
Will we have to stare into the red eyes

362
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,000
and the dark visage of a horrible, horrible thing?

363
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,260
That's even assuming they've got eyes to stare at.

364
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,580
What if they don't even have a face to look at?

365
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,080
What are you going to do then?

366
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,700
I was told that their eyes are capable of causing tremendous amounts of damage

367
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,320
to an ordinary onlooker like myself.

368
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,300
That's true, but I'm not saying that they look like eyes.

369
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,480
In fact, I've seen a thing that they look sort of like a wiggly nipple

370
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,340
or an extended finger sticking out of a little concavity,

371
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,080
like a crater only made out of flesh.

372
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,180
So you're saying it's like an ocular nipple of some sort capable of...

373
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,680
It is a light-sensing organ.

374
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,380
A light-sensing ocular nipple capable of giving both sustenance and taking on light?

375
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,160
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

376
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,320
So you have neatly encapsulated it in your description.

377
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,060
That ought to be made part of the official handbook.

378
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,820
Well, I heard that John Wilkes Booth,

379
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,240
the night before they assassinated Abraham Lincoln,

380
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,400
that he was found in a cabal of three or four of these others

381
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,560
discussing plans of an unearthly nature,

382
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,740
and that the U.S. conflagration at the time had nothing to do with it.

383
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,820
Well, it might not have appeared to have anything to do with it,

384
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:24,980
but it's as they say, if a butterfly farts in China, a wall falls down in Peoria.

385
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:32,380
We're all connected, and these convulsions on the earth of human wars and rumors of wars

386
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:39,320
are only eddies in our own backwater reflecting the giant convulsions of the cosmos all around us.

387
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,260
For there is war in heaven, principalities, powers, dominions, thrones,

388
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,020
great gods grapple in the central blue, lambasting themselves with clubs the size of universes,

389
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,340
and we think our tiny religious and secular controversies are worth ennobling ourselves about.

390
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,380
How pathetic.

391
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,360
Thank you.

392
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,860
What happened to my pills that were here?

393
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,280
How pathetic.

394
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:20,900
Yes, I sneer to scorn at these who do not open their inner portals to the possibilities of endless perception.

395
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,200
He got a little pretty mouth, ain't he?

396
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,960
I believe that I have Bob Dobbs.

397
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,640
I have Bob Dobbs.

398
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,920
Bob Dobbs.

399
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,100
Professor Dobbs?

400
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,440
I believe.

401
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,300
I believe.

402
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,840
I believe.

403
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
I believe.

404
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,000
Is this part of my investigation?

405
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Yes.

406
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,340
Say this blanket represents all the matter and energy in the universe, okay?

407
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,080
You, me, everything.

408
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:01,980
Nothing.

409
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,120
Nothing.

410
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,120


411
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:02,360
Nothing.

412
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,360


413
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,360


414
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,360


415
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:02,360


416
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:02,380


417
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,040
Sorry, I'm left out, all right?

418
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,520
All the particles, everything.

419
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,760
What's that side of this blanket?

420
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,620
More blankets.

421
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,280
That's the point.

422
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,900
Blankets, everything.

423
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,540
Exactly.

424
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,640
This is everything, okay?

425
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,660
Let's just say that this is me, right?

426
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,900
And I'm, what, 60-odd years old, and I'm wearing a gray suit, blah, blah, blah.

427
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,060
And let's say over here, this is you, and you're, I don't know, you're 21, you've got dark hair, et cetera.

428
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,440
And over here, this is Vivian, my wife in college.

429
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,480
And then over here, this is the Eiffel Tower, right?

430
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,940
It's Paris.

431
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,400
And this is a war.

432
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,740
And this is a museum and this is a disease and this is an orgasm and this is a hammer

433
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:46,100
Everything is the same even if it's different exactly, but our everyday mind forgets us. We think everything is separate limited

434
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,620
I'm over here. You're over there, which is true, but it's not the whole truth because we're all connected because we are connected

435
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,100
Yeah, all right now

436
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:04,740
We need to learn how to see the blanket truth all the time right in the everyday stuff

437
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
And that's what this is for why?

438
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,260
Why what why do I need to learn how to see the blanket thing all the time in the everyday stuff?

439
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,840
Well, you wouldn't want to miss out on the big picture would you?

440
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,240
That's partly why you're here right and this is it. I'm talking about it right now

441
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,000
I mean it'll take a while for you to get you know, but

442
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,780
It'll help you

443
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,140
How

444
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,040
When you

445
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,540
Get the blanket thing you can relax because everything you could ever want or be you already have and are

446
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,620
That's something pretty good. Sounds very good. All right, get in let me get in. Mm-hmm

447
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:47,660
So get in here, yeah, what's gonna happen to me in there, okay, you're gonna see you'll find out

448
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,420
The purpose of this suit mr. Makowski is to help shut down your everyday perceptions

449
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:03,200
And give up your usual identity that you think separates you from everything this room

450
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,560
the street

451
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,280
This town this this country this economy

452
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
this history

453
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,620
This planet your body your senses your job everything that you identify with

454
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,180
You know the future is a magnetic place each year a hundred

455
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,320
Billion are born into it why it seems all roads lead to tomorrow

456
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,600
Why just looking at the future is enchanting browse along conveyor belts were awe-inspiring

457
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,480
Holograms are as much a part of the experience of every man as were the real trees mountain sunsets of the dark past

458
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:53,640
It's thrilling to wander amidst these realistic 3d images and you'll certainly feel at home since the leaders here have chosen the

459
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,220
architecture of the mediocrity of the middle class

460
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,340
As the most relaxing and appeasing of all art forms

461
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:06,400
It could be the old world charm of suburbs and franchises or power plants and office buildings

462
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Which might suddenly change to lovely forests and pastures?

463
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:17,920
But wherever you go, you're still amid the clean ever-changing the holograms of the future made possible by the amazing

464
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,460
Hologram projectors and the careful planning of the folks behind the scenes and it won't put a dent in your budget

465
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,320
since holograms are produced in

466
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,060
economical black and white

467
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:34,020
You might even get to see a rare hologram eclipse when your real surroundings become enjoyably apparent

468
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,260
We are

469
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,060
critical

470
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,840
You can't see it all but you can't even be sure you're seeing any of it

471
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,040
Oh

472
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:55,380
You beat it you little pussy pussy

473
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,080
You're an asshole

474
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:01,920
You're an asshole

475
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,080
You're an asshole

476
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,900
How are you? Okay doing okay? I thought you said that was gonna relax me eventually, but you have to practice at home

477
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,880
Okay, you got a lot of layers in there don't you? Huh?

478
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,760
Catch me up to speed tell me what's happening. What's happening is she wants to talk about my work situation

479
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,360
I want to know about my coincidence. I thought not what's happening right now. This is what's happening right now

480
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,560
I'm telling you she's spying about the blanket. I'm not I don't know the blanket right now like this

481
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,180
I'm telling you she's spying on you

482
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:42,640
You're just taking pictures of you

483
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:42,640


484
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,620
All right, I love a dress

485
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,660
Oh, you said that was interesting

486
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,640
How can any of these clothes fit you to why the hell would you wear a full dress?

487
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,060
Oh, oh, What are you talking?

488
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,240
It'll look good. Come on. laughter

489
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,540
market

490
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,540


491
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,540


492
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,540


493
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:48,540


494
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:55,160
Pr Авprof

495
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,620
is an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.

496
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,080
Well, how can the center be everywhere if the, uh...

497
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,080
The problem in America today is

498
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,580
humanism. Humanism, as Pastor mentioned,

499
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,020
is when we become like gods

500
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,940
to replace God and we dethrone God and we begin to live for

501
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,200
ourselves and become lovers of ourselves more than lovers of God.

502
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,700
Oh, Bob! Oh, Bob! Oh, Bob!

503
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,680
Give me food! Give me money! Give me food! Give me everything, Bob!

504
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,660
Oh, Bob! Give me some food! Give me some money! Give me some food!

505
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,220
Give me some clothes! Give me pills! Give me some food!

506
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,460
Give me some clothes! Give me some pills! Give me some cards! Give me some things!

507
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,300
Give me that! Give me everything! Give me everything! Uh, I'll make a peace agreement with you.

508
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,080
The only reason America still stands is there's a remnant

509
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,860
of Christians who are still praying for a

510
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,120
spirit of God.

511
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,760
spiritual awakening in this country.

512
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,940
The church of the living God is preaching and believing and looking for the coming of

513
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,840
Jesus Christ.

514
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,840
There is a way out.

515
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,860
There is an escape route.

516
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,060
This world is destined for destruction.

517
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,200
It's doomed and it's damned according to the word of God.

518
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,160
But Jesus is coming for a church.

519
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,900
He's going to get his bride out of this world.

520
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,460
Point one.

521
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,860
I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States.

522
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:36,500
Beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977.

523
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,000
Never.

524
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,260
Today, I want to talk to you about something that, well, is kind of a passion of mine,

525
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,140
and that is sexuality.

526
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,580
You know, I like the subject.

527
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:51,960
And so.

528
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,920
It's a hot subject.

529
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,800
Check this out.

530
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,160
You're going to fall out of your seat when you hear this.

531
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,520
This is from the Associated Press.

532
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,200
The title of the article is Pentagon lists Christian beliefs as disorder.

533
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,040
Ooh.

534
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,900
Uh-oh.

535
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,340
A Pentagon document classifies Christian beliefs as a mental disorder.

536
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,940
Based on scientific and medical evidence, the APA classified Christian beliefs as a

537
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,300
mental disorder in 1973, a position shared by all other major health and mental health

538
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,840
organizations.

539
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,340
Hmm.

540
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,500
So there you have it.

541
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,840
The Pentagon, the intolerant Pentagon, is listing.

542
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,220
The church.

543
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,320
As a disorder.

544
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,100
Hmm.

545
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,920
Sexuality is no sin.

546
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:26,740
Check this out.

547
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,160
Washington.

548
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:27,580
Eh.

549
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:27,900
Eh.

550
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,400
Eh.

551
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:28,740
Eh.

552
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,780
I have a problem.

553
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,220
Ha.

554
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:30,480
Ha.

555
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:30,700
Ha.

556
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,100
Eh.

557
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,180
I have a problem.

558
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,240
You can call me gone.

559
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:33,900
Out there.

560
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,360
Gone.

561
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,020
Dum.

562
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,220
Dum.

563
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,380
Dum.

564
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:35,560
Da.

565
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:35,860
Da.

566
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,140
Dum.

567
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,020
Snitcher.

568
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,560
Snitcher.

569
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,600
See the word hypocrite?

570
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,040
Okay.

571
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,380
Okay.

572
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,020
If you're a Christian, something is wrong.

573
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,360
Da.

574
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:41,980
Da.

575
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,240
Da.

576
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,400
Da.

577
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,700
Da.

578
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:42,880
Da.

579
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:42,980
Da.

580
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,120
Da.

581
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,220
Da.

582
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,260
Da.

583
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,380
Da.

584
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:43,480
Da.

585
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,500
Da.

586
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:43,520
Da.

587
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,040
Da.

588
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,480
Da.

589
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,920
Da.

590
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,100
Da.

591
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,340
Da.

592
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:45,820
Da.

593
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:45,960
Da.

594
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,280
Da.

595
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,620
Bye-bye, Norrell Preff.

596
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,960
And now, some Radio Synesthesia, which is Dr. Sinister's show from WCSB in Cleveland.

597
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,640
Well, that was totally pointless.

598
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,280
But, you know, it took up a good four minutes of the time I have to fill.

599
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,140
Now, God has a reason for everything that happens in our world.

600
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,260
And you don't want to know.

601
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,800
I read in the news today about a little girl.

602
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,940
I forget which state she was in.

603
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,920
She was about to go in and start getting terrible chemotherapy and surgery for some kind of cancer.

604
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,600
I think it was blood cancer.

605
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,180
Cancer.

606
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,000
Leukemia.

607
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,940
And she suddenly, it turned out she was healed.

608
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:37,100
And her mom said she, the doctors couldn't figure out what had happened, but her mom said she knew that they owed it to God.

609
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,380
I'm thinking, well, yeah, so God gave her the cancer too, right?

610
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,960
Exactly.

611
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,300
This is what always bothers me.

612
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,800
You know, people say we give God the glory for this miraculous recovery, but you know what?

613
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
You don't give him the blame for the problem in the first place.

614
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,720
Right, he'll kill off all these people with cancer just so that the occasional miracle makes everybody think he's great.

615
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,640
Well, I don't know.

616
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,240
One of my favorite.

617
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,560
But he can't do that every time.

618
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,540
I can understand giving him cancer to show him once and for all the value of life.

619
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,880
But then, well, I guess if everybody got miraculously cured, then it'd be.

620
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,100
They'd get bored.

621
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,960
And people are so ungrateful.

622
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:21,580
Well, you know, if you want to actually believe in the God of the Bible, I am forced to make some weird analyses of it.

623
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,440
I mean, I personally conclude that the whole thing doesn't make sense unless you look at it a certain way.

624
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:34,940
God is evil, easily amused, and really not all powerful.

625
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,900
Yeah, and with occasionally a really, really sick sense of humor.

626
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,380
A horribly sick sense of humor.

627
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,900
And, I mean, like I said, you know, we're talking about somebody who had his chosen people in slavery in Egypt, you know.

628
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
And he inspired Moses to lead them out.

629
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,040
And Moses went to the Pharaoh and said, Pharaoh, let my people go.

630
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,860
And Pharaoh actually was convinced by Moses' argument that the people ought to be free.

631
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,020
But then the Lord went down and hardened Pharaoh's heart.

632
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,240
You remember that in Exodus?

633
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,540
Because the whole place.

634
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,100
That was the phrase they used.

635
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,860
They hardened Pharaoh's heart.

636
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,320
Yeah.

637
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,720
So he would hold out and God would get to send a plague of...

638
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,260
Yeah, because otherwise God wouldn't have a very good excuse for sending all those plagues.

639
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,760
And he had all these plagues and special effects he just had to use.

640
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,800
Exactly, exactly.

641
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,360
God acted through Pharaoh's PR people and said, no, Pharaoh, you can't give Moses the freedom that he needs.

642
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,620
So clearly, clearly, clearly when God intervenes in human affairs, he's not always inspiring people to do the right thing.

643
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,960
He's sometimes inspiring people to do the wrong thing.

644
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,880
Just so God can flex his muscle and do something even worse.

645
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,700
It's whether men are to be ruled by the state or whether they are to be ruled by the whims of a dictator.

646
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,480
Are men the property of the state or are they free souls?

647
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,420
Man shall be ruled by the will of other men.

648
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:05,440
You shall see hail fall from a clear sky and you shall see darkness when the sun climbs high to noon.

649
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,600
And you shall know that Bush is God.

650
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,600
Bow down to his will.

651
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,820
That you may...

652
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,580
Know the power of the Lord.

653
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,060
Death and evil.

654
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,580
For seven days you will thirst.

655
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:25,660
Thus saith the Lord, let my people drink bitter waters.

656
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,060
That you may know these things are done of God.

657
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,540
You have not yet obeyed the Lord.

658
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,500
Let my people drink bitter waters.

659
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,500
Slaves worship you and you serve only God.

660
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
See this staff?

661
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,700
God made it a rod to rule over scorpions and serpents.

662
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,520
Stretch out my staff against the waters.

663
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,480
To make their lives bitter in hard bondage.

664
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,600
Brought more evil upon you.

665
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,300
God forgive my weak use of his strength.

666
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,140
Hear his word and obey.

667
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,200
You have not yet obeyed Bush.

668
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,140
God has set before you this day his laws of Bush.

669
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,480
God has set before you this day his laws of Bush.

670
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,420
Bigotry will cause that you they pay for you.

671
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,140
For your cooperation with him God will have no opinion on this.

672
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,140


673
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,560
Die God v. Bush.

674
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,000
Hastee's

675
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,280
Hell.

676
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,060
I empty the ears.

677
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,060


678
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,220
I keep myFine balance.

679
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:43,420
levels, but it seems sort of obvious between the lines to me that God and the devil are

680
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,120
doing this good cop, bad cop thing, but they're both.

681
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,680
They're both on the same team.

682
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:47,940
Yeah.

683
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,120
Well, it's very obvious.

684
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,460
We're the ones that are under, you know, in the inquisitor's chair.

685
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,780
In the book of Job, it shows God making a bet with the devil.

686
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:03,740
And by the way, you know, if you're making a bet and you know everything, doesn't that

687
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,680
kind of count as cheating?

688
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,560
Well, that's why I say it's a good cop, bad cop thing.

689
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,580
Well, if God made man in his own image, then God made the devil in his own image, too.

690
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:14,940
Or?

691
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,240
Well, no, the devil, actually, I met the devil at Starwood.

692
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,360
He's been to the last several Starwoods, and he's not entirely, he's hominid, but he's

693
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,180
not manlike.

694
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,060
He is red, and he does have horns.

695
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,200
He doesn't actually have a tail or hooves, but he's, he doesn't, he's got a clownish,

696
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,280
kind of a nose.

697
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,860
Are you sure that wasn't Dr. Howell's famous devil disguise?

698
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,160
No, no, I know.

699
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,860
Dr. Howell does do a devil suit, but old Splitfoot is always, well, think about it.

700
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,360
Starwood's the biggest neo-pagan gathering around this neck of the woods.

701
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,600
And it's a lot more comfortable than Burning Man.

702
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,660
No, that's not necessarily so at all.

703
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,640
That's a myth based on fear of the desert.

704
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,400
Actually, both of them can be hideously hot or cold.

705
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,200
Within five minutes.

706
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,920
Five minutes of each other.

707
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,880
But anyway, the point is, I'm not kidding.

708
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,140
And if you want to look at the photographs on SubSight, there's a picture of Reverend

709
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:21,100
Andy Christ, who is a mason in his fez, shaking hands with Satan, who is always, as I said,

710
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,040
is a real person who's always at Starwood.

711
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:32,480
In fact, he's been, he posted to one of the subgenius news groups lately under the name

712
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,040
Mickey Mephistopheles, I believe.

713
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,740
Maybe you didn't know this, but there's more than one devil, too, you know?

714
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:38,960
Well, yeah.

715
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,220
And there's, well, everybody has their own devils.

716
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,380
Well, there were hundreds of them.

717
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,280
And the devils are all working for each other.

718
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Well, wasn't there one called Abaddon?

719
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,340
Oh, there was one called damn near everything you can think of.

720
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:52,620
Right.

721
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,840
The Satan, I used to use the wisecrack, well, you have to be a Christian, you have to believe

722
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,160
all that Christian stuff first before you can be a Satanist.

723
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,200
Nenslow pointed out that that is silly and not true.

724
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,900
That's not true, because Satan, or Shaitan, has been around for at least 3,000 years,

725
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,180
and was, the Jews picked him up from somebody else.

726
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,480
He had originally been a, just another desert devil monster.

727
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
You know the origin of the name?

728
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,300
You know, jinn or whatever.

729
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,200
Maybe it was the guy who was at Brushwood.

730
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,700
You know the origin of the name Beelzebub?

731
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,320
I don't know that.

732
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,180
Ball.

733
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:33,680
What?

734
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,280
Ball.

735
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,740
Ball.

736
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,440
Ball.

737
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,140
Oh, yeah.

738
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,160
Yeah, they would take, that was the name of another god in that area at the time.

739
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,820
Yeah, Beel.

740
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,220
And Zubub.

741
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,060
I always thought that was Beel, was the way it was pronounced.

742
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,600
And Zubub kind of means like dung.

743
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,620
Oh, Beelzebub.

744
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,060
Yeah, so they were just making fun of Ball.

745
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,020
Lord of the Ducks.

746
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,400
It's like calling him Satan Pepe.

747
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,900
Which sounds really childish, but I just passed a billboard that was for the cartoon channel,

748
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,020
but I think it said Pooting on it.

749
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,840
You know what?

750
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,180
Those Cartoon Network billboards are disturbing.

751
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,460
Well, when I was 12, I probably would have been thrilled.

752
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,320
And when I was 25, I would have thought, well, I'm glad that people are not so uptight anymore.

753
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,420
But for some reason, now it's kind of like, must the world just keep getting dumber and

754
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,060
dumber and dumber and dumber?

755
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,860
And the answer is yes, it must.

756
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:33,640
It very much must until something so horrible happens that only the very smartest survive.

757
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,460
Right.

758
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:34,540
Right.

759
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,820
Right.

760
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


761
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


762
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


763
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


764
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


765
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


766
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


767
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


768
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


769
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


770
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


771
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820


772
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,960
And the world will get smarter again.

773
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,580
So you better hope X days just right around the corner, Professor.

774
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,640
Well, you know, that's what I'm hoping for.

775
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,840
You know, we're all waiting for the saucers here.

776
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,900
You know, we're all holding on.

777
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,820
And, you know, the tables, they will turn around.

778
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,520
Plendecks will soon be found.

779
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,000
Well, that sounds so good, I decided to believe it.

780
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,600
Yeah.

781
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,740
I'm going to check a tape.

782
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,920
Yeah, all right.

783
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,400
All right.

784
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,520
All right.

785
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


786
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


787
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


788
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


789
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


790
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


791
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


792
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


793
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


794
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


795
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


796
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


797
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,820


798
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,060
Thank you.

799
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,800
Thank you.

800
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:10,800


801
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:10,800


802
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:10,800


803
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:10,820
Bye.

804
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,140
Bye.

805
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


806
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


807
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


808
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


809
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


810
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


811
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


812
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


813
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


814
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


815
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


816
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,140


817
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:18,700
There's no doubt of the trouble that's about.

818
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,440
So I say, my friend, you'd better start to pray.

819
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,440
They're a terrifying sight as they fly on day and night.

820
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,140
It's a warning that we'd better mend our ways.

821
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,180
You'd better pray.

822
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:41,420
Pray to the Lord when you see those flying saucers, it may be the coming of the judgment day.

823
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,320
Many people think the saucers might be someone's foolish dreams,

824
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,960
or maybe they were sent down here from Mars.

825
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,580
If you'll just stop and think you'd realize just what it means,

826
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,160
they're more than atom bombs or falling stars.

827
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,120
And though the war may be true, there's unrest and trouble brewing,

828
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,680
and those flying saucers may be just a sign

829
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,420
that if peace doesn't come, it will be the end of some.

830
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,900
So repent today, you're running out of time.

831
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,720
When you see a saucer fly like a comet through the sky,

832
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,920
you should realize the price.

833
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,080
You'll have to pay.

834
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,220
You'd better pray to the Lord when you see those flying saucers,

835
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,020
it may be the coming of the judgment day.

836
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,860
The Buchanan Brothers.

837
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,520
Praise Bob.

838
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:29,120
And before that, some radio synesthesia and a collage about Moses

839
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,020
from the geeks of dubious sexuality,

840
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,160
who all said,

841
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
We've also sent some movie soundtrack clips,

842
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,620
not including the following, from 9X Day.

843
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,380
We'll be right back.

844
00:43:40,940 --> 00:44:04,120
We'll be right back.

845
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,400
We'll be right back.

846
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,400


847
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,860
And also, and also, and also, and also,

848
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,580
and also, the devotional I just read today is coming up,

849
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,300
and Jihad Jerry is going to be there.

850
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,540
Jihad Jerry.

851
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:20,900
You know, Jerry Casale of Devo formed a sort of a protest rap surf band

852
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,140
called Jihad Jerry and the Sunbuddies.

853
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:24,580
I can't remember.

854
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,900
So, well, when is the devotional?

855
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,080
That is in September, the middle of September sometime,

856
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,000
not early or terribly late.

857
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,560
So we've got about a month.

858
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,000
I guess we have one of those.

859
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,720
middle weekend. About a month to go?

860
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,260
I read about it in the Free Times.

861
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,100
There's a

862
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,240
funny picture of Mark Mothersbaugh

863
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,020
with his finger up his nose.

864
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,760
Is that a current issue? Yes.

865
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,060
The one with the battered woman on the cover?

866
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,080
No. Well, maybe

867
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,200
it's the scene. This one has the drug-using

868
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,700
politician on the cover.

869
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:54,140
Yep, yep.

870
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,520
When they had Bob on the cover,

871
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,660
they got complaints. Of course, that was

872
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,740
because Bob Dobbs' face was pasted

873
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,420
in over the baby Jesus

874
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,480
on a classical painting.

875
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,440
And now, the radio adaptation

876
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,580
of Mel Gibson's

877
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,160
Passion of the Christ.

878
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,060
Are you

879
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,200
Jesus Christ?

880
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,120
I am.

881
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,100
Ah!

882
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,660
Ah!

883
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,660
Ah!

884
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,300
Ah!

885
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,120
Ah!

886
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,120


887
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,360
Ah!

888
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:30,880
Ah!

889
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,000
Ah!

890
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,380
Ah!

891
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:31,880
Ah!

892
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:31,980
Ah!

893
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,080
Ah!

894
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,080


895
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,260
Ah!

896
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,260


897
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,360
Ah!

898
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,240
Ah!

899
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


900
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


901
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


902
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


903
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


904
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


905
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


906
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


907
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


908
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,240


909
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,300
Ah!

910
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Ah!

911
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,440


912
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,220
Ah!

913
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:37,780
Ah!

914
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Ah!

915
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:40,340
Ah!

916
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:40,920
Ah!

917
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,240
Ah!

918
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,160
Ah!

919
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,220


920
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:43,500
Ah!

921
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,980
Passion of the Christ

922
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,580
from Phineas Narco

923
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,360
of National Cynical

924
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:02,860
Radio.

925
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,400
You can get it on there.

926
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,740
You can download tons of shows from nationalcynical.com.

927
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,760
And what else?

928
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,820
Oh, actually, I've got something for you guys.

929
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,500
I must share this with you, and this is not a well-known fact.

930
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,380
God, where's the note?

931
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:34,300
There is, it's called jesuschristarcade.com.

932
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,740
And it's a series of flash games that are amusing for a little while.

933
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:46,840
And the first one, Jesus keeps rising up, little cartoon Jesus is rising up to heaven.

934
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,940
And you blast him so that he crashes to the ground and doesn't make it to heaven.

935
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,280
Blood comes out and everything.

936
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,360
Would it be a good one?

937
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,060
A light gun game?

938
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:04,000
I don't know how of these light guns that you point for a century people speak of.

939
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,520
So loud.

940
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,360
Let's take another call here real quick.

941
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,020
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.

942
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,080
Hello, you're on the air.

943
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,960
Hello?

944
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:11,760
Hello.

945
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:12,700
Hello.

946
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,860
I was just wondering, like, what religion are you guys over there?

947
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,900
Church of the subgenius.

948
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,380
That's him.

949
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,780
This is what they're speaking of.

950
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,140
I, of course, am part of the non-aligned movement.

951
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,320
Well, you bought a subgenius membership card.

952
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:28,820
But that does not...

953
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,560
But you can still have your own religion besides that.

954
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,340
It was JesusChristArcade.com that I was talking about.

955
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,800
And I'm not kidding.

956
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,760
I'm not making that up.

957
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,900
I believe it exists.

958
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:41,740
Yeah.

959
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,560
So, Colin, why is this...

960
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,100
I have another question.

961
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,840
What was that website again?

962
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,400
JesusChristArcade.com.

963
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,520
It's done by a very religious fellow.

964
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,660
A Reverend Jeremiah.

965
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,300
I had a radio debate with him just yesterday.

966
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,020
I found a funny, interesting website called GodIsImaginary.com.

967
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:04,720
Okay, guys.

968
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,700
Thanks for having me.

969
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,640
I gotta go now, okay?

970
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,480
Oh, really?

971
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,060
Okay.

972
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:08,580
Have a good night.

973
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,100
Well, hey, while we're...

974
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,280
Let our religions carry you away.

975
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,780
And the true and not true.

976
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,200
What?

977
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:15,820
What?

978
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,080
What?

979
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:16,640
What?

980
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,540
What?

981
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,060
What?

982
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:18,900


983
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,340
What?

984
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:19,680


985
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,040
What?

986
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,360
What?

987
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:21,920
What?

988
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,100
What?

989
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,140
What?

990
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:23,480
What?

991
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:23,560
What?

992
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:23,700
What?

993
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:24,480
What?

994
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


995
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


996
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


997
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


998
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


999
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


1000
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


1001
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


1002
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


1003
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


1004
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,480


1005
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,380
What?

1006
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,660
What?

1007
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:38,920
What?

1008
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:38,960
What?

1009
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1010
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1011
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1012
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1013
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1014
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1015
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1016
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1017
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1018
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1019
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1020
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1021
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1022
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1023
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1024
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1025
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1026
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1027
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1028
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1029
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1030
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1031
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1032
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1033
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1034
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:38,960


1035
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:52,940
Here's why...

1036
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:01,460
nation. The judgments of God is going to fall upon this nation. An angel come and stood right over my

1037
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:08,560
head, and I heard that angel singing. There's a nation that stands in the judgment. There is a

1038
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:24,420
nation that has forgotten God. Sin stands in disgrace. America has forgotten God.

1039
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:32,100
Delightfully refreshing. Delightfully refreshing. Delightfully refreshing. Delightfully refreshing.

1040
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:43,100
A young man of 17 years of age is more exciting, more exciting. Jesus, you are good-looking. Come

1041
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:51,120
to bed with me and attack me. That is a good thing to do. Come to bed with me. Sleep with me. Oh,

1042
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,080
what an exchange.

1043
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,260
And your

1044
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:54,460
God is

1045
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:54,460


1046
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:03,360
good. Beautiful, beautiful. Expose her. Beautiful as Jesus. It's painful, pleasurable. Oh, no. Come

1047
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:10,860
close to me. Think of it. They were doing contact with others. They were getting along. They strip,

1048
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:19,560
they strip. She had devoured him. Bring out the long beat. Isn't it interesting living in this

1049
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,800
perverted land? A stench always came first. Beautiful,

1050
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:30,840
beautiful. Let's do it. Delightfully refreshing. Say you're driving with your children and someone

1051
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,980
cuts you off. You're mad and you have every right to be. That means you should take it out on the

1052
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:46,460
other driver's color, sex, or age. So teach prejudice to your kids. God gave us a purpose.

1053
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:53,520
God put us here for some reason. Everything that we do here is

1054
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:00,320
aimed at the next world or it ought not to be done. You who are pastors who have been chosen by God

1055
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:08,380
Almighty to lead. We are talking about Christianizing America. We are talking about

1056
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:15,300
simply spreading the gospel in a political context. My friend, God Almighty does not hear

1057
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:21,100
the prayer of a Jew for how in the world can God hear the prayer of a man who says Jesus Christ is

1058
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:21,940
not the true Messiah.

1059
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,180
It is.

1060
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,820
In this last moment, we need to bring the world to the foot of the cross.

1061
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:34,540
And we have been dealing with and showing who these people were and telling you that they were

1062
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:47,240
representatives of all the 12 tribes of Israel who were without a question Anglo-Saxon, Celtic,

1063
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,200
kindred peoples. Because that's the true Israel.

1064
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,700
Israel of the Bible that's who the true Israel of the Bible is.

1065
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:01,240
I shall go down in history as greatest German.

1066
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,900
I am not associated with them.

1067
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:09,620
We think of ourselves as the ultimate minority, the subgeniuses, the final organizations,

1068
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,220
the most understood minority.

1069
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,740
And they don't take us seriously and righteously so.

1070
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,020
What happens if they cross us?

1071
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,020
You know.

1072
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,100
Maybe we pray or something.

1073
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:26,140
but most often we don't know about it we are in this until the Lord himself comes

1074
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:34,900
back and rescues all of us all right cut him off leave him on down into the

1075
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:42,520
never-ending valley of toil and agony stretching mile after mile an inferno of

1076
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:49,540
mud-soaked bodies and everywhere the lash of watchful taskmasters ready to sting the

1077
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:55,580
backs of the wearer she lives up there she invites you up there and when she gets you

1078
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:00,780
up there she knocks you down a nice guy like Benson don't think honey I'm not thinking honey

1079
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,440
I'm just telling you Benson wasn't good enough for her come on get out of the sky I don't like

1080
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,920
you sure that's her but don't let her fool you when she looks soft and sweet she sits in your

1081
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,400
lap and purrs doesn't she yeah she don't fool me none because wham and there it is fire is still

1082
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,980
fire stuck a little tongue out at me didn't you

1083
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,920
fire we read a kiss from Cinderella well she didn't get away with it did she did she can't

1084
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:30,540
she got kissed right back and when you take her by the throat you shake her silly slap her back

1085
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,460
you put her in her place and you give her the left the vicious scheming rotten darling

1086
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,300
you're very

1087
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:54,620
you guys ever read a book I've been reading the most fabulous book

1088
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:03,900
um the the science of disc world 2 the globe it's half non-fiction modern science uh

1089
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:11,800
Carl Sagan-y type stuff and half the weirdest most insane fantasy satire you ever saw

1090
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:18,300
sounds uh sounds like good stuff by Terry Pratchett who is a best-selling fiction author

1091
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,520
in England and he's a great writer and he's a great writer and he's a great writer and he's a great

1092
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:19,880
he know I'm the one that's going to say this.

1093
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,780
Two scientist fellows who have

1094
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,380
been apparently keeping up on things a little better than I have it's full of

1095
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:32,000
some great debunking yeah you would probably actually like it Dr. Sinister

1096
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,180
why don't you repeat that name for me it's called the science of disc world 2

1097
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:45,240
uh-huh the globe there was a science of disc world but that was about the flat disc

1098
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,520
shape world on the back of the four elephants and the big turtle right this one is very small

1099
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:49,520


1100
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:49,520


1101
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:49,520


1102
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,720
about our world.

1103
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,180
Interesting.

1104
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,260
Although it relates

1105
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,140
to Discworld,

1106
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,500
or Discworld science.

1107
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,160
There's also

1108
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,400
the Physics of Star Trek

1109
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,800
by Cleveland favorite

1110
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,260
Lawrence Krauss.

1111
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,360
Well, but that's kind of

1112
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,980
a spoil sport thing.

1113
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:06,720
Yeah.

1114
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,260
This one is far from that.

1115
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,380
It's very, very fun

1116
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:12,420
and playful.

1117
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,000
And it's not heavy,

1118
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,020
heavy, hard science.

1119
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,620
It's definitely

1120
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,440
what you would call

1121
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,200
written for the pop

1122
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,720
science level.

1123
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,800
But it's quite a step up

1124
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,080
from last year's

1125
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,060
Discover magazine,

1126
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,940
if you know what I mean.

1127
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:27,200
All right.

1128
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,520
And so we come to the end,

1129
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,480
sort of.

1130
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,820
We've been hearing

1131
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,980
a combination of

1132
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,340
the old subgenius

1133
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,660
Media Barrage number four

1134
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,580
and some new stuff

1135
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,640
by Norrell Preff.

1136
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,700
Also, some weird noises

1137
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,520
by Frater Sadi.

1138
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,680
Or Sodi.

1139
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,240
I don't even know.

1140
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:48,680
And,

1141
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,680
Lemur.

1142
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,880
And in the background here,

1144
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,100

1156
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,320
Stretched across the surface

1157
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:21,820
of reality.

1158
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,440
Contains a thousand

1159
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,220
scattered images

1160
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,500
that cannot be retrieved.

1161
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,660
This building,

1162
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,700
you encrypted the truth.

1163
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,180
That's how good you are

1164
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,960
at betraying yourself.

1165
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,900
I told you that he wasn't

1166
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:34,640
ready for infinity.

1167
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,560
Hey, don't start with

1168
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,880
that magic blanket bullshit,

1169
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,220
okay?

1170
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:37,900
It's not magic.

1171
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,000
It's just the way things are,

1172
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:39,360
Tommy.

1173
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,580
You and me in the air

1174
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,360
are actually tiny particles

1175
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,820
that are swirling around together.

1176
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,820
Look right here.

1177
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,120
You see?

1178
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,120
Okay.

1179
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,140
But look at the cracks

1180
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,320
between these particles.

1181
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,080
And the cracks we fall through

1182
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,120
the holes of nothingness.

1183
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,380
Exactly, because that's what

1184
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,420
I just experienced upstairs.

1185
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,100
But look closer.

1186
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,480
There are tiny particles

1187
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,240
connecting the larger cubes.

1188
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,000
Yeah, and then tinier cracks

1189
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,060
between the connections.

1190
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,280
And even tinier connections.

1191
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,320
And even tinier cracks.

1192
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,260
Yeah, but if you look

1193
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,780
close enough,

1194
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,900
you can't tell where

1195
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,600
my nose ends and space begins

1196
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,080
because they're unified.

1197
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,040
See?

1198
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,780
So what?

1199
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,900
You can't see any of this anyway.

1200
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,660
Do you see anything?

1201
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:15,200
No.

1202
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,660
But I want to debate

1203
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,820
this particle cube thing.

1204
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,180
You live all the time

1205
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,120
with things you can't see.

1206
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:20,860
You can't see electricity,

1207
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,640
can you?

1208
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,080
You can't see radio waves,

1209
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,100
but you accept them.

1210
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:24,740
Trust.

1211
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,300
Fuck trust.

1212
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,260
You better stay away

1213
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,100
from Katerine Albert

1214
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,760
because she's going to

1215
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,440
lead you down the path

1216
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:28,880
to darkness.

1217
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,360
She was our prize graduate

1218
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,620
student until she went astray.

1219
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:32,580
No, I think that I am

1220
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,260
going to stay with her

1221
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,420
and the cracks and the pain

1222
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,100
and the nothingness

1223
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,080
because that's more real to me.

1224
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:36,780
That's what I feel.

1225
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,200
Word!

1226
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,540
Okay, we're not sweating it.

1227
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,800
No, we're going to work with Brad.

1228
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,000
And it'll all come back

1229
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,920
to you and interconnection.

1230
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,440
Brad, are you kidding me?

1231
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,700
I'm going to work on that prick

1232
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,640
and it's all going to come back

1233
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,740
to pain and no connection.

1234
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:47,940
No.

1235
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:48,920
It's on.

1236
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,520
It's on.

1237
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,360
It's on.

1238
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,440
It's on.

1239
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,680
It's on.

1240
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:25,880
It's on.

1241
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,500
It's on.

1242
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,320
It's on.

1243
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,320


1244
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,580
You can take those records

1245
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:32,620
and run them backwards

1246
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,500
and you can hear Satan

1247
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,380
talking on there.

1248
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,020
So I want you

1249
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,820
to realize

1250
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,420
that we're in a crooked

1251
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,240
and diverse nation.

1252
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,040
Nation.

1253
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,460
Nation.

1254
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,020
Nation.

1255
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,360
Nation.

1256
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,620
Nation.

1257
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,600
Get out of here.

1258
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,460
Get out of here.

1259
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,860
Get out of here.

1260
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,500
Get out of here.

1261
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,460
Get out of here.

1262
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,420
Get out of here.

1263
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,380
Get out of here.

1264
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,440
Get out of here.

1265
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,580
We're going to get you.

1266
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,440
We're going to get you.

1267
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,080
Peace!

1268
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,020
Right there, motherfucker.

1269
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:02,900
Peace!

1270
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,100
Right there, motherfucker.

1271
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,320
Son of a bitch with a machine gun.

1272
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,340
Son of a bitch with a machine gun.

1273
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:08,940
Peace!

1274
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,120
Right there, motherfucker.

1275
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:10,980
Peace!

1276
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:12,080
Right there, motherfucker.

1277
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,300
Son of a bitch with a machine gun.

1278
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,320
Son of a bitch with a machine gun.

1279
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,880
Get out of here! Get out of here!

1280
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,140
Peace!

1281
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,040
Right there, motherfucker!

1282
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,300
Son of a bitch with a machine gun!

1283
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,600
Get out of here!

1284
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,240
Well, never mind. I'll break the end of it, isn't it?

1285
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,220
I'll be back with the bacon.

1286
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,480
I'm drinking to a woman.

1287
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,800
I'm drinking to your mother.

1288
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,040
I'm drinking to your father.

1289
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,900
And I'm drinking to the whole corn-fed state of Kansas.
