1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,660
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,960
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,000
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,100
Nor that one.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,820
The subgenius. Power of...

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,780
Slack.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,860
Hey, what's going on?

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:44,480
Along with Bob, the pursuit of Slack, and a conspiracy of pinks, the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:54,300
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998, when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,800
the aliens will arrive.

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,640
They will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,020
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth. They're going to...

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:13,460
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

14
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:24,680
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket-paid-in-full-to-the-church subgenii, have the tiniest prayer of survival.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
The rest of them?

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,720
It's a tough world, Jack.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,380
That's right, friends.

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,780
A red-letter day is coming.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:40,240
And it is July 5th, year 2001.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:53,640
And there the gigantic flying saucers come down out of the blue sky to pick up the happy-go-lucky subgeniuses and their pets.

21
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,060
Bluebirds.

22
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,360
And all their worldly goods.

23
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,660
And swallows.

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,360
Because, friends, you can take it with you when you're a subgenius, sure.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,260
A throne of gold can be yours.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,300
You can take off and get it on with Ba-ah-ba-ah.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,600
And Dave here, who will be your driver throughout Earth space.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,020
Step in. Step in, please.

29
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,040
Stand clear of the closing door.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,140
Step in, please.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
Stand clear of the closing door.

32
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Red line, please, only.

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,220
Blue line to the left.

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,360
Red line to the right.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,960
Hey, hey.

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,380
Welcome, and we'll be embarking for, well, wherever these escape vessels escape to.

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,600
No one's ever asked, and we're not telling.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,180
What's gonna happen to your children?

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,720
What's gonna happen to your children?

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:50,780
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created, when this society we've created, air conditioners, air conditioners, station wagons with wooden sides, station wagons with wooden sides,

41
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,440
cautious indeed, a retired actor, orange hair, orange hair, orange hair,

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,000
What happens when that collapses?

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,340
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,820
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

45
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,720
That's when the man from Planet X-9, when the man from Planet X-9,

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

47
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,760
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

48
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:16,520
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,640
I don't know what I feel.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:20,760
I don't know what I feel.

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,340
I don't know what I feel this way.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,040
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at misfortune.

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,660
Darkness can never last too long.

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:43,760
Every time I think I'm falling and there's nobody around to hold me up and it seems like the world has come to an end.

55
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,180
I look up for my husband, now the face is friendly.

56
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,640
And suddenly a photo comes up in the ground.

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,980
The bottom of the pool is a raging fire.

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,220
I try to jump above it but there's no way.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,760
The next thing I know, I'm going down.

60
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,780
Does it hurt?

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,380
Oh, it really doesn't matter.

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,240
Does it burn?

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,740
Oh, I don't feel a thing.

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,680
Does it stink?

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,260
Oh yeah, it really doesn't matter.

66
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,040
Does it hurt?

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,660
Oh, I don't give a damn.

68
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,900
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom, it only makes me laugh.

69
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,480
It only makes me laugh.

70
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,920
When I go down the pool and I hit the bottom.

71
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:31,740
The last time that I fell in love, the love was milk and honey but the milk turned sour.

72
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,580
The woman became a monster and everyone I knew had become a stranger.

73
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,020
And the room went black and my luck was spent.

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,340
The floor opened up, down I went.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,340
Does it hurt?

76
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,920
Oh, it really doesn't matter.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,720
Does it burn?

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,240
Oh, I don't feel a thing.

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,140
Does it stink?

80
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,740
Oh yeah, it really doesn't matter.

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,560
Does it hurt?

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh, I don't give a damn.

83
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,280
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom, it only makes me laugh.

84
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,900
It only makes me laugh.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,120
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom, it only makes me laugh.

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,940
It only makes me laugh.

87
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,700
It only makes me laugh.

88
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,980
It's coming at me like, it's coming at me like.

89
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,700
It's coming at me like, it's coming at me like.

90
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,420
Can't get out, can't get it out.

91
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,800
Holding up prize in doesn't hurt, van

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:24,940
it.

93
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,980
But really doesn't matter, doesn't burn, do a little crazy.

94
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,420
Do a little crazy, a little crazy.

95
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:33,680
Can't get it out, can't get it out.

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,620
This little pain.

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,260
We grow from our blow to our heart's

98
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,900
ated guns.

99
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,940
Take a whiz and I'll save you a change.

100
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,040
Whoops that aint my answer fast enough,

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,680
Just a little run a couple of times.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:47,860
Lets go.

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:47,960
The end.

104
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:47,960


105
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,480
And no, so it was an alien place

106
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,700
The sun was coming by a dark cloud

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,960
And though I tried, I couldn't find a way to escape

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
The only way to go

109
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,580
Straight down

110
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,180
Does it hurt? Oh, it doesn't matter

111
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,560
Does it burn? Oh, I don't feel a thing

112
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,020
Does it sting? Oh, yeah, it doesn't matter

113
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,480
Does it hurt? Oh, I don't give a damn

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,920
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom

115
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,660
It only makes me laugh

116
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,200
It only makes me laugh

117
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,620
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom

118
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,520
It only makes me laugh

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,220
It only makes me laugh

120
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,900
It only makes me laugh

121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,480
It only makes me laugh

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,480
I don't know why I feel this way

123
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,620
I don't know if it's right or wrong

124
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,980
To laugh at this fortune

125
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,320
Dark

126
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,840
This can never last too long

127
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,300
With a laugh in his face

128
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,940
Oh, oh, yeah

129
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,880
With a laugh in his face

130
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,300
I don't know why I feel this way

131
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,540
I don't know if it's right or wrong

132
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,880
To laugh at this fortune

133
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,280
Dark

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,760
This can never last too long

135
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,220
With a laugh in his face

136
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,560
It only makes me laugh

137
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,260
It only makes me cry

138
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,300
When I find myself falling and I feel this way

139
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,340
This song is just so dark

140
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,380
This song is just too dark

141
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,380
I've UTTERly fallen

142
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm cellob ây

143
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,580
I can't die

144
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,100
It'll be over

145
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,580
But I still feel great

146
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm sentenced to eight years in prison for harboring PR News in Washington.

147
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,480
PR News, Washington.

148
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,120
The alleged mastermind is still at large.

149
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,840
Oh, yes. Dear friends, thanks, Lemur, for news and titles.

150
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,260
Praise good old Danny Elfman for that song, Only Makes Me Laugh.

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,300
And praise Pope of all New York, David N. Meyer,

152
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,060
and Professor Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and G. Gordon Gordon

153
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,420
for that media barrage set of clips there about X-Day.

154
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,740
Lots more of that old media barrage-y stuff to come.

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,940
We recorded hours of fun at 23X Day, or more properly, the 25th X-Day drill,

156
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,740
day in and day out for a week,

157
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:40,040
because we were meeting virtually for our end-of-the-world ritual party using the Zoom app.

158
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,840
And, uh...

159
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,420
the sound is weird and spotty and requires a lot of editing.

160
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,360
A lot of editing.

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,540
In fact, it's kind of hard to imagine getting through it all.

162
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,300
But, uh, we tended to get strangely informal and maybe too inside.

163
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,020
I had... I've removed some tedious and or interesting lecturing,

164
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,360
uh, but I'm putting it elsewhere for internet only,

165
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,180
so I can get it to the background mode.

166
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,380
Buddy?

167
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,300
I don't know if you can hear Buddy barking, but...

168
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,900
This music in the background is from Captain Blackout.

169
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,220
Cassie Overdose, he called him.

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,660
Uh, we did some kind of controlled show type things with the old guard

171
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,020
early in 23X Day, but much more of it was open mic madness

172
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,820
that any subgenius who spoke up would get.

173
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,640
So, uh, we're gonna have to get in on, and we'll get to those recordings soon.

174
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,340
But for now, it's the calm, old guy stuff with Dr. Howell,

175
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,340
Uncle Onan Canabite, Dr. Philo Drummond,

176
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,160
Piss Baptist John Shirley, Moda Mac,

177
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,100
and host Professor Pressure.

178
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,880
I've never seen that behavior before, but that's always why I went to X Day.

179
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,040
You know, I always like to see people do this.

180
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,260
I've never seen that behavior before.

181
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,800
You go to the room. That's why.

182
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,760
That's why I went to X Day.

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,880
So now I can say this was the X Day that I, you know, I saw John...

184
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
When I was a young boy, they said,

185
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,320
you should go to X Day if you want to see that stuff.

186
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,020
Hey, did you ever hear about the stark fist?

187
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,040
Well, I got something to tell you.

188
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,320
Yes.

189
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,240
Philo's granddad told him all about subgenius.

190
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,760
The lush fist.

191
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,140
Look him out behind the woodshed.

192
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,300
The nice fist of approval.

193
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,540
Yeah.

194
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,240
The nice open palm of approval.

195
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,400
Which you cross with silver.

196
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,240
And then you have to show to buy and sell in the marketplace.

197
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,300
For the first time, I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.

198
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,500
What else could it be?

199
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,060
Frightening as the thought may be, it could happen.

200
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,600
The sun will become dark.

201
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
The moon blood red.

202
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,760
The stars of the heavens will fall.

203
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,520
There'll be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming.

204
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,460
The islands and the mountains are shaking out of their sockets.

205
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
And the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the face of the earth.

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,660
It's all coming.

207
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,920
Yes, I'm ready now.

208
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,920
Then close your eyes.

209
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,120
And tap your heels together three times.

210
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,600
And think to yourself, there's no place like...

211
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,040
There's no source like...

212
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,260
BOB.

213
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,120
Round, round the slack-fo bob the bob down in the saucer-row.

214
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,940
Round, round the slack-fo bob the bob down in the saucer-row.

215
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,680
And in that air there was a ship, a rare ship, an ex � delight ship.

216
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,700
With a ship in the air, and the air flew in smoke.

217
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,060
H cloth It hid the smoke from the lamp, and the a prop

218
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,940
and the pipe, and the p ipe and the grid, and the grid.

219
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,380
And the bob bob down in the saucer-row.

220
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Round, round the slack-fo ob the bob down in the saucer-row.

221
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,080
Round, round the slack-fo ob the bob down in the saucer-row.

222
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,080
And in that ship there was a Bob, a rare Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

223
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:25,040
With a Bob on the ship, and the ship in the air, and the air through the smoke, and the smoke from the prop, and the prop in the pipe, in the pipe, in the grin, in the grin, in the Bob.

224
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,820
Bob Dobbs in the Sosaro!

225
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,720
Plan is to invade, to infest key men in government and industry with some alien force from outer space

226
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,440
that seeps into the human body and takes over.

227
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,060
Is that more ancient literature of subgenius?

228
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,360
Yeah.

229
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,700
Yeah, the old catalog.

230
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,640
Yep.

231
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,420
From a time when subgeniuses had to worry about who was eating and who was being eaten.

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,680
It's always one or the other.

233
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,440
Eat or be eaten.

234
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,560
Our ancestors told us this truth.

235
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,020
Only the most advanced life forms get off that particular...

236
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,700
They unchained from the food.

237
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,020
Food chain.

238
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,720
I know who did before us were the giant cave bears who were far more intelligent than today's bears.

239
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:21,580
And some of them, it seems, died of natural causes, so-called, peacefully surrounded by their loved ones.

240
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,420
Didn't get eaten at all.

241
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,880
And they were the first to achieve this.

242
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,500
Just four hours ago I murdered two lesser creatures and we ate them for lunch.

243
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,420
Lobsters.

244
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,240
We boiled them alive.

245
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,580
Oh my god, I hate that practice.

246
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,700
They're known to be relatively intelligent and socially, you know, evolved.

247
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,440
They're also quite delicious with butter.

248
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,200
But you're trying to terrify the kids on the kitchen floor.

249
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,620
Then you boil them alive.

250
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,520
Bobbies are delicious, but that's another story.

251
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,260
What if there is a form of life in space, not on some planet, but just drifting?

252
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Not life as we know it, with intelligence, yes, but pure energy with no organic matter.

253
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,760
Invisible.

254
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,400
Invisible?

255
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,020
Now the rocket passed through its path.

256
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,180
It entered the rocket.

257
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,420
It found living specimens of our form of life.

258
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Cell organisms.

259
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,740
Humans.

260
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,380
Exactly.

261
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,640
Now, if even by accident it could enter one of those structures, what a way to invade the Earth.

262
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,560
Now look, sir, I'm not over-intelligent, but will you...

263
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,800
You saw the film, you know what happened.

264
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,180
Only God knows where and how far that rocket traveled.

265
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,760
Something got into that rocket.

266
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,680
And it's found other forms of life.

267
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,000
The cactus.

268
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,400
The cactus.

269
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,500
The cactus.

270
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


271
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:37,500


272
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,280
Do you mean Kyrus, the cactus?

273
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,000
He's now in a shell of a man being transformed.

274
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,160
If one of these cactus plants were subject to the same mutation, there could be an affinity,

275
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,940
a union between plant and animal with the ability to destroy and possess and multiply.

276
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,020
An alien cannot invade a dead man, we're merely using this corpse for a demonstration of placement.

277
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:16,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm trying to murder former housing secretaries in several states, and in Arizona, retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes plummeted to earth.

278
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,060
Wall Street down 4 off 9, this is PR News.

279
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:29,500
President Bush is calling on voters to intensify their resistance against the United States after an unclaimed black backberry pack spoke to PR News in Washington.

280
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,260
Here we are on X.

281
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,280
Let me close the room, X!

282
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,180
X!

283
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,920
X!

284
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,600
X!

285
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:53,620


286
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:53,720
X!

287
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,880
I don't think you want to record us, but if you do want to, I did bring my...

288
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,780
What should I call it?

289
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,600
Tristan...

290
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,060
I'm happy with not recording us, let's just audio record.

291
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,280
We can be seen by the people on Zoom.

292
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,960
We can be seen by the people on Zoom.

293
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,720
They can see us, we can see them.

294
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,700
Ha ha ha ha!

295
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,800
Ha ha ha ha!

296
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,120
Ha ha ha ha!

297
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,340
Happy X Day.

298
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,120
Happy X Day.

299
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,500
Happy, happy.

300
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:19,660
Happy x day, happy x day, happy x day, happy x day, happy x day, happy x day, happy x day,

301
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,860
subgenius.

302
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,840
Are you a subgenius?

303
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,760
Are you really?

304
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,480
Are you really?

305
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,460
Did you pay your dues this year?

306
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,740
That's all I want to know.

307
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,140
Gotta pay that entry fee.

308
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,680
Gotta pay that entry fee to the salsa ship.

309
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,600
To the salsa ship.

310
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,320
The salsa ship that's taking us away.

311
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,240
Taking us away.

312
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,920
Take me away.

313
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,600
Take me away.

314
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:57,420
Ha!

315
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,120
Ha!

316
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,020
Ha!

317
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,000
Like a deflated balloon.

318
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,700
I'm waiting.

319
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,700
I'm waiting.

320
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,040
I'm waiting.

321
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,540
I'm waiting.

322
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm waiting for x day.

323
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,180
When is it coming?

324
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,140
When is it coming, rubber negative?

325
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,340
In the meantime.

326
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,940
In the meantime.

327
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,820
Now!

328
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,080
In the meantime...

329
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,240
We're gonna rock out until that salsa ship comes

330
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,760
and takes us away.

331
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,860
Ha ha ha ha ha!

332
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Ha ha ha ha ha!

333
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,840
Ha ha ha!

334
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:01,840


335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,300
Ha ha.

336
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,000
Ha ha ha.

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,000


338
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,780
Oh, you can't imagine how it makes my old ticker soar like a hawk

339
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:18,520
to hear young doctors doing doctor music like me and Philo and our buddies did back in the days

340
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,300
of Doctors for Rotan, which was inspired by Doctors for Bob in Little Rock,

341
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,680
where you just turn on the recorder and go nuts.

342
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,220
That was the Sub-G Kids.

343
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,100
Kids, the Sub-G Kids, my favorite new doctor band,

344
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,660
which is saying something because I normally hate doctor bands.

345
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,040
We'll hear lots more new doctors in the future.

346
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:51,380
But for now, we must make do with the old doctors still in the first hour of the first day of the

347
00:19:51,380 --> 00:20:00,980
first Zoom X-Day on July 1st of the so-called 2020, wherein we refer to the video things

348
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
that are...

349
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,100
Beloved radio audience cannot see.

350
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,340
This scene in the background behind me now is the way real X-Days are.

351
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,640
Is that a...

352
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,940
I love how you can move the image like a curtain.

353
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,420
It is a curtain.

354
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,240
Be the robot in the center.

355
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,400
Philo can come out from inside the image.

356
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,840
I love that.

357
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,620
Look at that.

358
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,020
That's a great effect by itself.

359
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,040
It's just so simple and obvious.

360
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,740
I'm sure it's...

361
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,900
Beyond the veil.

362
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,780
Sting.

363
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:31,940
Sting.

364
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,200
Sting.

365
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,200


366
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,580
Beyond the veil.

367
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,960
Days in the past that looked a lot like that, as I recall.

368
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,120
Yeah.

369
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,240
One of a kind of a...

370
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,900
Now, this way it's going to look next year.

371
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,980
Now, of course, the people listening to this on the radio don't know...

372
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,920
What next year?

373
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,040
This is the last year.

374
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,740
No, this is the place we look on my...

375
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,120
I was saying earlier that contextually, this is so apocalyptic, Al, this year, that this

376
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,900
could be the year, except the problem is the saucers will go to the place.

377
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,340
And we won't be there.

378
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,720
And so I've left a message for them to...

379
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,980
They're going to pick us up by pincers, which will pull us upward like this.

380
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,260
Oh!

381
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,160
And it will be a little painful, but it will be worth it.

382
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,440
Greatens your spine right out.

383
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,000
Greatens your spine.

384
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,920
It doesn't prefer to make it clearer the last terrestrial year, because just like space

385
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,880
travelers pretend for days and simulate Earth.

386
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,880
The wake and sleep periods will have the great solar year.

387
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,020
It'll actually be the year one.

388
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,740
Yes?

389
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,580
Down here, this could be the last year.

390
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:47,760
In fact, and surely is the last year of man on Earth.

391
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,240
Will there be taxes on the pleasure saucers?

392
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,860
There won't even be taxes.

393
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, I don't know.

394
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,240
There might be that.

395
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,860
But it depends on how you want.

396
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,540
How you want to pay and your ability to pay.

397
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,100
Yeah, how you organize the things in the pleasure saucers.

398
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,220
But if they're truly pleasure saucers, no tax would be necessary.

399
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,120
They would be innately utopian.

400
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,120
Effortlessly.

401
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,560
Effortlessly utopian.

402
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,280
There's a heavy tax for everyone who wants to pay it.

403
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Totally voluntary.

404
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,780
They do have a cussing job.

405
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,440
But if you're hanging with subgeniuses, you may find it taxing.

406
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,780
Absolutely.

407
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,320
That's how you pay part of the tax.

408
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,140
If you want to hang up a bob head, you have to use tax.

409
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,980
That's a good point.

410
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,980
Yes.

411
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,640
That's a good point.

412
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,160
Gatorade there, Philo?

413
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,680
Or is it something else?

414
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,820
Wee, she mysteriously appeared and vanished.

415
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,300
It could be a bottle of green pea or something.

416
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,120
But I think it is Gatorade.

417
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,640
I'm a gator.

418
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,380
Exactly.

419
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,780
It's like a ghostly apparition.

420
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,680
It's an endangered species.

421
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,940
Oh, hey, I did want to point out, if everyone looks up in the left-hand corner,

422
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,820
there's a little icon that says recording, and it's red.

423
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,920
So if you see that, that means that the whole thing is being recorded.

424
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,280
By them.

425
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,580
It's going to the Chinese server.

426
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,220
Of course it is.

427
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,040
We're on Zoom, which is managed by a corporation.

428
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,140
That's a point.

429
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,780
It could well be, you know, in the internet.

430
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,400
You're recording?

431
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,000
It's in a file somewhere.

432
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,280
A Chinese corporation.

433
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,100
Am I?

434
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,320
Yeah.

435
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,020
I'm doing it.

436
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,100
Is it a Chinese corporation?

437
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:38,900
Oh.

438
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,500
Wee, wee, wee.

439
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,800
I have nothing against the People's Republic of China.

440
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,180
May I add that you can make a personal recording of this if you just look down at the bottom,

441
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,180
the button on the right that says record.

442
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,640
You just tap it with your cursor.

443
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,200
Every subgenius has a team of three to five conspiracy agents

444
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,640
that follow.

445
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,700
And record everything they do.

446
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,960
And each of those in turn have five to eight conspiracy agents that review their work.

447
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,880
Well, and how many people are now around you here on this panel?

448
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,860
That's how we guarantee a high unemployment rate.

449
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,540
So that means.

450
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,420
The mystery of the beehive.

451
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,500
Exactly.

452
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:30,840
So the pyramid, the conspiracy pyramid is usually accurately portrayed inverted because the subgenius at the very bottom

453
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
is the person who's doing the work.

454
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,940
The one controlling all of these conspiracy agents by what we say and do.

455
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:42,120
You mean the Ose Dei is actually representing the Church of the subgenius?

456
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:51,120
It might be according to the Masons who, you know, you're if we don't have God, so we're going to make God,

457
00:24:51,260 --> 00:25:00,900
we're going to build this pyramid and we're going to have the eye of God there who favors the beginnings because without the beginnings,

458
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,180
you can't get to that particular end.

459
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,940
Yes, it begins with the letter I that's found in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

460
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,600
That's the mystery that you have to unfold to get to the next level.

461
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,860
Every dot.

462
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,080
Yeah.

463
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:15,960
Oh, good Lord.

464
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,460
Every dot has a revelatory message for those who will but assemble them correctly.

465
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,880
We give you the Dobbs head and you then disassemble the dots, rebuild it into the pyramid.

466
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,380
You're going to have a little bit of a clench that makes sense to you.

467
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,060
The superclimactic message.

468
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:36,940
Yes.

469
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,500
Yes.

470
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,400
The dots derive their information from their relationship to the other dots in the glyph.

471
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:50,780
We're all extraterrestrials on a cycle that is ancestral.

472
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,460
We're off to see the wizards on a paradise among the stars.

473
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
We're all extraterrestrials.

474
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,720
We're all extraterrestrials.

475
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
On a mission that is ancestral.

476
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,600
We're off to see the wizards on a world among the stars.

477
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,880
You know that scientists have said that the Earth will soon be dead.

478
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,960
Philosophers have told us long ago.

479
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,720
You'd think by now we'd all be in the know.

480
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,000
Next year.

481
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,700
I won't.

482
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:30,700


483
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,420
No prob.

484
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,760
Next year you will.

485
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,120
The spin has stopped.

486
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,260
What fun would one of you have?

487
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,340

We must get off.

We must get off.

We must get off.

We must get off.

00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,060
just born in the saucers

517
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,340
Ennio Morricone

518
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,460
the great Italian composer

519
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,020
in years past

520
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,880
I ripped off his scores

521
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,220
for background music

522
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,760
on my very most heartfelt rants

523
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,460
and I owe him.

524
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,640
Here's one of my favorite

525
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,100
pieces of music ever

526
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,780
not from a movie soundtrack album

527
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,960
but performed by the

528
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,400
Danish National Symphony Orchestra

529
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,460
You can see

530
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,020
the amazing music

531
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,560
and the amazing performance

532
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,280
complete with the ladies singing

533
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,340
on YouTube

534
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,280
which is where I got this

535
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,700
Danish National Symphony Orchestra

536
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,560
doing ecstasy of gold

537
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,820
from the good, the bad and the ugly

538
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,280
from the glass so I can't rhyme

539
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,280


540
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,280


541
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,280


542
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,280


543
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,280


544
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,220
and I got this

545
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,220


546
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,220


547
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,460
on and off

548
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:40,900
the last two days

549
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,080
because I was nervous

550
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:49,360
because I felt soPN 페이heet

551

¶¶

610
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:56,620
is written in this forced, painful, fake Victorian way. I'm surprised, John, that you haven't

611
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:02,880
encountered them just because they're so bad. It's a modern writer. A modern writer pretending

612
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:11,260
to write in the 1890s. You've got to watch out because the slightest usage can trip you up.

613
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,120
Yeah, it's always going to be threaded with anachronisms.

614
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,620
Not always, if you're a very careful creator.

615
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:25,240
A few people are. In television, when they have historical things, they're always having

616
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,660
anachronistic terms.

617
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,500
You can watch a Robin Hood movie and understand what's going on.

618
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,740
Robin Hood gets his arrow in the right place, shoots the apple and goes, yes!

619
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,580
Yeah, exactly. Stuff like that.

620
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:40,940
Awesome.

621
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,580
Yeah, that was awesome. That's the kind of thing that you see.

622
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,160
The story of Donahue sucks.

623
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,680
Yeah, some cowboys. Awesome.

624
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,820
No, they don't research these things.

625
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,100
Sucks donkey.

626
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,620
You had that Kevin Costner Robin Hood movie where they brought in gunpowder so they didn't

627
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,240
have explosions.

628
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,400
Well, look at it.

629
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Anyway, the Robin Hood.

630
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,540
The whole thing is permanent.

631
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:15,580
Yeah.

632
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,240
It's embedded in my mind in some form.

633
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,440
It is impressed on me as a child and it will never go.

634
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,900
And Errol Flynn is Robin Hood forever.

635
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,220
And so is Daffy Duck.

636
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,760
We will always remember Robin Hood Daffy.

637
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:37,760
Yes, that was also a Warner Brothers presentation, which included footage from the Errol Flynn

638
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,960
movie in the cartoon with Daffy Duck.

639
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,580
I love that movie.

640
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,040
Yikes and away, wham!

641
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,500
Yikes and away, wham!

642
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,940
Music by Eric Wolfgang.

643
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,440
I remember that now.

644
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,180
That's interesting.

645
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,140
I'm going to press pause and then break the stimulus.

646
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,660
What a great trick you can have in a cartoon.

647
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:25,900


648
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,140
A terrible surgery and then we'll go across to the blackout.

649
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,140


650
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:28,280
Well, not exactly.

651
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,700
Well, OK.

652
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:28,840
And so will it be coming back to you?

653
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,000
No?

654
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,040


655
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,460
Who blows.

656
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
The Psychoskeletons.

657
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,640
Who else?

658
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,080
A piece called Keep Current.

659
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,480
But now, we must lift off with Chaz.

660
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,660
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth.

661
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,600
On board were the Twelve.

662
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,520
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician.

663
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,360
And the other so-called gods of our legends.

664
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,400
But not Bob.

665
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,240
Though gods they were.

666
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,580
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind.

667
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,680
Let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

668
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,420
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.

669
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,420
But we'll have to wait another year.

670
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,120
Hail the sex goddesses.

671
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,620
Because they did show up at X-Day.

672
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,900
A new day.

673
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,480
Yeah, we went over the rainbow.

674
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,380
Into the mitochondria.

675
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,960
Yeti DNA.

676
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,160
Level C.

677
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,880
Well, we're going to have to go north and south and east and west.

678
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,200
And we've got to wait another year.

679
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,940
Yeah, but we're going to fill up a new pipe.

680
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,120
We're going to wait for the sun to shine.

681
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,840
We're going to turn around and take our time.

682
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,120
We're going to break the seal to the other side.

683
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,380
You know, from the valley, I hear the muffled cry.

684
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,760
Of all them poor sheeple that we left behind.

685
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,660
And we're going to take that next evolutionary step.

686
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,520
Yeah, we're going to climb on those rocket ships.

687
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,720
We're going to build the vessels if we have to.

688
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,760
We're already testing the engines.

689
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,180
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.

690
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,800
We're on the ride, yeah.

691
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,120
Mitochondria leave.

692
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,720
Thanks for the ride.

693
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,580
We'll take it from here.

694
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,560
Oh, here.

695
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,280
Here, this is the video down feed from the rocket launch.

696
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:08,580
Here.

697
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,660
Launch the.

698
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,640
Rocket ship.

699
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,500
This is remember they were all chanting this together.

700
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:12,880
Oh, yeah.

701
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,780
Lighting the fuse.

702
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,540
Everyone was dancing.

703
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,240
Mojo and I were out there lighting rocket.

704
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:26,060
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

705
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,240
Yeah!

706
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,420
Yeah!

707
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,380
Yeah!

708
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,300


709
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,380
Yeah!

710
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,800
Yeah!

711
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:32,980
Yeah!

712
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,600
Yeah!

713
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:33,900


714
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,120


715
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:34,360


716
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:34,380
Yeah!

717
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:34,580
Yeah!

718
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,800
Oooh!

719
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,780
In theigner, I was driving down all alone.

720
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:50,780


721
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:50,960
I got back up on that rocket ship.

722
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:50,960


723
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:50,960


724
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:50,960


725
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:50,960


726
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:50,960


727
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,800
I was riding down Main street in my car

728
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,520
A 41' under slung coupe.

729
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,380
When time went by, I lashed off,

730
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,200
I was all decked down, in ma blue suede shoes

731
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,720
And my hair was pumped with goo

732
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,220
I was listening to my radio and waving to all the chicks

733
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,000
When the music stopped and the newsman said

734
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,900
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

735
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,360
They destroyed the world.

736
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,880
The entire Los Angeles area.

737
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,380
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

738
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,820
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.

739
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,440
Martial law is now nationwide.

740
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,580
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

741
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,920
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble

742
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,820
under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

743
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,460
Mob?

744
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,500
Colorado Channel, this is a class one emergency.

745
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,520
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

746
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,040
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

747
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,780
I got exactly what I wanted!

748
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,780
I got exactly what I wanted!

749
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,340
X-Day shall come soon!

750
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:56,800
Sooner or later.

751
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,000
That X is nothing but a cross that's fallen over on its side

752
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,540
and somebody jumped on it.

753
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,660
Banged it up.

754
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,220
There is hope. There shall be hope.

755
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,520
You know, we sit and worry, oh gosh, if only the X-Disc had come.

756
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,060
We could have had a new government where Bob was the leader

757
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,040
and since he's never around there'd be no laws and we could do anything we want.

758
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,280
We could have had a new church where instead of having to get up with a hangover on Sunday

759
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,420
and watch boring crime,

760
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:29,700
you'd go to church Saturday night and get drunk!

761
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,280
Drunk, my friend!

762
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,140
Oh, we could have had our own coolness where we invented the coolness, blah blah blah blah blah.

763
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,700
Friends, what are we waiting for?

764
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,340
Are we really waiting on some invisible monsters in the sky?

765
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,160
Or some space things?

766
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,680
Or some pipe smoking salesman with a good line?

767
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,280
Friends, I say, quit waiting, do it yourself!

768
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,880
Make your own slack!

769
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,400
Bob is not going to do it!

770
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,040
He's not the answer and neither is anything else!

771
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,000
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how!

772
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,440
Question authority or else!

773
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,940
And f*** if they can't take a joke!

774
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,100
Praise Bob!

775
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,260
Oh, those were the days, friends.

776
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,900
Oh, listen to that energy.

777
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,400
And nowadays I'm too old and beat to edit anymore for this episode.

778
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:36,260
So I'll end it with this edit by some utterly mysterious, probably much younger person or persons from the Cleveland area,

779
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,660
going by the name of Sheridan.

780
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,440
Sheridan sent us stuff.

781
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,560
This is some.

782
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:53,160
It's a very laid back, long collage piece called Adrift.

783
00:47:53,900 --> 00:48:01,580
Even if you're driving right now, close your eyes and slack off.

784
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,960
Good morning, senor. Welcome aboard. We've been expecting you.

785
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,500
You greet me with 11 guns. The correct salute for El Supremo Capitan is 23 guns.

786
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,120
The King himself receives only 21.

787
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,040
That is why I always have 23.

788
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,520
Well, hmm.

789
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,140
I'm sorry.

790
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:47,100
I never thought we were pretending to always come back threatened.

791
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,100


792
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,100


793
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,100


794
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,100


795
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,100


796
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,780
They soiled myink, my Зак Tha'ty but I've nothing bigger than this now.

797
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:50,780


798
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:50,780


799
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:51,340
Well, Al-Majumdu.

800
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:51,520


801
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:51,520


802
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,220
Uh Oh E.

803
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,080
She think I'm Kelly di Zafran.

804
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,420
I just listened to this stomach of mine.

805
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,140
I mean, the way it keeps growling and squealing,

806
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,320
the way it sounds, you'd think I had a hyena inside of me.

807
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,080
I have a dream that one day

808
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,300
this nation will rise up

809
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,060
and live out the true meaning of its creed.

810
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,000
We hold these truths to be self-evident

811
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,820
that all men are created equal.

812
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:23,020
We are all human beings.

813
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,900
We can never leave.

814
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,440
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

815
00:50:53,140 --> 00:51:08,760
We are all human beings.

816
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,440
Well, man, so far, so good.

817
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,180
Thank you.

818
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,120
Thank you.

819
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,120


820
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,120


821
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,120


822
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,120


823
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,900
Can two women really be so distracting, Captain?

824
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,020
May I remind you, ma'am,

825
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,720
that my men have been continually at sea for more than seven months.

826
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,700
And you, sir, how long have you been at sea?

827
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,960
I... I...

828
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,560
I shan't complain, Mr. Ornott.

829
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,720
We have much to be thankful for.

830
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,880
That's a fact, miss.

831
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,120
It's like they say,

832
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,480
it ain't never so bad that it can't be worse.

833
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,660
His kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humor,

834
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,200
everything about him is so right.

835
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,000
I...

836
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,220
I...

837
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:38,560
I...

838
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,920
I still have a dream.

839
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,600
I...

840
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:17,600


841
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,480
I...

842
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,480


843
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:26,480


844
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,680
I...

845
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,680


846
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,680


847
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,680


848
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,680


849
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,680


850
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,680


851
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:38,700
I...

852
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:38,700


853
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:38,720
I...

854
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,800
No honorable way to kill.

855
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,640
No gentle way to destroy.

856
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,940
There's nothing good in war except its ending.

857
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,340
It's a

858
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,900
It's a...

859
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:00,900


860
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,080
It's a...

861
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:02,260
It's a...

862
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,380
It's a...

863
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:02,540
It's a...

864
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,200
It's a...

865
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,540
I don't interrupt the parade to lecture the bandmaster,

866
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,960
which is a misimpression that people cultivate

867
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,900
because it's kind of fun.

868
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,280
People who look at this universe as a nice, comfortable place to visit,

869
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,080
maybe live in, maybe spend an awful lot of time in,

870
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:48,420
and anything that helps preserve the illusion helps.

871
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,840
And when you break it, it's like you're just,

872
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,920
you're harshing my particular fantasy right now, you know?

873
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,240
Do you speak Ewok?

874
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:01,800
Not fluently.

875
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,140
I still have a dream.

876
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:41,560
I still have a dream.

877
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,680
I'm used to bemoaning the idiocy of youth,

878
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,660
but it's bad news to keep hearing again and again

879
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,340
that this larger cultural heritage is being squandered

880
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,820
and evaporating before our very eyes.

881
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,040
A lot of human existence is denying our animal nature,

882
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,060
but I think that's the best way to put it.

883
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,060


884
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,060


885
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,780
I just want, I want to teach our kids

886
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,220
what the social expectations are

887
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,860
so that they can go into the world prepared.

888
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,960
I think just wearing pants should be enough

889
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,480
to distinguish us from the monkeys.

890
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,600
That's a good point.

891
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,660
What are we gonna teach you about the wearing pants question?

892
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,400
Eventually we're gonna have to confront that.

893
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,280
Pants are optional.

894
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,800
And now may I be allowed to say something?

895
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:45,980
Humph, humph, humph.

896
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,200
Mמה.

897
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,860
Humph, humph, humph.

898
00:56:59,280 --> 00:56:59,760
Humph, humph, humph.

899
00:56:59,760 --> 00:56:59,760


900
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,660
What drives me crazy is

901
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,180
people perpetually expressing surprise

902
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,460
that terrible things happen in the world.

903
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,140
I mean, it doesn't mean we're not going to be horrified.

904
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,400
It doesn't mean we're not going to be appalled.

905
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,640
It doesn't mean we're not going to protest.

906
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,040
We're, we're going to need to be aumentoodd.

907
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,040


908
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,060
do whatever we can to limit or undo these horrors. But we shouldn't be surprised. How can it be

909
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:28,260
that the commandant at Auschwitz would come home after a day of, you know, ripping babies from

910
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,520
their mother's arms and bashing their heads against the wall and sending people off to the

911
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:39,060
crematoria, and then he would come back to his house and kiss his wife and children and sit down

912
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:44,860
at the piano and play some Schubert before dinner? How is this possible? I think it's absurd to ask

913
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:49,580
such a question. Of course it's possible. Who said that wicked people don't have family lives or

914
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:55,500
have good taste in music? Monsters don't come with signs over their heads saying,

915
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,300
I'm a monster, and then they don't participate in any other human activities. I think we have

916
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,760
to understand that it's human beings who do this, and we have to stop being surprised.

917
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:11,580
We're going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks.

918
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,940
Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser.

919
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,800
That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war.

920
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:44,260
So, Dr. Knudsen, I take it that everybody's now on the same page and they all agree

921
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:49,080
on something about climate change. It's all finished, the shouting's over, right?

922
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,220
No, hardly. Based on the panel discussion that we had in New Orleans, there's still

923
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,040
quite a bit of disagreement on this issue.

924
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,600
Why is it such a hard issue to resolve?

925
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,120
Well, we're...

926
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,040
Thank you, Sheridan, and that long collage called Adrift.
