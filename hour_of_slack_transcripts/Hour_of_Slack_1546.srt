1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,800
Either of you men fear what I fear?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,760
It's funny. They think you're YouTube-ing for everyone saying this when you take content.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,820
I'm afraid she's right, Mr. Vandergilt.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,600
But how can we be sure?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,600
The self-genius, power of...

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,360
What?

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,720
That devil!

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,100
Good grief. I'm on my way.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm on my way.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,480
I'm on my way.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:34,880
I'm on my way.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm on my way.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,140
I'm on my way.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,300
I'm on my way.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,160
Today is a very special day. It's X-Day.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,480
And to help explain the significance of this day, allow me to read the Wikipedia entry

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,980
about the

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,200
about the

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:16,720
X-Day is a traditional part of the Church of the Subgenius, a religion formed as a parody cult of extreme religious groups and their pamphlets and claims.

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:28,980
X-Day fell on July 5, 1998, the scheduled end of the world, and has been celebrated on July 5 each year since then.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,980
X-Day fell on July 5, 1998, the scheduled end of the world, and has been celebrated on July 5 each year since then.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:57,520
From its inception in 1980, the church had prophesied that an army of alien invaders known as the X-ists, or men from planet X, would land on the planet Earth and destroy the world of normals, pinks, and glorps, while the members of the Church of the Subgenius would be rescued by the aliens and taken away into space.

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,660
the Global Mar galaxy may have신

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:19,320
The Arghottqang

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,940
The dinosaur

26
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,420
''Ofirst Life''

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,540
showing up

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
up

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:27,500
up

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,300
the Bozo Cult, until eventually their souls are devoured by the Elder Gods.

31
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,380
The book also tells readers that if they want more information, they should send $1 million

32
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,280
to Ivan Stang so that he can remake his 1973 film, Let's Visit the World of the Future.

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,060
First Event

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:59,380
When July 5, 1998 arrived and no alien fleet appeared in the sky, members of the church

35
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,880
began citing a large number of conspiracy theories to explain why the predicted end

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,640
of the world did not take place.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,120
The most popular explanation for the failure of the prophecy in the church is usually summarized

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,820
with the statement,

39
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,960
The calendar is wrong and July 5, 1998 has not really arrived yet.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,340
Because of this, the church has held annual gatherings around July 5 of each year since

41
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:36,300
1998 to celebrate X-Day and greet the arrival of the anticipated alien sex goddesses.

42
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:44,440
No flying saucer rendezvous has been confirmed as of 2013, but members of the church have

43
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
been undaunted.

44
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,880
The X-Day celebration has become well known in underground culture circles.

45
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,200
Many underground rock bands have performed at X-Day, and the event has evolved into a

46
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,860
festival similar to Burning Man, lasting for three to five days with rock concerts, artistic

47
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,820
events, bonfires, and parties taking place day and night.

48
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,980
Regular events at X-Day include a symbolic effigy burning of J.R. Bob Dobbs, the founder

49
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,500
of the Church of the Subgenius.

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
A baptism where participants have their sins washed and their sins cleansed.

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,040


52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,740
Concerts and performances by underground rock bands and performance artists such as the

53
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,680
Amino Acids, theme camps, and an auction where participants are encouraged to donate strange,

54
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
unusual, and offensive items of all sorts, including themselves.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,600
Burners familiar with the Burning Man event have been upset by the fact that X-Day is

56
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,680
not a commerce-free event in the fashion of Burning Man.

57
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,020
The band has been working on a new album called Burning Man, which is a new album that is

58
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,020


59
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,120
being sold to the public.

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,160
The band's members and participants at X-Day are, in fact, encouraged to sell their own

61
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,980
items, music, and CDs and albums and other paraphernalia.

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,980
The Church of the Subgenius has responded to these complaints with a statement that

63
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,040
it is not a non-profit church.

64
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,440
To quote,

65
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,740
We're for profit, we want profit, and we want to cast out false prophets.

66
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,280
However, the church's status as an independent corporation with no corporate affiliations,

67
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,520
is a

68
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:47,360
That was Reverend Flamegrape on the very first episode of his subgenius show, Fugue Segway,

69
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,380
which runs on Wonderful Wozo.

70
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,020
Or, I don't know.

71
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:59,660
W-O-Z-O-F-M in Knoxville, Tennessee on Sundays at 11 o'clock, which station also runs Hour

72
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,160
of Slack.

73
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,080
Praise Bob.

74
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,560
We're going back to 18X Day again this episode for the edited recordings of the horror of

75
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,480
7am July 5th, as well as the happiness of the Bob-tism.

76
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,520
And some discussion of the same recorded the night of July 5th on Dr. Sinister's show on

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
WCSB Cleveland.

78
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Radio Synesthesia.

79
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,880
But first, a word from Father Joe Mama.

80
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,840
We all know vaguely what X-Day is.

81
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,460
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

82
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,860
The X's shall land and whisk the good subgenies off to a never-ending pleasure cruise of

83
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,300
the cosmos.

84
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,980
But what of the peaks that remain on earth?

85
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,420
What will happen to the A-holes that are left behind?

86
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,780
Well, friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those things, I'm not going to go into

87
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,780


88
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,780


89
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,780


90
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,780


91
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,780


92
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:49,780


93
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,040
the details of what's happening.

94
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,000
But if you're a little less fortunate than I am, the fact is, they'll get exactly what

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,500
they deserve.

96
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,220
Now, to any real subgenie, giving a normal what he deserves is about the cruelest fate

97
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,420
a normal could ever receive.

98
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,000
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,740
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name

100
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,160
of Bob.

101
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,260
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world and turned

102
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,680
it into an ever-growing bureaucratic governmental monster.

103
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:19,740
This is a story of the best-ever-before.

104
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:19,740


105
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:19,760
I'm Bob Sargent.

106
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:19,760


107
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,560
that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck passing, and fill in the blank.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,560
Then, once the creature's rot-filled gut sprues out the digestive combination

109
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,160
of all the vices before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth,

110
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,260
what's the result?

111
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,920
Why, the conspiracy, of course.

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,680
And this pile of stinking defecation we're supposed to kneel before

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,780
and worship and serve?

114
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,040
Never!

115
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,700
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,160
on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays, X-Day 1998.

117
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,460
Dreaded by them, but not by us.

118
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,140
Welcome to Synesthesia, a very special episode here.

119
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm Dr. Sinister.

120
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,440
With me in the studio are Dr. Howland L.

121
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Hello.

122
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,320
And Reverend Ivan Stang, back for the post-mortem

123
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,660
on yet another case of Bob leaving us high and dry.

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,920
On America's grisliest autopsies.

125
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,000
And the only time we want to be left high and dry is during a flood.

126
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,880
Yes, and you mean to say, harking back to that PSA,

127
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,920
that you have to buy special insurance just to cover yourself in case of a flood?

128
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,060
That seems a little bit...

129
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,780
It is true that most homeowners' policies do not cover flood.

130
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,400
Even if you live in floodplain terrace estates?

131
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,040
If you...

132
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,800
You get, uh...

133
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,980
Yeah, they'll make an exception if you deliberately move into a place

134
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,800
called floodplain terrace estates.

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,020
Floodplain terrorist estates?

136
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,480
But the deductible is half a million dollars.

137
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,980
Oh, that's a little bit too rich for my blood.

138
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,200
Anyway, out in Wisteria at X-Day,

139
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,720
no one is concerned with questions of realty or real estate

140
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,540
except Andrew the Impale.

141
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,420
And no one can hear you scream because everyone has, like, earbuds and so on.

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,420
Well, they're all screaming.

143
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,460
No one can hear you scream.

144
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,980
They're all screaming.

145
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,020
They're all screaming.

146
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,640
They're all so screaming at the top of their voices.

147
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,400
It's true.

148
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,640
During the subgenius rave,

149
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,820
where they get down on the ground,

150
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
eat grass like Nebuchadnezzar,

151
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
and foam at the mouth.

152
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
That was just last night.

153
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,320
And then, the very next morning,

154
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,800
we assemble at the saucer landing field

155
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,900
and give the countdown

156
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,860
and look up into the huge, echoing, empty dome

157
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,500
of overarching space

158
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,680
for the manifestation,

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,120
of the special Vimana,

160
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,900
the craft which will whisk us into a new paradigm.

161
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,720
One of these days.

162
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah, whenever it really is 1998, obviously.

163
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,880
It wasn't this time.

164
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,260
I'm asleep because I'll be all fropped to the gills.

165
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,160
I've got a bottle of wine in that green thing there.

166
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,820
I've got a big old bowl of frop in my pocket, already loaded,

167
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,900
so that I can just pull it up.

168
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,580
I'm fired up.

169
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,000
I have...

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,620
While I wait for the X's to land.

171
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,120
I'm gonna miss them.

172
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,100
My wife and kids.

173
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,360
I got memberships, right?

174
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,860
I hope.

175
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,100
Lily doesn't.

176
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,240
But she's automatically saved.

177
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,260
Because she's under the age of reasoning.

178
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,000
You're right.

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,420
She's like the innocence.

180
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,700
She'll go to the purgatory.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Where was it?

182
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,060
Limbo.

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,700
What is limbo?

184
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,700
There's all those technicalities in Christianity.

185
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,360
That's why it's never gonna succeed.

186
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,400
Shall I go get your jacket, mon frere?

187
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll jump off this time.

188
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,800
I'll jack it off for you.

189
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,300
Yeah, pre-jacket.

190
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,100
Would you?

191
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,280
So it comes back only flaccid.

192
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,880
This isn't suitable talk for such an august moment.

193
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,100
Yeah, I'm augusted.

194
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,160
This is august.

195
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,680
I need to get out of here in order to run away.

196
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,220
I'm going up to there and get my coat.

197
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,860
He's gonna go get your coat.

198
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,640
Oh, he is. Okay.

199
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,880
That's what he was saying, you deaf old bard.

200
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,820
I can hear you fine.

201
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,980
Isn't that interesting?

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,320
That's because I have that voice, a certain voice.

203
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,700
The piercing, dromundian, overman voice.

204
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,400
It's a company by silent radio.

205
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,860
It's a voice that has been honed for years of interrupting people.

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,700
And talking over people.

207
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,880
And talking over people.

208
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,440
I had to work on it really hard to make it do that all the time.

209
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,800
It's not that I'm rude.

210
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,460
Not that I mean to do that.

211
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,140
It didn't cause anything.

212
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,740
You're trying to talk over Wellman's background sound track.

213
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,940
I've never seen that type.

214
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,020
Look at all these subgeniuses waking up in early morning.

215
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, I heard they use...

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,020
I see people staring and even moving slowly down the road toward the field.

217
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,380
Just running down.

218
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,140
So many people with so little faith.

219
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,880
Still lying around.

220
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,140
Taking their time.

221
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,000
So unenthusiastic about this great day.

222
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,320
You're here to be in a great day.

223
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,600
People still lying around in their hammocks and their nests.

224
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,140
Whirled up in their little domiciles.

225
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,580
Sleeping through the end of the world.

226
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,060
They're scratched together.

227
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,780
Beds of leaves and cardboard.

228
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,940
The world ends not with a bang but with a snore.

229
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,560
With a snimper.

230
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,560
With a simper.

231
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,180
Simpering end to the simpering world.

232
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,640
Stop snoring, sleepo.

233
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,340
You're waking me up.

234
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,480
Here, let me get out.

235
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,660
Here, let me close this door.

236
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,680
Philo, can you hold this tape recorder for a second?

237
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,500
I sure can.

238
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,380
I can't believe he's getting me to hold this tape deck like this.

239
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,600
It's such a hard work I have to do this without...

240
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
And I'm not prepared for this.

241
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,180
This work that Stang has me doing.

242
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,300
Holding the tape deck.

243
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,580
Where is everyone?

244
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
The losers aren't here.

245
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,460
What are we doing down in the woods over there?

246
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,760
They're outside the blast radius.

247
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,600
They've gotten lifted already.

248
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,100
Oh, now I get it.

249
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,640
It takes one of the good mobsters to understand.

250
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,060
So we look on the ground here and...

251
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,620
Oh, Sinfaltimus is costume.

252
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,960
He was lifted up.

253
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,400
Look at the ground.

254
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,420
Oh, no.

255
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,160
There's a...

256
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,200
He was eviscerated.

257
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,180
Gay for Bob.

258
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,140
Somebody wearing a Gay for Bob shirt was lifted up.

259
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,700
What's over here?

260
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,940
This is horrible.

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Sucking the church world.

262
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,080
This is what it looks like after the world ends.

263
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,660
All the empty clothing laying around.

264
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,120
There's nobody over there.

265
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,300
Those people that aren't there, their clothes are here.

266
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,820
I was only a couple minutes late.

267
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,780
What time is it?

268
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,700
I thought I was on time.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,820
We can't...

270
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,500
We can't have been left behind.

271
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
We've been left behind.

272
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,380
I think my watch was wrong.

273
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Where's my right behind?

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
This one has a note on it.

275
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,760
So does this one.

276
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,940
The only missing thing is you, John.

277
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,420
Where were you, Stang?

278
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,880
That one asked.

279
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,680
Oh, I'm glad I looked down.

280
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,300
The missing thing is you.

281
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,240
I've been...

282
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,560
This is the second X day I would have gone through with my fly down.

283
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,180
Well, I'll...

284
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
If you want, seriously...

285
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,540
I'll put mine down to show solidarity if it's broken.

286
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,100
No, that's okay.

287
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,480
I managed to get it back up.

288
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,820
As it were, so to speak.

289
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,120
I leave mine down a lot.

290
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,720
Another note...

291
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,360
I found Susie.

292
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh, Susie was definitely in this one.

293
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,000
I could recognize her foul stench anywhere.

294
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,700
Stang, we waited as long as we could.

295
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,140
Sorry we missed you.

296
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,160
Oh, man.

297
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,740
I think about all those naked people on that saucer and it's kind of hot.

298
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,780
Wait a minute.

299
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,460
That was a saucer built for 14 and there's at least 15 shirts on it.

300
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,100
It's over.

301
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,220
And there's a launched bleeding head over there.

302
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,400
I think that's Synthothemus's head.

303
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,540
Well, left behind.

304
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,360
That's us.

305
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,140
Too damn bad.

306
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,840
What an ignominious thing.

307
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,920
And somehow it just figures though, doesn't it, that Philo, after all of our work...

308
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,640
All of our hard work.

309
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,260
Hard, hard work.

310
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
We worked so hard.

311
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


312
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


313
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


314
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


315
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


316
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


317
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


318
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


319
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460


320
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,560
To be left behind!

321
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,540
We missed the boat.

322
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,680
Well, why?

323
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't know how I'm going to deal with this.

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,120
Our watches aren't running. Oh my God, it's only five minutes to showtime. Five minutes!

325
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,180
Five minutes and we can be back in bed aboard our escape vessels. There'll be much bigger beds.

326
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,100
Yeah, big, beautiful, big...

327
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,360
How big was your bed going to be?

328
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,940
My bed was going to be like 12 blocks long and 16 blocks wide.

329
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,360
Mine was going to be like Rhode Island.

330
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,080
Well, that's 12 blocks long by 16 blocks wide. It's a little state. It's very small.

331
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,320
I don't want to be left behind!

332
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, baby bear! Don't cry!

333
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,020
Wait a minute. I don't want to be left behind either!

334
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,140
I appreciate this.

335
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,620
I think we'd be kidding.

336
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,000
They left us behind!

337
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,060
Calm down now. I think actually, really, if you step back...

338
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,340
Fuck!

339
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:47,980
...for a second and just consider this, the absurdity of the situation, you'll realize that we're all victims of a cruel, cruel joke.

340
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,100
Joke?

341
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,860
Yes, this is...

342
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,460
Joke?

343
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,500
Joke!

344
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:55,500


345
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:55,880
Joke!

346
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah, this is just...

347
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,000
What kind of...

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,240
And the cruelty of it is so...

349
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,740
It's so deep off wood.

350
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,380
It's so deep. So deep.

351
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,520
Where are all those naked people standing over in the woods looking at these empty clothing?

352
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,740
Yeah, acting like they're...

353
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:06,940
Shivering.

354
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,200
Joke is right!

355
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,920
They're acting like they have clothes on!

356
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,140
They may have succumbed to the blandishments of a fake saucer which did not lift them up.

357
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,880
My God, what a grisly thought!

358
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, none of them wear watches. Imagine if the Greys or some false aliens showed up at quarter of seven.

359
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,520
They wouldn't know the difference. They'd be lifted up and they're probably now in pens...

360
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,900
Being herded around, prodded with probes and...

361
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,340
Some will be kept as pets.

362
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
...cattle, mutilation devices...

363
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,840
Some will talk of the human pet boy who died so sad.

364
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:55,880
Whoa! Oh my God! We're standing around here jawing and once again it's two minutes till 7 a.m.

365
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,060
Oh, you've got... This is the first time we've ever had an accurate countdown clock.

366
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:00,580
What's the time?

367
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
That's because we're...

368
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,780
Flight C-TAUGE has this new technology.

369
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,500
We have new technology. This is the digital age.

370
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,940
So we'll actually hit the countdown right.

371
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,760
We've gone from pre-digital to digital.

372
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,060
You should leave that. You should start with the 10.

373
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,500
Okay.

374
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,640
For the countdown.

375
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,180
Oh look, here come the jokers back.

376
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,940
Ha ha ha!

377
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,400
So amused.

378
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,600
So amused now, huh?

379
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,760
I guess you're gonna show us a ticket stub and find your seat number.

380
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,740
They kicked us off the fly!

381
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,700
We were up there, they kicked us off the fly!

382
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,560
You got lifted up by the escape vessels and you got kicked off. Way to go Susie the floozy.

383
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,780
That's great. I don't suppose they're planning to come back or anything?

384
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,160
What time is it?

385
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,240
Less than two minutes.

386
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,880
Less than two minutes to find out whether they're going to come back.

387
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,020
This is rather a new twist on the thing.

388
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Ha ha ha!

389
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,140
Friends, remember your life here on planet Earth.

390
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
How easy it is.

391
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,880
How easy it was. Everything just...

392
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,500
I guess it wasn't for the...

393
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,700
Oh wait. No, no. It was a crappy, tedious, boring life here on planet Earth.

394
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,380
And that will be over with soon. I have faith.

395
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,240
I had a vision when I was knocked out last night.

396
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,900
Yeah, that was what it was. Knocked out.

397
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,640
An epiphany?

398
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,340
Yeah, an epiphany.

399
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,060
So, and then I saw that everything will be just right.

400
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,060
Everyone's here.

401
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,580
Yeah.

402
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,180
Will no one be left behind? What's our time now?

403
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,460
Here we go.

404
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,860
Oh my god. Thirty-five seconds.

405
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,080
Thirty-five seconds. Oh, I'm so excited. I'm going to wee wee in my pants.

406
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,380
My pants are going to be damp.

407
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,200
This is right when Bobber gets left behind, asshole!

408
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,380
Ha!

409
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:03,160
Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

410
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,560
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

411
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,320
Five, four, three, two, one.

412
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,420
Fuck them all!

413
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,500
Fuck them if they can't take the job!

414
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,120
Oh, it's about a three.

415
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
Wait, I think I see something.

416
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,820
Nah, that's just shit in your eye.

417
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,900
Oh.

418
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,680
Oh.

419
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,580
Oh, god.

420
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,940
Let me take that head. I'm relieved for myself now.

421
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,180
One more time, I heard that.

422
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,680
This is, I'm not going to, I try to drown my sorrows in bleeding head stump fucking.

423
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,320
I don't think I can even get it up, even for that next stump.

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
It's the twenty years.

425
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,720
Dr. Dark, maybe we should have stayed in bed.

426
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,880
The one thing that's been in common every time is him and me have been here.

427
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
One of us has got to go.

428
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,860
I think we should have just...

429
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,560
Just stayed in bed.

430
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,560
Only one can survive.

431
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,940
Fight to the death.

432
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,880
Fight to the death.

433
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,920
Fight to the death.

434
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,760
Fight to the death.

435
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,340
Fight to the death.

436
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,020
We are already dead.

437
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,580
That is pointless.

438
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,320
Huh?

439
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,880
With soda straws.

440
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,860
Fight to the death with soda straws?

441
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,420
Oh, yeah.

442
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,420
But you gotta use those flip flops right there.

443
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,020
Yeah.

444
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,560
There you go.

445
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,260
One of you gets the salmon, one of you gets the purple pear, and you just go at it.

446
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,660
Why does this seem so familiar?

447
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,080
Hey, look, your shoes have the same tendency as your checks.

448
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,540
I don't know if you're joining.

449
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,300
Yeah.

450
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,800
This seems just like I've been here before.

451
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm having this horrible, depressing deja vu.

452
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,620
Hey, where's that Bob dummy?

453
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,520
I feel like lynching something.

454
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,940
He's a wise dummy.

455
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,220
He didn't see the reason to come down here.

456
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,840
It's Pease's fault.

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,420
It's Pease's fault.

458
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,160
Reverend, Reverend Pease.

459
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,540
It's Pease's fault.

460
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Yeah, exactly.

461
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,620
Why didn't he come?

462
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,320
We're not Pease.

463
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,720
Oh, because he fucked up.

464
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,000
Pease fucked up.

465
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,240
Once again.

466
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Well, anybody that's not here fucked up.

467
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:10,960
Pease, stop it.

468
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:10,960


469
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,100
Here's another fine mess you've gotten us into, Reverend Pease.

470
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,120
Been here, done this.

471
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,520
You know, there have been all sorts of people tinkering with the calendar over the years.

472
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,600
Julius Caesar, Omar Khayyam, the Pope.

473
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,240
They've just managed to get it all twisted around, so it's difficult for people to get

474
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


475
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


476
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


477
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


478
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


479
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


480
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


481
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


482
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


483
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,240


484
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,460
more 不要

485
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,280
Uh-huh.

486
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:49,980


487
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:49,980


488
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:49,980


489
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,440
I know.

490
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,840
I haven't seen him in a while.

491
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,700
Any times he comes, what is he supposed to be, like, Let's just fuck that up.

492
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,540
I meanろ

493
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:55,540


494
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:55,540


495
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,580


496
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,580


497
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,580


498
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:55,580


499
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,200
He just which is an idiot to, you know, that shit.

500
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,080
Well, you know beginning to work from a pharmaceutical să's.

501
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,300
Genius believes that, or a variation of it.

502
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,560
I just wonder how far off the calendars are.

503
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Is it like a 10-year?

504
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,520
Well, no, it's more than 10 years already.

505
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,780
Far off.

506
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,580
A thousand years?

507
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,500
Right wing, dude.

508
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,840
The conspiracy's been working for at least a thousand years just to embarrass J.R. Bob Dobbs.

509
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,700
It's quite possible.

510
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,800
The devil is an angel and sees ahead with his infra-vision.

511
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,500
Yep.

512
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,140
If the devil and Superman fought, who would win, Dr. Howe?

513
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,820
Well, I think the theologians would have to say it would be old Nick, the Prince of Darkness.

514
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,120
I would think so.

515
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:57,540
After all, the mephitic evidence of evil permeates all parts of the cosmos that are not original chaos, the unformed, crawling darkness.

516
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,260
But there is a problem.

517
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,820
Which is that...

518
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,260
Supposedly, these demonic spirits are confined to hell.

519
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,920
So, how could he even get out to get Superman?

520
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,020
But the devil himself has an answer for that one.

521
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,700
Which Mephistopheles has often said to Faust.

522
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,640
When he said, you know, how come you're here when you're supposed to be trapped in hell?

523
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,960
The devil said, why, this is hell.

524
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,200
Nor am I out of it.

525
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,640
Honky.

526
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,960
So, there you go.

527
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,720
I mean, how can you fight that?

528
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,120
Hell is where you hang your hat, I guess.

529
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,000
Now, what if Superman fought J.R. Bob Dobbs?

530
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,580
Dobbs?

531
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,420
Dobbs would win because he's luckier than Superman.

532
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,600
He's lucky. He surfs the luck plane.

533
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,880
And Superman would run into some fifth-dimensional imp or lump of red kryptonite or something like that

534
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,700
that the plot writers would fire at him with their loaded quids.

535
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,100
Me bizarro Superman. Me hate slack.

536
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
And that's terrible.

537
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,600
Pipe smoke me.

538
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,420
Me have bad luck.

539
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,020
Yeah, I bet Superman would actually use his heat vision to reignite Bob's pipe if it were even capable of going out.

540
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm sure he would do that.

541
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:25,620
The day that that pipe goes out, so is thy puny life snuffed out, mortal disbeliever.

542
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,000
Which is why we would need Superman.

543
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,460
And the Dottle. Don't forget the Dottle.

544
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,980
raining down like fire on the rooftops of the unbelievers.

545
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,480
It's going to be a terrible moment for everyone

546
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,740
except the subgeniuses who will snicker

547
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,440
as they watch from above in smug satisfaction.

548
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,380
And their snark saucers.

549
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,360
Mm-hmm.

550
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,780
That's what we've always been led to believe.

551
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,940
Only some of us may feel in these dark hours

552
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,620
that possibly some charlatan put something over on us.

553
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,320
But just a moment does this apostolic thought...

554
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,920
Now, Wyatt, are you saying that a preacher like Bob

555
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,140
might lie or be wrong?

556
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
I didn't mean Bob, Stang,

557
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,920
but it's quite possible that somebody

558
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,240
might be putting a whammy on us.

559
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,440
It happens in one's personal life.

560
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,640
It can happen in the life of an organization.

561
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,500
I don't know.

562
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,920
I mean, if Bob says it, doesn't that make it true automatically?

563
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,400
Well, it makes it relevant

564
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,600
because it's a person who's a Christian.

565
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,880
Bob sold it, I smoked it, that settles it.

566
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,340
Mm-hmm. That's it.

567
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,680
How many times have I said that phrase in the last couple of weeks?

568
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,860
As many as you need to wriggle out of an embarrassing conundrum.

569
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,320
That's right.

570
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,240
Sacred doctrine of erasability.

571
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,760
Sacred doctrine of erasability.

572
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,900
I didn't say that. I didn't really say that.

573
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
That tape, that's just doctored.

574
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,780
They Photoshopped that tape.

575
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,040
Make it sound like I said that.

576
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,520
You know, we've got more people every year.

577
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,520
That really says something sad about the subgeniuses

578
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,420
mentality.

579
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,380
It certainly does.

580
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,300
Yeah, more people are let down every year.

581
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,300
We're supposed to be lifted up.

582
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,000
And once again, let down.

583
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,600
At this point,

584
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,980
you've disappointed more people than I ever have.

585
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,860
Me? I'm not piloting

586
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,380
spaceships. Why is everybody

587
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,440
looking at me? Do I look like an

588
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,860
exist? Look, it says right here,

589
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,220
July 5th, and I...

590
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,760
Uh-oh.

591
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,540
Um...

592
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
Maybe we should

593
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,720
have looked at the fine print a little more closely.

594
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,320
Susie, you look really

595
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
pathetic again. Thank you.

596
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,540
Once a year, we all look

597
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,340
so damn lame and

598
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,780
pathetic.

599
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,540
Sad. It's so sad.

600
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,340
We could say

601
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,180
maybe next year, but that would

602
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,500
possibly be even lamer than ever.

603
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,320
Twenty.

604
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,500
It's never worked.

605
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,140
Twenty years.

606
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,320
Well, next year will be the 21st time that you do it.

607
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,460
Huh? Next year will be the 21st

608
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,740
time that you've done it. Well,

609
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,120
the first couple of times, we weren't expecting

610
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,240
anything to happen.

611
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
They were just drills. Right.

612
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,760
It turned out there have now been 20

613
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,340
drills.

614
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,340
Twenty drills.

615
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,900
You'd think somebody would get

616
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,500
a life.

617
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,380
Oh, well.

618
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,240
Oh, that's good.

619
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,540
Everyone step right up and get your rubber earth eraser.

620
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,540
It has a picture of the planet earth on it.

621
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,080
And you can get to erasing now.

622
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,680
I guess the X's aren't gonna do it for us.

623
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,720
Once again, the salesmen, the space gods, and everything else,

624
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,180
we thought they were gonna do our job for us.

625
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,120
Mine actually kind of looks like Hulu.

626
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,280
There's your earth eraser, since I'm a mess.

627
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,280
Grass patch.

628
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,180
Get to erasing, kids.

629
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,820
One human at a time, I guess.

630
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,140
One building.

631
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,880
Look at this.

632
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,960
They all have their hands out.

633
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,320
This is so sad.

634
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,860
I meant my eraser.

635
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,680
Can't I at least get one rubber eraser?

636
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,820
I spent 40 years and $100,000 on the church and the septenians.

637
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,980
I want my eraser.

638
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,700
I'm gonna go get my eraser.

639
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,600
This guy's shell shocked.

640
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,520
I think I bought 50 and there's about 10 left.

641
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,980
These are genuine Chinese erasers, so don't put them near your mouth.

642
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,520
Not guaranteed to work after the end of the checkout aisle.

643
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,020
At least we got earth erasers.

644
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,460
At least we got erasers.

645
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,760
I know.

646
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,540
It's lame.

647
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,140
Well, we wanna hurt ourselves on the sharp edges.

648
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,180
Bob!

649
00:29:59,600 --> 00:29:59,720
Bob!

650
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,260


651
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,960
Just don't eat it.

652
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,240
Why hast thou forsaken us?

653
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,500
This never stopped me.

654
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:04,980
Bob.

655
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,880
This is like...

656
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,580
When did Bob do this?

657
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,240
Then why does it fit in my mouth?

658
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,580
They were going to take us off, but when they saw that a prank was being attempted...

659
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,060
Yeah, that way you didn't have to buy extra poison.

660
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,520
Oh, is that it?

661
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,500
Hey, way to go.

662
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,420
Whose idea was this empty clothes here?

663
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,220
Sounds to me like the exes...

664
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
Princess Wee.

665
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,020
It sounds like the exes got here, looked around and went, oh, they've already been taken.

666
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,620
We can just skip this one.

667
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:29,940
We can just skip this one.

668
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,120
We can just skip this one.

669
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,340
No, just doe.

670
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,260
Doe.

671
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,540
Doe.

672
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,080
Doe.

673
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,420
Doe.

674
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:37,960
Doe.

675
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:37,960


676
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,360
Doe.

677
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:38,360


678
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:38,400
Dang.

679
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,800
That's all I have to say, dang.

680
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,640
Thank you, Daniel.

681
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,180
Dad, blame it.

682
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,020
Uh-huh.

683
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,160
We weren't supposed to say blame.

684
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,120
That's a cuss word.

685
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah, consarnant.

686
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But I'll say it anyway.

687
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,260
Dad, blame it.

688
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,820
Uh-huh.

689
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,760
Consarnant.

690
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,780
Easy, Stang.

691
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,940
Remember your blood pressure.

692
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,880
Tarnation.

693
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,920
Gosh, oh my, get out.

694
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Gol darn it.

695
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:56,840
Gol darn it.

696
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,440
That was Walter Britt.

697
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,120
Heck fire.

698
00:30:59,540 --> 00:30:59,780
Yeah.

699
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,760
Heck, I'll say it again.

700
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,060
Heck.

701
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,780
I'll express my frustration.

702
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,340
Heck.

703
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,580
AG double hockey sticks.

704
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,040
Yeah, I'm getting hard.

705
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm hardly getting.

706
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,800
Yeah, I'm hardly getting too.

707
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,260
Well.

708
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,280
Well.

709
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,360
Um.

710
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:23,520
Uh.

711
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,420
Uh.

712
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,900
Yeah.

713
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,220
Yeah, I hear.

714
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,060
Somebody says that.

715
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,180
Kill the messenger.

716
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,320
Kill the messenger.

717
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,560
Well, wait for somebody else to say it, okay?

718
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
It's not funny.

719
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,380
Come on again.

720
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,580
Laugh, Brian.

721
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,500
He's got a Jonestown shirt.

722
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,180
I've got a, what's his name's shirt?

723
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,740
Harold Camping.

724
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,220
Harold Camping.

725
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,440
Praise Harold Camping.

726
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,580
Yeah, well, did everybody have fun camping?

727
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,280
Does his style of camping work better?

728
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,280
Yeah, anybody jonesing?

729
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,000
Uh.

730
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,020
Jonesing for Jones.

731
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,520
Sure you got your heaven's gate zipped up?

732
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:01,980
Hey.

733
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,080
At least they're not still here.

734
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,840
What, the Jonestown people?

735
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,480
Yeah, I'll see them around here.

736
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,380
Wait, what's that sound?

737
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,340
Same difference.

738
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

739
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,180
I do.

740
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,900
You're a low rumble.

741
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,380
It turns out to be a very low rent.

742
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:18,820
Low rent.

743
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,080
Come and get us in a truck.

744
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,900
Yeah, a honey dipper truck most likely.

745
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,880
All this time the extras were disguised as the honey dippers.

746
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,660
Honey dipper man.

747
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,060
Yeah.

748
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,880
It comes down to the chem toilets.

749
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,080
Turns out the honey dipper man was the extras.

750
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,060
Right.

751
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,280
Like, like to the subject truck.

752
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:35,800
There's a lot of.

753
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,040
We weren't, we were a little large to be sucked up through the hose.

754
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,720
Yeah, there's a lot of.

755
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,420
Story in my life.

756
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,240
Exes who are supposed to be hiding inside the freaking toilet.

757
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,300
Oh my God.

758
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,920
That's it.

759
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,640
That robot.

760
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,540
You first.

761
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,380
Only the shit is getting fucking ruptured right now.

762
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,620
You first.

763
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,620
All that Yeti shit.

764
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,640
God.

765
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:56,860
Oh my God.

766
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,640
The shit is getting ruptured.

767
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,480
Well, um.

768
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,960
Some shit is getting vexed.

769
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,760
The discordians are gonna laugh at us again.

770
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,220
The flying spaghetti monster assholes are gonna laugh at us again.

771
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,440
Discordians can go eat their hot dogs.

772
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,380
You know what this means, Princess?

773
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,740
We have to go through Starwood.

774
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,180
Damn.

775
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,860
Well.

776
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,420
I can't believe it.

777
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,400
He fooled them again.

778
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,160
After all these years.

779
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,140
I'm going back.

780
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,360
They still came out.

781
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,320
There's another thing.

782
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,420
Still got up.

783
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,500
Still looked at the sky.

784
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,400
Sometime.

785
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,520
We're on a real roll over here.

786
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,680
How long will it go on before they all sleep in?

787
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,920
How many more years will it take for everyone to sleep in?

788
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,400
How many more times do I have to play this sanguine game?

789
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


790
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


791
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


792
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


793
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


794
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


795
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


796
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


797
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


798
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


799
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,400


800
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,380
song over and over again.

801
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,800
Well I think people were encouraged by the possibilities of next year.

802
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,420
This morning.

803
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,640
Oh yeah, yeah, encouraged.

804
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,840
One more X Day.

805
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,680
One more X Day bites the dust.

806
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,860
One more X Day in the camp.

807
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,740
I hate that phrase, next X Day.

808
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,280
I hate that phrase.

809
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah, it's such a bummer.

810
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,420
Such a bummer.

811
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,380
So little slack.

812
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,060
I have so many Dobbs heads to take down.

813
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,800
So many Dobbs heads.

814
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,180
It was a pleasure meeting you both.

815
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,420
Sorry the saucers didn't get here this time, Matt.

816
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
Thank you so much.

817
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,840
I have faith.

818
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,920
Very little.

819
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,740
Well.

820
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,620
I think the message of course is that X Day could happen any second.

821
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,180
We don't know.

822
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,140
So we better be ready all the time.

823
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,820
Yeah, that must be it.

824
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,120
It's kind of like other things that could happen at any time.

825
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:10,780
Right.

826
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,580
Right.

827
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,740
Could happen.

828
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
That would be great if it happened right now.

829
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,680
Wouldn't that be, you know, they'd only be off by 20 minutes.

830
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,580
Ugh.

831
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,140
All right.

832
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,920
I have enough frop to drown my sorrow.

833
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
Is there that much frop in all the world?

834
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,740
If it's up the ass, yeah.

835
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,280
Quick River, it's staying.

836
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,960
They're all gone.

837
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,480
Let's board the saucer now.

838
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:34,960
Yeah.

839
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,800
They're all over that way.

840
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,800
What a day.

841
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,880
What a day.

842
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,020
Oh, what a day.

843
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,020
I should mention that the main voices you hear in most of that recording are Dr. Philo Drummond,

844
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,060
Dr. Hal Robbins,

845
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,200
Dr. Dark,

846
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,760
and it's all doctors,

847
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,960
oh, and Reverend Susie the Flusie,

848
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,440
and Princess Wee Ardo,

849
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,360
and about 40 other subgeniuses,

850
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:06,680
the few dedicated enough to pry themselves out of slumber before 7 a.m.

851
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,500
Now there were many notable and famous subgeniuses there.

852
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,700
Yes, we had a good turnout,

853
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:17,840
despite the incessant rain, howling cyclones, and typhoon.

854
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,560
Dr. Philo Drummond, the overman, was there.

855
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,660
For real.

856
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,000
And his lovely wife, Chaosmic Mama Cat,

857
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:31,120
and Vuvuzela-blowing progeny, the incredible Lily.

858
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,080
Evolution Control Committee was at the judgment.

859
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,060
And they did an entire piece about pants.

860
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,700
That was amazing.

861
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,080
Yes, it was.

862
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:49,520
Apparently Trademark has been gathering samples from songs that mention,

863
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,800
and movie lines,

864
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,660
that mention pants for years.

865
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,020
I forget what the project was originally meant to be.

866
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,420
And they all fit together.

867
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,860
But for us, he pieced them all together

868
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,860
and played them out on his weird little sampler guitar warping device

869
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,360
for about 25 minutes of pants.

870
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm surprised, sir.

871
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,240
It made me dance to listen to those songs about the pants.

872
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,400
Exactly. Now you're getting back into it.

873
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,720
Oh, I'm back, yeah.

874
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,920
Doctors for Wotan were there.

875
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,240
The original subgenius anti-music band,

876
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,200
which in the day was composed of Dr. Drummond, myself,

877
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,280
and Hellswammy Satellite Weavers,

878
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,920
and whoever else would join us,

879
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,080
but not our wives back then.

880
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,100
This time, it was Philo and me and our new wives,

881
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,420
who will Wotan.

882
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,540
And that was a lot of fun.

883
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,620
It was just like the old days.

884
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,540
The process of elimination.

885
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,340
Some people, for some reason,

886
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,900
thought that our concert was a joke.

887
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,660
It was funny.

888
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,460
I kept hearing that phrase over and over again.

889
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,980
I thought we were doing a rockin' show myself,

890
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,480
but I kept being told,

891
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,020
well, it was really funny, you guys.

892
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,940
Funny, peculiar, or funny, ha-ha?

893
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,360
Funny, ha-ha, I think, is what they meant.

894
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,680
We meant to be funny, peculiar,

895
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,460
but no, no, it was all, ha-ha-ha.

896
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,400
I guess they're joking.

897
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,120
We get that a lot here in the Church of the Subgenius.

898
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,700
They're joking, of course.

899
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,720
They're not occult kooks.

900
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,320
Joking.

901
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,300
I know these people.

902
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,040
Reverend Susie the Floozy was there.

903
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,640
Now, that's a real hot subgenius celebrity.

904
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,380
And, of course, the new subgenius celebrities,

905
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,280
like Baby Bear and Priestess Pisces and so forth.

906
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,140
We had Eggplant.

907
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,540
Reverend Angry Larry was there.

908
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,340
The great amino acids were in disguise

909
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,560
as the giant germs.

910
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,500
I believe you mean Lord Reverend Angry Larry.

911
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,400
Oh, that's right, that's right.

912
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,980
He changed.

913
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
He had a vertical promotion.

914
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,620
Yeah, Lord of Giant Germs was his new band name,

915
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,500
so now he's Lord Angry Larry.

916
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,520
Lisa Cheeks Marie was there.

917
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,780
And what about the festal couple that you joined forever?

918
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,160
Reverend Fox spelled foe, but pronounced fox.

919
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,800
Yes.

920
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,120
And the beautiful Aster.

921
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,300
Yes.

922
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,480
Reverend Aster.

923
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:15,840
Meaning star.

924
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,620
And we know she's extra beautiful

925
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,680
on account of she got in the baptism pond with her shirt off.

926
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,740
Yes, and they were both simultaneously baptized by Reverend Stang.

927
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,240
The longest who was, the longest time.

928
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,660
Who stayed under the longest?

929
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,460
Well, the longest baptism itself was, again, Susie the Floozies,

930
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,900
which took an extended amount of time.

931
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,820
Well, that's because she likes me to heff the time.

932
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,540
I don't know if you're a hefft her.

933
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:55,880
But before I dunk her, so I naturally prolong the period of legitimate hefting as long as possible.

934
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,800
I pretend to forget that they're praising Bob.

935
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,940
It's part of the...

936
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,860
Forget his name.

937
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,520
...gland escaping that we have often promised.

938
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,020
Hello.

939
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,820
Welcome to the Bob Gizm.

940
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,560
You're on the radio.

941
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,860
Greetings and celebrations.

942
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,680
Oh!

943
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:12,840
Oh!

944
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:13,820


945
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,020


946
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,740
That's it.

947
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,680
That's it.

948
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,460
This is a good place to practice your mad science.

949
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,180
Now, are you sure at this point, feel down there, you're happy, you're together?

950
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,460
Reverend Angie, do you accept Bob?

951
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,180
This is her first baptism, so she's like a virgin to this.

952
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,000
This is an important one.

953
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:43,240
Do you accept Bob into your heart and mind and any other mutually agreeable whatever?

954
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,000
Orifice.

955
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,740
And reject the conspiracy in whatever form it may take in your life except this event.

956
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,480
Say yes.

957
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,260
Yes, I do.

958
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,700
Praise Bob!

959
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,040
How we doing?

960
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
That was a semi-long.

961
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,360
See, it's like being born again.

962
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,620
Something tweaked her when she went down.

963
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,300
He saw her face.

964
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,060
Give her her mask back in your niche.

965
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,360
There is a butt-biting fish in here.

966
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,240
We may not have mentioned the butt-biting fish.

967
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,860
You didn't see my post about that?

968
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,580
I see so many pictures of butt-biting fish.

969
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,020
I can't know one from the other.

970
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,180
Christ Tristan, do you accept Bob into your mind and heart and reject the conspiracy and so forth?

971
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,060
Hell yeah!

972
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:21,680
Hell yeah!

973
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,800
That's the way to do it.

974
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,620
Another soldier in Bob's army.

975
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,800
Alright, we need another apostolate.

976
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,820
Carol Christmas, she's another new one.

977
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,460
I am.

978
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:41,980
Alright, Carol Christmas, do you accept Bob into your heart and mind and reject, who are we rejecting?

979
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,760
Conspiracy.

980
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,200
Conspiracy, that's right.

981
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,180
Reject the conspiracy.

982
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:44,780
It works.

983
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,560
Hell yeah!

984
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,340
Hell yeah!

985
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,200
Praise Bob!

986
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,980
Praise Bob!

987
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:49,840
Woo!

988
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,460
Woo!

989
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,400
Refreshing.

990
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,680
Oh man.

991
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,100
I really look like a yeti all over.

992
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,940
Well, that's one magical thing this pond has.

993
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,900
Yeah, it yetifies the hairless.

994
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,020
Even Baby Bear came out with a coat on her when this happened.

995
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,640
So, who is next?

996
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,540
We need more.

997
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,000
More.

998
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,280
Come on now.

999
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
Do you accept the conspiracy and reject Bob?

1000
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,560
Fuck no!

1001
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,540
Alright!

1002
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,480
Okay!

1003
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,940
That's a good one.

1004
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,560
I was wondering what the correct answer was.

1005
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,580
That's a good one.

1006
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,040
That's it.

1007
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,820
I like it.

1008
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,360
Okay.

1009
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:19,720
Okay.

1010
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,340
You were standing there.

1011
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,160
Dot, come forward.

1012
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,820
Yes.

1013
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,020
Do you, Reverend, new Reverend Dot, accept Bob into your life?

1014
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,060
Professor Random Dot.

1015
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,140
Just Random Dot.

1016
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,200
Oh, Random Dot.

1017
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:30,860
There you go.

1018
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,820
Alright, do you accept the dots of J.R. Bob Dobbs, even though they are not entirely random?

1019
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,260
Yes.

1020
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,580
And reject the evil dots of the conspiracy?

1021
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,680
Yes.

1022
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,460
Especially the red.

1023
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:40,800
I do!

1024
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Praise Reverend Dot.

1025
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,500
Praise Reverend Dot.

1026
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:45,940
Alright.

1027
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,980
That's the idea.

1028
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,300
Generic subgenius clergyman, I know by definition you must accept Bob into your heart and reject

1029
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:55,820
the conspiracy.

1030
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,840
Is that correct?

1031
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,360
Yes, I do.

1032
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,220
Especially the NSA and all it stands for.

1033
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,980
Fuck yes!

1034
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,400
Oh, God!

1035
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,220
Praise Bob.

1036
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,140
Yeah!

1037
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,100
Praise subgenius clergyman.

1039
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:11,540


1041
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:11,540


1042
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,880
The Reverend Sparkling Oddity.

1043
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,600
I think I'd be able to remember the oddity part.

1044
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:16,960
Yeah.

1045
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,260
But you sparkle and that just, you know.

1046
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,020
Okay, sparkles.

1047
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,720
Do you accept Bob into your life and reject the conspiracy?

1048
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,060
Say I do.

1049
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,920
I do!

1050
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,040
Believe us.

1052
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,700
Woo!

1053
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,200
Praise Bob.

1054
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,240
We should do Fox and Asper at the same time.

1055
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,600
Yeah.

1056
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,460
Want to do you guys as one?

1057
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,360
Because they're getting ditched in about two hours.

1058
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:37,880
Two hours.

1059
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,840
Can you explain the facts of life to me?

1060
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,320
Fucking wedding.

1061
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,520
Separate parties.

1062
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:41,520


1063
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,400
I'm kind of figuring it out as we go.

1064
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,740
I don't know what the hell these are.

1065
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,040
Something's growing up.

1066
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,700
I'll have to, I'll explain it to you by demonstration later.

1067
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,180
All right.

1068
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,800
Oh, what a romantic couple.

1069
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,400
Fucking cool!

1070
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,460
Look, they're covered with electro-stimulo-risk.

1071
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,620
Psychological impact.

1072
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:08,900
Do you both in unison accept Bob into your heart and reject the conspiracy and all jobs

1073
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,540
that do not pay quite enough?

1074
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,080
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's going to have to try that.

1075
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,200
Does it hurt?

1076
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,000
Yes.

1077
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,760
Then yes!

1078
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,480
Yes!

1079
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,520
Hold up.

1080
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,760
There they go.

1081
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,000
That is it.

1082
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,200
Oh, it's so romantic.

1083
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,220
See you, see you.

1084
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:25,540
Isn't it romantic?

1085
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,740
I see you standing in the corner over there hiding.

1086
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,380
Oh, it's so cold.

1087
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,960
It is cold.

1088
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,200
That's cold.

1089
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,240
Haven't you been in here before already?

1090
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,860
Yes, I've been in here before.

1091
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,260
Well, then it shouldn't seem so cold.

1092
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:41,000
Oh, look, her nipples are shriveled up down to the size of Susan B. Anthony Dollar.

1093
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:41,500
That's cold.

1094
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:41,500


1095
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:41,500


1096
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:41,500


1097
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:41,500


1098
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:41,500


1099
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,500
Well, that is sad, but we'll fix you up.

1100
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,700
More like Eisenhower's.

1101
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,980
Reverend Susie the floozy.

1102
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:48,940
Now, wait a minute.

1103
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,380
We have a tradition where we do this because I have to like do the laying on of hands.

1104
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:54,880
Face to face.

1105
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,380
This is why you're the chief, chief.

1106
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:56,980
The hefting.

1107
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,220
By Stephen King, America's most popular writer.

1108
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:05,200
Susie the floozy, do you accept, what was it now?

1109
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,160
What was it?

1110
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,260
What's his name?

1111
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,600
Fred?

1112
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,740
Do you accept Fred?

1113
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,460
It'll come to you.

1114
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:09,780
Robert.

1115
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,360
Bob.

1116
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:10,680
Bob.

1117
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,480
You accept Fred?

1118
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,480


1119
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,480


1120
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,480


1121
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,480


1122
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:11,480


1123
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,360
You accept Bob into your, what was it?

1124
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,160
There's some body part I can't quite get a grip on.

1125
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:20,920
Heart?

1126
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:21,400
Mind?

1127
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,440
Yeah, your heart.

1128
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:22,880
Your chest.

1129
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,840
You accept Bob into your chest.

1130
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,140
Yeah, both boosters.

1131
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,460
That's easy for me to say.

1132
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,820
And reject the conspiracy.

1133
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,700
Whatever that is.

1134
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,900
Yeah.

1135
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,060
It's hard to define, but yeah.

1136
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,080
All of that shit.

1137
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:39,680
Okay.

1138
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,320
Are you sure you totally understand?

1139
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:42,540
Yeah.

1140
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,400
Let me ask you one more time.

1141
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,780
Are you in your right mind and you understand the question?

1142
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,300
Oh, hold on.

1143
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,860
Oh, I guess this is long enough.

1144
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,220
Praise Bob.

1145
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,380
Down you go.

1146
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,000
Down you go.

1147
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,800
She won't go down.

1148
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,960
She's stuffed.

1149
00:45:59,160 --> 00:45:59,820
She's awesome.

1150
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,640
Oh, my foot.

1151
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,300
Praise Bob.

1152
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:02,780
All right.

1153
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,980
We have a caller here.

1154
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,220
She has some great plans.

1155
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,300
There is a caller.

1156
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,720
All right.

1157
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,240
Well, let's get that caller on right now.

1158
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:09,440
Yeah.

1159
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,300
Hello, you're on the air.

1160
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1161
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1162
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1163
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1164
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1165
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1166
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1167
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,300


1168
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,400
I'm on the air.

1169
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,340
I'm in the air, too.

1170
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,860
It's Princess We Are Doe, the queen of all the UFOs.

1171
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,120
Yes.

1172
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,420
Particles flying at the speed of light.

1173
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,680
Yes.

1174
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:23,980
Yes.

1175
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,260
I'm calling you from the heart of darkness here in Southern Ohio.

1176
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,600
Had a power outage?

1177
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,380
No, it's just dark.

1178
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:38,660
They call that place Ohio's Outback, that area, Meigs County, home of Meigs County Green.

1179
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,000
Hmm.

1180
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,280
The Outback.

1181
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1182
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1183
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1184
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1185
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1186
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1187
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1188
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1189
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1190
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1191
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1192
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,280


1193
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,740
The Outback, eh?

1194
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,860
Ohio's Outback.

1195
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Ohio's Outback.

1196
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,040
You've got Ohio Dundee out there.

1197
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,220
Others call it Ohio's Outhouse.

1198
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,160
The little house on the prairie or the necessary house.

1199
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,560
Well, we call it the big house, the one we stay in.

1200
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:01,840
That's the greatest bed and breakfast on the planet with the greatest hostess.

1201
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,520
Yes.

1202
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,040
Absolutely.

1203
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,240
And they will be happy to provide pots and pans.

1204
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,560
You just have to ask.

1205
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,180
Oh, hi.

1206
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,600
Princess Wee, is everything okay out there still?

1207
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,320
Are the Starwoodians flocking in even though they weren't destroyed by the saucers?

1208
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,180
Have the last subgeniuses limped painfully away?

1209
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,860
Oh, no.

1210
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,240
Lots of subgeniuses are staying the night.

1211
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,400
I'm about to go down and see what I can see down there.

1212
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,180
But it's apparently quite a good night.

1213
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,460
Are they jamming?

1214
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,700
No, I've got a phone call coming in from Kenny McGloskey.

1215
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,600
I'm going to have to go.

1216
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,220
Oh, well.

1217
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:41,500
I'll be sure.

1218
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,600
Call back later.

1219
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,540
Take that call now.

1220
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:43,800
Okay.

1221
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,460
All right.

1222
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:51,160
That was one of the mysterious Wisterians was calling and you can't just let that go

1223
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:51,880
to the message.

1224
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,880
Apparently not.

1225
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,240
Well, not when you're running Starwood.

1226
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:55,720
Wee.

1227
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,800
I mean, me.

1228
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,060
Well, at any rate, when you're running Starwood, you have to be on the ball.

1229
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,000
You've got to run fast.

1230
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,140
Yes.

1231
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:10,480
And when the Wisterians call, you better pick it up because it may be your child who's being

1232
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,240
dragged out of the road drunk.

1233
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,200
Or left in the road drunk.

1234
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,360
You know, I've retired from dragging them out of the road.

1235
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,160
Well, if they're too big, I don't know how you can do it.

1236
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,040
I'm not going to go to the trouble of dragging them into the road, but I used to drag them

1237
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,720
out of the road and now I don't.

1238
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,180
I've quit babying the subgeniuses.

1239
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,760
These crazy kids today out there dragging in the road.

1240
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,860
And now we have another call here.

1241
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,580
Drag artists.

1242
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,800
Okay.

1243
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:35,800
Well, here's another caller.

1244
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,520
So let's go to that call now.

1245
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,680
And you're on the air.

1246
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,760
I guess I blew it.

1247
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,180
Man, you had such a perfect chance.

1248
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,860
You had a moment and you got tongue tied.

1249
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,500
Untie your tongue, dude.

1250
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:56,180
It's just the pressure of the radio.

1251
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,680
That's Dr. Drummond.

1252
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:58,800
Yes.

1253
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,520
That's phylo Dr. Drummond.

1254
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,360
Folks, you're hearing the Overman now.

1255
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,760
And you heard him screw up.

1256
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,760
Well, he's.

1257
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

1258
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1259
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1260
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1261
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1262
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1263
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1264
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1265
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1266
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1267
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1268
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1269
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1270
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1271
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1272
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1273
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:08,660


1274
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:18,560
It's just a courtesy to the human to be like them and fallible and make mistakes and fall

1275
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,640
in the mud, disgraced forever.

1276
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,700
So the ignominy.

1277
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,640
But I guess you're practicing your cartooning chops while all this is going on.

1278
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:34,180
Getting your lessons from KRK Rydon and other art professionals.

1279
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,240
Yeah, you as well.

1280
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,220
I've got the highest, the top artist of their day.

1281
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:40,840
That's right.

1282
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:45,500
I sent him through Dr. Howland Owl's famous school of adult cartooning.

1283
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,060
Yeah.

1284
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,460
Not to mention your special force that you throw in there on sex and success.

1285
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,360
Success in sex and real estate.

1286
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,800
Yes, it's true.

1287
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,640
It's possible to move mountains with just a little elbow grease.

1288
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,380
And I believe we is calling back now.

1289
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,820
Welcome back.

1290
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,520
Is Dr. Drummond in the house yet?

1291
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:05,960
Yes.

1292
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,420
He is.

1293
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,240
He's right over there, officer.

1294
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,880
This is kind of the way the hour of slack will sound when Philo moves to Kentucky.

1295
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,780
And he'll be a phone voice on both of our shows, Dr. Howland.

1296
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,780
Yes, don't laugh.

1297
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,740
That's really happening.

1298
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,240
Yeah.

1299
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,120
It is true.

1300
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,560
Philo's coming out to live in this bar.

1301
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
Philo's coming, hide your heart, girls.

1302
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,560
Philo's coming, hide your heart, girls.

1303
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:31,760
Yeah.

1304
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,900
He's going to be house hunting maybe in your neighborhood.

1305
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,240
For a big old place.

1306
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:37,960
Have you guys given the X Day report already?

1307
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,040
Big old barn and big old ... What?

1308
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,740
Well, we've given some of the X Day report.

1309
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,940
Of course, there's a lot of stuff we can't talk about because it was a little too special.

1310
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,740
Yeah, some things were on the hush hush.

1311
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,400
You know what I mean?

1312
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,780
You don't want all of the hoi polloi rushing the gates at Wisteria wanting to get some

1313
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,160
of that.

1314
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,140
No, certainly not.

1315
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,460
It's nice to have some things to yourself.

1316
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,480
Yeah.

1317
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,880
Well, I wish I'd gotten a copy of that cool Doctors's for Wozniak.

1318
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:04,880


1319
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:04,880


1320
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:04,880


1321
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:04,880


1322
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,160
It's a good thing.

1323
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,160


1324
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,160


1325
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,160


1326
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,160


1327
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,360
Because I'm not going to be a part of a Wu-Tang reunion gig.

1328
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:12,200
Oh, Dr. Drummond, you'll be glad to know that I have heard the copy of the ... I can

1329
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,120
give you a bootleg of that, and it's not bad.

1330
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,180
There's a couple of places where that unearthly machine of yours was louder than my voice,

1331
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,560
which of course is not suitable.

1332
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:29,680
But most of it, my voice is at least as loud as your voice or your infernal machine.

1333
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,760
So, I was pretty happy with it.

1334
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,140
Oh, I wasn't sure if they could hear the machine even.

1335
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,880
Oh, they could ... The machine was loud.

1336
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:34,880


1337
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:34,880


1338
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,620
mic'd big time.

1339
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,260
And Mike kept the volume

1340
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:40,580
up pretty high on that thing.

1341
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,460
It's kind of hard to hear Mrs. Drummond.

1342
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:44,860
But...

1343
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,260
She was more silent.

1344
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,820
But you can hear the duet that

1345
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,960
Princess Wee and I did

1346
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,920
as we did it.

1347
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,300
We liked to do that.

1348
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,560
Of course, Mrs. Drummond

1349
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,480
mostly is known for her

1350
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:58,900
visual.

1351
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,320
Mrs. Drummond is the greatest

1352
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,380
dancer in the world.

1353
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,160
Also the weirdest

1354
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,080
dancer in the world.

1355
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,600
The whole time

1356
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:12,680
Trademark G's

1357
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,620
Evolution Control Committee was playing

1358
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,280
I couldn't look at him or his videos.

1359
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,000
I had to keep looking at your

1360
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,140
wife there, Dr. Drummond.

1361
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,660
Was that a rabbit suit she was

1362
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,880
wearing? What kind of a suit was that?

1363
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,640
It was a green alien Avi suit.

1364
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,840
It's an alien Avi suit.

1365
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,460
Avi!

1366
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,120
It's an Avi suit.

1367
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,360
Yeah. I was Avi

1368
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,800
and out.

1369
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,440
But I didn't want to Avi out on stage

1370
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,800
with her because she's so much

1371
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,840
better than anybody else.

1372
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,120
I Avi'd from the pit.

1373
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,360
Yeah, that's kind of what I did.

1374
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,600
From your seat?

1375
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,260
Yeah, I was Avi.

1376
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,620
I was riveted to my seat.

1377
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,600
And boy, did that hurt.

1378
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,780
Four stars and

1379
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,940
a gripping night at the cinema.

1380
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,600
Hey, let go.

1381
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,380
Stick around, children.

1382
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,240
I have a little tale to tell.

1383
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,060
A little tale.

1384
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,940
A cat of nine tails.

1385
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,260
A chaotic bobcat of nine tails

1386
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,920
to whip your ass into shreds.

1387
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,520
Thank you.

1388
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,180
I am here today

1389
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,600
from the planet X

1390
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,920
to invite you

1391
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,600
to take part

1392
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,380
if you wish

1393
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,760
in an ancient

1394
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,200
dark form

1395
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,560
called

1396
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,600
Avi.

1397
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,000
Avi.

1398
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,780
Avi has a base

1399
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,820
in Japan from the know.

1400
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,680
I'm a

1401
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,060
voodoo.

1402
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,820
Because the arm form

1403
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,380
of Avi,

1404
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,980
if anyone would like to

1405
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,760
come up here and join

1406
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,520
me when you are so inspired.

1407
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,060
Avi,

1408
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,300
you go deep inside

1409
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,700
with your sounds

1410
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,780
and your body and your mind.

1411
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,820
And it's the people

1412
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,560
who are experiencing

1413
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,440
your Avi

1414
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,840
like your...

1415
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,340
And they are Forever

1416
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,660
rosser.

1417
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,320
You don't need

1418
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,920
Me!

1419
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,120
You will never

1420
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,560
Who Gracias

1421
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:33,880
Never

1422
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,780
Are you absolutely

1423
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,540
No

1424
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,740
Wen

1425
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:34,720
D

1426
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:57,660
From PR News in Washington, I'm the polygamous sex leader swept away yesterday afternoon in

1427
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,400
New York at the end of the month. The Food and Drug Administration is at or near the end of its

1428
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,200
useful life, which could cause problems. Cuban President Raul Castro is taking the unprecedented

1429
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:14,400
step of ordering top-selling products from the market. Cuban President Raul Castro operated the

1430
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,360
crane that crashed last week and killed at least 107 people in New York. Castro is banned from

1431
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:26,240
future projects in the city. The investigation found in PR News blew the crane down. That's

1432
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:32,200
according to a new report by major top-selling PR. Cuban President Raul Castro is

1433
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,300
confirmed dead from flash floods along the Utah-Arizona border. The governor of Texas is

1434
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:42,100
joining educators and students in paying tribute to the victims of a school in the state's largest

1435
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,680
public school district in Washington state. The governors of New York and New Jersey are asking

1436
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:53,000
the federal government to pay for half the cost of a new PR News under the Hudson River.

1437
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,820
Phone number, paper, scrap, cheese, and old buttons,

1438
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:09,180
scraped, pitiless orange peel, think they have won the war by a show of sheer numbers. I am no

1439
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:15,440
suburbanite in hipster camouflage, not as lost in the details as in the inanimate think I look.

1440
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:23,060
The carnelian in my belly glows out beyond the fuzzy edges, my skin. I remember lost

1441
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:29,220
chips among the ticket stubs and dishes, regain them in bursts of confident orange.

1442
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:40,800
Thank you for the cheese and buttons to Reverend Andrew Genis. PR News and our title sequence came

1443
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:47,740
from Mr. Fernandin Andy Lemur, whose works, by the way, are on archive.com in all their splendor.

1444
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:55,460
We heard the melodious Reverend Chaos McBobcat at 18X Day demonstrating the new art consciousness

1445
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:01,440
form called A-V. I played Monster Hunter online with her daughter.

1446
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:09,720
Thanks to WCSB and Dr. Sinister for lending us his show again for use on Hour of Slut number 1546

1447
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:16,340
from the Church of the Subgenius, about which there is everything on subgenius.com,

1448
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:25,460
including the last thousand some odd episodes of this insane show. That's subgenius.com. Praise Bob.

1449
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:31,740
Oh, did we mention that Bob died? Our guru, Bob,

1450
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,680
well, he's dead again. It was his own experiments that did him in this time.

1451
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:44,820
He experimented on himself. Here lies the result. We mustn't think of him too harshly.

1452
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,960
The things he did, and they were terrible.

1453
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:56,200
All of us are capable of doing when we give free play to the basins, which is a part of everyone.

1454
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,940
He tampered with things beyond his province.

1455
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,400
Beyond what any man should do.

1456
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,380
And if it was madness,

1457
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,040
well,

1458
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,260
those whom the gods would destroy, they,

1459
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,180
they first make mad.

1460
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,940
Better this way.

1461
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:26,320
