Hi, Mom. It's Bobby.
Um, look, I'm gonna have to work tonight after all.
If there was a way to get out of here, we wouldn't know about it.
It's your turn.
Come on, Bob.
There's no time for a joke.
Come on, Bobby, no time for a joke.
But I am no joke.
I am very serious.
I am sure.
Here they come.
Okay, you two.
Time for your hour of fun.
Call me Bob.

Goodbye, Bob.
Outro Music
We're live outside the courthouse where religious cult leader has just been indicted on several counts.
Included are conspiracy, tax evasion, kidnapping, resisting arrest, and jury tampering.
Surely what everyone must understand about this is that it is not religious persecution.
The Church of Subgenius is not a church at all. It's a front.
It's a tax shelter set up solely for personal financial gain.
Well, how do you see the situation now?
Excuse me. Reverend, could we get a statement?
The Reverend has no statements at these times.
I'd like to say that this is a very old story.
If you don't understand something, then you attack it.
You call it weird or a cult, and you try to destroy it.
Well, the person who is leading the attack is usually someone who is on very shaky moral ground himself.
He's unsure of himself, and so he lashes out in a paranoid way against those of us who have ascended to a higher plane of consciousness and awareness.
Well, we'll survive this. We always have in the past.
And when Mr. Reese loses his anger and his fear, we invite him to join us in spreading our message of love and profit.
Thank you very much.
Shirley!
This is pure crap.
From NPR News in Washington, I'm swept away by a tsunami.
In the town of Cedar Grove, Bob made a mess of the property his family has spent a lifetime developing.
A top Treasury Department official has told a congressional panel that President Obama was arrested in an FBI sting.
Some badly needed Obama supplies are beginning to reach a remote area of NPR News in Washington.
Remind me of one of those cleverly amoral PR flats who sell their services to industries that pollute.

I must... must pull myself together.
Good evening.
The story of Ivan was filed under unsolved.
What?
Story?
Story.
Yeah?
I know who he is.
You got time to listen?
Shoot.
Well, this begins in a stormy night long ago.
1924 was a howling wintry day.
Neighbors later testified to seeing Ivan's massive eyes flailing open in the wind.
It was the last time they saw him.
What happened then?
He testified that Ivan covered with a piece of black velvet.
Ivan, well, glad to see you.
Yes.
Thanks.
Thanks.

Uh, did you, um, get a lot done today on the head, I mean?
See for yourself.
Good.
Come closer.
Oh, I see.
Here.
You poor fool.
Well, shall we start, Ivan?
Yes.
Why, Ivan.
Ivan.
How quaint.
But tell me.
Yes.
Why are you so set on the head?
I see.
I'm tired of your stupid cats.
Yes.
One, two, three, four cats with their heads cut off.
And another one.
And I'm so tired of them.
I think I've got to get out of here.







And filled with all the exciting smells of good cooking.
Get out before I break your neck.
Six more times.
What a story.
He's a bum on a barge.
Yeah.
No.
Ivan died penniless and insane a year later.
For heaven's sake.
Ivan was raised in an asylum.
That's right.
I was raised in an asylum.
You don't mean.
Yes.
Ivan.
No.
No.
Yes.
Yes, dear friends.
Ivan was sent to an insane asylum after he lost his fortune.
When no one would call the station during the pledge drive.
But that was fiction.
A cut and edited there by the great Fernanda Nande.
Leigh Murr.
The story of Ivan there.
Thank you, Fernanda Nande.
Leigh Murr.
We've heard many little cuts by the large.
The mysterious and large.
The large.
And one long cut.
The tax evasion business there.
And he also did our titles this time.
Lots of little.
This music isn't exciting enough for a pledge drive.
And that song.
With a lot of.
Bobs in it.
That kind of driving song.
Was by a new person.
Christian Blatter.
And that's not a description of his music.
It's.
Or his philosophy.
Apparently that is the person's name.
This last week.
We got mailed to us.
A number of really interesting CDs.
And even a cassette tape.
They were almost all.
Except for one.
Which we won't be playing tonight.
Was Handling.
The
This is a bad sign.
Usually it means amateurish junk.
Well this was amateurish.
Great stuff.
And that is the kind of thing that you only hear.
On stations like this.
And on shows like this.
Music.
That is made by real people.
Without the intervention of a record company.
Or.
Very expensive equipment.
In most cases.
But.
It just sheer talent.
Nerve.
And.
Often times a sense of humor.
The music in the background.
Theoretically.
Is the Rudy Schwartz project.
Although now I'm starting to wonder.
What I've got.
All mixed up here.
Anyway yes.
Thanks to Christian Blatter.
We'll be playing some of his music in the background.
And we'll be playing all kinds of horrible things.
If you don't pledge.
And here's how you do that.
You call this station.
The number of.
Of which.
Is this.
I'm only going to say it once.
This whole show.
Tattoo.
The best.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Here's the hard part.
Sixty nine hundred.
Six nine.
Oh.
Oh.
Is that number.
To call.
Two.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Sixty nine hundred.
In beautiful Cleveland.
Now.
If you happen to be listening to this show.
By internet.
Or on another station.
You can still.
Donate to your station.
Even if they're not having a pledge.
Drive.
Or.
You can donate to this station.
Anything I say now.
Will continue.
To hold true.
Well.
Maybe not that phone number.
After a week.
But.
You can always.
Get any information from us.
That you need.
By writing me.
Stang.
At subgenius.com.
At.
Or.
Post office box.
One eight one four one seven.
Cleveland Heights.
Ohio.
Four four one one eight.
And we'll.
I'm sure.
Do that again later.
But in the meantime.
The important thing.
That you must know.
Is.
Is that.
You must donate.
You.
In fact.
Have to.
Or you will go to hell.
Subgenius hell.
The worst.
Place.
In the.
In.
In.
The afterlife.
Actually.
Some people say.
That subgenius hell.
Is the best place.
In the afterlife.
Sit next to subgenius heaven.
Better than some of our rival.
Afterlives.
From.
Other religions.
Let's see what.
Happens.
If I.
Punch.
Dave.
In the.
Baby.
In the.
Labanzas.
As it were.
I punched.
Dave.
In the baby head.
As you are.
We're captain.
Of all mysterious realities.
To float.
By.
We're captain.
We're captain.
We are all.
Captain.
Of our own destiny.
Yes.
Friends.
And.
And.
And.
As such.
Why.
We're cool.
And.
And.
We're.
We're.
WCSB.
Listeners.
We're listeners.
Not only to WCSB.
But to this station.
The all-important.
This station.
Have I mentioned.
Any of the benefits.
That.
That.
They get.
Besides.
Hearing.
What they're hearing.
Right now.
The lilting voices.
Of lonesome cowboy Dave.
And.
Reverend Stang.
And Princess Wee.
If she's.
Not answering the phones.
In there.
Hi.
I'm arguing.
In her.
In her.
Doing the other room.
And.
Well.
And.
Dr.
Sinister.
Is here.
He's also answering.
Phones.
And.
People are calling.
Because.
Because.
You know.
Because.
You know why.
Why.
Because.
They know.
That.
When they donate.
To WCSB.
Or.
This station.
They don't just.
Get the great feeling.
Of knowing.
They've kept.
The station.
On the air.
They don't just get.
The great feeling.
Of knowing.
That they don't have to live.
In a place like.
Dallas.
Texas.
That has only.
Stations.
That are.
To suck.
But.
They are.
Listening.
To this.
Cleveland station.
The.
Greatest.
Of.
All.
Cleveland.
Stations.
I must say.
I agree.
Because of this show.
And the previous show.
And the following show.
And the shows later on tonight.
And the shows tomorrow as well.
I've been in the future.
Friends.
I'm going to prove it.
Later on tonight.
On this show.
I've been to the future.
And I know what we're going to do tonight.
We're going to start out with.
Polite.
Requests.
For donations.
And.
Simple explanations.
Of your pledge premiums.
Which.
We've got some special ones.
We will then progress to.
Insistent.
Weedling.
And guilt tripping.
We will finally.
We will finally.
Move on up to.
Angry demands.
And unreasonable.
Promises.
And threats.
Even.
And finally into depressed.
Begging.
Which is.
The ultimate culmination.
Of any pledge drive show.
And then a sort of.
And then shout outs.
Of course.
You know.
When you.
Make that.
Phone call.
And make that promise.
Whether it's.
A real.
Heartfelt promise.
Whether you're planning.
To back out later or not.
You get to talk.
To Princess Wee.
Or Dr.
Sinister.
Or.
Even.
The.
The double mean baby head.
That hangs off the side.
Of Dave's head.
That wonders.
A lot of the night.
I.
He'll be taking calls.
We'll be taking calls.
She'll be taking calls.
We want your calls.
As quickly as possible.
Because we're back loaded.
There's thousands of people.
People right at this moment.
Who.
If not.
Actually.
Calling.
They're thinking of calling.
They need to be calling.
And remember.
It's their calling.
Stan has promised.
To punish you.
With all forms of rhetoric.
Rhetoric available.
As means is disposable.
I have.
I had a calling.
I had a calling.
To preach the word of Bob.
And you have a calling.
To call.
The station of Bob.
That's.
That's.
That's 6900.
Right here in Cleveland.
That's a 216 area code.
Friends.
Don't be redundant.
Don't call.
Don't recall.
Recall.
What.
CSB has meant to you.
Remember.
For these many years.
Remember.
And then recall.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
What is this music in the background?
Is this Christian Blatter still?
I'm actually kind of confused as to what's happened.
Dave.
Go ahead.
Go ahead and distract them for a second.
I was just going to say.
Do you think it might be the right time to remind all of our listeners out there that
I'm wearing a huge.
Huge.
Prophylactic device of some kind on the top of my head.
And I look kind of like a baby bottle right now.
And that's the kind of lowbrow stunt that I'm willing to stoop to.
Is that what's making that hum?
That's.
I think it's my phone's dang.
Can you hear that stop?
Hum.
I was hoping nobody could hear it.
Not even me.
That was your electric.
Your new.
Your brand new electric forehead that you bought.
I haven't really followed through on.
On buying a forehead.
Oh.
Because.
Because you don't have enough money.
Right.
No.
I.
I've just.
I've shopped around.
And I want to save money when I get the right one.
Oh.
I thought you were.
We're supposed to say.
We.
We don't have enough.
Dave needs a new forehead.
I need new ears.
I do.
Why.
How long do you think we can keep preaching the word of Bob with no forehead and no ears?
Yeah.
What if some.
For instance.
Some night.
I was.
Think about that.
Friend.
It's.
It's.
There's too many things to think of at one time.
We're facing with the awful possibility that if WCSB does not get funding.
Enough funding.
That it.
Might not get enough funding.
And therefore.
It.
Won't be quite as much fun around there.
Well.
It's.
It's not just that.
We're trying to.
Not just keep the station on the air.
Which.
Requires a lot of money.
But we're trying to improve our service.
Did you know.
That what we're going to do with the money you're about to pledge to us.
Is start archiving WCSB programming.
Like other great stations that already do that.
Such as WREK in Atlanta.
Their listeners.
Are so lucky.
If they happen to miss Susie.
The floozies.
Bob slack time funhouse.
Or hour of slack.
Any time during the week.
They can listen to it on the internet.
WCSB must have this capability.
Archiving.
So that.
And we have to improve our website.
So that you can do that thing.
So if you miss.
For instance.
Radio synesthesia.
Or say you heard something on radio synesthesia.
Or hour of slack.
Or African abstract.
It's so great.
You wished you had your.
Your recorder on.
Well you can.
Play it again later on.
And anytime later on in the week.
That's the archiving.
Now it's true that the hour of slack.
Is already archived.
On my dime.
On my website.
But it doesn't usually appear.
On the.
On the internet.
Until after.
We've.
For several days after we've done one of these live shows.
But sometimes it takes months or even years.
With the way things are financially right now.
Sometimes it takes.
Years.


You know.




Years just for us to.
Eat breakfast.
That's how poor we are.
Yeah.
And so far.
As far as concept development goes.
We're absolute aeons behind.
So please.
If you've got anything to join with us.
Join.
Join us now.
Humans.
Join us humans.
Sure.
Why not.
Even if you're a human.
You can join us.
Or.
We'll accept humanoid.
You know.
If you can.
A good facsimile will work.
If you're a sentient being.
And you've got some sort of.
You know.




Fish collateral.
Or some sort of.
Gravy that you can spread around.
Like money.
Please.
Pledge now.
Or forever.
Be held.
In a.
Strange.
Position.
Because.
Things are desperate out here.
And not only do we need these archival materials.
Archivists.
Materials.
We also need to send you a wonderful.
Wonderful.
What are they called?
The.
The t-shirt.
The logo.
Premiums.
The.
Four pack.
Of.
Shot glasses.
The.
Sin.
Pack.
Friends.
Get this.
Now get this.
I'm about to.
Explain to you.
If I.
Get.
Yourself.
Music.
Here.
In the.
Back.
You know.
You can't do a subgenius show.
Without confusing background music.
Should I recall.
Because of the horrible.
Buzzing.
And see if it doesn't.
Go away.
No.
It always does that.
It does that.
Whenever you.
But.
When I have the background music up.
But.
Your pledge will get you stuff.
Here's what it'll get you.
Number one.
Any pledge we get.
Over.
Uh.
Ten.
Well.
Fifteen bucks.
For fifteen bucks and up.
Here's your subgenius premiums.
Get ready.
Number one.
A.
Bob.
Head.
Condom.
Yes.
A subgenius condom.
They really exist.
We also have a Connie condom.
But to keep things calm.
We'll probably just offer the Bob condom.
Nobody cares about Connie anyway.
So.



And these are real condoms.
Plus.
You get a triple X rated hour of slack show that we could not play on any of the broadcast
stations.
It was an internet only show.
Number twelve hundred seventy nine A. Or X.
And it was the nastiest.
Nastiest stuff from triple X day.
Or thirteen X day recently.
Including.
Dr. Legumes famous sermon or parable about the seven year rape.
Priestess Pisces most filthful feminist sex songs.
With great music by Reverend Anguillaire and Philo Drummond and Dr. Sinister and so forth.
All kinds of great stuff.
That's.
You never could hear it on any broadcast radio.
In the United States.
Legally.
So.
You can hear that.
And.
With your fifteen dollar premium pledge.
And this is just a pledge.
Of course we'll come after you for it later.
But.
You get.
The WCSB sin pack.
That means an ashtray shot glass bottle opener and condom all emblazoned with the famous WCSB
logo.
For like a twenty dollar pledge.
There's such things as CDs and VHS tapes and DVDs.
Yes.
You heard me right.
VHS tapes.
Of the most disgustingly bad horror movies.
Such as Alien Visitor.
Arachnid.
Children of Night.
Doppelganger.
Earth vs. the Spider.
Eve of Destruction.
E-Vo-Lution.
That's just a E's.
And the E's with which you can get these is just a call.
It's sixty nine hundred.
That's not a hard number to remember by any means.
It's easy.
Sixty nine.
That's a dirty word.
Sixty nine.
You know what that means?
It means you're the opposite of ninety six.
What you'd like to be doing with one of those premiums right now.
Yeah.
Is that you hold it in your hand.








You hold it tenderly in your arms and you look.
Perhaps someday it might be a coffee cup.
But right now it's a bunch of wonderful T-shirts and strange VHS's you'll never find anywhere
else in your life.
And why should you look any further than you're looking right now at your radio dial.
So please.
If you've got a brain left behind those ears.
Stop staring at the radio dial and get to a telephone.
These amazing devices.
Some say were invented by Alexander Graham Bell.
But many people know that in the same epoch, the same period of time in France, there were
other numerous developments that were very similar to an actual telephone.
Look at some of these amazing CDs.
We only have one each here.
But if you're the one who demands it, you'll get it.
Here's negative lands.
Great album.
A big ten eight place.
My personal favorite of all of theirs.
It was handed to me by them the first time they ever played out live, which was at the
night of Slack in San Francisco where Bob was shot.
Yes.
Negative land open for Bob's death.
And we have that album.
Nucleon.
That's a Cleveland band.
They did the great hit Green Acid, which is about flying through outer space out of
control on green acid.
Their album Hyper Emitter is here.
Stinking Lizaveta.
Our another hour of Slack favorite, Kirkendall Void.
Their CD Graveyard at GoGo is sitting here waiting for ye.
And guess what, friends?
If you come to the, if you make your donation tonight and then come to the Oval Office,
open house of Cleveland WCSB down here near downtown in a couple of weeks, why, we'll
hand you that premium personally.
And thank you for listening.
And you can then kiss our hand for being famous radio DJs.
But we'll be humble and we'll go, no, no, no.
We did this for you.
And here's your premium.
Here's your Bob condom.
Here's your triple X rated album.
Here's your sin pack of WCSB.
Em blazin or whatever.
kosher island drive the blue sky for the city was harder than is drive.
A little static that you bring on ifele didn't know what left to add wheel and that was

A hot supply coming up early to the city seats for ainizi a stopover that'd be plain � Вид
Today special time at Kobe Bryant Headquarters at the het lobby in the middle of observation

of a vestigial tail left, that's all right.
We could say maybe three legs, and for some of those guys out there,
I'm sure they'd love to be called a three-legged man,
but that doesn't matter at this point in time.
What matters at this point in time is that you get close to that vacuum tube thing.
Well, that's what they used to be back in the days of a Wendy's film,
an old-fashioned radio, the kind that was fashioned of worms
that fit directly into your ears.
You place them just enough close to your skull,
and they would actually climb into your ear and weave their way in
and tell you what you needed to hear.
And now we are continuing to tell you what you need to hear.
Friends, you need to know that you have a friend in WCSB.
Not an arm and a leg, not a person who will show up at midnight
with an army behind him and expect your deportation.
No, we're talking about men with raincoats and also umbrellas.
The kind of people that know to keep the snoot away
and to keep the vomit at their feet like it was
when they were young.
Back in the days of yours, mine truly, I'm telling you, please pledge.
If you've got the wherewithal to pledge,
it doesn't matter whether you're a steamer or diesel punk,
you don't have to use an actual credit card or any of those modern devices.
You can actually send some sort of postal money order,
or you could, well, you don't send that, you just pledge,
and then you could send a check later after.
I'm sure you could probably stuff some money in a bag
and you could make your way to Oaxaca,
but you don't have to.
But let's say that you're just going to stay here in Cleveland.
Let's just pretend that everything's okay.
Yeah, that everything's just fine,
and might even continue to be fine
as long as you support little teeny portals
into the world you'd rather have.
Now, you know, what we could do is just change right now
in the middle of the show to whatever all the other stations are playing.
Exactly.
I don't know.
That would be because I don't ever listen to any of the other stations.
We don't need to.
In fact, I don't really listen to much of anything
because I am almost completely stone deaf
and cannot even hear anything Dave has just said.
I'm guessing, however, and I'm a good guesser.
And you're not as good a guesser as you are a guesser.
But I don't want to bring your past into this at this point in time.
Give us your goodest guess.
Give it. Whip it out, baby.
Anyway.
Whatever he said.
It's all true.
Yes, yes.
And 6900 is the number to call.
Now, I'm going to look through this glass studio window here
and I see that Princess Wee is on the phone right now.
But poor Dr. Sinister has got...
Oh, wait. No, Princess Wee isn't on the phone.
There's nothing happening.
Princess Wee's just sitting there all by herself.
Friends, you better call.
This is your one chance to talk to Princess Wee.
And if you happen to be a little bit too late,
you'll get to talk to the...
real Dr. Sinister.
Of course, he lets anybody talk to him
every Sunday night.
And we're not really quite sure if he is real.
But he is the real Dr. Sinister.
As far as his reality goes in another direction,
you'll have to measure that yourself
when you call into his show later.
But right now, at this point in time,
remember,
you must call to receive the benefits
that Dobbs has intended for you.
And these benefits are many.
You get to listen to primo lectures
and arguments between people in bus stops.
No, no, you wait, you...
You get to hear the mentally ill people
that call the subgenius foundation answer machine.
Yes, yes, yes.
And you get to hear
peer-reviewed argument.
I mean, you get to hear
your synapses flying like
somebody put them in bacon grease.
Just listen to this.
Look.
My third non-starly is opening.
Ah, what a blissful smell that is.
A psychic smell.
An aroma of freedom.
Of slack.
Of lots and lots of luxury
at your feet.
Be prepared to grow, Morphe.
Remember,
it's on its way.
And you'd better be prepared.
Friends...
I don't know why I said that,
and I'm glad I didn't.
Because I...
Oh, go ahead, Dye.
Go ahead.
I just...
I was saddened by the fact
that so many of our listeners
are still calling right now
and they can't get through.
Please, keep trying.
It's very simple.
It's no game like
who can actually get in
or something like that.
You just keep hitting that redial button
and you're going to get in.
And when you get in,
the liberation from them.
But, sir, we have no money.
We gotta get some money.
Wait, dirty...
Egg flapping, flopping, rubbing...
Friends, the sounds in the background
are from Outmouth,
an otherwise unlabeled...
Actually, this CD was sent to us
in the mail by Outmouth
with handwritten liner notes
and an intricately made outer cover
made from a very, very, very
carefully cut up grocery bag.
And listen to...
Now, this is the kind of stuff...
This.
That you...
You're not going to hear this
on any other station, hardly,
because other stations only play
what the conspiracy approves.
You can't get your mind raped
like you can on these
independent stations
and college stations that we're on.
Let me read you this touching thing
that Outmouth wrote
on the Instagram page.
I saw it personally to us,
to you, the listener at WCSB.
My middle school...
No, how would he say this?
My middle school science teacher
told me once that I had a nice body.
That's neither here nor there.
More importantly, he told me
if it were possible to hear
all the radio waves passing over our head
every second of every day,
we would go insane
from the constant barrage of noise.
That idea has always entertained me,
and this recording is an attempt
at distilling that experience.
All samples are used illegally.
I claim no ownership,
and neither should they.
Public domain is everything
we see, feel, touch, and hear.
Although you shouldn't taste
anything in public.
And, uh, and yes,
squatting on intellectual properties
is the name of this CD,
and it's the name of this philosophy.
This is beautiful.
This is one of the best objections
you asked by your recent customers.
I don't even know if he's a subgenius.
I don't know if he paid his bribe to Bob.
I don't know if he's even ever pledged to WCSB.
But it was quality cut up.
It's the sons of negative land.
And, uh, and we love, we love that.
We love things that...
Yes, both the descendants
and the antecedents.
Both of these vast art movements
found their beginnings
in a strange back room
in a place in Cleveland Bluffs.
On the afternoon of
1927,
Earl Boggs...
You know, I'm gonna have to
pot that one down now, Dave.
You know why?
Because I haven't heard the rest of it.
Our power went out yesterday
right in the middle of this CD.
Probably, probably, probably, probably.
It's caused by the CD.
So I have to take off the outmouth.
Let's play him just a song for two minutes
and let him rest for a second.
Let people take those, make those calls.
Dave, I'm gonna play a song
I think you mighty like
that you may not have heard.
It's by the singer-songwriter
Dewey Cox, the late Dewey Cox.
This was featured in the movie
Walk Hard.
And it's a love song.
And I think you and everyone else
will have to like it.
For two and one half minutes.
I'm gonna love it.
Hello, Darlene.
Hello, Mr. Cox.
You ready to sing one?
I'm always ready.
All right.
In my dreams, you're blowing me
Some kisses
That's one of my favorite things to do
You and I could go down in history
That's what I'm praying to do with you
Let's do it
In ways that make us feel good
Let's do it
And make that song feel good







Let's do it
Put two and two together
Perfect harmony we found
We know it's only natural
Let's do it
I'm gonna beat off all my demons
That's what love and Jesus are about
Let's do it
Looking in your eyes
I start believing
Let's bring this whisper to a shout
Let's do it
In ways that make us feel good
Let's do it
And make that sacred sound
Put two and two together
Perfect harmony we found
We know it's only natural
Let's do it
Did I hear you sighing?
What are you implying?
You look a little tired
The music got me wired
Pretty good looking
Boy, we're really cooking now
I just wanna make out what you're saying
Read my lips, it's what you're looking for
Here I am, I'm sneaking up behind you
You can always come in my back door
I just wanna make out what you're saying
Let's do it
In ways that make us feel good
Let's do it
And make that sacred sound
Put two and two together
Perfect harmony we found
We know it's only natural
Of course it's only natural
God knows it's only natural
Let's do it
All right, that beautiful.
Yep.
Dewey Cox.
And I forget the girl's name.
He had an affair with her later
in the movie.
I thought Dewey Cox was still in the vacuum cleaner business.
I had no idea that he'd taken his cue
from that strange profession
of breaking into people's homes
and arguing with elderly people.
He was a married man.

And he was a married man.
And he was a married man.
And he was a married man.
And he was a married man.


And kind of an erotic
country western anthem
produced in the mid-90s
by Gerald Hiskos.
Hiskos, as you remember,
was a cross-eyed.
And when he would do his scores,
he had to be corrected numerous times.
But friends,
and I know we have friends out there.
Yes, Dave, it's true.
They love us.
I'm going to say their names.
I'm going to do shout-outs here
because these people,
these beloved listeners,
actually went to the trouble of calling and promising their hard-earned something.
Reverend King, now, see, some of these people even are from Cleveland,
but Reverend King, he called from Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Think of that.
Reverend Jason from Ohio managed to call in.
He wanted that negative land, Big Ten 8.
See, he's smart.
Well, these people have warmed the cock.
Are there more?
Dr. Dark, you know Dr. Dark and Her Highness Hell No, a faithful, faithful pledger.
And he wanted that triple X rated hour of slack that comes as a premium.
And since his donation was so large, why, he could get just about anything he wants.
And Hewitt, he hewed to the word of Bob.
And these are our beloved listers.
Then there's our...
Ignored listeners, which is all the rest of you haven't called yet.
Because I've got no use for you.
I've washed my hands of you.
Well, I think if we're going to have people...
I'll wash my feet of you, for that matter.
Well, that's what they used to do in the days of our Lord.
They would wash their feet.
You walk into someone's house and they start sucking on your toes.
That's what we'll do for you if you pledge.
But they ain't pledging, see.
We're feeling down.
It's looking bad.
I don't know if we'll be on the air next week.
Actually, I won't be on the air next week.
Well, I won't either.
But if I could, I would have like an enormous, huge, psychic tickler.
It would be like a feather.
It would be more like a wand.
And I would stick it right into the vacuum of space.
And I would tickle those radio waves that go on forever.
And there are so numerous that we can't count them.
And I would force...
Love it with force.
Well, I wouldn't force anybody to...
Blank it with love.
I would force them to consider...
Whack it over the head with your hard love, baby.
Yeah.
Do that to this station.
Wait a minute.
This is the parallel.
Wait.
This is not the caramel.
This is the parallel theme.
Are you still doing the other thing?
Yeah, I just realized something.
I'm going to...
I'll be seeing that Reverend King next week at the Detroit Devival.
Oh, I hope it's not one of those.
Yes, I...
Yeah, it is.
See, people will...
They'll come to see the word Bob preached.
They'll even pay good money to see it in some places.
I don't know about Cleveland.
I might as well just move back to Dallas.
Me and Reverend Gene Scott might as well just move back to Dallas.
I might as well just shut off all this background stuff.
Might as well...
Might as well just play my saxophone.
Which I never did learn how to play.
But that's all they deserve, these listeners, if they ain't going to call.
They won't even promise us money.
We're not trying to get the money out of you right this minute.
We'll get it later.
We're just trying to get you to promise, that's all.
I see a whole bunch of people listening by internet.
I ain't getting them...
I ain't seeing them call.
Them call?
Buttons light up.
I guess we might as well just become Southern Baptists, Dave.
Yep.
We'd get paid a lot better.
We might as well just give them the word and let them do whatever they want to do.
They're going to do it anyway.
If we quit this subgenius church and these little piddly stations,
why, we could be like Rush Limbaugh or Jimmy Swaggart.
Well, nobody remembers who they are anymore.
Who's the new ones?
Chorus.
Towers.
Kind of leave.
Grim.
And Gwen Becker.
Gwen Lendbecker?
Yeah, we could be like that.
We could be preaching some other gospel besides slack.
Who cares about...
Nobody cares about slack anymore.
We could be building huge cathedrals, too, just like they do.
Had we not the decency and honesty to inform our fellow men and other members of other species
that if they would just pick up the telephone, their life might be broadened beyond conjecture.
They might be more...
They might be happier than they've been in the last three weeks or something.
They might say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here comes my T-shirt, man.
Oh, thanks, you PS guy or regular...
That's a big if.
That's a real big if, and you're talking about a bunch of big butts.
And that's what they ain't going to get off of, because the phone, it might be across the room.
It's a little bit easier to just sit there listening by a computer or whatnot.
We're going to be doing this show anyway.
It's going to be free.
Why should they...
Why should they help?
Why should they demonstrate that anybody except those four people that called in have ever listened to this show?
As far as I'm concerned, they're the only people we ever talked to this whole...
All the 20-something years I've been doing this.
The only ones that ever paid any attention was Dr. Dark and Reverend King there and James and John and Jason and Joe.
No, Joe wasn't even listening, was he?
Well, Piker was...
Joe just gave up on us.
Jim Bowe and the Alarm Room.
I said...
And...
And...
And how...
How bold are you guys?
Why should we...
Why should we keep...
You know I have to drive all the way down here to this station once a month?
Why am I going...
If they can't even go across the room to pick up that phone and call this station, they can't be bothered to do that.
Why should I be bothered to do anything?
Anything at all?
Now, the form of rhetoric you're taking up is a form based on pity and stuff.
Now, I'm not going to speak to you...
There's nothing wrong with...
Hey, I'm just hating them.
No, it's just pure hate.
Depression.
And I'm depressed, sure.
I'm going to go home and commit suicide.
That's why I'm not going to be here next week.
I'm going to go just kill myself because four listeners ain't enough.
And if one more, just one more, that's all we're talking about.
Do you think we'd lie to you?
Do you think there'd really be 400 listeners I'm just saying for?
Do you think a subgenius would come up with a silly lie like that?
I don't think so.
We've got four million listeners, Stang.
Just calm down.
Sit back in that little easy chair.
Four million dead listeners.
Four million listeners in the afterlife.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, yeah.
People.
Yeah, people, sure.
But this...
Perhaps.
I mean, I'm just throwing this out there.
Perhaps people in this dimension have a hard time remembering that number.
Now, if we've accidentally, perhaps on purpose, transversed into the next string,
and the string is vibrating at the right rate,
we've zoomed off into a place where there are four million listeners
who cannot comprehend past the last sentence they heard.
They can't remember.
This is 6900.
They can't remember the hour of slack.
The church of the subgenius.
Yeah, what was that show I used to hear back in those days?
The hour of flack?
Or was it the week of slack?
Or hour of Bob?
What was it?
Oh, that show.
That show made me feel so good.
I've been so depressed ever since that show went off the air.
Oh, come to think of it, that whole station went off the air
because nobody gave to those independent stations.
All they did was listen to the top 40 drive time classic rock stations
or their supposedly hip modern new music station
that always plays exactly what Clear Channel prescribes.
You know, it's prescription music for the brain dead.
They want to keep you sick, you know.
They want to keep you hearing.
They want to make you be one of those people that just,
oh boy, they're playing my favorite song again.
They played that ten minutes ago.
I'm so happy they're playing it again
because I don't like anything new
because I'm a stupid pig.
I'm a stupid, normally, warmly human.
I'm a pathetic, and I don't have enough money to give it to the station
because I'm too stupid and poor
because I'm too chintzy
because I'm a...
a...
a...
a...
a...








a...
a selfish, fat hog
that can't do, even if I'm skinny,
I'm just a hog that can't be bothered.
Can't be bothered to lift the phone.
Can't be bothered to call this station
and show the tiniest...
tiniest gram of gratitude.
No, sir.
No, that's too much work for them.
That's not their idea of slack.
Their idea of slack is
to drink Miller similar
Uh-huh. That's what they'd like because it's the cheapest in old Milwaukee.
And smoke some of their dirt weed and listen to whatever that station is that they listen to.
That's not this one. Or they listen to this one going, well, I guess I'm cool.
Even though I have no mind, I'm just cool because I must be smart because I listen to Frank Zappa albums.
Oh, that shit makes me sick.
I'm spraying spittle and foam all over this expensive equipment.
Well, it's not very expensive equipment.
Who cares if I'm spitting all over this equipment?
We can't afford these equipment.
We can't afford a maid to come in here and clean up my spittle.
Because that's the way these people are.
How do you wash this stuff out of your nasal hairs?
Check.
I think you've gone over the edge, but I do agree that maybe you should have stepped a little bit further and kicked a few more groins.
Or is that the plural of it?
They don't have groins. The kind of people I'm talking about don't have enough groin to kick.
They've got kind of a space between their legs, but that's all.
And they don't have an eye for an egg.
You're listening to a preacher who's only got six up front.
And you ain't got none, as far as I'm concerned, if you haven't called.
Now, there are those who have called, yes.
There are those true subgeniuses, the men and women of Bob, the children of Bob,
who cared enough to call the station and donate.
That's just a tiny, you know, who means the most to Bob?
The rich man who could have given a million dollars and only gave 15?
A hundred?
Or the poor old lady who's only got $10 to her name, but she gave nine to the station?
I think you know the answer.
That Bob loves that rich man.
Because he gave more money.
That's what it all comes down to.
Friend, can't you feel deep down in your heart and into that place even more close,
even more you than your heart?
Your wallet.
Your wallet.
Can't you reach down into that and spare the ministers of Bob
and the Home for Slackless Children just a little bit?
Give generously.
I mean, we're going to spend more on postage than you, your premiums,
than we'll actually make.
Now, come on, friend.
You can do it.
I know you can.
I know that somewhere out there, there is one true, honest man or woman
or something.
Some gender along in there.
At least nearby.
That will fork it over.
You know?
At least they'll often do in your part of the world.
So give generously now.
Oh, my gosh.
All that screaming and yelling I just did got three more people to call in.
Three more people called?
Can you believe the Princess Marie?
That's amazing.
It is amazing.
They went for that Southern preacher crap and actually pledged?
What?
Well, now it's...
Well, now it's...

It's my turn to get a little bit angry.
If that kind of dramatic over-drama is going to get you to send in some money,
then I'm going to come up...
I'm going to go on...
Now, here's the funniest thing.
Get this.
Only one of these new pledgers is from Ohio.
Well, it figures.
A lot for that.
Our brother Hoffmeister has coughed...
Hoffmeister could cough.
He's a coughmeister, and he coughed up a really good donation.
He's going to get...
Get him a black zip-up men's hoodie with a gray WCSB logo.
Brother Sears called from...
Get this.
Pittsburgh, North Carolina.
Well, that's a strange thing for a preacher here.
It costs Brother Sears more to make that phone call than anybody in Cleveland has donated,
except Dr. Dark hardly and Reverend Hoffmeister and the other ones that donated.
And here's...
Get this.
After all my bad mouth in Dallas, we got one from Dallas.
Reverend Michael in Dallas.
Oh, my goodness.
He coughed up.
He hocked up a loogie that'll get him that triple X rated hour of slack show that you can't get on the broadcast world.
Now we're talking some trash.
This is like homily grits in the middle of email services.
This is beyond any form of success I could have imagined.
Yes, yes.
Seven donators.
Well, that's seven more skulls that we haven't trepanated.
That's seven more skulls.
That's seven more skulls that we could be invading right now, and we are invading.
And we want to invade as many as we possibly can.
We want to get right inside that cerebral cortex.
We want to get right into the...
What's the part in between that joins everything up?
The medulla oblongata, the MO there?
Is that the part?
That's the part we're looking at right now?
It's moving.
The hindbrain.
Oh, the hindbrain.
Yeah.
It's right near the fore...
It's the area that we want...
The hindbrain.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
It's also called...
It's the place that's dimly lit from within.
That means we're calling on you in a suspenseful, Uruguayan, perhaps even spiritualist, demonic way
to enter your wallet and look and see how many dollars of U.S. currency or any other kind.
You know you can also donate to this station with Canadian money.
We'll take it.
I mean, they'll take it.
Don't you...
Don't you want to...
Have some identity that separates you from the others?
The faceless?
Don't you want to feel and know?
Now, everybody likes to feel special.
But wouldn't you like to know that you were like those few, those brave people that called into this station, this station, and made that pledge?
Made that promise to J.R. Bob Dobbs?
You know Bob's a rich...
He's the richest, luckiest man in the world.
He doesn't need your money.
But he needs to know that you trust him.
And the only way to do that is to get from you that which is more important to you than your own life, your children, your spouse.
Yes, it's your money.
That's the only way he can know that you've given up something you really care about.
And we're not asking for all your money.
If we were some of these other religions, we'd have...
We'd make you bow down to Dallas every day at 6.
6 o'clock in the evening.
Or we'd make you get up at 7 in the morning and go to work.
Or we'd make you kneel down by your bed and say whisper to Bob, even though he's not really paying any attention in the slightest.
But we don't.
We just give you slack.
We'd rather be selling you slack.
But, you know, the day that the conspiracy can package and sell slack is the day they've won.
As long as they don't know what slack is, they can...
They don't win!
And you!
You and your donation is the one thin hair-like line, the tiny thin cellophane wall in between
total world destruction by the conspiracy and slavery and freedom.
You!
Your call is that one thing that could make freedom, slack, love, warmth and beauty and full belly forever
versus your non-success.
Stop calling in and just might as well just go back in time to become a slave under the pharaoh,
hauling stuff up that pyramid wall, whipping the mammoths, cleaning the mammoth poo up as they haul those bricks up.
Isn't that what you're doing right now, friends?
That's kind of what I'm trying to do right now.
Huge granite bricks up a monolithic mammoth mammoth every day.
One more inch closer to the very...
Are you going to let that happen?
Are you going to be the person who causes the avalanche that destroys civilization?
Or are you going to be the Abraham Lincoln that stands up against the conspiracy for once in this benighted world
and says, yes, Bob, yes, yes, this station, I believe, I believe.
Well, that was the last woman tracked from...
Aldo Zinger's spy remedies and the other unfortunate victims of the heretofore non-existent crap.
Yep, that's it.
It's a long-winded opus and perhaps one of the best ways to describe it was it requires some audience participation.
And so as a part of the continuing survey going on right now, those of you who have registered and with those comments and feel...
I'm packing up. I'm getting out of here. I've had it.
Please call.
Call if you can now or if you cannot.
This is the assignment.
I'm going to do a show next week.
I'm going to mail it to those seven people that pledged.
That's it.
They're the only ones that are going to hear a show next week.
That's it.
Are you saying the wagon wheel of time is approaching when no one gets the opportunity to be saved?
Not ever again.
This was the last chance.
Now, it's possible that a few of them were thinking, I can't bear to miss a single word that Lonesome Cowboy Dave says,
so I'm not going to call in until Stang starts playing prerecorded.
I don't blame him.
I don't blame him for waiting.
That's okay.
We're patient.
I mean, you've got to remember that people are going to form some form of astrophysical drift out there,
and if their fingers get too small, they're not going to be able to dial the phone right.
I can say this.
I can say this.
I can say this tonight.
In fact, I have to say it.
Now, that may not ever...
Now, that may not ever...
I'll never have to say that again if nobody ever coughs it up.
Anyway, I'm going to...
We're off.
This is the end.
This is probably the last show.
That's it.
So, oh, well.
Oh, well.
It's going right now?
Unless a few people call in when I get off the air here and let Dr. Sinister take over,
and that's what I'm going to do right now.
So, Dave, I'm going to fade you out.
There it goes.
Okay, but I really hope some people call because they really should.
It'd be a lot better for everybody, especially...
So, I'm fading you out.
Actually, I'm going to start fading me out, too.
Okay.
Come on!
Get up off that chair!
Follow me!
Now you can have something to sell.
We all know we're in the art of selling.
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.
Right in your own home.
And you can call in and you can talk to the...
There's some sexy ministers on the lines tonight.
Your prayer partners are here ready to receive your promise.
Your covenant with Bob, friends.
Why, the evil Dr. Zaphod here picked up...
He got one from Joseph Prowl for 200 bucks.
And I happen to know that that one's not a joke.
But we got to sell you, friends.
We're not just going to sit here and talk.
Bob said we had to party.
Didn't he?
Didn't he?
He said we had to party.
He didn't say we couldn't.
He said we had to.
And so, we must also sell.
Praise Bob and thank you.
Or they're destroyed.
When everybody sells...
We're all selling.
We all have something to sell.
Yes, everyone selling together.
Mighty symphony of prosperity.
For we all have something to sell.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
A candy-colored clown.
They call us Santa.
Tiptoes to my room every night.
Every night.
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper.
To whisper, dear friend.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Everything is just fine.
It's just fine.
