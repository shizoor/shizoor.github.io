1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Today is Wednesday, July 3rd, 2013.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,100
2013? Oh, good God.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,240
All day, in the Grindhouse, the movies will be projected.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:25,140
Now the live hour of slack will transpire, here on the Wisteria stage at Caffeina's.

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:33,320
From 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock, the first phase of the historic Bulldada auction will begin.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,660
And from 4 to 5, another live hour of slack at Caffeina's.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,100
Yeah, so bring on the babes, bring on the babes. Where'd all the babes go?

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,280
They'll be along.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,680
There's Baby Bear over there. We need her squeaky voice up here.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,920
We need her, but of course she's on duty at the swag shack.

11
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,220
She is.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,420
Yes.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,080
Oh, really? Okay, well then you should come and give us some assistance here.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,140
Hooray.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,380
Who are our two swaggards today?

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,640
Oh, Peter Bergman is here. I thought you were dead.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,760
Let's take it again. Oh, Pete and Dave. Okay, there we go.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,060
All right, you over here?

19
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,040
You just shut up.

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,380
This is Phil.

21
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,740
Phil.

22
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,100
Pete.

23
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,800
And Dave.

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,480
Of the Firesign Theater.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,600
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,580
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,060
Children's voices in the orchard between the blossom and the fruit time.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,020
Whee.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,080
Golden head, crimson head, between the green tip and the root.

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,540
Black wing, brown wing, hover over.

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,380
Twenty years and the spring is over.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,040
Today grieves, tomorrow grieves.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,880
Cover me over, light in leaves.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
Golden head, black wing.

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,700
Cling, swing, spring, sing.

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,160
Swing up into the apple tree.

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,940
Does anybody know what the hell he's going on about?

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,460
I just thought everybody should be rested and slackful.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,620
Praise Dr. Howell.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,660
To heave up.

41
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,960
To heave up the burdens of today.

42
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,780
Bleugh.

43
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,920
The intolerable heavy weight of so much slackfulness and fun.

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,720
More than the human organism was ever designed for.

45
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,000
My butt hurts.

46
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,820
We'll accept no whining, no complaining.

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,140
All my butt cheeks hurt.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,060
I want it to be more funner.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,920
More funner.

50
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
It should be more funner.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,320
That's what...

52
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,960
Dildo Valerie said her first afternoon at X Day.

53
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,400
Really?

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,880
Yes.

55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,220
She wanted it to be more funner.

56
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:00,980
More funner.

57
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,620
Everybody...

58
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,500
It should be more funner.

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,780
And I said, Dildo Valerie, I think the problem is that you're new here.

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,920
And most of the people here have kind of known each other for years.

61
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,960
So what they're mainly here for is to just sit around and yak in the flesh instead of on the internet.

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,440
So what you have to do is make it more fun.

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:24,900
More funner.

64
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,900
Yes.

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,520
And they did.

66
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,320
What more could you want?

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,320
It's already the most funnest.

68
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,980
She had more fun, I take it, later on.

69
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,340
Yes, she did.

70
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,340
She got to break open the piñata, which turned out to be full of live bugs.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
Yes, no one expected...

72
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,380
And it was designed to scare girls.

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,160
And it turned out she was an insectologist.

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,380
Well, we had that piñata all filled with spiders and beetles and all sorts of things.

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,080
Centipedes.

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,100
They came showering down.

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
I wouldn't react so well.

78
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,100
A great subgenius moment.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:08,960
Now, as I understand it, Reverend Baby Bear, you have been in the conspiracies pits, working your pits off.

80
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,880
Deep, deep in the caves.

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,900
You had like a 12-hour shift before you came out here or something?

82
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,540
Two 12-hour shifts and two days of being at work at 7.30 in the morning.

83
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Did they give you overtime for that sacrifice?

84
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,120
No.

85
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,340
No.

86
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,440
I just had to fill in all the hours that I was going to miss this week.

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,060
It was horrendous.

88
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,460
Did you have to use the religious excuse that you were going to your religious retreat?

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,660
You're going to a church meeting.

90
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,220
No.

91
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,140
Because they would press me and I don't want to have to explain it.

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I called it a music festival.

93
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, okay.

94
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,120
And camping.

95
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,840
That's it, yeah.

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,420
That's what we call Starwood.

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,800
Seven whole days of peace, love, and...

98
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,800
Did you hear the story of how...

99
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:02,560
Dow Jones and Reverend Purge and Reverend Fox managed to rent a car after they missed the bus,

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,400
despite a lot of paperwork problems.

101
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
Somebody's credit wasn't good enough.

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
And the lady at the car rental place said,

103
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm sorry, I can't rent you any cars as long as your credit is like...

104
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,300
And I think Dow Jones said something like,

105
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,060
I guess we'll miss our church meeting.

106
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,640
And suddenly everything changed.

107
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,860
She said, I think we'll be able to rent you a car, sir.

108
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,900
He didn't say what church it was.

109
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,700
Jesus gets you a ticket.

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,460
And now we have Susie here in the place.

111
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,520
So the fourth member is here.

112
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,420
Hi, Susie.

113
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,200
Oh, there we go.

114
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,840
And we got the background, the video backdrop.

115
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,120
We don't really need the video backdrop this time because we got the girls here.

116
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,620
Well, you can have the video.

117
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


118
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


119
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


121
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


123
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


124
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


125
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,300
We got the video backdrop and them.

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,660
And so indulge, wallow in richness here.

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,060
Susie, are you going to enrichen us?

128
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,440
I got a fan.

129
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,680
She brought a big fan with her.

130
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,720
I got a thing to blow you with.

131
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,980
Susie's going to blow us.

132
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,660
As per usual.

133
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,280
She's such a big fan.

134
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm a big Susie fan.

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
Can I blow you?

136
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,540
Sure.

137
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,120
Sure.

138
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,320
He'll huff and he'll puff.

139
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,460
And he'll blow you away.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,240
My sword is blunted.

141
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,880
We're still getting set up here, experiencing minor testicle difficulties.

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:47,300
In just a short while, we will be fully embarked on an incredible adventure of subgenius broadcasting.

143
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,620
Live.

144
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,260
Here.

145
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,400
Here and now.

146
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,960
No, I'm sorry.

147
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,460
This is the incredible adventure.

148
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,580
This is the whole thing.

149
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

150
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,580
Here it goes.

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah.

152
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,300
The slack must flow.

153
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

154
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,400
Where have I heard that before?

155
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,360
Um, so we have the projector, so I could spring the surprise on Susie.

156
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,360
There's a surprise.

157
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
I want to know the surprise.

158
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,240
Surprise, surprise, surprise.

159
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,880
Hm.

160
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,160
Right.

161
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,820
Yes.

162
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,620
Yes, it's taken a long time to do.

163
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,920
time to rehearse this

164
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,200
apparent artless bumbling.

165
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,560
Actually, it's a highly refined

166
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
comedy routine. How's that?

167
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,060
There, that's excellent.

168
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,380
You have to scoot your chair forward.

169
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,520
Then I'll be right in the middle of your interrogation camera.

170
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,940
Bring it even further forward.

171
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,240
You can't be too close. I did it, Chowchilla.

172
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,420
I buried that damn school bus. I'm sorry.

173
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,900
Well, we'll get to that later.

174
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,520
See, there's one right there. I saw it.

175
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,780
There are wasps.

176
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,340
Oh, there are wasps.

177
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,060
I wasn't denying it. There are wasps.

178
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
You know, all you have to do is hold your breath

179
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,220
and it makes all of your pores slam shut.

180
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,620
And that's a mechanism by which they sting you.

181
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,020
They stick their little stingers in your open pores.

182
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,040
But no, you hold your breath.

183
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,280
All your pores are like slammed shut.

184
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,800
Like little tight sphincters.

185
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,600
An interesting false belief here.

186
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,080
And there's nothing for them to stick their pointy asses in.

187
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,920
So you're safe. I've always been safe that way.

188
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,520
I'm not actually afraid of getting stung.

189
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,580
I can handle that. It's just the buzzing.

190
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,500
The horrible buzzing.

191
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm more afraid of getting stung.

192
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,300
The numinous horror of the shape of the wasp itself

193
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,440
is existentially frightening.

194
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,260
More than any damage they can do with the sting.

195
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Well, some people are terrified.

196
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,780
There's no explanation.

197
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,560
Is that an exos with some sort of extensive device on?

198
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,460
A mechanism of explanation has been offered

199
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,760
for why people have these indescribable fears.

200
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,480
And it's speculated that

201
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,900
as a baby lying in the cradle

202
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,780
with jam on your face or whatever,

203
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,800
you may be visited by a persistent spider

204
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,180
or wasp or something.

205
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,380
The baby cries.

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,280
The parents come, but there's no bug to be seen.

207
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,940
The parents retreat, and the bug comes back.

208
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,500
And from then on...

209
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,640
Sometimes if you light the baby,

210
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,340
that will produce enough smoke to keep it going.

211
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,040
A terrible fear, illogical and unexplained,

212
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,580
of certain creatures is maintained.

213
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,500
According to this theory.

214
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,040
Buzzing is just a metaphor.

215
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,680
Maddening sound.

216
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,620
You don't like the buzzing.

217
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,980
Welcome to my world.

218
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,140
What's the matter with a little bit of a buzz, huh?

219
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,560
Test, test, test.

220
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,780
Now come on, man.

221
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,280
It's the hole.

222
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
It's the hole that is...

223
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
We can't tell which mic is failing you.

224
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,400
It's a story of my life, man.

225
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,040
Always blaming it on that.

226
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,960
You men.

227
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,480
Yeah, it's the bitches, man.

228
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,720
It's all their fault.

229
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,760
And now I'm getting tangled up

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
in blue white...

231
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,280
You liars.

232
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,380
Jiggle it a little, it'll open.

233
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,420
If only he was here.

234
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,760
Reverend, jiggle it a little,

235
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,560
and it'll open.

236
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,100
This isn't like WREK,

237
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,760
your fancy radio station

238
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,420
that's got million dollar microphones.

239
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,420
And headphones.

240
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,500
I still do it in the recording bunker.

241
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,100
You guys, you two girls should...

242
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,740
We get the crappy mic.

243
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,100
No, that's actually the louder mic.

244
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,520
Oh gosh, it is loud.

245
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,040
Saw Bigfoot?

246
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,900
Near? Here?

247
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,900
Well, yeah, I understand there have been unusual sightings.

248
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,920
Not of just old sea qual, but...

249
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,480
But of shaggy, shambling beings

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
crashing through the woods.

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,300
Shambling things.

252
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm not sure of shaggy, scaly, slimy.

253
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,400
I hear some of them feel like hagfish.

254
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,940
Oh, that's encouraging.

255
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,500
Yeah, that's a very...

256
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,240
Hagfish, lampreys...

257
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,940
It's not a nice slime.

258
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,660
It's not like a good, honest,

259
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,040
prairie squid slime.

260
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,960
Well, there are creatures near us.

261
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,020
Last year, I was walking on the upper road

262
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,920
and there was something large

263
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,460
crashing in the bushes near me.

264
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,180
There are things nearby, definitely.

265
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,420
You sure it wasn't one of your peers?

266
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,980
Peers?

267
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,600
Well, with no light,

268
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,500
totally drunk and lost and off the trail

269
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,640
and crashing through the bushes.

270
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,980
Bushes, you know, you might have something there.

271
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Mm-hmm.

272
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,140
There are some bears

273
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,160
in this area.

274
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,080
These are ordinary bears?

275
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,560
Ordinary bears, not the...

276
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,220
Terrible.

277
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,380
Not the funny thing that everybody says all the time.

278
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,220
Yeah, not the right bears.

279
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,680
And they're supposed to be some sort of

280
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,020
equally lascivious creature.

281
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,680
We put notices up in the woods.

282
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,320
What the...

283
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,260
Oh, more things shoved in our mouths.

284
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,400
Story of my life.

285
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,440
And now...

286
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,880
Yeah, they've put in some regulations,

287
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,960
stern regulations on the rape bear population

288
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,480
and they put signs up.

289
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,960
I understand in their language.

290
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,720
And wasn't there an awful creature?

291
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,760
So we're going to be totally safe.

292
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,860
A terrible creature called Man Bear Pig.

293
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,040
Do you remember that?

294
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,360
Oh.

295
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,720
There's so many mixtures.

296
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,980
Well, anyway.

297
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,360
But a true subgenius has a power to control

298
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,540
and dismiss them.

299
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,840
Just as a Christian, according to Jack Cheechick,

300
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,640
can dismiss demons in Jesus' name.

301
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,620
There was a possum, a cat, and an amoeba.

302
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,180
Oh, man, that was rough.

303
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,480
Couldn't keep it out of a sleeping bag.

304
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,460
Well, and did anything unusual happen during the night?

305
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,860
That's another question.

306
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,020
It got cold.

307
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,560
That was unusual.

308
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,940
It got chill here.

309
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,020
And it was very pleasant.

310
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,360
It was really nice.

311
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,520
I had to pardon my brain.

312
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,820
I had to pardon my skin.

313
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,060
I had to pardon my skin.

314
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,060


315
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,060


316
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,660
But it was warm for a long time, I thought.

317
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,220
The residual heat of the day lingered on.

318
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,580
Oh, no, no.

319
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,260
It was nice.

320
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,460
Especially naked rolling in the wet grass.

321
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,860
That was very nice.

322
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,020
We're feeding back.

323
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,740
I'm scared to put my mouth on it now, staying.

324
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,080
I got microphone marks on my teeth.

325
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,800
How much closer should I be?

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,800
Those are a badge of honor.

327
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,060
I'm going to be...

328
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,220
You sound like an echo.

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,680
So, it got chilly, you were saying.

330
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,880
But before that, you whinnied like a horse and rolled on the fresh grass.

331
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,740
Mm-hmm.

332
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,440
Mm-hmm.

333
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,260
Has it rained very much?

334
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,820
What did I miss?

335
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
Any good storms?

336
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,880
Oh, torrential downpour.

337
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,560
Today?

338
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,800
Oh, no.

339
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,680
Oh, no.

340
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,380
Because I just got in last night.

341
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
It was cool.

342
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,100
It was cool.

343
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,720
I mean, this is Ragnarok.

344
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,300
I mean, without that sweet sense around thinking you're going to die in your tent.

345
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,060
I mean, that's like that tasty foreshadowing.

346
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
There's worse ways to die.

347
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,060
At least it wasn't Ragnar-a-Rak.

348
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,200
It made my sticker peck out.

349
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,160
We have had some people who always have trouble with their tents and always get rained out.

350
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,200
And their tents get full of water, even when it's not raining.

351
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,820
My peckers are closer.

352
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,060
Bad luck.

353
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,920
It's the bad juju.

354
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,140
And what about unusual insect life?

355
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,280
Has anyone been visited in the tent by some large and spectral specimens?

356
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,020
I just held my breath.

357
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,700
Everything's slam show.

358
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,160
I can't even poop.

359
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,480
Well, I'm glad that works for you.

360
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm not sure it would for me.

361
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,160
I really believe that.

362
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,520
And somehow I never got stung for decades.

363
00:14:52,060 --> 00:15:00,120
I asked this guy who was a beekeeper, and he really wanted to shout bullshit at me in the middle of a Kroger.

364
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,080
He had a display of bees.

365
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,840
Here's one for you to take out and stay.

366
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,060
The problem with the bees is if one stings, they all sting.

367
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,320
It's like a chemical signal.

368
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,080
So you're fine with that big beard of bees on you or whatever until one of them decides to sting.

369
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,380
Okay, I've got Susie here.

370
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,020
And I have the surprise.

371
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,480
I have the surprise up on the screen.

372
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm going to take advantage of this.

373
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,880
Scoot over just a little bit, Susie.

374
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,600
Okay, I'm not going to go into how or why I was in a GameStop on the way here.

375
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:45,180
But I found for $1.79 in an unmarked box this game called Pipe Mania.

376
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,200
Now, of course, for $1.79, I figured it was probably a little pipe puzzle.

377
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,420
It's a plumbing puzzle game, and it is.

378
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,860
But there was a surprise for me.

379
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,840
I've got to hold the mic and the controller here at the same time.

380
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,820
Pipe Mania, of course, I didn't expect it to be about J.R. Bob Dobbs.

381
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,360
It just was a cute title.

382
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Everything with a pipe in it doesn't have to be about Bob.

383
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,940
I don't know if everybody here knew that.

384
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,600
Potential.

385
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,340
Also, I might mention that there are...

386
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,100
The name Bob is the most common name in English-speaking countries.

387
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,300
It's not always magic.

388
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,360
And it was...

389
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,420
Oh, here we go.

390
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:33,700
Okay.

391
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,540
Wait for it.

392
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,120
Wait for it.

393
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,880
Totally open to bafflement.

394
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,920
You know, we were watching Jack the Giant Slayer, and they were using year 2000 cliches

395
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,420
like, wait for it, wait for it.

396
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,180
And okay.

397
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,900
I have a bad feeling about this, which was used twice in Star Wars.

398
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,160
Really?

399
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,040
And of course, the ever-present, yes!

400
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,800
And the ever-present, no!

401
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,960
And okay was in the medieval.

402
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, people did.

403
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,680
Stanky, that's you.

404
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,220
Okay, Stanky's game.

405
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,280
Now, we have to go.

406
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Oh, how to play.

407
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,100
That's the most important part.

408
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,880
Yes, we're going to find out what flows through these pipes.

409
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,220
Right.

410
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,920
All right.

411
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,600
The goal of Pipe Mania is to lay down a set of pipes that will allow the...

412
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:31,960
Flues to flow from the start piece to the end piece of each level without spilling out.

413
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm a euphemism for do.

414
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Yes, you are a euphemism for goo.

415
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,200
Oh, how do I get to my next...

416
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,700
There we go.

417
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:48,460
You can bomb a previously laid pipe segment by placing a new pipe.

418
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,640
The old pipe will explode and be replaced by a new one.

419
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,760
This takes time and incurs a score penalty.

420
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,640
Pipes filled with flues, obstacles, and fixed pipes cannot be bombed.

421
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,300
What if flues is fixed?

422
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,340
Use the...

423
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,800
Baby Bear, you should give Susie...

424
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,680
Force your microphone into Susie's face.

425
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,880
Fast flues?

426
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:21,820
Use the fast flues button to speed up the flues and end the level quickly.

427
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:28,640
While also scoring double points, which Susie is famous for.

428
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,140
Oh, boy.

429
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,180
For each pipe piece, the flues passes through.

430
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,400
While fast flues is active, no other moves can be made.

431
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,180
No wonder I've been laying so much cable since I got here.

432
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,140
You've been pulling the train for a long time here, Susie.

433
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,220
I sure have.

434
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,660
If you don't need it.

435
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,020
I have locomotives.

436
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,580
Stop.

437
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,380
Okay, the...

438
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,060
That pretty much explains the flues.

439
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,440
If you're way ahead of the flues...

440
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,920
You're in a race to beat the flues.

441
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:09,600
The goal is to lay down those pipes to allow the flues to flow and not spill out all over the place, which it will do.

442
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,260
That sounds logical on so many levels.

443
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,260
It scares me.

444
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,260
Oh, someone just had to put this together.

445
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,920
Basic pipes.

446
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh, man, this is harder than you would think.

447
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,480
He told me.

448
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,560
You should try it from my perspective.

449
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,480
Trying not to make the flues overflow out of the pipes is like a 24-7 thing.

450
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,200
I'd rather see you than be you.

451
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,120
And now they've made it into a game.

452
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,860
Yes.

453
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,620
It's not loaded yet.

454
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,460
Oh, now it's loaded.

455
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,220
Okay.

456
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Oh, that doesn't help that much.

457
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,280
You're actually going to play this...

458
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,560
Here comes the flues.

459
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:52,720
It's green.

460
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,320
And it's going to...

461
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,880
I can tell you right now that I'm about to get my ass kicked by the flues.

462
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,360
Yes.

463
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,080
The flues is...

464
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,800
Oh, now it's going to...

465
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,880
Now I know we're messed up.

466
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,840
Now you're just going to fill your pipe hole with flues.

467
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,340
Yep.

468
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,460
My pipe hole.

469
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,440
What happens if it gets up?

470
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,620
Oh, no, it's going to spill.

471
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,480
The flues is coming.

472
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,480
I ain't cleaning up after that.

473
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,120
It's all over everywhere.

474
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
By the way, be glad you're not hearing the...

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,180
The terrible, irritating MIDI music that goes with this.

476
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,640
Oh, yeah.

477
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,560
Oh, yes.

478
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,740
The leak meter filled completely.

479
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,800
We're all dead.

480
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,560
No spark.

481
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,060
Well, anyway...

482
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,960
The flues beat me.

483
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,220
You see how it's done.

484
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:36,580
Yes.

485
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,380
Whooped by the flues again.

486
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,360
And all I had to do was ooze.

487
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,260
I just sat here and oozed and won the day.

488
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,520
I bet I would be really good at that game.

489
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,980
I'm part hagfish.

490
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,960
Oh, I'm sure you can play that game.

491
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,840
I like puzzle games.

492
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:51,660
I'm a puzzle game fan.

493
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,120
Yeah, that was...

494
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,360
I figured it was a puzzle game.

495
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,320
I picked that one up.

496
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,440
If you ever played Mercury,

497
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,720
this is what you...

498
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,400
You'd slide a tray full of mercury through a maze.

499
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,240
No, did you...

500
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,040
Without spilling it.

501
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Did you get Loco Roco?

502
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,880
And you can get cancer from it.

503
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,600
What did you say?

504
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,960
So, did you get Loco Roco?

505
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,880
No.

506
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,160
It's only for the PSP.

507
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,860
It's a fun game.

508
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,940
Oh, I'll have to keep mine.

509
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,500
You're like a little ball and you use the thing to tilt the world.

510
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
You tilt the entire world.

511
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,620
You don't move yourself.

512
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,620
You just cause the entire level to tilt and that's how you move to and fro.

513
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,700
One little ball?

514
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,760
That sounds like a game to me.

515
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,460
I ain't seeing it.

516
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,280
There you go.

517
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,620
Okay.

518
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:42,060
By the way, if anyone on really bad drugs admires the video and says,

519
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,240
gosh, I want a copy of that for when I'm on even worse drugs later,

520
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,600
this is all from the collection called Dobsidilium.

521
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,840
Or Dobsidiliastes.

522
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,900
That's what it is.

523
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,000
All available.

524
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,940
Not to be confused with one of the shorts in it, which is called Dobsidiliastes.

525
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,780
Not at all confusing.

526
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,700
I say Yakutismo.

527
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,900
I say Yakutismo.

528
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,240
Let's blow the whole thing off.

529
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Is that available at the Swack Shack over there?

530
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,240
Yes.

531
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,280
Only a couple of copies left.

532
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Yes, they're running out.

533
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,120
They're running out of the pipes just like the flues.

534
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,700
Oozing.

535
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,460
Oozing.

536
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,060
You're running out of time to spend all of your money before the fifth.

537
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
After all, it's not worth anything anymore.

538
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,820
It took me a long time to find the ooze.

539
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,160
No, you don't want to be too heavy.

540
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,000
Just lean closer.

541
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll hit my tooth again.

542
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,080
There you go.

543
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,500
Now we can hear your dulcet.

544
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,380
I'm dentally shy of the mic.

545
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,340
Respecting you and your needs.

546
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
There are Democrats in the White House.

547
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,640
Where's the roll bar for this thing?

548
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,920
I need a safety device so I don't hurt myself.

549
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,620
Okay, I'm all done for.

550
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,240
Put your game away.

551
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,860
Not on the radio.

552
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,420
Not at the dinner table.

553
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:12,060
No, I try to go by the rules of good radio by which you don't watch YouTube and computer

554
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,080
pornography during your show unless you know everyone in the audience is looking at the

555
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,160
same YouTube or pornography.

556
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,180
That's a very good point.

557
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,520
Very good plan.

558
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,820
Very good provision.

559
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,300
Now, I wish that Philo and Puzzling Evidence would stick with that plan.

560
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,280
It's not I who puts those YouTubes up during shows.

561
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,280
No, but if you talk about the YouTubes, you're enabling those bad boys.

562
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,940
You just have to use your imagination.

563
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,620
How do you like it?

564
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,740
I've got it set up to where you and me are blinded by the video projector, Susie.

565
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,480
Blinded by science.

566
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:49,620
Blinded by science.

567
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,860
And there's a beautiful silhouette of my goatee and her armpit hair.

568
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
That's my back.

569
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,780
Mygoatee.com.

570
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,920
That was a great band.

571
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,140
Yeah.

572
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,820
Mygoatee.com.

573
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,000
You can lean over this way if you want.

574
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,340
Too temperamental to stay together.

575
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,000
And get out of the light.

576
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,680
Yeah, now see, if you girls could successfully learn how to share one of those pecker-shaped

577
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,940
rods there.

578
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,460
How to cooperate.

579
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,460


580
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,940
What do they have to share now?

581
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,300
That microphone, although this one would probably be okay.

582
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,100
Oh, the story of my life.

583
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,460
Don't impose your rules.

584
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,460
There we go.

585
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,300
Don't impose your rules on us.

586
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,680
Yeah, man.

587
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,200
No more rules, man.

588
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,140
Your regulations.

589
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,920
Sign, sign, everywhere a sign.

590
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,960
Questioning authority.

591
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,700
Repeat yourself.

592
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,400
Repeat yourself.

593
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:41,920
Repeat yourself.

594
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,160
And, uh.

595
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,600
Wait, I forget.

596
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,720
Are we supposed to do that or not?

597
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,720
Do what?

598
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,700
Question authority.

599
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,320
Question authority.

600
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm confused.

601
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,820
We need to ask someone.

602
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:59,040
If you don't question authority, we'll put you in the, uh, bad anti-authoritarian prison.

603
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,900
Who is an art authority?

604
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,640
We're, we are the, as Dr. Onan Kanabike put it, the church of the subgenius.

605
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,940
We're the mind your own business police.

606
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,880
We will goddamn force you to mind your own business.

607
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,300
That, uh, it's not a business.

608
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,560
It's not a choice.

609
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,680
Okay?

610
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,840
It's for your own good.

611
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,860
So roll over and take your medicine.

612
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,220
Miss Tori took her shirt off and I got distracted for a second there.

613
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,880
Well, cue to your, to your, to your.

614
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,780
But only for a second.

615
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,420
Well, now it's dragging on and on and on.

616
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,320
Put your shirt back on, hon.

617
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,320
God damn it.

618
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,640
We're trying to do a show here.

619
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,500
Yes.

620
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,660
Oh, now Pisces.

621
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,240
Going to do one thing.

622
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,280
Oh, now Pisces.

623
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


624
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


625
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


626
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


627
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


628
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


629
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


630
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


631
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


632
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,280


633
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,700
Oh, next thing they're all going to take their shirts off just to ruin the show that's already,

634
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,740
boy, I'm going to have to edit this one a lot.

635
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,800
That's the trick.

636
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,080
If you tell a woman.

637
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,160
We'll be crackling with excitement.

638
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,160
If you tell a woman to take her shirt off, she probably won't do it.

639
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,360
Right.

640
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,800
If you tell her to put her shirt on, then all of a sudden women start taking their shirts

641
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,080
off.

642
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,460
Keep your shirts on, gals.

643
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,660
What?

644
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,500
Look, Suzie the flute.

645
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,340
Now see, she knows how to be a good subgenius.

646
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,260
Don't give the church a thousand dollars.

647
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,260


648
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,260


649
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,260


650
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,260


651
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,260


652
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,240
Anyone, whatever you do, don't give us your spare money.

653
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,280
Nobody bring me a bottle of water.

654
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,740
Yeah, don't anybody help pack up the equipment when it's all over with.

655
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,860
Wait a minute.

656
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,120
We don't have to worry about that.

657
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,220
We'll just beam up anything that we don't feel that we can have reproduced perfectly

658
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
on the saucer.

659
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,380
Destroy it and get better equipment.

660
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,500
Suzie, put your titties over there next to that microphone so we can hear them.

661
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,820
No, no, no.

662
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,260
It doesn't work.

663
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,240
It doesn't work.

664
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:49,800
It doesn't count.

665
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
It's still over it like a dolly.

666
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,060
But look, Reverend Glitch has brought some water for Baby Bear.

667
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,760
Yay!

668
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,080
Yay!

669
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,140
Thank you.

670
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,660
Thank you, Glitch.

671
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:08,400
Now, Baby Bear has not yet been schooled by her elders, the rape bears.

672
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,360
The ice truck's here.

673
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,780
The ice truck's here.

674
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,400
The ice truck's here.

675
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,980
Oh, boy.

676
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,280
The Iceman's here.

677
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:14,740
The Iceman's here.

678
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,420
Oh, that's actually, that's what we're...

679
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,680
He really does that.

680
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,880
Ice all the way from the glaciers of the North.

681
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,640
Don't ask me.

682
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,060
Hello.

683
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,160
The lady over there can help you.

684
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,160
They're in charge of the ice hole.

685
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,380
The Iceman's coming.

686
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,520
You know, I just missed a great opportunity.

687
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:41,580
The Iceman cameth, and I had the chance then to pull some kind of a...like, take it down

688
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,900
to that pond, the fork in the road and tump it all right into there.

689
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,800
And if a giant tortoise-looking thing, a sea serpent monster, a big turtle, yeah, turtle,

690
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,640
it's in the water.

691
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,560
He likes turtles.

692
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,220
Snapping turtle-looking thing, rises to the surface.

693
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,480
Tortoises are land-based.

694
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,140
Go over there and pet it on the head.

695
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,740
Yeah, that's it.

696
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,200
This one has scuba devices.

697
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,840
A tortoise with scuba gear.

698
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
That's what old Sea Coy is.

699
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,440
You girls just don't talk loud enough.

700
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Tortoises are on land and turtles are in the water.

701
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,160
I can't say whatever.

702
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,840
I don't know.

703
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:14,980
I don't know.

704
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:15,880
I don't know.

705
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


706
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


707
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


708
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


709
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


710
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


711
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,880


712
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:17,880
I don't know.

713
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:17,880


714
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:17,880


715
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:17,880


716
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:17,880


717
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,800
Yes, you don't want to be the first to be serviced.

718
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
This iceman means to be serviced.

719
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,380
I can see there's ... He needs oil in his ice.

720
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,960
I can smell it.

721
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,320
Can you hear me?

722
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,840
Yeah.

723
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,600
Yeah, I can hear you fine.

724
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,300
That's all better ice than the ice that's in here.

725
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,960
However, Susie, like Philo, is refusing to cooperate.

726
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,840
You know, there've been times when I've had to like literally grab the microphone, carry

727
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,660
it across the room.

728
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,700
and shove it in Philo's fucking face

729
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,560
because he would not.

730
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,020
He just couldn't make that extra effort

731
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,300
to lean forward to where the microphone was.

732
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,860
Well, we seem to be having a diesel exhaust event here.

733
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,460
That just seems to compromise what comes out.

734
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,520
I'm picking up some nice background noises there.

735
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,460
Can you hear that?

736
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,580
I'm going to turn down the music.

737
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,500
This is good time for your sound effects record, Dr. Howell.

738
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,900
Yes, incredible.

739
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,040
We have that rumbling.

740
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,320
Life-like sounds of a giant diesel truck,

741
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,020
which we have to add in post.

742
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,120
No, I mean your thunder stick there.

743
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,940
Oh, yes, well, I can try.

744
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,480
You should demonstrate that.

745
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,540
Well, I did before,

746
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,960
but I wasn't even sure this microphone was really on.

747
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,980
That's quite an impressive tube.

748
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,420
Friends, this is the way the primitive cavemen

749
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,260
did scary narrations for science fiction movies.

750
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,300
A long time ago.

751
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,080
Man, the broadcaster.

752
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,820
Man, the tool abuser.

753
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,120
There you go.

754
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,620
Creatures.

755
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,420
Creatures that sit and wait.

756
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,580
Creatures who must kill to live.

757
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,860
Shamble and drop.

758
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,980
I'm getting my daily dose of diesel fuels.

759
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,240
All in one sitting.

760
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,060
Dr. Howell is replicating the soundtrack

761
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,440
of the classic Hammer motion,

762
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,420
one million years B.C.

763
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,000
And man,

764
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,640
superior to the creatures

765
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,600
only in his cunning.

766
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

767
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,000
So where did you get that incredible

768
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,400
piece of equipment?

769
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,820
Where did you get that incredible

770
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,240
sound effects machine?

771
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,920
They're at Guitar Center for $7.

772
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,520
What?

773
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,880
You told me some story

774
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
about Tibetan monks,

775
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,120
carving it for you

776
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,880
out of the skulls of sinners or something.

777
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,020
Well, maybe in some other life than this,

778
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,440
that could have happened,

779
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,740
but a good old cardboard tube.

780
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,520
You see, this cheap Chinese junk

781
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,440
is really ingeniously constructed

782
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,300
out of ready-made materials.

783
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,420
Yeah, make one yourself, kids.

784
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,660
Yeah, that's right.

785
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,460
Toilet paper roll and a slinky.

786
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,700
A spring.

787
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,440
To sproing in.

788
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,460
To a new life.

789
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,400
I'm distracted by it.

790
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,260
Reverend Fox left his laptop over here.

791
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,100
Laptop.

792
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,080
Look at the...

793
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh, I'm doing it.

794
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,180
I'm looking at YouTube things

795
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,040
and talking about it

796
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,940
when the audience gets it.

797
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,700
Yeah, stop doing it.

798
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,520
You were the one who was down on it.

799
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,380
Oh, they told me not to,

800
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,100
so I did it.

801
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I'm a good subgenius.

802
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,160
I get an award now.

803
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,160
All right.

804
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,820
Stop watching MTV

805
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,180
and attend to the business at hand.

806
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,700
Now, let's see.

807
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,920
That means I should start watching MTV.

808
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,940
On the bizarro subgenius world?

809
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,520
On the radar, trust me.

810
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,040
Me bizarro subgenius.

811
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,800
Me hate slack.

812
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,480
Oh, we did that one yesterday.

813
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,640
A couple of years ago,

814
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,040
we had a crew here

815
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,300
shooting this all in 3D.

816
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,060
And consequently,

817
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,520
they never finished their project.

818
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,580
Yeah, there really was a film crew here

819
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,720
making us do everything in 3D,

820
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
which was a lot of extra work.

821
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,700
I don't know if you've ever had to do that.

822
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,080
You have to go like this a lot at the camera.

823
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,400
For what purpose?

824
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,260
Why would you need it to be in 3D?

825
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,820
Who's going,

826
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,760
who's going to view it in 3D?

827
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,440
They wanted to view it in 3D,

828
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,660
but it's about the most undynamic setup

829
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,600
you can think of.

830
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,140
People sitting behind a desk and talking.

831
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,780
But nonetheless,

832
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,940
they're here with 3D and...

833
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,580
It's coming right at me,

834
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,360
out of the screen.

835
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
They're adding to our discomfort

836
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,280
in the heat immeasurably

837
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,480
by turning on their hot movie lights

838
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,300
and blasting us with them

839
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,060
just so they can get a good 3D picture

840
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,720
of us sitting here and talking.

841
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,000
Well, the main point of their project

842
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,640
was to show us being the,

843
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,820
the usual gang of idiots that we are.

844
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,860
And then it was going to be intercut

845
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,140
with famous celebrities saying things like,

846
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:20,900
well, you know,

847
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,300
the Church of the Subgenius

848
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,280
is America's secret treasure.

849
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,600
It's a...

850
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,140
But when they went to the famous celebrities...

851
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,760
They're all dead, aren't they?

852
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,200
They weren't very forthcoming.

853
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,380
Let's just put it that way.

854
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,140
Either they were dead

855
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,580
or they'd forgotten about Bob

856
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,440
or the conspiracy had said,

857
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,780
no, you're famous now.

858
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,800
You can't talk about Bob.

859
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,240
You're still around?

860
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,260
Huh?

861
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,600
I get that.

862
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,780
No, no, don't look at me when you talk.

863
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,260
They're still around?

864
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,420
You're still doing that subgenius thing?

865
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:51,880
Right, yeah.

866
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,480
To quote R. Crumb...

867
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,660
I was really into that in high school.

868
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,200
Well, now, it's so sad

869
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,300
that we still hear that.

870
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,300
And the guy saying it is 70 years old.

871
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,940
Well, the problem is

872
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,500
they're not buying their copies of Revelation X.

873
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,740
They stopped at the book of the subgenius.

874
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,620
But if you want to go farther and higher,

875
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,640
and upper and deeper in this subject,

876
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,180
you've got to get a copy of Revelation X.

877
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,500
And as I said yesterday,

878
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,660
here we can sign it for you

879
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,020
and increase its value exponentially,

880
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,740
which you can't do if you get it on Amazon

881
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,920
or in a bookstore or a swap meet

882
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,640
or something like that.

883
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
It's like they think that being weird

884
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,200
is just going to stop.

885
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,520
That's so yesterday.

886
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,340
I haven't had that happen yet.

887
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,260
Being normal is where it's at.

888
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,960
It's hip to be square.

889
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,040
Oh, yeah, now you can buy your copy

890
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,760
of Bob Leografon for like $500 on eBay now.

891
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,200
Yeah, or you could be my really good friend.

892
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Or sell it, I guess, and find somewhere to buy it.

893
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,740
Those are all staying sat on naked.

894
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,360
I still have a box of 30 of the...

895
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,640
our greatest book, the Third Testament,

896
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,700
and I've got about 30 copies

897
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,920
of the subgenius New World Order game.

898
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,340
From Steve Jackson Games.

899
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,180
Oh, yeah.

900
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,620
And I'm saving all of those

901
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,940
for the contributors for the inevitable day

902
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,160
when they call me up and go,

903
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,500
hey, I like loaned my copy out to my nephew

904
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,040
and he like went to Iraq and it's lost now.

905
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,400
So can you like, do you have any more of them

906
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,300
you can send me for like free?

907
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,520
Why, sure.

908
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,220
Why, sure.

909
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,260
Heart Ignition, sure.

910
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,500
Lemur.

911
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,660
No.

912
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,580
Sure.

913
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,640
Oh, wait, actually,

914
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,920
the game was done before those guys.

915
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,920
Is the game...

916
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,540
I don't have to worry about it.

917
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,320
People who worked on those things are dead now.

918
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,360
We're the last living elder subgeniuses,

919
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,440
Hal and Susie.

920
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,740
Is it in the style of Illuminati?

921
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,140
Huh?

922
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,920
Is it in the style of like the game Illuminati?

923
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,840
Oh, you haven't seen it?

924
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,880
Yeah, it's a spinoff

925
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,840
from the Steve Jackson Illuminati game.

926
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,200
It fits in.

927
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,680
It's like an extra pack of 100 cards.

928
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,260
Ah, I love that game.

929
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,200
And I'll tell you,

930
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,660
it was actually designed by Steve Jackson.

931
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,400
And oddly enough, in this case,

932
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,200
I handled the illustrations

933
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
because as you know,

934
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,280
I didn't know anything about games,

935
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,900
especially that kind of game.

936
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,680
And I've never played it.

937
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,620
But I always saw it as a great rolling tray

938
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:39,200
with 100 little cool art cards that came with it.

939
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,860
Steve Jackson.

940
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
I do know that the way to win it,

941
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,020
is to send $1 to the church of the subgenius in an envelope.

942
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,420
It's that way you always win.

943
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,200
But I'm surprised.

944
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,460
I'm not kidding.

945
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,480
That actually is what Steve Jackson worked it into the game

946
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,300
as the, that's like the special extra little thing

947
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,440
that is pretty much guaranteed that you win.

948
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,520
And Steve Jackson himself has sent me at least four,

949
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,100
I've gotten $4 in the mail in little envelopes,

950
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,060
$1 bills from Steve Jackson.

951
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,580
And he's the guy who always wins.

952
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
I didn't get a dollar in the mail.

953
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,240


954
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,240


955
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,240


956
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,400
I got mail from many other people.

957
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,880
So if they say they won, they were cheating.

958
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,120
Steve Jackson makes a good game,

959
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,120
but he does make games that will make you hate all of your friends.

960
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:23,980
Really?

961
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,920
How does that work?

962
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:25,240
Oh yes.

963
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,280
They will turn you against brother against brother.

964
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,080
They must be really good games.

965
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,920
It will tear you apart.

966
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,460
It will tear apart friendships and families.

967
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,260
An unusual epi phenomenon.

968
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,760
So you've never, you haven't even seen the subgenius in-world game, right?

969
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,220
I don't think so.

970
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,220
It's really rare.

971
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,220


972
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,800
It's really rare, isn't it?

973
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,200
Pity you didn't bring a copy.

974
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,100
Yeah, it is.

975
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Yeah, I don't think there's one in this campground now that I think about it.

976
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,980
Yeah, so all this talking about it is futile and sad.

977
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:58,480
No, because Reverend Michael Mirth, the stage magician who happens to live in Cleveland,

978
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,380
has the other 25 copies remaining of the game and he's selling them for $185 a piece.

979
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,000
I actually think I saw one that was more in the, more around $500 to $700.

980
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,740
Oh, wow.

981
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,160
Yeah, I wish Michael Mirth could have made it here because he's a good magician but we don't pay enough.

982
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,340
He won't take payment in slack?

983
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,760
He did once.

984
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,020
You know, setting new recording.

985
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,680
We have a side note here.

986
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:42,200
Oh, you know, that's one, it's amazing how technology has improved so much that, you know, so much better with this digital stuff than the old cassette tapes where all you had to do was push the button.

987
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,200


988
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,200
You had to push stop and flip it and it was running again in 10 seconds.

989
00:38:47,440 --> 00:39:01,760
Right now you have to finalize your 80 minute CD or your 2 gigabyte card or whatnot and sit and scratch your whatevers, all three of them.

990
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,700
Well, you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.

991
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,500
And that's when the funniest stuff happens, of course, except this time.

992
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:09,820
That's progress.

993
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,800
Most times that happens.

994
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,140
Oh, look, there's Tommy Amoeba making a, oh, we're talking about the YouTube again.

995
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,020
Damn it.

996
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,320
Tommy Amoeba will be here, folks.

997
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:21,960
Yes.

998
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,880
All right.

999
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh, we're back to rolling again.

1000
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,380
There's Dr. Dark is hobbling into the cafe.

1001
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,260
Look what he's brought.

1002
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,700
No doubt a bunch of Bull Dada auction material.

1003
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,480
Great stuff for the Bull Dada auction.

1004
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,860
You don't want to miss that historic event.

1005
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,780
I like so many things at the moment.

1006
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:48,560
And you don't want to be the one just hoping someone else will buy stuff so they'll move on to the next one.

1007
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:57,220
If you get bored with the auctioneering, the only way to stop the auctioneer from getting out of that rut is to buy it.

1008
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,260
Luckily, most of these things end up being offered for about a dollar first.

1009
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,400
Well, it depends on the level of enthusiasm.

1010
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,480
And remember, on the pleasure saucers, you will have untold wealth and riches.

1011
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:19,140
But you can get a little equity on everybody else by starting to accumulate your wealth and riches now.

1012
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,360
Right.

1013
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,800
On the saucers, money won't mean anything.

1014
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,900
Good looks won't mean anything because those will all be free.

1015
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,340
What will be important is who's got the coolest crap to show off.

1016
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:41,360
Who's got the most imaginative collection of weird stuff and who has surgically transformed themselves in the most daring way.

1017
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,320
I want all of the original Pokemon.

1018
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,960
What do you have there?

1019
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,440
I will have all living copies of them.

1020
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:46,840
Oh, look, a gift.

1021
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,460
This can either be auctioned.

1022
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,320
Mr. Sistar has brought some pulpo.

1023
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,380
Some octopus.

1024
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,800
In aceite de soja oliva.

1025
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,160
So it's octopus in olive oil.

1026
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,360
You do and you clean it up.

1027
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,160
Wild caught, not farm octopus.

1028
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,320
These fought back.

1029
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,760
These are free range octopus.

1030
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,380
These have the taste of terror and fear and anger in them.

1031
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,340
Don't you feel bad?

1032
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,400
Don't you feel bad eating octopus?

1033
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,540
I'm deaf and so is everyone else.

1034
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,260
Every tentacle a taste sensation.

1035
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,460
Um.

1036
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,560
So we're getting.

1037
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
Well, I could have lunch right here.

1038
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,520
I've got my ranch style beans, a bunch of octopus.

1039
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,940
What else do you need?

1040
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,520
Octopus and beans have enlivened many a campfire.

1041
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,480
In the UK, they consider octopuses so intelligent or octopi, octopodes.

1042
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,260
Octopuses.

1043
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,360
It's octopuses.

1044
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,100
The octopodes.

1045
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,060
It is octopuses.

1046
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,120
Although some people.

1047
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,580
Isn't it octopodes?

1048
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,620
Like octopodes, like my learned friend, Baby Bear.

1049
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,040
Well, anyway, they consider them.

1050
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,680
Octaroons.

1051
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,040
They consider them honorary invertebrates.

1052
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,840
Octaroons.

1053
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,860
I don't think they like that name.

1054
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,400
That's kind of an archaic.

1055
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,280
In the south, they call them.

1056
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,020
It's kind of a put down.

1057
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,900
We could have archaic and eat it too.

1058
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,340
That's like calling them a high slimer or something.

1059
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,020
Whatever.

1060
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,180
I think he's going to eat all of them right here.

1061
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
You were going to make them an honorary vertebrate, did you say?

1062
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,480
No, no.

1063
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:20,360
In the UK, they, so for the animal like cruelty laws, they consider octopuses, octopodes to

1064
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
be honorary vertebrates.

1065
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,160
Well, that's good because they are sensitive and shy and shouldn't be tormented the way

1066
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:27,500
they are.

1067
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,160
Do you see what happened a few years ago to Paul the octopus?

1068
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,120
No.

1069
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,600
What happened to Paul?

1070
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,400
Well, he died.

1071
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,080
Not that I know of.

1072
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,580
But before that.

1073
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Before that, this particular octopus could predict who would win in races and the direction

1074
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,460
of the stock market and so on.

1075
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,700
And a big fuss was made about him.

1076
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:53,620
Then the Islamic world began to denounce the Western devils who let this hideous octopus

1077
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,820
decide their fate for them.

1078
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,340
And the middle of it all, Paul the octopus, probed and bothered by scientists and thrill

1079
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,500
seekers just died.

1080
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,920
Because they're shy.

1081
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,200
And they don't like to be in the spotlight.

1082
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:13,000
But he had the uncanny ability to predict future events and made some people a lot of

1083
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,220
money.

1084
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,140
Please Google Paul the octopus.

1085
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,180
P-A-U-L, the octopus.

1086
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,780
As if your very life depended on it.

1087
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,300
Google Paul the octopus.

1088
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,920
No, the thing is, we say all these outlandish things.

1089
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,940
They're all checkable.

1090
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,220
Go to, look, go to the internet.

1091
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,680
You'll find they're actually there.

1092
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,200
That's the interesting thing.

1093
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,900
Or if you can't reach the internet now, make a little note.

1094
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:34,900


1095
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:34,900


1096
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,940
With a pencil.

1097
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,400
And put a piece of paper in your pocket.

1098
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,640
Look up Paul the octopus and read his sad story.

1099
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,780
You know, back in the old days, when you needed to know something, you had to look

1100
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,180
it up in an encyclopedia.

1101
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,820
And then the future came and you could Google it or Wiki it.

1102
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,520
But friends, here, we don't need all that high tech crap.

1103
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,380
All we have to do is...

1104
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Ask Dr. Howell.

1105
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,880
Why, yes.

1106
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,400
The human Wikipedia.

1107
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,760
But not today.

1108
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,460
And he's just as accurate.

1109
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,300
Tomorrow.

1110
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,280
And we'll do the Bulldada auction, the first phase of it today.

1111
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,160
But there will be an Ask Dr. Howell tomorrow.

1112
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,920
And behind the scenes of Ask Dr. Howell, there's the Ask Dr. Howell discussion groups

1113
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,220
for every Ask Dr. Howell question.

1114
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,900
And the hands-on Ask Dr. Howell healing centers and other...

1115
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,360
Well, yeah.

1116
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,100
...great aspects of our ministry.

1117
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,260
So, yeah, save up your questions and your donations, because information, contrary to

1118
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,440
popular belief, does not want to be free.

1119
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,840
I happen to know information personally, and it wants to get paid just like everybody

1120
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,400
else.

1121
00:44:53,740 --> 00:45:01,000
Well, a curious thing was recently discovered that they produce maps of Google searches

1122
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,740
to see in what areas of the country.

1123
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,800
People were trying to find things out.

1124
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:13,340
And on the East Coast and the West Coast, in the metropolitan areas, the map was black

1125
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,000
with Google searches.

1126
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,780
But in the middle of the country, few people seem to be trying to find out anything.

1127
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,840
Why is this?

1128
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,320
They're not as insecure as those big city folks.

1129
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,600
Those big city folks have to check everything and double-check.

1130
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,500
But the peaceful, rural...

1131
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,720
Hey, Chuck.

1132
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,280
...possessing, unassuming farmers are content to wallow in their own ignorance.

1133
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,560
They got the Bible on CD wrong.

1134
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:40,580
That's right.

1135
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,100
Princess Wee, could you find a little plastic fork or something so I can try some of this

1136
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,540
octopus?

1137
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,380
Stang's gonna chow down on octopus right here and now, folks.

1138
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:51,720
Eat it with your hands.

1139
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,220
And he did last year at this time.

1140
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,200
Plastic.

1141
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,780
Oh, get him a wooden fork.

1142
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,960
Live a little.

1143
00:45:59,180 --> 00:45:59,700
Splurge.

1144
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,740
When you come to a fork in the road, take it, as Yogi Berra said.

1145
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,660
The speedy Reverend Glitch was on the job.

1146
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,820
There's somebody who knows how to walk fast.

1147
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,220
He's a helpful guy.

1148
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,600
He's a guy after my own fast walking hard...

1149
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,140
Oh, and I got...

1150
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,240
Okay.

1151
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,980
Who wants a taste of pulpo?

1152
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,620
Thanks, I'll pass.

1153
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,240
I knew you'd say that.

1154
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:29,680
I'm sorry.

1155
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,660
No, you didn't know.

1156
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,120
I've eaten octopus a lot.

1157
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,440
I live in San Francisco.

1158
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,560
My friends are Chinese.

1159
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,400
You wouldn't believe what they give me for snacks.

1160
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:37,620
Octopus?

1161
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,220
Now, all sharing the sacrament of octopus.

1162
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,380
I've had octopus in sushi form.

1163
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,680
Well, if everybody's eating it, I'll eat some.

1164
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,460
Oh, here.

1165
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,860
All right, I'll try it.

1166
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,920
It actually does smell...

1167
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,240
I'll try it.

1168
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:51,660
I'll try it.

1169
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,040
I'll try it.

1170
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,820
You take a bite.

1171
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,120
I'll take a bite.

1172
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,860
It smells not good, but familiar in strange ways.

1173
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,000
The smell of an old, familiar octopus.

1174
00:46:59,200 --> 00:46:59,680
It's just a little bit of a smell.

1175
00:46:59,680 --> 00:46:59,680


1176
00:46:59,680 --> 00:46:59,680


1177
00:46:59,680 --> 00:46:59,680


1178
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,520
It's like cat food that puts up a fight.

1179
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,540
It smells like my office trash can.

1180
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,620
I'm going to put juice all over myself.

1181
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,760
Well, yeah, you got to...

1182
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,340
All over your lap.

1183
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,360
Don't tell anybody.

1184
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,060
That's going to attract the adult bears, baby bear.

1185
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,460
You'll finally get your lessons in raping.

1186
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,180
She's just a baby rape bear.

1187
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,920
They're cute when they're little.

1188
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,900
I'm going to put juice now.

1189
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,720
It's terrible.

1190
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,120
Yeah, it is terrible.

1191
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:28,420
Thank you.

1192
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,920
I kind of knew that would happen when I opened it.

1193
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,020
That's the pulpo part, isn't it?

1194
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,620
And that's why I was being so very careful.

1195
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,320
I went to X Day and all I got was octopus all over my clothes.

1196
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,020
Octopus juice.

1197
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,400
Octopus juice.

1198
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,820
Octopus flues, we call it.

1199
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,460
Can you stop the flooding, spreading flues?

1200
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,000
It's not bad.

1201
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,300
This octopus is al dente.

1202
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,820
It's rubbery, chewy.

1203
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah.

1204
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,620
Yeah.

1205
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,360
I'm going to get for trying new things.

1206
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,360
That's what happens.

1207
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,960
Okay, now I've tasted it.

1208
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,600
I don't want to try anything new because what if I didn't like it?

1209
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,200
I'm afraid of not liking things and then what would happen?

1210
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,100
If I tried something and I didn't like it?

1211
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,380
Right.

1212
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,560
You don't know.

1213
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,300
You'd never try anything again.

1214
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,660
There would be terrible consequences.

1215
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,180
What if I'm allergic?

1216
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,000
What if I died?

1217
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,240
I must remember not to breathe in anybody's face after chewing this.

1218
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,900
What if all of the above?

1219
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,600
Or be called octopus breath.

1220
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,520
What if it all happened at once?

1221
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,520
Or touch anyone?

1222
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,300
I'll draw another chunk.

1223
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,760
Alright.

1224
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,960
Sussie's no octopussy.

1225
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,920
I'm a thrill seeker.

1226
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,080
She's a thrill seeker, Seekers.

1227
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,340
Well, by consuming this octopus you will be able to be more like an octopus.

1228
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,460
I want to attain his power.

1229
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,800
Most of the ink squirting thing.

1230
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,980
Yes.

1231
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,820
When you consume the octopus you gain...

1232
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:56,880
What?

1233
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,720
his dexterity.

1234
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,360
Whistle-solving skills.

1235
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,740
If only that were possible. They can do

1236
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,900
incredible things. They can put their entire

1237
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,680
body through a tiny hole,

1238
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,280
not having any bones,

1239
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,660
and they can configure their body

1240
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,580
to any shape, having

1241
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,820
incredible power

1242
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,700
over it. That is, they can cause bumps

1243
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,860
and things to rise up out of their body.

1244
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,940
They can disguise themselves as a piece

1245
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,880
of coral, or look like a plant

1246
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,400
on the ocean floor.

1247
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,320
And they can change their color.

1248
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,920
They can imitate popular

1249
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,840
animated GIFs from

1250
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,020
4chan. In fact, most

1251
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,600
of the... Oh, you say GIFs?

1252
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,740
Yes, I say GIFs. Most of the popular

1253
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,020
personalities that you see on

1254
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,780
television are octopuses

1255
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,220
disguised effortlessly

1256
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,960
as humans. No, wait a minute.

1257
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,820
I call them GIFs. What am I saying?

1258
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,820
I don't know. You said GIF. I thought it was weird.

1259
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,820
Yeah, I usually say GIF.

1260
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,780
GIF is peanut butter. That's the way

1261
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,920
it's supposed to be, though.

1262
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,540
It's socialist propaganda.

1263
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,460
The inventor decided to

1264
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,820
wreck everybody's

1265
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,280
fantasies.

1266
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,820
Wait, how do you pronounce it, Mr. Sister?

1267
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,560
Yeah, see, that's

1268
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,420
what I say, because if you have to spell it

1269
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,400
differently to tell people how to pronounce it,

1270
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,360
it's an invented word from like

1271
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,240
30 years ago. It's GIFs. Come on.

1272
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,880
It's also proprietary.

1273
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,520
I'm solving the internet war over it right

1274
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,560
now. Thank you.

1275
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,040
They like to come out with unpronounceable

1276
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,440
words. Enough about that.

1277
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:24,500
Yes.

1278
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,020
When you devour the octopus, when you devour

1279
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
the chicken, you gain his courage.

1280
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,480
When you devour the flesh of the cow,

1281
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,200
you gain his wisdom,

1282
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,700
his craftiness.

1283
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:37,180
Yes.

1284
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,180
When you devour the pig,

1285
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,180
you gain his

1286
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,180
his

1287
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,760
boundless, what?

1288
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,320
Omnivory. Yes.

1289
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,220
Monogamy. Is that why I'm so

1290
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,960
mixed up?

1291
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,100
Well, that's one reason.

1292
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,680
Pigs and humans are

1293
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,000
disturbingly similar in many

1294
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,060
anatomical peculiarities,

1295
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,360
and this has never been explained.

1296
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,560
And embryologists dissect

1297
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,120
fetal pigs to come as

1298
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,340
close as possible to the human embryo.

1299
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,000
There are many similarities that

1300
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,040
the suedi, the swine,

1301
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,960
have with the humans that

1302
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,900
apes and monkeys do not have.

1303
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,940
And this has never been

1304
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,140
satisfactorily explained. Really? I didn't know

1305
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,460
that. Oh, it is so.

1306
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,040
Huh. Well, doesn't

1307
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,420
Mr. Sister have part of a

1308
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,360
pig's spine in his neck or something like that?

1309
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh, I wasn't making a personal remark.

1310
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,360
I didn't know about that. No, I mean, didn't they

1311
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,080
implant...

1312
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,680
Oh, it was a

1313
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,100
a policeman.

1314
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,900
I misunderstood what you meant.

1315
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,440
He got it from a dead human. It was dug up by a

1316
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,540
cadaver dog. No, I'm

1317
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,940
just kidding.

1318
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,180
Okay, well. But I am smelling

1319
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,380
something. Oh, there's a barbecue

1320
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,280
over there? When you devour the

1321
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,180
soybean, you gain its

1322
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,040
courage.

1323
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,440
Its mobility.

1324
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,000
Its fart?

1325
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,040
Its responsivity to the sun.

1326
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,200
When you devour the ranch-style

1327
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,420
bean, you gain its coolness.

1328
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,260
Which,

1329
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,460
they're not cool to most people, but...

1330
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,340
Pythagoras thought beans

1331
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,140
were sacred.

1332
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,940
Huh? Pythagoras

1333
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,300
thought beans were sacred.

1334
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,220
And the cult of

1335
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,120
worshipping the bean came

1336
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,540
from the Pythagoreans.

1337
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,460
In ancient Athens.

1338
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:28,200
Gee, well, I guess those old ancient Greeks

1339
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,380
must have known everything. Yeah, they sure

1340
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,000
knew their onions. Sure were smart to

1341
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,980
worship a bunch of beans.

1342
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:35,980
Praise God.

1343
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,200
At least we've got our priorities

1344
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,700
straight.

1345
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,160
How can they worship

1346
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,000
a legume when

1347
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,840
there's perfectly good clip art?

1348
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,180
Well, there wasn't so much clip art

1349
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,120
in ancient Greece.

1350
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,960
And also, they had a great respect for

1351
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,400
mathematics, especially Pythagoras'

1352
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,220
Pythagoras, I mean,

1353
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,680
the original bean counter.

1354
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,280
Oh, is that where they get that?

1355
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,200
Okay. It's all true. I mean,

1356
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,820
really, they...

1357
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,060
I don't know why, but bean was

1358
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,060
an important object in their

1359
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:08,800
devotions.

1360
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,120
Save all bean-related questions

1361
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,720
for Ask Dr. Howell tomorrow.

1362
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,180
And we know that certain beans, when dropped in the

1363
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,220
ground, instantly cause an enormous

1364
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,080
beanstalk to grow

1365
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,220
up to the sky, where

1366
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,140
giants can be

1367
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,520
be found.

1368
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,200
Yeah, it's been hard for us to shake

1369
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,440
that crappy

1370
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,200
Hollywood movie, Jack the Giant Slayer,

1371
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,480
from our head. We saw it, yeah.

1372
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:35,440
You mean that movie wasn't true?

1373
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,040
Well, it had

1374
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,040
giants in it. It had giants. That's all

1375
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,060
you need. I know

1376
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,140
I said this yesterday, but in that

1377
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,440
movie, some

1378
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,260
maladroit giant accidentally dropped

1379
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,020
a magic bean when they were already

1380
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,020
up in giant land, and a huge

1381
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,840
beanstalk started to grow up there.

1382
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,700
So I was wondering, would that

1383
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,080
beanstalk carry a giant

1384
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,900
up to an even higher giant

1385
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,080
land, containing even bigger giants

1386
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,100
that would dwarf the giants

1387
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,080
in giant land?

1388
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,980
Or Gantua, as

1389
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,580
it was known.

1390
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,900
But we'll never know, because

1391
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,620
the giants

1392
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,060
grabbed the beanstalks and bent them

1393
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,000
down toward the earth, so they could

1394
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,660
ride down and invade.

1395
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,280
Sooner or later, the weight of the giants

1396
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,800
is going to collapse a whole skin.

1397
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,700
According to the movie,

1398
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,600
somewhere out there is

1399
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,780
one last bean.

1400
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,960
One last bean that could

1401
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,200
get us to giant land.

1402
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,240
Or, contrary-wise,

1403
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,800
could get the giants down

1404
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,940
to here. But we don't need

1405
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,960
to worry, because the same movie also

1406
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,620
explains that the British

1407
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,800
crown, the property of the current

1408
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,620
monarch, Queen Elizabeth II,

1409
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,940
actually is the ancient crown

1410
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,000
that can control all the giants.

1411
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,860
It was simply refurbished and had

1412
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,920
the kings added to it through the years,

1413
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,340
and it now resides in the

1414
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,220
Tower of London, where it's on display.

1415
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,360
Well, that's convenient.

1416
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,980
Just don't let the lions get you.

1417
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,420
They still do have lions in the Tower of London,

1418
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,580
don't they? Or do they?

1419
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,700
They have ravens.

1420
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,700
Maybe they took them out since my time.

1421
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,540
They used to have lions.

1422
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:14,860
They used to have lions.

1423
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,680
They did.

1424
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,300
Susie, you're lying down on the job as long as

1425
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,900
you're not yelling into that microphone.

1426
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,120
I'm sorry. She doesn't have anything to say.

1427
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,940
I don't have anything to say.

1428
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,720
I'm so sorry.

1429
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,140
No, um...

1430
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,100
Ugh.

1431
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,780
No groaning in exasperation,

1432
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,120
Stag. You must make the best

1433
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,000
of it, certainly.

1434
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,560
I'm sure that there's a lot to

1435
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,580
relate.

1436
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:43,600
Pope Robert Anton Wilson was the most

1437
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,680
microphone-unfriendly

1438
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,040
guy I ever had to mic.

1439
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,560
Not a Gabby sort.

1440
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,420
Well, oh yeah, I was very Gabby,

1441
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,120
but you'd put the mic in the

1442
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,860
normal place and he'd lean

1443
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:58,000
back and talk

1444
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,920
like you did.

1445
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,140
Louder and funnier.

1446
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,180
Back and back and back.

1447
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,940
You'd move the mic up to him like that

1448
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,980
and he'd start talking again and back and back.

1449
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,980
Sounds like Philo.

1450
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,680
Yes, exactly.

1451
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,520
And, um, we

1452
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,660
who have to adjust

1453
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,880
the volumes on these things,

1454
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,880
let me tell you we don't

1455
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,560
appreciate that because

1456
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,860
it makes our mouse wrist

1457
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:24,680
hurt.

1458
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,240
With every selection

1459
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,960
of the mumbler.

1460
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,140
High volume, low quality.

1461
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,040
And, uh, on the other hand, if this Radio Shack

1462
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,880
mixer had one other mic input

1463
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,420
or if there was another little pre-mixer

1464
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,620
then we'd all be...

1465
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,760
We'd be able to clip a mic to

1466
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,180
Susie's cheek

1467
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,460
pointing into her lips.

1468
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,800
I know you want to do that.

1469
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,420
Hear her muttering and mumbling.

1470
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,360
Well, she says a lot of really funny stuff.

1471
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,580
With her face pointed at me.

1472
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,080
But you have to be there.

1473
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,820
Right, you have to be here right in front of the camera.

1474
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,060
You're funny looking. I can't help but respond to it.

1475
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,780
If you had a mic sticking out of your face

1476
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,180
maybe you'd get some gem-like

1477
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,120
wisdom from me.

1478
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,920
You just have to ignore it.

1479
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,420
Ignore that the mic is there to see.

1480
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,400
It's like your nose which you don't

1481
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,440
normally see unless you've tried.

1482
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,140
No, the mic is your friend.

1483
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,680
Your microphone is your friend.

1484
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,080
This is my mic.

1485
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,320
This is...

1486
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,740
This is my microphone. This is my gun.

1487
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,320
This one's for talking, the other's for fun.

1488
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,480
This is my microphone.

1489
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,780
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

1490
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,460
I will use my microphone to be heard.

1491
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,320
I will.

1492
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,960
I will be heard loudly.

1493
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,520
My microphone will carry my voice.

1494
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,220
My every word is

1495
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,340
a turd to be heard.

1496
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,300
There you go.

1497
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,840
Baby bear, I see

1498
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,700
you don't have your carpal tunnel

1499
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,880
bandage on, so it got better?

1500
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,960
Well, when I'm not

1501
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,000
actually at work and having

1502
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,700
to move a mouse around, plus

1503
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,740
Susie gave me these strange

1504
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,060
eyeballs. She gave you wonderful

1505
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,440
eyeball bracelets

1506
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,180
that look back at you when you look at it.

1507
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,120
Plus it's placebo, so

1508
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,280
because I think they work, they'll work.

1509
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,440
I just have to keep believing it.

1510
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,820
Yeah, they have magic.

1511
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,980
Brass and other metals can

1512
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,640
ease your

1513
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,020
rheumatism.

1514
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:20,820
Did you

1515
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,540
consult Mr.

1516
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,020
about the carpal tunnel issues

1517
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,880
as you were planning to? Yes, I did.

1518
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,840
He's very knowledgeable. He was helpful.

1519
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,820
Did he operate on your wrist and

1520
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,680
sew the

1521
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,420
tendons together and

1522
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,900
implant some artificial? No, I wish because I would

1523
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,920
love for it to be fixed, but as long as I don't

1524
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,760
use it or do anything strenuous,

1525
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,080
it's okay. Well, don't get anywhere near

1526
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,580
a mouse during this trip.

1527
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,880
I thought her carpal tunnel

1528
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,000
was all bare somehow. Eek!

1529
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,900
A mouse! Has

1530
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,120
anyone manufactured a computer

1531
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,600
mouse known as

1532
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,820
the Eek?

1533
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,420
Because that would be cute.

1534
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,840
Eek! A mouse! Another million dollar

1535
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,580
idea and it's all yours, Stan.

1536
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,320
Twenty percent off at Walgreens

1537
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,760
this week only. Just remember me

1538
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,160
when you're wallowing in your wealth.

1539
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,940
You've been listening

1540
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,840
to the subgenius

Praise Bob!

1556
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,580
Friends,

1557
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,040
we're glad you listened to this show

1558
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,080
and we're even more glad that some

1559
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,220
listeners have donated enough to help us

1560
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,120
keep on going for another couple of months.

1561
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,180
Not just this show,

1562
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,860
but subgenius.com

1563
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,380
and all the other archive sites.

1564
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,060
But if you truly

1565
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,100
love Bob and want some of that

1566
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,500
slack back to rebound

1567
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,840
to you, you should go to

1568
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,300
subgenius.com

1569
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,900
front page or especially the radio page

1570
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,940
or the catalog store pages

1571
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,680
and help out

1572
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,300
financially as best you can.

1573
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,080
Now, we know what it's like to be

1574
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,660
on the brink of total poverty

1575
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:24,020
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their

1576
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,300
own situations worse.

1577
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,280
But some of you still have jobs.

1578
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,240
Even five bucks

1579
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,600
makes a big difference

1580
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,580
even if it's only once a month

1581
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,140
from enough of you.

1582
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,500
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1583
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,280
All we're saying

1584
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:40,880
is that

1585
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,260
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1586
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,040
if you don't pay dogs.

1587
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,300
We also take

1588
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,920
checks and money orders to

Thanks for

1597
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,680
anything you can do to help

1598
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,480
let there be slack.
