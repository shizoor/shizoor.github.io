1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:01,640
.

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,860
Cut me some slack.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:18,360
Slack?

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,980
Didn't you say slack?

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,520
Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,500
Captain, sit.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,000
It's safe.

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,180
You want to talk about slack?

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,340
Push harder.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,420
You have to.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,480
Do not give up.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,600
Do not give up.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,700
Do not stop.

14
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,380
Don't quit.

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,060
I don't care.

16
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,440
It's just pain.

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,580
Suffer.

18
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,060
Dig.

19
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,380
In your soul.

20
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,700
Dig and push.

21
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:37,580
Now.

22
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,240
Now.

23
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,040
Now.

24
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,660
Now.

25
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,420
Now.

26
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,040
Now.

27
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,400
Now.

28
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,660
Now.

29
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:41,780
Now.

30
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,500
Bob was a boxer, a hoofer, a vaudeville performer, and a Broadway headliner.

31
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,140
Before his work in radio.

32
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm Bobby.

33
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm Bobby.

34
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,260
I know.

35
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,040
I know.

36
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,600
Bobby.

37
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,080
Bobby.

38
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,560
Bobby.

39
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,180
I know.

40
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,900
I know.

41
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:55,900


42
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,460
I know.

43
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:57,460


44
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,260
Yeah.

45
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,740
Can you take a one-up second?

46
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,960
Already there.

47
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,180
So many things going on there.

48
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,220
Bob did the right thing.

49
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,100
He folds and puckers and oozies.

50
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,680
Oh, what's going on?

51
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,160
They've recently had babies.

52
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,740
Now Bob's a fine family man.

53
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,020
Every, you know, in and out.

54
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,100
So they're a little, yes.

55
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,380
Yes.

56
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,460


57
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,580
A little stretched at the moment, darlings, aren't you?

58
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,260
Yeah.

59
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,460
Yeah.

60
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,940
A little slack.

61
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,660
Mm-hmm.

62
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,880
Take your family out.

63
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


64
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


65
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


66
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


67
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


68
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


69
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:25,880


70
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,240
You know I will, Bob.

71
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,940
Oh my goodness.

72
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,680
And.

73
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,420
Ooh.

74
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:29,960
Yeah.

75
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,480
Just take a break like that.

76
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,560
Oh, it's like a.

77
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,300
That's, you can tell.

78
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:32,920
Like a milk jelly.

79
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,440
This is ready.

80
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,740
To be with my boyfriend, Bob, again, my heart like skipped a beat when I saw him.

81
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,480
Like really, truly.

82
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
I love him so much.

83
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,200
We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house proving that the people inside

84
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,060
are not cultists after all.

85
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,700
Uh-oh.

86
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,040
Uh, attention everyone.

87
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,660
This has only been.

88
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,860
The Self Genius Hour on the Web.

89
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:55,860


90
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,280
We're getting classy.

91
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,640
We're getting classy.

92
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,760
I love the classy subgeniuses because they offset the me.

93
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,780
So you've got a poem to read or recite?

94
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,200
All right.

95
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,280
This is a poem that I wrote about my experience at X Day last year.

96
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,700
I'll do my best.

97
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,600
I'll do my best to recite it from memory.

98
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:29,740
No.

99
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,180
You're just going to have to listen harder.

100
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,180
The subgenii all went to brush wood.

101
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,320
And we smoked all the frop that we could.

102
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,920
We chugged wine and beer hoping this was the year that Bob and the Xists made good.

103
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,000
We drank away all of our cares.

104
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,900
We sat round fires and folding chairs.

105
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,060
We awaited escape.

106
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,420
But instead we got rape.

107
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,500
And rape and rape from dogs and bears.

108
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,240
Now down in the cool brushwood glades.

109
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,980
From our asses hot semen cascades.

110
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
Rescue we expected.

111
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,000
But instead got infected with herpes and dog and bear AIDS.

112
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,420
Sold out again by J.R. Dobbs.

113
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
July 5th morn rang with our sobs.

114
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Stang laughed and smirked and said,

115
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,820
That's it jerks.

116
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,260
Now go back to your worthless pink jobs.

117
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,280
So we packed up our liquor and drums.

118
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,180
Heads hung somber and glum.

119
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,360
Smoked the last of the dope with a glimmer of hope.

120
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,060
Next year Bob surely will come.

121
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,500
I don't know if anybody knows it but there's like a bonfire down there across from Caffeina's.

122
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,660
This whole time that we've been doing this there's been a little bonfire just for us.

123
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,060
They're going to make one every night.

124
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,640
Wisteria, I wasn't expecting it but Wisteria's going to make this little community bonfire.

125
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Yeah, praise Wisteria.

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,180
Praise Wisteria.

127
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,480
I can do a little tiny rant about Wisteria.

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,880
Wisteria, this land that we're on right now used to be a strip mine.

129
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,620
A totally raped and raped and raped and raped.

130
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,860
A great strip mine for more than seven years.

131
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,660
More than seven years.

132
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,560
And the state of Ohio put a million dollars into making this land into this beautiful land that we're getting to be in now.

133
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,480
So we really can't even express how amazing it is to be here and experiencing it.

134
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,720
Especially with such a warm and welcoming crew of folks.

135
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,220
That greet us here.

136
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,960
Make us feel so welcome.

137
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,000
So I'm just so happy to be here.

138
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,920
I know everyone else is too.

139
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,840
Yay!

140
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,560
I think it's the best day, X day ever.

141
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,660
And I'm actually going to do a public announcement for Elliot.

142
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,920
He's running our sound.

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,060
Yes!

144
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,920
Back there, that guy.

145
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,420
Thank that guy back there.

146
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,300
Elliot, praise the sound guy.

147
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,400
Praise!

148
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,240
Without him, we wouldn't be able to have sound this good.

149
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,980
Did you hear that echo?

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,440
Echo!

151
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,200
That's right.

152
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,820
Echo, echo, echo, echo.

153
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,060
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a track next from our new album, All Rights Reserved.

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,540
And this is with Jonathan Colton on vocals.

155
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,180
And it's called Pwn Monkey.

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,580
Jonathan Colton's the only one that gave us permission to use his vocals.

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,220
Yeah, this will be the only one we can use.

158
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,220


159
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,340
Actually got permission to do something with.

160
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,940
Well, granted, we didn't get permission from the other 36 songs that we sampled for this under three minute song.

161
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,420
But, you know, that's just how it goes, right?

162
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,320
It's Pwn Monkey, people.

163
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah!

164
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
All right!

165
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,500
Yeah!

166
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,440
Yeah!

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,620

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,040
Boring manager Rob.

173
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,760
Rob say code monkey very diligent, but his output stink.

174
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,180
His code not functional or elegant.

175
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,780
What do code monkey think?

176
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,540
Code monkey think maybe manager wanna write goddamn login page himself.

177
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,940
Code monkey not say it out loud.

178
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,320
Code monkey not crazy, just proud.

179
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,020
Code monkey like Speedos.

180
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,980
Code monkey like tap Mountain Dew.

181
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,060
Code monkey very simple man.

Bring your cup or ring your lights.

189
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,200
You say no thank you for the soda,

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,840
cause soda make you fat.

191
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,780
Any way you're busy with the telephone, no time for chat

192
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,560
Code Monkey have long walked back to Cusico

193
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,700
Sit down, pretend to work

194
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,100
Code Monkey not thinking, so straight

195
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,540
Code Monkey not feeling, so great

196
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,000
Code Monkey like Beatles

197
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,260
Code Monkey like Tad and Mountain Dew

198
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,320
Code Monkey very simple man

199
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,800
Big, warm, fuzzy, secret heart

200
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,940
Code Monkey like you

201
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,980
Code Monkey like you

202
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,160
A lot

203
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,080
Basically, this is called Code Monkey

204
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
Or rather, Cone Monkey

This song and all the other songs on it

Have a contest

211
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,100
A commentary track

212
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,640
How many albums have you had before with a commentary track?

213
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,100
For the whole album?

214
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,440
We've got it

215
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,820

And you can find out all the stories behind this

217
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,160
And so many more

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,100
And we have CDs available

219
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,160

Or tomorrow at the Roach

221
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,840
Code Monkey have every reason

222
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,560
To get out this place

223
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,640
Code Monkey just keep on working

224
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,540
See your soft pretty face

225
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,640
But Shroud away

226
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,840
Got to eat a coffee cake

227
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,220
Take bath, take nap

228
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,540
This job fulfilling

229
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,720
Your creative way

230
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,040
Such a load of crap

231
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Code Monkey thinks someday

232
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,840
He have everything

233
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,960
Even pretty girl like you

234
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,380
Code Monkey just waiting

235
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,260
For now

236
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,920
Code Monkey says someday

237
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,560
Somehow

238
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
Code Monkey like Fritos

239
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,320
Code Monkey like Tad and Mountain Dew

240
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Code Monkey very simple man

241
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,760
Big, warm, fuzzy, secret heart

242
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,880
Code Monkey like you

243
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,860
Code Monkey likes you

244
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,740
Code Monkey likes you

245
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,020
Code Monkey likes you

246
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,540
Code Monkey likes you

247
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,620
Code Monkey likes you

248
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,180
Code Monkey likes you

249
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,260
Yes dear friends

250
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,660
And welcome to Hour of Slack number

251
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,400
1,320

252
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,560
And that was

253
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,960
Evolution Control Committee

254
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,580
Recorded live at

255
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,780
X-Day Drill number 14

256
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,020
Before that we heard

257
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,620
Princess Tadeo

258
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:21,180
We Are Doe, talking about Wisteria, the history of it, the site, the incredible, really, it turned everything, went great.

259
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,220
And before that, the poem, sorry I had to cut that for the broadcast radio audience,

260
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:44,260
the poem was by Hazel of the Windmills, Reverend Hazel, who also is playing sitar in the background on our main background music that we'll be using tonight.

261
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,380
Boy, I can't wait to witness her new sitar next year. It's fabulously amazing.

262
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,980
Yeah, well, I don't know if you knew this.

263
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,200
Some people who are familiar with X-Day and Star Trek...

264
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,880
Ken driving up the road that evening, that was the first night, Wednesday, and everyone, wait a minute, something's wrong.

265
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,360
It was supposed to be X-Day. This doesn't sound like X-Day.

266
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,680
It was Potter and Settle.

267
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,180
Oh, yeah, Potter and Settle and Petal.

268
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,360
And, of course, we also have with us Dr. Dave.

269
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:26,940
Dr. Do-Nothing, a coat monkey that's so blue, his rectum is fried and ready for you.

270
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,060
So here we go.

271
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,120
Let's not...

272
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,300
Stop.

273
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,780
I'm removing part of my forehead now. You want to watch?

274
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,780
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,540
I was inspired by the poetry.

276
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,100
What? Your forehead popped?

277
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,180
I didn't know you could even hear the show from Ashtabula.

278
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,220
Yeah, I didn't either.

279
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:55,160
If you go to WCSB radio.org and you play Listen, you can do that, but it's out of sync if you want to call somebody and hear yourself a half an hour later.

280
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:55,620
Right.

281
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,200
That's one reason we don't take calls, because I don't like having...

282
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,740
I don't like having to explain that over and over again.

283
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,260
Oh, man.

284
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,940
And to so many people, too, after you just explained it to three blithering idiots in a row.

285
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,320
And then you have to go once again and say, okay, this is how it works. There's a delay on this.

286
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,320
Well, we had a whole festival of blithering idiots.

287
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,980
Actually, this is the first time we've been in the studio since we left for X-Day in Starwood.

288
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,120
How was your X-Day, Dave?

289
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,560
It was not as planned as usual.

290
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,040
Back when we were...

291
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,180
Well, it was...

292
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,200
Back when we were...

293
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,200


294
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,100
Everybody kept saying they'd see you drive by.

295
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,540
And I'd go, well, where's Dave?

296
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,180
And they'd go, I think he just ran into town for something.

297
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,740
He drove by with an anxious look on his face.

298
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,160
Yeah.

299
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,360
And looking for a place to go to the bathroom.

300
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,440
But...

301
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,360
Oh, there were plenty of those.

302
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,720
We called them sweat lodges.

303
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,140
Did you actually have sweat lodges?

304
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,880
Yes. They were also doubled as porta-potties.

305
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,640
Ah.

306
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,360
And...

307
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,860
And then the...

308
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,260
Yeah, you just sat in there and sweat.

309
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,740
And then the sun...the sun...what do you call it?

310
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,860
When they put the things in your breasts and...the bone in your breasts...

311
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh, yeah, like the Sundance. It was like a Lakota Sundance.

312
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,440
Yes.

313
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,120
And you're receiving illumination over the John, which is where it should be.

314
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,580
Believe it or not...

315
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,480
That's real extra meditation right there, boy.

316
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,360
I...I know. I had to deliver a buffalo skull to an authentic Lakota Sundance.

317
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,480
I remember I had to deliver a buffalo skull to an authentic Lakota Sundance in Rosebud one time.

318
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,340
But I...I didn't...they asked me to film the Sundance.

319
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,480
And at the last minute, I decided that I would have my assistant, who was a tribe member, do it instead.

320
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,460
Because I wasn't part of that religion.

321
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,660
And I felt like I was just being a washi-chu poking his nose in.

322
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,220
Well...

323
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,820
Well, unlike the...we had...there was a whole camera crew at X Day shooting in 3D.

324
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,260
The producer was a subgenius who had been to X Day before, Reverend Edmund.

325
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,500
I remembered him from the first time he came two years ago.

326
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:20,440
And the director, Paul Yates, has a long history of punk documentaries.

327
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,080
Anyway, they're trying to make a movie.

328
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:31,540
About...not about X Day, but about how influential the church has been over the last 31 years since pamphlet number one was published.

329
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,820
And there'll be more about that on subgenius.com eventually.

330
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,460
I can't wait to see the baptism in 3D.

331
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Even though they shot it mostly from behind, you'll still get the sort of...a lot of rounded shapes.

332
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,020
You know how Reverend Stang loves it.

333
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,060
Yeah.

334
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,940
He loves those rounded shapes.

335
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,540
Yes.

336
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,620
In some places they're referred to as humvees.

337
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,720
Well, they're still rounded.

338
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,060
Humvees.

339
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,340
You know, back at the old place, the baptism was held in a swimming pool.

340
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,300
But at Wisteria, you have a swimming hole.

341
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,360
An actual pond, a natural pond, although they...it's filtered water somehow.

342
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,140
But not a cement pond.

343
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,460
It ain't no cement pond.

344
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:21,740
It's a real live pond.

345
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,520
It's a real live pond.

346
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:30,740
It's a real live pond with frogs and little alligators and an ancient, gigantic, ageless snapping turtle called Old Sequa.

347
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,320
Even the Indians knew of him.

348
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,140
And no one's ever been able to catch him.

349
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,860
We talked about him a lot.

350
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,460
But I was amazed.

351
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,020
People got in the water.

352
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,680
We had a great turnout.

353
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,280
And even at the baptism.

354
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,440
Even with the 3D cameras pointing at everybody.

355
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,020
Mm-hmm.

356
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:50,900
And...

357
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,620
How many head would you say did you rearrange?

358
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,140
Say what?

359
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,780
How many head did you barbecue or rearrange this year?

360
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,400
As you like to...

361
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,480
How many head?

362
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,040
...final your words.

363
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,700
How many head of what?

364
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,840
Your attendees, your...your...your latents of genii.

365
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,860
An even hundred, Dave.

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,220
An even hundred.

367
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,080
Well, that's the...yeah, that was the paying ones.

368
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,260
That didn't include the elders that...see, you wouldn't have been included in that number.

369
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,920
The sickies, the elders, and the superstars, and the groupies aren't included in that...that

370
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,360
number.

371
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:33,080
So we probably had exactly 112, I would say, would be my...my closest guess.

372
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,600
Well, that's a firmly...a dense, firmly packed pack, and capable of causing some nuisance.

373
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,080
And I'm still editing all the recordings.

374
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,260
We got two recordings from different ways of everything.

375
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,240
Including the baptism.

376
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,520
I was just talking about the pond.

377
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:53,420
Don't you want to hear the...just about a...see, about two minutes.

378
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,160
This is Susie the floozy getting baptized by myself and Dr. Howell.

379
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,000
Now, you have to imagine a...a...a country swimming hole with a lot of frog watchers

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,640
standing around.

381
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,920
But also, there's already a lot of young men and a few young women in the...in the pond

382
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,260
when this sequence here takes place here.

383
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:14,740
We'll pull the...

384
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,880
And Sequa is watching.

385
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,160
Right.

386
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,980
And there's a lot of real frogs.

387
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, now listen, don't...don't interrupt, because you want to hear every splash, because

388
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,820
they represent...Susie was wearing this incredible shroud.

389
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,600
It was like a wet shroud contest.

390
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,560
It was pristine.

391
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,980
And she looked so good.

392
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,540
There's pictures on subgenius.com, but here, listen to this.

393
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,060
Oh, yes!

394
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,240
All right!

395
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,780
Who is next?

396
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,800
Look, if we get...moves will take moves.

397
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,560
Keep going.

398
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,520
It looks like we're getting wet.

399
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,020
It's got to be kind of evened out.

400
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,780
I'm here for the wet shroud contest.

401
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,500
Just like something out of Brother Where Art Thou.

402
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,820
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

403
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,480
This is where we...I hear the hymns in my head.

404
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,780
Reverend Susie the floozy.

405
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,900
A real shroud in the church garden.

406
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,480
Damn!

407
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,560
He can do it too.

408
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,300
First, it was worth coming to Ex Day, wasn't it?

409
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Reverend Susie the floozy, you've been in the church since 1981, when it only cost $10

410
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,220
to join.

411
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,140
30 fucking years.

412
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,900
And you have built such a crust of sin upon you that it's hard to imagine it being possible

413
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,920
to wipe it away.

414
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,180
Chiseled, maybe.

415
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,160
And yet, and yet, in these holy waters, made holy, by the way, by the word, Bob, and the

416
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,960
P of Connie.

417
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,320
I can be cleansed?

418
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,260
That's the warm part you feel.

419
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,780
It's not me.

420
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,240
Are you telling me I can be cleansed?

421
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,060
You can...no, you can be encrusted further.

422
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:50,440
I can be made whole?

423
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:57,120
You can be given an even thicker crust, a shell of pure, pure sin.

424
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,120
Kevlar sin.

425
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,880
But only if you reject all aspects of the conspiracy from your life, and your heart,

426
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,460
and the other, the down there...

427
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:08,980
You're whole.

428
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,000
Those sort of things.

429
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


430
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


431
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


432
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


433
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


434
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


435
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


436
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


437
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


438
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


439
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


440
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


441
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


442
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,140


443
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:20,620
And, and, and, except into them, the mighty rod of strength, and the, the, the steely, burning,

444
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,040
hot love of J.R. Bob Godds.

445
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,980
Praise his name.

446
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,120
Fuck you!

447
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,520
All right!

448
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm saved!

449
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,680
I am saved!

450
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,760
She is saved, and I am saved.

451
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,960
By God, look at that stuff.

452
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,700
I'm saved!

453
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,120
I am saved!

454
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


455
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


456
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


457
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


458
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


459
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


460
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


461
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


462
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


463
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,120


464
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,180
She knows how to do it.

465
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,420
Well, by now you must have gotten some idea how this works.

466
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,200
So come one, come all.

467
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,540
We've got a lot to...

468
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,520
It sounds very holy.

469
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,640
I mean, it does sound very holy, if not sacred or even.

470
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,760
And I can see two white buns emerging from the water, and red hair on the other side

471
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,060
of it.

472
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,140
So I guess as a visual image, there's some things, though, that you aren't mentioning,

473
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,560
aren't there?

474
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,200
I mean...

475
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,300
Uh, say what?

476
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
Lots of big, soft rounds of water.

477
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


478
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


479
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


480
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


481
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


482
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


483
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


484
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


485
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


486
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,120


487
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,440
Lots of things.

488
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,140
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

489
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:12,620
Yeah.

490
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,520
In fact, there were...

491
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:13,980
God...

492
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,540
Yeah.

493
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,620
Yeah.

494
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,840
There was some that were a little bit too young and soft and round, and we later learned

495
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,120
this pagan girl jumped in.

496
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,100
She wanted to be baptized.

497
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,380
She wasn't a dues-paying subgenius, but we weren't going to turn her down because she

498
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,500
was completely naked and incredibly beautiful.

499
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,780
And then we later found out that publishing photographs of her would probably be illegal

500
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,100
because she was a lot younger than she...

501
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,440
And that's the way it always goes.

502
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:43,940
A lot younger.

503
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,180
The train comes in a lot quicker than the passengers, you know what I mean?

504
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,460
Next thing you know, you've got your picketins, your iron feds, your policemen, your people

505
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,540
with the strange masks that come down and stuff, and look like there are toothpicks

506
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,500
there or something like that.

507
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,040
At least that's something I don't have to worry about.

508
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,520
If they came right in my office looking for child porno, they'd...

509
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,060
After three years of...

510
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,360
After three years of searching all those hard drives and CDs, they'd end up going,

511
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,940
I'm not this pervert.

512
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,640
We can't find anybody under 45.

513
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,100
Yes, but within the...

514
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,660
He's in his own ageist.

515
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:28,400
But within the current conspiracy scenario, the way it is, you must admit that they would

516
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,840
find pictures of you and your children perhaps playing with Mr. Froggy or doing some of the

517
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,400
strange...

518
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,660
Oh, yeah, yeah.

519
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,820
They'll arrest you for pictures of your kids in the bathtub.

520
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,500
And I'll be...

521
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,160
I don't have any.

522
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Listen to Pisces in the background chanting.

523
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,140
Or it might be Princess Wee.

524
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,460
No, Princess...

525
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,360
I think that's Pisces.

526
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,240
That's Reverend Stick on the bongos.

527
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,140
And I think it's that...

528
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,240
I thought it was Mickey Mephistopheles or Phaeton on the drums.

529
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,980
Who's doing that delightful Hindu jam in the background?

530
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,760
That's Reverend Hazel of the windmills playing sitar, which was new to X-Day.

531
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,160
Oh, man.

532
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,820
That was, you know, that's nice.

533
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,320
We had some...

534
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,580
I know.

535
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,500
That's why I say people didn't think it was X-Day.

536
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,300
They went, what's...

537
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,200
This is all wrong.

538
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,400
The music's pretty.

539
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
The star would start early.

540
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,600
But Bob still didn't come.

541
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,800
No X's.

542
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,460
Well...

543
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,420
No end of the world.

544
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,320
We don't know whether Bob was there or not.

545
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,020
Apparently, he's still trying to tell us something.

546
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,740
Drive into town to get vegetables, yeah.

547
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,140
But it was a good X-Day.

548
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,140


549
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,920
You know, I was getting so bored with the way things were going.

550
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,800
We had had 15 of them out there at the old place.

551
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,180
And sure enough, we still had some of the traditional features like Dr. Dark's drive-in

552
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,020
and the pancake orgy.

553
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,640
But we had new ones, like the all-night grindhouse from Reverend Fightsy Taj.

554
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:07,860
It was like all day and night you could go into this area and watch the...

555
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,200
It was the absolute worst.

556
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,140
Old blaxploitation movies.

557
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,620
And plus the, you know, coming attractions stuff.

558
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,280
And let's all go to the lobby kind of things that went with that period.

559
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,140
And it was a real happening place.

560
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,000
Because it was in the Green Man Tavern where there are chairs and tables that you can put

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,780
your beer on.

562
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,960
There's a Green Man Tavern there?

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,740
There's a cafe.

564
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,720
We did our live hours of Slack from the stage of a real nice cafe.

565
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,060
Oh!

566
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,580
And there was a side table, all the sales and registration and everything at this place

567
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,620
where not only could you eat, it wasn't junk food.

568
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,680
It was really nice, you know, home-cooked meals that were reasonably priced.

569
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,800
Well, you know, it just sounds so much like it has so much more character with a green

570
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,560
man there and a sequoia turtle in the incandescent pool filled with phosgene.

571
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,540
And there's the people lighting...

572
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm sorry, what?

573
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,840
There's even a turtle mound modeled after sequoia.

574
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:07,840


575
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:07,840


576
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,400
And there are mounds probably within 20 miles there of the actual Hope Lower Dena culture,

577
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:13,660
right?

578
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:19,620
They actually have mounds that they've built by hand on the land at Wisteria.

579
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,160
They were imitating the original turtle mounds.

580
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,580
Yes.

581
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,540
They have an ancestor mound too, but I don't think they had many ancestors because it's

582
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,280
not really big.

583
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,540
But it's in a great stone circle, which is where we held the 7 a.m. event where we wait

584
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,460
for the saucers.

585
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,820
And aside from the saucers not coming...

586
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,020
That went great.

587
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,520
We had a record turnout.

588
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:47,840
And I decided since I had this camera crew telling me where to stand all the time, and

589
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,840
I decided, okay, I'm going to handle this one differently.

590
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,160
I'm going to do the entire 7 a.m. waiting for the saucers routine with a video camera

591
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,400
plastered against my face, and I'm going to run from subgenius to subgenius and interview

592
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,840
them.

593
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,160
But that sequence is going to take...

594
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,720
I've got a lot of great material to play on this show, but because of the cussing of

595
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,320
our congregation, it's going to take intensive editing before I can make broadcast versions.

596
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,260
In fact, I'll have to do at least one show that's just internet only.

597
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,640
They are indeed the bluest gang of foul-mouthed wretches and wrenches in the entire universe.

598
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,140
Well, I'm one of the worst.

599
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,840
Any ex-day, any revival.

600
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,820
You just hear the sound of the saucer.

601
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:37,820


602
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
You hear the ordinary chatter.

603
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,400
It's just consistent with so many words that...

604
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,480
Right, I have to do a lot of cutting of what the audience is yelling.

605
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,440
Now, in the background, the music, the guitar there is by Reverend Frodo Suds Shaw.

606
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:54,840
Pushaw.

607
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:55,840
Pushaw.

608
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,420
And get this, he and Priestess Pisces got engaged this ex-day.

609
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,000
And guess who they told first?

610
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,820
No, one day director.

611
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:07,820


612
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:07,820


613
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,280
They're going to do a graduation marriage?

614
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,140
No, no.

615
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,160
It's just like they're going to...

616
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,600
And they'll probably do the wedding next ex-day.

617
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,140
But it was so romantic.

618
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,180
And on top of that...

619
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
Oh, I'm glad I missed that.

620
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,880
I mean, I'm sorry.

621
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:30,880
Suds not only played great guitar, but he made a golden statue for Dr. Leguim as a Bobby

622
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,020
Award called the Adolf.

623
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,600
It was a really nice sculpture of Adolf Hitler.

624
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,440
You can see that on the sub-site.

625
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,040
Well, Leguim, if you look at the Leguim's...

626
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm sorry I laugh when I hear the Fuhrer's name, but it's not his real name.

627
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,040
I know, but if you look at Leguim's YouTube channel, you'll see why he got that.

628
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,980
And the episodes also did a painting.

629
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,840
Well, it's not hard to figure out with his demeanor.

630
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,300
And also Papa Joe, I'm sure many people were frightened by his rather...

631
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,300
His Nazi uniform?

632
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:01,920


633
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,940
Yeah.

634
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,840
Well, it's funny.

635
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,520
When Bob was being burned...

636
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,640
You know, we always burn an icon of Bob, but in this case, it was a very realistic

637
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,340
Bob robot.

638
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,120
A robot-looking thing that...

639
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,800
I mean, it was like...

640
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,140
It really looked like Bob.

641
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:31,620
And once it was set on fire, it really honestly looked like a burning man being immolated.

642
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,040
Wow.

643
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,580
It was made in such a way that the eyeballs would roll out of its head.

644
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:46,540
And it had a kind of a flare smoke bomb stuck in its third eye and in its neither eye, its

645
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,280
bottom rectal eye, you might say.

646
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,480
So that as his skeleton...

647
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,880
First, his clothes were burning, his flesh was burning, but his soul was escaping through

648
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,660
these red flare rocket things at the top and bottom of him.

649
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,620
Well, how do you know that?

650
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,580
Because I was there and I was filming all of it and narrating it.

651
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,560
But again, I was there.

652
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,620
And because of the constant cussing by the audience in the background, I can't play that

653
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,720
section tonight or on YouTube.

654
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,840
But eventually, it will be on there.

655
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,500
By the way, we've just changed background music to one of the other bands who was there,

656
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,500
Cult of Zier.

657
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,280
They also sound very nice.

658
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,240
Z-I-R.

659
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,740
Z-E-I-R?

660
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,940
Z-I-R.

661
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,020
I-R-Z-I-R.

662
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,760
Dr. Zeronius is the...

663
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,580
I-R-Z-I-R.

664
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:37,580


665
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:37,580


666
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:37,580


667
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,800
He's the cultist behind that.

668
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
And he came all the way from Portland.

669
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,820
Portland.

670
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,460
Yeah, this is Cult of Zier in the background.

671
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,680
Portland, Maine or Portland, Mass?

672
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,500
Mass.

673
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,740
I mean, or Portland, or...

674
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:49,840
Portland, or...

675
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,820
Princess, what is wrong with your microphone?

676
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,560
I tried a different one, but this one is apparently...

677
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,640
There's two of them over there, right?

678
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,680
That sounds pleasurier than my phone sounds.

679
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,660
I thought it was microphone number three.

680
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,160
Yeah, that's weird.

681
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:05,720
We've...

682
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,500
It's like...

683
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,720
The mics all go through the same line, so it's the line that's the problem.

684
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,040
Let's just see if this one is any better.

685
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:13,940
No, it's not.

686
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,080
It's like there's a limiter on it that's...

687
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,860
It's not what sounds like an angry bee.

688
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,280
Or perhaps like the fly, the original fly.

689
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:20,680
I don't know.

690
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:20,860
I'm sorry.

691
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,260
I'm thinking of the original fly.

692
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,720
And he was trying so hard to explain what was happening, and it sounded like that.

693
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,920
Meow.

694
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,000
Meow.

695
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,520
Meow.

696
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,180
Meow.

697
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,420
Meow.

698
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,060
Meow.

699
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,200
Meow.

700
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,200


701
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,640
Meow.

702
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,400
And it goes perfect with that cult of Zier stuff.

703
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,060
It does.

704
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,040
It does.

705
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,640
It's beautiful.

706
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,580
He had a funny little animal inside of his homemade electronic noise device.

707
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,900
Well, we've all got a funny little animal in our homemade electronic devices.

708
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,900
No, I mean...

709
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:49,940
Don't you?

710
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,740
And that's another thing.

711
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,620
There's a photo of that on So genius.com.

712
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,180
We have photos of everything up there.

713
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,320
The animal morphisms of a person's technological instrument.

714
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,380
Right.

715
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,660
What, like a wolverine he became suddenly?

716
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,260
Well, it's like as if, like, say, on Discworld, when they make a computer, the mouse is actually a real mouse.

717
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,040
And the ram is the skull of a ram.

718
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,060
Let's see.

719
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,420
Now we're talking translinguistics.

720
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,880
I can hear your underpants flapping in the wind.

721
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,600
What's wrong?

722
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,820
It's like she's getting worse and worse.

723
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,840
She's getting smaller now.

724
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,540
I don't know what to tell you to do, but we're going to watch.

725
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,580
Well, if you want me on the radio show, I'm just going to have to come right over here by you, dear.

726
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,880
Yeah, boy, Princess Wee's right next to me.

727
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,600
I think it's time for us to cut to a song.

728
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,060
Oh, I didn't mention the beautiful painting that Suds did.

729
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,480
He didn't just do the Adolf Award for Legume.

730
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:59,740
He did, I'm not kidding, an oil painting or something of Princess Wee and me in the style of American Gothic.

731
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,020
With the landscape behind.

732
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,160
I mean, an architectural.

733
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,740
Well, see, Ray.

734
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,320
The background is just a little different.

735
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,960
Yeah, it's X Day in the background.

736
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,700
It's like the saucers are burning down the farmhouse behind.

737
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,040
And that's not all.

738
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:21,320
He also did an amazing portrait of Pisces holding Bob's head and dripping an ocean of blood.

739
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,220
Yeah, that's kind of like the main T-shirt of X Day.

740
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,100
I think that's a great T-shirt.

741
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,240
Did you sell any?

742
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,000
I can't say you sold them.

743
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,820
Did you give any and have people return the favor by smooching you on the forehead?

744
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,440
Yes, but not enough.

745
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,280
I actually ended up mailing several of them away as gifts yesterday.

746
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,600
But everybody was giving.

747
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:51,180
Reverend Heathen cooked chicken and barbecue day after day and fed everybody who needed to be fed.

748
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,840
He sure did.

749
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,580
Wow.

750
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,180
And helped out in a million different ways.

751
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,580
Everybody helped.

752
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,340
Reverend Jimbo, Reverend Scum, who are both ex-military guys.

753
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,620
Did a lot of physical type stuff and moral support.

754
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,160
And it's good to have them around the security.

755
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,360
The Ministry of Slack, which is another subgenius show, but it's not a broadcast show.

756
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,360
They have never been potty trained by going to station meetings or anything.

757
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,880
So they did shows, but they're like constantly cussing because they've only ever done it for the Internet.

758
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,520
Although actually Reverend Sweetness McGee said that he did used to have a...

759
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,560
Oh yeah, a broadcast show at one point.

760
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,440
But Reverend Cynic, of course, was always helping us out.

761
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,240
And Nikki Death Chick and Bob Wild were helping run it.

762
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,460
All the regulars.

763
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,300
And there were new people.

764
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,620
Tons of new people.

765
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:58,040
A guy named Reverend Fox brought this video projector and he used it to project images on things like trees at night.

766
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,680
And rooftops and clouds.

767
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,900
That's illegal.

768
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,140
So you'd have Dobbs heads.

769
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,980
Well, yeah, of course.

770
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,160
Why else would we do it?

771
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,840
Well, yeah.

772
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,700
This is X Day.

773
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,320
I was so impressed.

774
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,640
And I let him know clearly that I was.

775
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,800
I didn't mean to get in the middle of a family thing here.

776
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:26,740
Speaking of family things, we had among the many bands, we had some new bands like Evolutionary Control Committee.

777
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,000
Evolution Control Committee, I should say.

778
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,620
Zero Defects.

779
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,360
Boron Nuzzle.

780
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,280
Cult of Seer.

781
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,460
And Monkey Hive was somewhat revised.

782
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,360
We'll be playing bits of all of those.

783
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,800
In fact, I need to play one.

784
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,160
We did have Fat Mandy and Tommy Amoeba came.

785
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,000
And I'm about to play a song by Tommy Amoeba.

786
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,040
And I think you're going to love the lyrics to this one, Dave.

787
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,020
I certainly hope so.

788
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,100
I've got my fingers crossed.

789
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,980
I've been waiting for the last 25 minutes.

790
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,560
And I guess I'll just go with it.

791
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,500
Just enjoy away.

792
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,960
Yeah, this is Tommy Amoeba from Pittsburgh.

793
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,460
Okay.

794
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,160
Dave, I'm pulling for you.

795
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,780
Get ready.

796
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,880
This next song is called You Gotta Say Yes to the Death of T-Rex.

797
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,440
Yes.

798
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,440
Please don't mistake my obsession with death for a death.

799
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:32,900
Death wish.

800
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,660
I wouldn't wish death on anyone, least of all me.

801
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,160
I've always lived by the motto to die and to let live.

802
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,740
Please disregard this shot.

803
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,060
I'd around my neck.

804
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,960
But you gotta say yes.

805
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,960
To the death of T-Rex.

806
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,760
And that guy in excess.

807
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,740
And whoever's next.

808
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,480
You just gotta make way for the next casualty.

809
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,700
One never knows.

810
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,220
It just might be me.

811
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:26,020
Just because I sport black clothes and a corpse's complexion.

812
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,340
It doesn't mean I don't live my life.

813
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,320
To the fullest.

814
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,920
You may call me morbid because I sleep in a coffin.

815
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,920
My brain's not dead and buried in some suburban lawn.

816
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:50,920
Like the pig.

817
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,420
You gotta say yes.

818
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,420
To the death of T-Rex.

819
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,840
And some passenger pigeon with chromosome X.

820
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,320
You just gotta make way for the next casualty.

821
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,320


822
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,500
I have a feeling that I'll make room for the strongest species.

823
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,420
I have a feeling that don't include me.

824
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,560
Oh, Bill!

825
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,800
Oh, Bill!

826
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,480
Oh, Bill!

827
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,480


828
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,480


829
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,480


830
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,480


831
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:27,480


832
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,320
Oh, Bill!

833
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,100
Bill!

834
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,180
Bill!

835
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,700
Bill!

836
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,680
za-胜

837
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,220
appl

838
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:02,300
le

839
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:15,280
feeling no feeling please disregard this shotgun I have aimed at your head but

840
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,260
you gotta say yes to the death of T-Rex and that guy in excess and whoever's

841
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,620
next you just gotta make way for the next wannabe when it's all said and done

842
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,220
I just wanna be

843
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,040
ladies and gentlemen give it up for my husband the one and only

844
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,220
Tommy Amoeba

845
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,060
and my band Bill Sperry Joe Tarowski

846
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,700
Red Bob Tompkins

847
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,900
praise Tommy Amoeba

848
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,900
I just like to say that that boy is

849
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,680
so unusual and original

850
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,440
that I just

851
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,480
I'll give him a big fat slap in the face

852
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,080
and a five

853
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,660
a nine five

854
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,480
you ought to see the costumes

855
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,800
he brings

856
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,280
and he had a new song called

857
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,820
the King of the Flower Men

858
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,300
that I almost played tonight but

859
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,340
he didn't have any instrumentation

860
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,440
for it it's brand new

861
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,340
and you just have to see it

862
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,520
to get it

863
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,940
it's a flower man costume

864
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,040
he's dressed as a flower

865
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,520
he's king of the flower men

866
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,800
he has this giant you know

867
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,660
petals around his head

868
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,680
and he strips

869
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
three thirds of the way through the song

870
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,960
he starts stripping it all off

871
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
until he's down to his little red white and blue

872
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,120
speedo

873
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,960
speedo yeah

874
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,020
but

875
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,380
oh what a terrible visage

876
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,120
no I've

877
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
there's another song that I should play

878
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,980
just because this is the week to do it

879
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,000
and the timing is perfect

880
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,640
well I don't know if you can defeat the only song

881
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,500
or Tom

882
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,620
the question is

883
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,720
the question is

884
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,300
is it too soon

885
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,820
well if it's not too soon for evolution

886
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,480
for everything to end already

887
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,400
for crying out loud

888
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,640
it's not too soon for whatever you're saying next

889
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,920
it's not too soon

890
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,320
it's not too soon

891
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,880
for the church of the subgenius

892
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,940
here is the duke of uke

893
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,680
okay here's uh

894
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,480
here's an amy winehouse song

895
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,780
but really if you wanted to see some fucked up person

896
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,860
ruin an amy winehouse song

897
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,680
you just go to an amy winehouse concert

898
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,700
comedy gold

899
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,020
music

907
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,480


908
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,920
music

909
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,980
music

910
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,180
music

911
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,660
music

912
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:47,760
music

913
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:47,780
music

914
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:47,800
music

915
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:47,960
music

916
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,560
music

917
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:59,140
You went back to what you knew, so far removed from all that we went through.

918
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:10,660
And I tread a troubled track, my odds are stacked, so I'll go back to slack.

919
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,560
We only said goodbye in words, I died a hundred times.

920
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,540
You go back to her and I go back to you.

921
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:28,520
We only said goodbye in words, I died a hundred times.

922
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,600
You go back to her and I go back to us.

923
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:43,000
It's not enough that you love blow and I love puff.

924
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,540
Life is life.

925
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,580
Like a pie.

926
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,120
And I'm a penny rollin' round up inside.

927
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:01,760
We only said goodbye in words, I died a hundred times.

928
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,180
You go back to her and I go back to you.

929
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,060
We only said goodbye in words, I died a hundred times.

930
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,540
You go back to her and I go back to us.

931
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:36,940
Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack, Slack

932
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,240
And I go back to

933
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,080
We only said goodbye in words

934
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,420
I died a hundred times

935
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,900
You go back to her

936
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,780
And I go back to

937
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,120
We only said goodbye in words

938
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,300
I died a hundred times

939
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,920
You go back to her

940
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,700
And I go back to Slack

941
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,800
Remember, once you've had Slack,

942
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,380
Slack, you'll never go back.

943
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,680
Was it too soon?

944
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,360
That was recorded a little, almost a month ago,

945
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,540
but didn't Amy Winehouse die, like, last week?

946
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,120
Yes.

947
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,440
That's why I would say, to the last two offerings,

948
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,520
I would say, egregious with malice of forethought.

949
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,860
Because in the first selection, were they not, was he not,

950
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,120
speaking of the death of dinosaurs,

951
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,700
meaning the end of a certain evolutionary period.

952
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,060
And if you were a music culturist,

953
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,600
you would assume that Winehouse, being 27,

954
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,700
and have done all the dirty sodomizing

955
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,680
that is done in the record business,

956
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,160
has now reached the point where she's no longer sodomizable,

957
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,200
and therefore is part of the vast quagmire,

958
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,080
the machinery that drips in and out,

959
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,940
and can keep dripping, dripping down.

960
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,700
Well, you know, some of the pagans that were there early for Starwood,

961
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,680
or Wisteria regulars, or not even pagans,

962
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,920
they just weren't subgeniuses.

963
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,820
There was a lot of people around when we burned that very realistic model of Bob.

964
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,980
It was a big bonfire, and there were a lot of drummers.

965
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,580
Well, they hated him, as all do.

966
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,340
No, that was the question.

967
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,280
These girls would come up to the subgeniuses and go,

968
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,720
why all this hate and violence and death?

969
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,240
I don't understand.

970
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,660
And the subgeniuses would, if they were able,

971
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:39,660


972
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,080
if they were answering correctly, would say,

973
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:46,280
this is how we free ourselves from silly superstitions

974
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,220
and belief in any magic besides Bob, and even Bob's magic.

975
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,560
We all know Bob's rules of magic.

976
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,760
Start with get off your butt.

977
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,220
We did have some, there was an accident,

978
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,260
Reverend Teeters LaVerge, the author of that agent

979
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,240
and Mr. Dobbs story I've been reading,

980
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,780
as soon as he got there, he had an accident with a bullhorn

981
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,700
and knocked out one of his front top teeth.

982
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,560
So the whole rest of the festival, he looked like a sort of a

983
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,260
Pobucker disco cokehead.

984
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,820
Well, the disco part came from Susie.

985
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:35,560
She had bought the estate of a fellow that had a lot of greasy sort of tuxedo.

986
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,180
He was a strip club owner that she had once worked for

987
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,860
when she was a young stripper.

988
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,220
And he had 70s strip club owner clothing.

989
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,000
And she had stumbled upon this yard sale of all this stuff.

990
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,980
She even had glasses with the guy's pictures on them.

991
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,320
They gave her the lot, I believe, at the end.

992
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,240
And now he has no teeth on front.

993
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,460
Oh, that was only the beginning of the problems that Teeters had.

994
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,480
He had a great ex-day, but everything that happened after that,

995
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,680
I don't know if he does, Princess Wee,

996
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,220
his car broke down, his family, everything.

997
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,760
All kinds of terrible stuff.

998
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,040
So what else does it say here?

999
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,140
Oh, here was a surprise that I was happy with.

1000
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,560
When we were packing to leave Starwood, I was packing up the pulpit.

1001
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,800
And on the floor of the pulpit, I found someone had put in

1002
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,840
a package of condoms labeled huge.

1003
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,020
It's the only word on the whole package.

1004
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,260
Yeah, I took that as a compliment.

1005
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,460
And so you put them on your head.

1006
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,360
Yes.

1007
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,480
Oh, and a guy who was a guest at both festivals,

1008
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:47,220
Reverend Joost van der Liege, presented us with a Dutch graphic novel

1009
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,420
by his famous artist grandfather that contained artwork

1010
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,100
that had somehow found its way into the book of the subgenius.

1011
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,480
It had somehow become clip art.

1012
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,300
I remember him. He was very famous back in the day.

1013
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,320
Van der Liege?

1014
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,460
I don't know if the artist's name was that.

1015
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,340
But we've got this fabulous book.

1016
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,640
Okay.

1017
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,500
And anyway, it's like Bob had been part of this guy's life since,

1018
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,440
even in Holland, since he was a kid.

1019
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,160
Since he was a sparkle in his grandfather's eye.

1020
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,080
And now he makes a million bucks telling people what they want to hear.

1021
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,320
Oh, telling people how to be happier than they've ever been before.

1022
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,400
He makes a million bucks telling people what he wants to hear,

1023
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,000
selling ashtrays of Bob with big ears and wearing a sweater?

1024
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,020
Come on.

1025
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,280
You know that's not the naturalistic real world of which we live,

1026
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,660
in the true verifiable world.

1027
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,860
This is craziness.

1028
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,280
Well, yeah.

1029
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,240
That's why we went there.

1030
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,020
Oh, and that's another reason to have X Day down in southern Ohio,

1031
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:49,140
is it's only about 20 minutes from Athens, which, not Athens, Greece,

1032
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,000
but it turns out to be an incredibly cool college town.

1033
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,240
We all knew.

1034
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,660
All the chameleons know that.

1035
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,240
Half of us went to college there.

1036
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,160
But you didn't know because you came from Texas.

1037
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,040
Didn't go to college.

1038
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,160
Oh, oh, oh.

1039
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,300
Oh, here's something we didn't mention.

1040
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,940
During the baptism, this was pretty magical.

1041
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,620
When he was rising after being baptized,

1042
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,960
Reverend Fox aported a dollar bill out of his mouth.

1043
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,960
That's what you call magic.

1044
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,840
And this is only folk legend as you can be heard because I didn't get a shot of it.

1045
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,840
I heard it was as dry as aluminum sulfite they put on the dog boners.

1046
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,280
Yeah, it was like a miracle.

1047
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
It was a true miracle.

1048
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,160
His eyes rolled back and then they couldn't unroll for a while.

1049
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,040
Oh, another miracle that was fun.

1050
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,700
During the drive-in.

1051
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,420
Okay, imagine the stage, all right?

1052
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,040
It's roofed.

1053
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,800
Hanging from the roof is what we call the full metal Dobbs head.

1054
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,700
It's a metal Dobbs head.

1055
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,540
But this is an immense stage.

1056
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,280
It's really big.

1057
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,880
It's like five-foot-high bob hair, four feet high.

1058
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,580
Wow.

1059
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,280
It's the one we're always cutting our heads on.

1060
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,960
We used to cut our heads on it.

1061
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,060
It's the lower stage at the old place.

1062
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,140
But Reverend Scum got it put up really high.

1063
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,400
Yeah, it was up high, but there's a screen that the drive-in movies are being shown on, right?

1064
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:18,460
Well, the Dobbs head isn't exactly in the way of the screen unless you went over to the left and up on a little rise.

1065
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:27,400
And then about every third shot, the bob would become the head from your point of view there in that one spot.

1066
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,240
The bob would replace the face of the close-up of the person on screen.

1067
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,080
Wow.

1068
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:42,220
So you'd be watching some old, what was it, Big Man Japan or something, and the actor would be Bob constantly.

1069
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,680
Primitive special effects.

1070
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,740
Yes, very, very primitive superimposure.

1071
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,440
Well, that is the wave of the pasture, if you'd like to make cheese out of the issue.

1072
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,080
No, it truly is, though.

1073
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,520
It is the wave of the pasture.

1074
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,380
Taking a number of sticks, perhaps, and trying to create a...

1075
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,880
Hydroelectric plant, stuff like that.

1076
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,000
It can be easily done if you've got your head in the right, well, I don't know, place.

1077
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:14,960
Oh, the Bulldada auctions were held with a new co-host with Dr. Hal, Reverend Janice Blackseed.

1078
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,840
See, I knew her.

1079
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,080
Who also did a nice concert, too.

1080
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:26,860
Oh, and he brought out a giant plate of bananas and blow for everyone and did a song about it so that after that song,

1081
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,700
everybody was walking around with white powder all around their noses and mouth.

1082
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,160
And a string of banana peels behind them.

1083
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,140
Yeah, slipping and falling and babbling.

1084
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,100
Wow, so they actually got high off the banana peels.

1085
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,120
I guess you're not allowed to say that on the radio.

1086
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,520
No, don't talk about that.

1087
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,900
Yeah, don't talk about X Day on the radio.

1088
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:56,040
If you do bake the banana peels at 200 for a really, really, really, really, really long time, then you're prepared for something.

1089
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,200
Okay, I'm going to play another song here.

1090
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:05,180
This one is by Fat Free from Brooklyn.

1091
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:11,060
They've been to almost every main subgenius show in a long time.

1092
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,700
And they always seem confused.

1093
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:18,060
They're the guys who give free aliens and parachutes to everyone.

1094
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,840
But this is a really good copy of their hit single called Rocket Sauce.

1095
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,240
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1096
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,960
Here's an X Day favorite.

1097
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,480
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1098
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,420
Oh, not meow mix?

1099
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:34,860
No.

1100
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:35,960
Oh, okay.

1101
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,660
I did meow mix for you guys, whoever said meow mix.

1102
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,000
We got it!

1103
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,960
Give me some lube

1104
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,420
Give me some food

1105
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,940
I'm coming through

1106
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,580
To fertilize you

1107
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,120
Rock it south

1108
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,900
Rock it south

1109
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,780
Rock it south

1110
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,200
Rock it south

1111
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,680
Give me some food

1112
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,200
I'm coming through

1113
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,840
To fertilize you

1114
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,020
Rock it south

1115
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,320
Rock it south

1116
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,140
Rock it south

1117
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,960
Rock it south

1118
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,360
Rock it south

1119
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,620
Rock it south

1120
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,080
Rock it south

1121
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,040
Rock it south

1122
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,020
Rock it south

1123
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,700
Rock it south

1124
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,000
Rock it south

1125
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,080
Rock it south

1126
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,580
Rock it north

1127
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:51,580


1128
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,360
Rock it south

1129
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,440
Rock it north

1130
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:15,920
I'm coming through to fertilize you.

1131
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Rocket sauce.

1132
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Rocket sauce.

1133
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,780
Rocket sauce.

1134
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,340
Rocket sauce.

1135
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,140
Oh, here we go.

1136
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,180
That is a sticky song.

1137
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,080
Boy, that is very morbid indeed.

1138
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,320
It's even grotesque.

1139
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,880
I don't think so.

1140
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,840
I think it's sexy.

1141
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,920
Well, I do too, but I think it's perversely sexy.

1142
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,460
That's the point I was trying to make.

1143
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,320
Because I keep on seeing this pajama party of all these.

1144
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,480
Very, very tender young ladies.

1145
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,340
Probably from the far west side.

1146
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:51,340
Right part of town.

1147
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,920
Whatever that might be.

1148
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,080
All sitting around together like smoking milkshakes.

1149
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,940
And arguing with each other about the current.

1150
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,700
It's pop star and stuff.

1151
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,540
And then these big grotesque looking.

1152
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,180
Like Harryhausen kind of guys.

1153
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,440
Like, you know, come in the room.

1154
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,440
That's fairly accurate.

1155
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,720
You know, it's just.

1156
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,300
I don't know.

1157
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,200
They do look like Harryhausen guys.

1158
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,580
They look like cavemen.

1159
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,680
The show is almost over.

1160
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,700
And I'm skipping over Pisces improv.

1161
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,180
To play the first song that Monkey Hive did.

1162
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,260
Monkey Hive this year specialized in.

1163
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,260
They asked everybody.

1164
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,280
Hey, do you have a favorite song you'd like us to learn?

1165
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,280
And you can sing.

1166
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,760
So they never rehearsed these things together.

1167
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,760
But I'm going to end.

1168
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,800
Now stay tuned.

1169
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,000
Because when Fat Mandy's vocals end.

1170
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,380
The music will continue.

1171
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,900
But this is.

1172
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,700
Well, I'll let Pisces introduce this.

1173
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,980
All right.

1174
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,440
First song that we're going to ruin.

1175
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,700
Actually, we'll just make it better.

1176
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,460
First subgenius version of a song we're going to do.

1177
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,900
Is going to feature Fat Mandy.

1178
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,260
And you probably know this one.

1179
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,820
Come on, Fat Mandy.

1180
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,000
And I encourage you to sing along.

1181
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,600
Dead girls gathered in their masses.

1182
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:15,060
Just like witches of like my size.

1183
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:15,880
I'm sorry.

1184
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,860
City of Parest Small Town.

1185
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:24,340
Timothy Derrick Menacing Joeartz.

1186
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,020
Who was at the personally beckoning the gas rush.

1187
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,620
And I got revenge on my

1188
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:29,720
Assdade.

1189
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,100
Yeah.

1190
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,320
Understand then

1191
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,520
I saw my machine keeps.

1192
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,100
وق match.

1193
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,600
But she keeps turning it all around

1194
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,240
Time will tell on their power minds

1195
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,040
Taking war just for fun

1196
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,680
Treating people just like monsters

1197
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,980
Pray till their judgment day comes

1198
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,200
Our Lord, yeah

1199
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:46,940
Yes, that's Monkey Hive.

1200
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,520
That's mainly Suds Pasha on guitar.

1201
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,080
And I think Scotty from the Amino Acids on drums.

1202
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:01,320
Beautiful backup work among the boys there, if you want to call them boys.

1203
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,280
Yeah, considering that they never rehearsed this song.

1204
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,840
It's like, well, Scotty knows what to do anyway.

1205
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,540
And Fat Mandy has been known to sing this song

1206
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,080
in her radio.

1207
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:14,600
She's a regular set.

1208
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,300
Yes.

1209
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,800
But with a jazz band.

1210
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,780
Anyway, friends, this has been Hour of Slack number 1320.

1211
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,440
Almost all of it that wasn't us blabbering

1212
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,860
was recorded live at 14X Day Drill.

1213
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,420
Thanks to all the musicians who were there

1214
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,340
and all the people who paid their entry fee

1215
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:38,560
to get to come and to the mysterious staff and so forth.

1216
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,880
And we'll be doing a lot more of Hours of Slack

1217
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,160
that were recorded there

1218
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,080
with Dr. H.

1219
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,600
Howell and Papa Joe and so forth,

1220
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,100
but not Dave.

1221
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,900
Dave is here with us.

1222
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,340
Thank goodness.

1223
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:54,780
Dave.

1224
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,680
I'm in the bowling bag right now.

1225
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,440
I'm waiting.

1226
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,460
Dr. bill.

1227
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,220
Stop

1228
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:00,620
saying

1229
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,900
.

1230
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,640
Wei gave you a present,

1231
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:05,660
Kobe easy

1232
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,180
bracelets,

1233
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,180


1234
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,320
Okay,

1235
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,700
No more war pigs have the power.

1236
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,820
And we've got to strike the hour.

1237
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,880
Day of judgment, God is calling.

1238
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:26,460
On their knees, the war pigs crawling.

1239
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,100
Is she singing about me?

1240
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,900
Begging mercy for their sin.

1241
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:31,500


1242
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,520
Satan laughing, spread his wings.

1243
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,900
I'm Dave.

1244
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,100
And with that, we must kind of let things fade out.

1245
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,640
I'm going to let the band continue on here.

1246
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,300
We're going to have to hang you up with all your hang-ups and all our hang-ups.

1247
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,080
Oh, it's subgenius.com.

1248
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,440
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1249
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,160
The Brusco Hour?

1250
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,180
No, it's actually.

1251
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:12,080
And that's us all.

1252
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:12,900
Praise God.

1253
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,280
Good night, Dave, and thank you.

1254
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,020
Good night.

1255
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,040
Good night.

1256
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,140
Bye.

1257
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,040
Bye.

1258
