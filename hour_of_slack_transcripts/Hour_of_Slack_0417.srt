1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
And come on in.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,720
To the hour of slack.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,220
Come on.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,480
Just step right in, dear friends.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,440
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,720
One, two, three, four.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,960
Better lock your door.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,180
Five, six, get a crinkled little stick.

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,840
Seven, eight, better stay up late.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,480
Nine, ten, and Bob's coming again.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,740
We like you and should ignore you.

15
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,380
But instead, welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,680
The hour of slack.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,120
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,680
Slack.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
Slack.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:07,780
Slack.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,640
Slack.

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,600
Slack.

23
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,340
Slack.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:10,840
Slack.

25
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,360
Slack.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:11,740
Slack.

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:12,700


28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:12,700


29
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,720
Slack.

30
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,080
Slack. Slack. Slack. Slack. Sl 완전yyy.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,100
End of the world Hoe.

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,420
Slack. Slack. Sl reacted it and walked away.

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,420


34
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,520
Sl is stupid business...

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,520


36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,520


37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:57,520


38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,600
Bull desde.

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:57,900


40
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:57,900


41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
Thank you.

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,820
Thank you.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,820
An hour of slack presented here by K&ON in this case.

44
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,540
In this case.

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,660
Oh, dear friends, it's Halloween time.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,400
Halloweeny.

47
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,880
It's coming up on Halloweeny time.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,860
It's a Halloweeny day.

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,560
A fun time.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,860
You know, my family has worshipped certain religious holidays,

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:24,420
and we observe this holiday above all others, as you may well have guessed by now.

52
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,740
Well, Halloween is the only one where all the pink,

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,300
just have to go out and act like subgeniuses.

54
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,020
Oh, yes.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,760
Where the monster fans rule.

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,360
And, well, we'll be getting into that a little bit later.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,880
Not only that, but tonight, tonight is the anniversary,

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,980
the 50th anniversary of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast.

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,080
Ah, that great radio broadcast that proved for once and for all

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,440
that the pinks will believe anything.

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,820
And we're going to try to make them believe that very thing tonight.

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,860
Ah, it was a wonderful thing.

63
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,760
And, you know, at one point I thought, why, we should do a takeoff.

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,760
A silly, funny takeoff on the War of the Worlds thing.

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:27,520
But then I realized, no, Martian invasion isn't, I mean, friends, there are far worse things awaiting us.

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,940
There are far worse things awaiting us.

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:27,940


68
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,820
There are far worse things awaiting us.

69
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:28,820


70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:28,820


71
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,920
On November 7th, you'll find out just how bad those things are.

72
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,880
But, well, we'll get into the really scary stuff.

73
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,020
The love of horror.

74
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,700
Horror tonight.

75
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,860
Ah, yes.

76
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,260
Because we love Halloween so much.

77
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,580
And Halloween is the truest holiday, you know.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,220
It's more true on Halloween than it is on Christmas.

79
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,560
Sorry, it's not that the devil is more powerful. It's just that he's a better

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,360
tempter, you know, and so is Bob.

81
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,660
Oh, no, no, that was the old tape, dear friends.

82
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,460
That was the old, old, old, old tape.

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,680
Yes, we're here.

84
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,080
We're reading you.

85
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,700
We're reading.

86
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,500
And, well, oh, sorry, friend.

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,920
Tired, beat.

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,680
It wasn't November 7th we met.

89
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,560
It was October 29th.

90
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,900
It was hell.

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,540
It was hell.

92
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:06,220
I just got back from doing a show at Bennington College, and they'll never be able

93
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:06,340
to do it.

94
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,940
They can't say the subgeniuses are a bunch of wimps.

95
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,740
I ended up physically throwing four or five, like, drunk people off the stage or wherever

96
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,120
it was they ended up finally forcing us to.

97
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,680
It'll go down in subgenius legend.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,220
I might play a little bit of the tape of that.

99
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,320
Yeah, every now and then, somebody books the church into, or a church preacher into a place

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,980
where they really just want to get drunk.

101
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,260
And dance to Madonna.

102
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,660
And they make that real clear sometimes.

103
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,420
I don't like them trying to tell me that when I'm in the middle of delivering the word of

104
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,720
Bob.

105
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,860
No, sir.

106
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,120
You don't mess with Reverend Stang when he's in the spirit.

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,820
He'll whack you.

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,120
But, well, I've been wearing my Bob mask all evening.

109
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,900
It's Halloween in Dallas, friends.

110
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:05,840
It may not be Halloween anymore in Atlanta or Cleveland or Rochester or Chicago.

111
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,780
But it's still Halloween here.

112
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,380
And my lovely thing, Civet, came into the station with us.

113
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,500
We've been out trick-or-treating.

114
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
How's your candy?

115
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,260
Have you gone through the candy yet?

116
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,520
I found a couple razor blades.

117
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,140
Huh?

118
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,800
I found a couple razor blades.

119
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,560
Oh, good, good.

120
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,520
How about the, what was that bit?

121
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
Did you ever figure out what that bitter powder was on those gumballs?

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,520
No.

123
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,340
I thought it was sugar.

124
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,340


125
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,340


126
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,340


127
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,340


128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,680
Sugar.

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,640
Now, you said that somebody gave you a little tiny square of paper that had Mickey Mouse

130
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,740
on it when you were trick-or-treating?

131
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,420
Yeah, I licked it and I put it on a piece of paper as a stamp.

132
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,760
Oh, okay, okay.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let me mail that one for you, okay, darling?

134
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,200
Well, so we're counting out our candy loot here.

135
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,260
And luckily, Sister Susie the Floozy did a Halloween show a couple of weeks ago in Atlanta,

136
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,080
which happened.

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:14,440
And if anything happened and she was to just throw it to thezenia, a little doll, she

138
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,920
might know what that is, but maybe it's because she loves Lucy.

139
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,100
We'll let a little trick or treat follow.

140
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,100


141
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,100


142
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,240
Sorry,flea.

143
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't cut that in, skewer this chicken.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,160
To punctuous it until it's eaten and mostly nothing, because without food she'd spell

145
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,780
out sign language.

146
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,760
And also, if your mom knows that, she'd say,

147
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,820
I hope she gets some milk.

148
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,240
Change of plan,larm.

149
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,240


150
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,380
Hey, don't snoop down.

151
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:43,140
in it. Hey, um, you don't want to do that commercial, do you? You're going to do it?

152
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,320
Okay. Here goes, friends. Here's a subgenius rant. You won't get too many hours of slack.

153
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,000
What the hell do you think you're doing dragging your butt through the day selling body and

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,920
soul to a bunch of plain normals acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them? Tired

155
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,900
of getting all the guilt but none of the sex? There's a simple answer, dear friend. A glowing

156
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,100
beacon of slack against the turmoil and darkness that stare above dogs in the church of the

157
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,260
subgenius. It's us versus them. You're going to pull the wool over your own eyes, set Bob

158
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,240
into your mind, repent, quit your job, slack off, surprise Bob.

159
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,380
But that's my daughter. She's going to be the new Marjo, friends. New Marjo. I won't

160
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,560
have to beat her anymore to make her learn.

161
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,700
Well, son, let me tell you, I'm so pleased to meet you. The boys and I've been expecting

162
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,980
to greet you. I'll get some honor in the house of the dead. Just relax, lay yourself

163
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,140
down, say goodbye to your head.

164
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,820
Hidey, hidey, hide. Hidey, hidey, hide.

165
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,560
Ho, dee, ho, dee, ho. Ho, dee, ho, dee, ho.

166
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,940
Wadi, wadi, wadi. Wadi, wadi, wadi.

167
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,080
Hidey, hidey, ho. Hidey, hidey, ho.

168
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,160
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hide.

169
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,740
Please, Mr. Devil, it's not for me I'm pleading. If you help Renee and Frenchie, I'll give

170
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,560
you what you're needing.

171
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,340
If you want to bargain and produce something real, deliver me the French that boy and you've

172
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,200
got a deal.

173
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,700
You never had the precious boy that you've got a deal.

174
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,280
Okay.

175
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Oh, skeep-dop-doop-dop-dee-doo.

176
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,520
Skeep-dop-doop-dop-dee-doo.

177
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,200
Skeep-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dop-dee-dop.

178
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,860
Skeep-dop-dee-dop-dee-dop-dee-dop.

179
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,780
Oh, da-da-da-da-da-dee-oh.

180
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,420
Oh, da-da-da-da-da-dee-oh.

181
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,040
Hidey, hidey, ho.

182
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,980
Hidey, hidey, ho.

183
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,900
Congratulations, son, you really deliver.

184
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,840
This little gal makes me shake and shiver.

185
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,480
Don't you got forgotten all the things that I've said?

186
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,460
Don't worry about your friends.

187
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:50,800
Relax.

188
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,280
Now off with his head.

189
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,200
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.

190
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,040
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.

191
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,700
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.

192
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,540
Hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, hidey, ho.

193
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,420
Hidey, hidey, ho.

194
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,140
Deed-de-deed-dee.

195
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,520
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday

196
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,260
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

197
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,660
Be nice to me, babe, or you'll regret it

198
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,620
You are my hostage and don't you forget it

199
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,020
The night is early and there's lots to be done

200
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,860
Let's boogie now, come on, we're gonna have some fun

201
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,540
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

202
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,540
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

203
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:29,660
Whoa!

204
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,260
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy

205
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,280
I like practise, I'm recite

206
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,280


207
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,560
Say you're great, you will still help

208
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,120
Throw in another fool's mound

209
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,420
Done some checks, you don't plate

210
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:18,980
superhero money

211
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,220
Some men they sc provoc

212
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,240
Oh!

213
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,160
Oh!

214
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,520
Just a little Peck

215
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,880
Say your husband still drinks

216
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,440
Your cat is trying to sing

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,960
I could put you off, could you shake?

218
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,420
Now you're up, don't you know what?

219
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,460
You're a zombie, zombie

220
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,380
Dance and dance with the tranching wheels

221
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,840
Stop some of that, kick it in

222
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,560
Shake it hard, shake it thin

223
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,080
Shake those balls right on your skin

224
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,180
Hey, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

225
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,040
Shake, shake, shake

226
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,880
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy

227
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
Shake, shake, shake

228
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,260
Shake, shake, shake

229
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,840
Shake, shake, shake

230
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,440
Now get around while I lose the date

231
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,480
And what goes on when it gets late

232
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,800
Along about midnight the ghost and banshees

233
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,520
Get together for a jamboree

234
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,740
There's a ghost with a jamboree

235
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,280
Horns and saucer eyes

236
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,360
Some have fangs about this size

237
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
Some short and fat, some tall and thin

238
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,280
And some don't even bother to wear their skin

239
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,160
I'm a-telling you, brother, it's a fearful sight

240
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,040
Just to see what goes on in the night

241
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,960
When the spooks have a midnight jamboree

242
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,020
They break it up with a fiendish plea

243
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,900
Ghosts are bad, but the one that's cursed

244
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,440
Is the headless horse

245
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,860
Man, he's the worst

246
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,860
When he goes jogging across the land

247
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,820
Holding his noggin right in his hand

248
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,760
Demons take one look and groan

249
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,520
Then they hit the road, pop, farts unknown

250
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,760
Well, there's no rage like a spook that's burned

251
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,600
The ghost don't like him and he's really burned

252
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
He swears to the longest day he's dead

253
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,460
Well, I'll show them that I can get ahead

254
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,220
Do-do-do-wow, wow, wow, wow, wow

255
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,180
So close all the windows

256
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,520
Lock all the doors

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,300
Unless you're careful, he'll get yours

258
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,160
Don't think he'll hesitate a bit

259
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
Cause if you flip your top, his head will fit

260
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,060
He likes them little, he likes them big

261
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,900
Put them in the middle or wear a wig

262
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,800
Black or white or even red

263
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,740
The headless horseman needs a head

264
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,700
With a hip, hip, hip and a clippity-clop

265
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,420
Why, he's out looking for a head to chop

266
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,340
So don't stop to figure out a plan

267
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,300
Cause you can reason with a headless man

268
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,300
With a hip, hip, hop and a clippity-clop

269
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,960
Look out!

270
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,900
You know what we're talking about

271
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,280
Believe me

272
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,140
Do-do-do-do-do

273
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,520
You better watch your cues

274
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,900
But take a look at the people

275
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,080
Who ignored the old good book

276
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,900
Change your ways, you'll find it safe

277
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,560
Cause you can't be a hank if you ain't

278
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:57,780
Good

279
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,980
Kinda crazy, I guess you'd say

280
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,260
Take our word, we know what we're talking about

281
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,440
Now this is a pretty spooky thing we're doing here

282
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,300
You don't mind if I turn on another light, do you?

283
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,780
Hmm?

284
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,000
Ooh, boy, that was refreshing

285
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,440
Hey, if the headless horseman wants a head

286
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,280
All he has to do is join this church

287
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,960
We got lots of heads here

288
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,080
We got the super sacred dog

289
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,580
And the bobs head

290
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,740
The pumpkin version of which is beaming

291
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,920
It's mirroring visage all over us

292
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,980
And there's the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

293
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,420
Which is, oh, that's a ritual all in itself

294
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,220
You oughta see that bloody neck stump

295
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,400
Arcing over the greedy leaping hands of the audience

296
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,380
Oh, it's like beach blanket gone bad

297
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,940
Oh, and the other things you heard was

298
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,680
Birdsong by Lena Lovitch

299
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,900
It was a love song, but everything she sings

300
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,500
Makes it sound like it's straight from a funeral

301
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,060
Squeeze at the bottom of the head of Arnold Palmer

302
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,060


303
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,300
And the moochers from the soundtrack of The Forbidden Zone

304
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,420
That was Danny Elfman in one of his early works

305
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,140
Also in The Forbidden Zone

306
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,780
There appeared the mystic knights of the Oingo Boingo

307
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,660
That was before they shortened their name

308
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,840
After that it was Zombie Samba

309
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,300
By the world famous pajama slave dancers

310
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,740
And Headless Horseman by Kay Stark

311
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,300
But, oh, there's a head in here

312
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,500
And it is so expanded

313
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh, let's crawl in this giant ear here

314
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,660
And see what's kicking

315
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,320
Oh, my

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, Susie

317
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,240
You are listening to WREK

318
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,620
Oh, yeah, what?

319
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,780
No, it's, um

320
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,640
Where we are questioning authority

321
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,980
Question authority

322
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,480
Question the hell out of authority

323
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Question the friggin' name of authority

324
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,140
Question hell out of every kind of authority

325
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,020
There is, or ever was, or ever could be

326
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,580
Question authority here, over there

327
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,820
Everywhere you go, everywhere anyone goes

328
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,100
Question authority

329
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,040
Question the authority of anyone who professes blind allegiance to any authority

330
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,960
Question those who follow leaders without question

331
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,780
Don't follow leaders, watch your parking leaders

332
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Question all those who accept without question supreme authority of any book, text, or dogma

333
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,060
Question anyone with a deeply felt or long-held devotion to any form of authority

334
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,280
Question anyone who loves authority or who loves anyone in authority

335
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,720
Question anyone who loves the thought of being in love with authority

336
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,040
And dearly loves all people in authority

337
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:49,260
Question all those who are powerfully and easily swayed by appeals to sentiment, patriotism, and tradition

338
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,120
Powerful forms of pride quickly become negatives

339
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,320
Not because of what they lovingly embrace

340
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,160
And uphold

341
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,000
But because of what they sneeringly despise and downgrade

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,120
Be highly suspicious of all those who get misty-eyed

343
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,420
While watching parades of anything besides clowns

344
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,980
Question the authority of every religion that suddenly sounds very political

345
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,440
And every political party that suddenly sounds very religious

346
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Question all politicians who used to be preachers

347
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,560
And all preachers who used to be politicians

348
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,800
Avoid like hell every grinning, yapping TV pundit

349
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,440
And all the president named Pat

350
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,420
Question authority's right to be in authority

351
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,780
Question the divine right of kings and popes

352
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,840
Question the constitutionality of presidents and prime ministers

353
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,480
Question the legitimacy of all self-appointed pubas

354
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,560
Of any and all ad hoc committees

355
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:46,600
Appointed to preserve, protect, and defend the precious, self-evident, anality of our United States of normality

356
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,240
And especially question the hell out of the so-called legitimacy

357
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,600
The so-called constitutionality

358
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,780
The so-called humanity, sanity, and basic rights of all people

359
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,600
The so-called democracy, freedom, and freedom of speech

360
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:58,860
And the so-called accuracy of the world

361
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,380
The so-called egotism

362
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,460
The so-called

363
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,760
The so-called

364
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,580
The so-called

365
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,200
The so-called

366
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:23,800
The so-called

367
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:33,340
Question any person or any institution who opposes or flees from dissent, divergence, diversity, creativity, or free thought.

368
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,840
Remember free thought?

369
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,160
Question every thought, every word, every deed in human experience and in the human imagination.

370
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,020
Question yourself continually.

371
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,900
Question your own questions.

372
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,180
Question every single word I am saying.

373
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,180
Question authority.

374
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,620
Question the hell out of authority.

375
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,660
Question the friggin' hell out of every kind of authority there is or ever was or ever could be.

376
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,140
Question authority here, over there, everywhere you go, everywhere anyone goes.

377
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
Question authority.

378
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,920
Look, up in the sky.

379
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,260
A single dramatic piece of the mosaic becomes in the minds of millions the entire picture.

380
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,780
Would you believe me if I told you?

381
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,220
It's worse than I thought.

382
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,480
It is basically the nation.

383
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,820
It's the people.

384
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,920
Thank you very much.

385
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,520
Thank you.

386
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,460
Thank you and welcome to Let's Make a Deal.

387
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,160
It's worse than I thought.

388
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,900
The guiding light.

389
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,940
Thank you.

390
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,880
Thank you and welcome to Let's Make a Deal.

391
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,940
It is basically the nation.

392
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's the people.

393
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,000
It's worse than I thought.

394
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,320
People are falling off all the time.

395
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,740
Therefore, some people must be walking on it upside down.

396
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,940
People are falling off all the time.

397
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,300
Why is it that these people do not fall off?

398
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,860
Stop it!

399
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,520
Stop it!

400
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,080
Stop it!

401
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,700
Stop it!

402
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,640
Stop it!

403
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,180
Stop it!

404
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,260
Stop it!

405
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,220
Stop it!

406
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:55,980
Stop it!

407
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,020
Stop it!

408
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,020
Therefore, some people must be walking on it upside down.

409
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,020
People are falling off all the time.

410
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,860
Every Grinch down in Grinchville liked Halloween a lot.

411
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:17,020
But the Who that lived just north of Grinchville did not.

412
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,120
The Who hated Halloween.

413
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,800
The whole Halloween season.

414
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,820
No one quite knows the reason.

415
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,660
It could be that he lost a big bet and had an unbelievable gambling debt.

416
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,900
Or it could be that his underwear was too tight and he was desperate to get laid that night.

417
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,680
But whatever the reason, groin itches or wallet pinches,

418
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,940
he stood there on Halloween hating the Grinchies.

419
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,820
Staring down from his cave was a sour-hued frown

420
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,120
at the warm-lighted pumpkins below in their town.

421
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,980
For he knew every Grinch.

422
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,540
The Grinch down in Grinchville beneath was busy now hanging someone

423
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,380
capped with a thorny Halloween wreath.

424
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,820
He snarled with his fundamentalist fingers nervously drumming,

425
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,540
I must find some way to keep Halloween from coming.

426
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,100
The Who had quite a vivid imagination,

427
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,140
but for only one thing, he had a morbid fixation,

428
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,160
which was a full-time occupation of hating other people's imaginations.

429
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,880
All the Grinch girls and boys will be carving their

430
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,880
Halloween toys, imagine The Who.

431
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,140
Hundreds of grotesque dolls for voodoo,

432
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,800
and fashioning enormous piles of fake dog doodoo.

433
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,420
Then the Grinch's young and old will sit down to a feast.

434
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,920
The young will feast on the old, and they'll feast, feast, feast, feast, feast.

435
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,020
Then they'll do something I hate most of all, said The Who.

436
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,960
Every Grinch down in Grinchville, the tall and the small,

437
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,640
will burn down the local Baptist church, dismember the pastor,

438
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,940
and sacrifice his liver on an altar to Satan.

439
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,960
The Who's self-righteous indignation knew no end.

440
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,500
He made it his whole life, because he had not a friend.

441
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,820
Then The Who got an idea, an awful idea.

442
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,960
The Who got an evangelical awful idea.

443
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,640
I know just what to do, The Who laughed in his throat.

444
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,360
I'll drill a few holes in their hellfire boat.

445
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,800
I'll fill their dark passions with something mind-numbing.

446
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,180
This year I'll stop Halloween from coming.

447
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,320
Then dressing up as a mass-murdering psychotic clown,

448
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,340
The Who infiltrated the Grinchville town.

449
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,380
He stole all their glow-in-the-dark skeletons,

450
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,820
their Dobbshead pumpkins, and old recordings of Monster Mash.

451
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,600
He took all their candles, their Ouija boards and cash,

452
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,000
and the last thing The Who took was the last of their frock stash.

453
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,500
But Halloween came,

454
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,320
and it came just the same, and it came again and again.

455
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,500
How could it be so, mused The Who?

456
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,540
It came without plastic pirate hats and cardboard black cats.

457
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,580
It came without Frankenstein and Dracula's ghost.

458
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,020
It came without trance chandlers flown in from the coast.

459
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,760
Halloween came. It came just the same.

460
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,460
It came without devils and witches and hags.

461
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,860
It came without commies, new-agers and fags.

462
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,800
The Who puzzled and puzzled,

463
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,520
till his puzzler was sore.

464
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,520
Then The Who thought of something he hadn't before.

465
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,620
Maybe, just maybe, Halloween isn't a liberal-inspired,

466
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,380
devil-worshipping conspiracy to dupe the youth of our nation

467
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,680
into rejecting the ultra-conservative, fundamentalist Christian agenda.

468
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,760
Maybe Halloween, perhaps, means a little bit more.

469
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,240
And in Grinchville, they say,

470
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,800
The Who's brain grew three sizes that day,

471
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,280
and his penis grew five sizes, guaranteed.

472
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,300
And the next day, then the true meaning of Halloween came through.

473
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,960
And The Who found the slack of ten Grinches plus two.

474
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,100
Welcome, Halloween. Bring your weirdness.

475
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,140
Weirdness to all Grinches far and near.

476
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,940
Halloween will ever soar as long as M-80s blow down your door.

477
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,600
Welcome, children of the night, with hearts and minds so dark and bright.

478
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,760
Halloween is in our grasp,

479
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,020
as long as we have blood sacrifices to clasp.

480
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,280
Halloween will always be, just as long as we have perversity.

481
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,380
Welcome, Halloween, while we stand,

482
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,760
hand cut off and heart in hand.

483
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,920
Oh, my.

484
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,020
Oh, that was so pithy.

485
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:38,880
Whew.

486
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:38,880


487
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,220
Let's have some Laika and the Cosmonauts,

488
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,220
a Finnish surfability band that the Reverend Rex Reverb turned us on to.

489
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,060
.

490
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,060


491
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:53,940
.

492
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:53,940


493
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:53,940


494
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:53,940


495
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:23,940


496
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:53,940


497
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:23,940


498
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:53,940


499
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:23,940


500
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,600
..

501
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,760
.

502
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,320
.

503
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,400
.

504
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,880
That's my girl.

505
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,500
My little daughter.

506
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,740
She's so sweet.

507
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,020
Give me one more kiss, baby..

508
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,740
.

509
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

510
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,260
Well, let's see what happened what what next we

511
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:03,540
We actually don't know half the time. We don't know what it's going to be. Well, it'll be this

512
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:12,640
The doors peta I'll keep them out wouldn't you be afraid

513
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,880
I

514
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:22,900
Was younger back in Parsippany, New Jersey my daddy who was on two weeks of

515
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,640
From the secret Marines based near a nudist camp outside of Fort Dix took me to Morristown to have my eyes examined

516
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,840
We sat in the waiting room for almost an hour nervously thumbing through the magazines

517
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:43,100
Highlights Goofus and Gallant was my favorite while trying to ignore the occasional muffled screams. We could hear coming through the wall

518
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,860
I remember watching daddy salute some old photo of President

519
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,880
Eisenhower in one of the mags and thinking how I could have looked better with lipstick and one of those propellers

520
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,760
I was like oh my god. I'm gonna be a

521
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,280
He would have looked like some giant glob of monosodium glutamate

522
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,520
Hydrogenated dude

523
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,540
When my time arrived I went into the doctor's office alone

524
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,580
There was a folding chair over to the side and the doc said he'd be right with me as soon as he was finished with

525
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:18,540
This last patient his patient was some gray hair clean-cut middle-aged man who appeared to have a pleasant disposition

526
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,360
He smiled at me and called me lad and I liked that

527
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:30,160
The nice man looked through this big machine that looked like it came from Mars and started reciting letters from the alphabet to mr.

528
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,260
Eye doctor when the doc pulled the machine away the nice man leaned forward

529
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,760
Opened his mouth wide and literally bit off the Doc's entire face

530
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:47,240
Swinging the now lifeless skin back and forth in his mouth like a dog and the dog blood sprayed all over my mom's

531
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,940
Maybe t-shirt the Doc's eyes were dangling in every which way and direction

532
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,760
and his

533
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:01,340
Nose was totally gone his teeth looked like a skeleton, but with tons and tons of pulsating blood flowing from all the torn muscle tissue

534
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:07,280
He had a ghastly kind of skeletal smile as he gurgled and moaned and knocked into the machines

535
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,540
Breaking a lot of glass and making a real mess

536
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:19,320
The nice man in the chair spit out Doc's face and began swinging from the overhead hanging light fixtures like a chimpanzee

537
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,660
laughing hysterically

538
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,740
somehow the Doc still had a

539
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,440
Glasses on with the blood squirting all over the inside of the lenses

540
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,260
He needed those funny trick glasses with the battery operated windshield wipers on him except on the inside

541
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,040
The Doc kind of reminded me of that photo of old Ike, but much more animated and colorful

542
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,860
The nice man soon dropped to the floor pushed the Doc aside and ran out into the street right in front of a speeding bus

543
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,080
Which squashed him like a great?

544
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,720
His glasses flew off just in time

545
00:33:52,740 --> 00:34:00,340
In the nick of time however into the gutter my daddy always prudent quickly ran over to the puddle that remained of the nice man

546
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:07,600
And picked up his glasses pleased with himself he approached me and carefully placed them on my face a

547
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,580
Perfect fit I could see so clearly too and without daddy having to spend a penny

548
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,360
I agreed and I products

549
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:47,200
I managed to get officers to blunder what to do

550
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,260
Looks like I was waiting too long for the great � pool

551
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,260


552
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,060
this is the great zoogs riff

553
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,860
This lovely little lilting tune,

554
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,320
Secret Marines Sex Kitten Party,

555
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,220
from Zug's Riff's album, Torment.

556
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,660
Oh, boy.

557
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,980
Oh, boy.

558
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,940
Oh, I feel Halloween-y all over.

559
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,160
I feel all orange and black.

560
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,220
Oh, great things happen this time of year.

561
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,320
Let's not just relegate it to one day.

562
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,360
Let's let Halloween be every day,

563
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,340
every morning when we wake up, say,

564
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,740
it's Halloween, baby.

565
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,820
So put on those false faces

566
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,500
and get out there.

567
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,780
And as the great wings

568
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,280
flapped off into the distance,

569
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,260
the lights in the house came on,

570
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,540
the stars came out,

571
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,080
the scariest Halloween ever was over.

572
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,440
We humans do not see with our eyes

573
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,880
or hear with our ears,

574
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,640
but that we both see and hear

575
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,480
with our minds.

576
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,480
People laugh.

577
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,320
People laugh at it because it did appear to be a joke.

578
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,700
Good, I'm gonna walk your mind.

579
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,020
Good, I'm gonna walk your mind.

580
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,860
Remember, your mind is a rich storehouse of images.

581
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,100
You will instruct your mind to do what you want.

582
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,120
You will instruct your mind to do what you want.

583
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,180
You will instruct your mind to do what you want.

584
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,700
So now I've learned to love women,

585
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,140
and miracle of miracles,

586
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,160
some of them have learned to love me.

587
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,420
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.

588
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,080
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.

589
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,240
One came for 15 minutes and stayed for 39 months.

590
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,420
That's love.

591
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,680
She was the town's bad girl when she came.

592
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,080
She was the town's bad girl when she came.

593
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,460
An alcoholic and a thief at 14.

594
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
You ought to see her now.

595
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,220
She's got a light around her.

596
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,080
It's a terrific drag lady. She's still with the smoke, and it's a great day.

597
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,220
It's a terrific drag lady. She's still with the smoke, and it's a great day.

598
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,380
She's not quite to the pouring mass,

599
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,900
it's all the humanity...

600
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,800
Close your eyes, and relax yourself in the usual way.

601
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,500
Close your eyes, and relax yourself in the usual way.

602
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:24,500


603
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,040
Picture yourself standing out of doors

604
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,460
Picture yourself standing out of doors

605
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,520
in a meadow on a warm summer afternoon.

606
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,280
You look up.

607
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,360
The sky is bright blue

608
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,140
with large, fluffy clouds drifting overhead.

609
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:35,560


610
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,080
Allow yourself to fully experience

611
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,060
this pleasant, outward experience.

612
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:50,200
door seams. Walk a bit, enjoying the lovely day. For some reason, a trampoline is sitting

613
00:37:50,200 --> 00:38:05,260
in the meadow. And climb up on the trampoline. You begin to jump up and down on it. Feel

614
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:13,840
the mild sensation of freedom and unrestraint as you begin to bounce. Experience the liberating,

615
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:27,260
flying sensation as you bounce higher and higher. Continue to bounce up and up. Spread

616
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,800
your arms and feel the wonderful warm wind rushing past as you bounce even higher.

617
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:41,120
Enjoy the feeling and look about you at the scene below as you bounce higher and higher,

618
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,700
way above the trees.

619
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,860
You're just slacking off, you're just back to me. I wish I could slice over your head

620
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,100
no matter where you are, one at a time. And I could take out your tape and program into

621
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,160
believing you only want me so much, or you only can have so much confidence. And if I

622
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,200
could take over your mind for 30 days, and you do exactly like I told you, you'd be the

623
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,200


624
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,400
strongest, and I'd be sparking a flame.

625
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,680
The difference between singing like Frank Sinatra and being Frank Sinatra singing. Try

626
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,700
it and you'll see what I mean.

627
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:20,420
To breathe and how often. What to think and how to express it. Whom to know, what to wear,

628
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,440
what to study.

629
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:29,420
Then I would take Ben's dream to get me up. Somewhat later not much, liquor to keep me

630
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,000
up. And then, sleeping pills to knock me out.

631
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,240
Well this makes the difference.

632
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,440
It's a very short day.

633
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,640
It's a very powerful tool. Try it.

634
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,240
Try the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.

635
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:57,240
That lovely piece just there, just then, was by Reverend Susie the Floozy and Oh Brother Jeff.

636
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,820
Something called Mind Tree.

637
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,760
I figured it out.

638
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,020
Oh, no, I know you figured it out, Susie, but we can't let you tell them about it.

639
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:11,160
No, I can't believe what you dared to say to begin with on the radio.

640
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,780
It's all right, it's all right.

641
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,620
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

642
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,480
Well, if Bob gets wrong and I get wrong, that must be all right.

643
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,460
That must be all right.

644
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,420
You know, things are different in my day.

645
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,120
I mean, these kids these days, they walk around like they were zombies.

646
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,980
I mean, that's what really makes me mad.

647
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,380
Back when I was a zombie, things were a little bit different.

648
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,660
When we rose from the dead, it was at 6 a.m., not noon.

649
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,000
We ate the flesh of a young woman's corpse.

650
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,180
We did it with respect, respect for the woman and respect for the corpse.

651
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,260
And kids these days are walking around with just computerized this, that, video games.

652
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,280
I remember back in my day, just to iron clothes.

653
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,160
We just had to heat our hands up over a stove and then just rub your hot hand over the clothes.

654
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,800
I mean...

655
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,440
Well, it's all these...

656
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,300
Body eating has made people spoiled.

657
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah, I remember back in my day, just to even walk to school in the morning,

658
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,540
I had to walk across the surface of the sun while swallowing fish hooks.

659
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,740
So that'll...

660
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,900
That was on a cold day, too.

661
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,300
Yeah, in a snowstorm.

662
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,480
You know, the trick of picking chicken is picking what chicken to pick.

663
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,380
Like this fowl I plucked the other day.

664
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,140
Look how plump and funny.

665
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,400
I had to put it out of its misery, but it looks so funny in its little bag.

666
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,740
You can trick and kick that chicken, but you've got the right chicken.

667
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,000
You've got the right chicken to pick.

668
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:31,840
Yeah.

669
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,000
Well, we'll let you go back to sleep.

670
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,280
This has been educational.

671
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,860
And we'll send you a copy, a simul-fax copy of your words very soon.

672
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,360
Write for another copy of our experimental...

673
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,680
Which you're hearing right now, right?

674
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,200
So I get to hear how intelligent and intelligent and awake I am at 7 o'clock in the morning.

675
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,940
You're hearing for the very first time the copy of yourself right now.

676
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,280
You're not gonna stand up and hear my tape played.

677
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,540
You're gonna hear your tape played.

678
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,760
And it won't be in a secretary around until you raise a part of it.

679
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,480
You might need to just take off and run!

680
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,900
Bob's running with the devil.

681
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,460
So you're gonna run away to the other one.

682
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,800
One way or the other.

683
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,360
What else do you do?

684
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,660
Come on, kids.

685
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,160
Honey?

686
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,480
Well, here we are.

687
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,060
The park.

688
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:08,940
Come on, everybody.

689
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,980
Welcome to Synthetic National Park 116B.

690
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,600
I'm Jack, your animatronic ranger and guide.

691
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,900
Please step on conveyor and press A for nature excursion.

692
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,020
Okay.

693
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,820
Kindly direct your attention to the astroturf and fabric forest.

694
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,280
You will notice the mechanized bears are not threatened by us and will not respond in a hostile manner,

695
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,880
unlike real bears of the past.

696
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:28,880


697
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,520
Growl.

698
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,320
Growl.

699
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,520
And over on the right are 3D computer generated water birds.

700
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Hey, that's not real water in those rapids, is it?

701
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,780
No, of course not.

702
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,020
It's basically recycled liquid wastes and salvaged oil spills from tanker accidents dyed blue and white

703
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,100
and mechanically propelled by small nuclear rotors for a historically correct effect.

704
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,980
We're proud to say it's almost aesthetically perfect as well.

705
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,060
What about the clouds and the blue sky?

706
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,340
Computer generated.

707
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,800
What about the warm temperatures?

708
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,920
Greenhouse effect.

709
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,920
Not bad for New York in February, huh?

710
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,540
Yes, thanks to the efforts of one time President George Bush over a hundred years ago,

711
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,260
real parks were cleared away and controlled, easy to maintain environments like this one were created.

712
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,220
Which park was this?

713
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,720
It was called Central Park, I believe, but I'm only a ranger, not a historian.

714
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,340
Please, follow me, folks.

715
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,000
There's much more of the park to see.

716
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,840
Having trouble getting the children to eat their food, Mom?

717
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,320
Kids complaining that they don't like the taste of fish?

718
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,000
Try Mrs. Filabert's deflavored fish, the fish that doesn't taste like anything.

719
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,040
That caviar was great, Mom. Pass the anchovies.

720
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,080
Thanks for dinner, dear. It was tasteless.

721
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,180
They didn't taste a thing.

722
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:46,980
And you will too when you serve Mrs. Filabert's deflavored fish, the fish that needs no flavoring.

723
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,060
Marge, that tasted like nothing I've ever had.

724
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,880
Never taste that fishy taste of fish again with Mrs. Filabert's deflavored food.

725
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,820
Waiter, I'd like to try some.

726
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,140
I'd like to try some of that delicious fish.

727
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,220
But you just ate your fish, ma'am.

728
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,960
What a catch.

729
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,920
Whole fish without the flavor.

730
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,580
Try the same fish the fast food restaurants use.

731
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,080
Mrs. Filabert's freeze-dried deflavored fish in sticks, cakes, slabs, or bakes.

732
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,080
Mrs. Filabert's. That man of yours will say...

733
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,220
What was that, honey?

734
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,080
Uh, yeah.

735
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,520
Question, dear friends.

736
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,760
Thanks to Reverend Filippo Abernathy...

737
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,200
I love you, I love you.

738
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,600
You're a good friend, and you deserve a lot of love.

739
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,760
Thank you.

740
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,960
You're a good friend, and you deserve a lot of love.

741
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,400
Oh, yes.

742
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,660
But the boogeyman can't get you, don't worry.

743
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,880
Although you can't kill him...

744
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,460
He can't get you.

745
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,080
You can't kill him, but he can't get you.

746
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,100
I must, yet I cannot.

747
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,020
Michael?

748
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,700
Michael?

749
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,840
Oh, Michael Myers, a true subgenius, friends.

750
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,180
Well, we're going to talk, as I said,

751
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,300
we're going to talk about scarier things.

752
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,980
Scarier things than the War of the Worlds broadcast

753
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:23,760
or any of those showbiz-type thingies,

754
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,140
because it is Halloween, and we love death.

755
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,140
The Day of the Dead.

756
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,320
Yes, that's what it is.

757
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,860
El Dio del Muerte.

758
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,680
Something like that.

759
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,040
And, uh...

760
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,960
You know, it's because,

761
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,780
although we Americans treasure health,

762
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,160
and we rightfully pride ourselves on our heritage

763
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,940
of rich land, open air, and clean, pure water,

764
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,240
well, my friends, water doesn't, uh,

765
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:53,740
pay attention.

766
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,880
It doesn't pay attention to these, uh, national borders.

767
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,480
It doesn't salute the flag.

768
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,160
It doesn't pledge allegiance.

769
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,700
It recycles between the Earth, air, and oceans,

770
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,600
and between the outside world and our own cells.

771
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,520
Our bodies are 75% water.

772
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,080
It's our most important nutrient.

773
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,380
We can do without food,

774
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,960
but we have to have water all the time.

775
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,020
Yet, our water has changed.

776
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,320
Ah, yes.

777
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,380
Mutation, dear friends,

778
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,720
and it will change us.

779
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,680
If we do not restore it to its former purity.

780
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,600
So let's not.

781
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,320
Let's just let it mutate us, you know?

782
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,320
Uh, because there's something like

783
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,860
100,000 hazardous waste dumps in our country,

784
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,020
and the resulting contamination of our groundwater

785
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,020
has helped put carcinogens in the water in 34 states.

786
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:57,640
And discarded chemical wastes have found their wonderful little ways

787
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,800
into 400,000 landfills to the point that near big cities,

788
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,020
up to 10% of our groundwater is hideously polluted.

789
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,100
Oh, friends, let's praise Bob for that,

790
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,900
because that spreads the mutation.

791
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,980
That helps to taint the gene pool that there may be less normals and pinks.

792
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,520
Ah.

793
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,280
Ah, it's wonderful.

794
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,480
63% of our rural water supply, supplying 40 million people, in fact, are unsafe.

795
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:36,940
And one in five Americans drink tap water containing excess levels of toxic lead.

796
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,920
Oh, we can end up like those Japanese with flippers over there.

797
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,120
The mercury poisoning.

798
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,820
It's wonderful, wonderful.

799
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,480
The same elements that are deadly to insects, dear friends, are also deadly to us.

800
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,740
There's enough DDT in the ground.

801
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,580
There's enough mercury in the ground to affect us until the year 3000.

802
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:02,260
Herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides, they relentlessly creep into our underground water supplies.

803
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,220
And our surface water is tainted with agricultural runoff,

804
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,520
with industrial effluence, and urban waste.

805
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,340
Why, our river, our rivers, our lovely rivers,

806
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,760
have become great sewers carrying arsenic.

807
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,400
Nitrates.

808
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,920
Not all, but there have been disasters from machine killing.

809
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,620
From burning seafood, perhaps powder, from

810
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:01,860
policerifters to the president of the下折 .

811
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,660

815
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,700
Well, let's see what the tape says.

816
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,000
It says Wavy Gravy WCSB.

817
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,760
WCSB is the station in Cleveland where Lonesome Cowboy Dave has that show

818
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,520
and where you are listening to the Hour of Slack right now in Cleveland.

819
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,580
But this is punishment above and beyond.

820
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:40,820
It truly is.

821
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,020
Hang in and love it or hate it.

822
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,340
In screen, Blackula, scream.

823
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,740
Hey!

824
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:21,520
Ooh!

825
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:23,460
Ah!

826
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,300
Ooh!

827
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,980
Ah!

828
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:31,900
Ooh!

829
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:31,900


830
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:31,900


831
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,640
There's a hate all in my brain.

832
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,380
Everything seems the same.

833
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,860
Feeling funny, I don't know why.

834
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,020
Excuse me.

835
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,620
While I kiss the sky.

836
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,400
Yeah!

837
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,780
Blackula Hayes all in my brain.

838
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,260
Don't know what I'm in for.

839
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,200
That woman put a spell on me.

840
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,020
Tomorrow's just the end of time.

841
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,680
That womanール you and I are both the same.

842
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,320
Oh, glad you know this already.

843
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,460
Well, this season you and I

But really, how does it keep coming up?

865
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,220
Here they are, carrying the ball downfield.

866
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,080
A little color game.

867
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,700
It's a beautiful ball, rising over the mountains like a shining sun.

868
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,540
And the birds are singing.

869
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,240
The waterfall is falling.

870
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,140
The moose is bellowing in the woods.

Yeah.

Puppet of the day in the moose.

881
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,440
That old P.O. box.

882
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,880
I just love that old number.

883
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,280
140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

884
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:09,680
And that zip is 75214.

885
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,820
Oh, yes.

886
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,400
And P.O. box.

887
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:11,400


888
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:17,100
And Sivit, did you have anything to say tonight, this Halloween, as we go off the air?

889
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,440
Yes.

890
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,420
Father, I do.

891
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:26,060
That is her statement, dear friends.

892
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,200
I die.

893
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,560
I die.

894
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:41,520
I die.

895
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,140
I die.

896
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,000
I die.

897
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,820
I die.

898
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,060
I die.

899
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,340
I die.

900
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:29,740
I die.

901
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,400
I die.

902
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,880
I die.

903
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,440
I die.

904
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,080
I die.

905
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,740
I die.

906
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,040
I die.

907
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,700

00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,280
Can't do it thanks to Pines Point Apartments for their support.

914
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:46,980
Music

915
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:46,980

925
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,180
Good evening.

926
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,480
You are listening to radio station KNON

927
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,940
89.3 Dallas, Fort Worth,

928
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,380
The Voice of the People. I'm your host,

929
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:11,100
Paul Wilson, and this is the Halloween edition of Celtic Crossroads.

930
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:17,600
And we're going to play as much music thematically for Halloween as we have.

931
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,680
Either we will run out of music or we will run out of program first.

932
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,860
I'm not really sure which is going to happen.

933
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,300
So why don't you stay tuned.

934
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,140
We have a few announcements to do.

935
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,640
We're going to get through with those and be back in just a minute.

936
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,880
And we're going to begin this segment of the program,

937
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,360
which will last until the end of the show.

938
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,840
Until about 1025 or so,

939
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,460
with the Pogues.

940
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,560
And if your childhood was deprived

941
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,900
of the learning of this song,

942
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:45,160
well,

943
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,580
I feel sorry for you.

944
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,740

Thank you.

991
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,480
I always remember.

992
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,760
Quick, grab him.

993
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,920
Take him out to freeway

994
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,760
to be run over repeatedly like the roadkill that he is.

995
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,300
No, no, no.

996
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,080
Wait.

997
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,420
Wait.

998
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,800
This bit's boring me.

999
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,640
Let's do another routine or whatever you call these things.

1000
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,200
Quite right.

1001
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,840
Besides, the script ran out.

1002
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,780
Quite right, quite right, quite.

1003
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,740
Let's do one where I can talk like I regularly do, you know?

1004
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,200
Yeah.

1005
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,100
Like I mighty like, damn it.

1006
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:39,040
Okay.

1007
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,040
Yeah.

1008
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, yeah, there we go.

1009
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,400
That's more like it.

1010
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:45,740
More like it.

1011
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,760
I like that music.
