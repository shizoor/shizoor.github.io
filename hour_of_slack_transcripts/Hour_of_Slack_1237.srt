Forget about it now.

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,160
You should be destroyed.

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,600
That's right.

You don't mean right now, do you?

40
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,700
It's important to us now.

41
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,300
It was my fault.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,740
But why?

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,940
What's the big deal?

44
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,460
Bob.

45
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,880
You should be destroyed.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,120
Bob.

47
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,400
This here is a holiday message from Tater Gumfries.

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,860
Now, the holidays are coming up and a lot of you will be spending them with your kin.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,840
And so you know there's going to be some drinking.

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,980
But you got to remember, don't nobody like an asshole.

51
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,000
So if you're going to be drinking, try not to be an asshole.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,480
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,740
I'm Santa and I endorse this product or service.

54
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,740
Santa.

55
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,160
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

56
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,600
It's Christmas time again.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,700
You hear it in the songs of joy promoting fiscal gain.

58
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,780
You see it in the credit cards that platter down the drain.

59
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,600
Cause Santa's laughter mocks the poor and here it comes again.

60
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,180
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

61
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,880
It echoes in the night.

62
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,500
A nagging sound that makes you wonder if you've got it right.

63
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,840
Everybody lies awake and thinks there's more to life.

64
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,200
But Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,720
And y'all.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
You've got to blame tonight.

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,060
Santa.

68
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,160
We have been Santa.

69
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Don't you care?

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Why don't you ignore us?

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Santa.

72
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,740
At this time of year.

73
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,180
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

74
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,020
A liability.

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,600
That taunts you every time you turn on one of your TVs.

76
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,640
Or choose the leather option or a nice Moroccan tee.

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,600
Oh Santa's laughter mocks the poor across the seven seas.

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,560
Santa.

79
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,700
We have been Santa.

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,720
Don't you care?

81
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,300
Why don't you ignore us?

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,000
Santa.

83
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,700
At this time of year.

84
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,160
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

85
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,820
The catchiest of songs.

86
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,680
If everybody else is singing it, it can't be wrong.

87
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,700
You hear it in the news reports of panic in Hong Kong.

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,180
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
You've known it all along.

90
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,180
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,840
They just don't help the clout.

92
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,940
To make a difference in the way society's turned out.

93
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Share out all the money in the world.

94
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,840
We've seen one out.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,180
Oh Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

96
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,680
Of that there is no doubt.

97
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,780
Santa.

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,940
We have been Santa.

99
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,820
Don't you care?

100
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,360
Why don't you ignore us?

101
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,940
Santa.

102
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,760
At this time of year.

103
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,140
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

104
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,640
It's Christmas time again.

105
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,180
You hear it in the songs of joy.

106
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,740
Promoting fiscal gain.

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,220
You see it in the credit cards.

108
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,740
That plod down the drain.

109
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,220
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

110
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,580
And here it comes again.

111
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,800
A credit card Christmas had died.

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:51,920
Santa's laughter mocks the poor.

113
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,440
Happy New Year.

114
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,720
If it's not worth anything.

115
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,300
Then it's not worth having.

116
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Remember children everywhere.

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,980
Keep your receipts.

118
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,760
Yeah aren't you.

119
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,900
You know I mean it's a giveaway.

120
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,820
What can I say.

121
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,480
Yeah but remember that time I did that.

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
We've got a special on them today.

123
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,700
I want you to look especially at our bargain basement item.

124
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,580
I remember that one time.

125
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,740
You know we've got such wonderful bargains here.

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:19,940
It was great back then.

127
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,480
I think we all take it for granted.

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
But the customer comes first.

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,940
We all used to go down and sit around.

130
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,980
The customer is king here at Subgenius Department Store.

131
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,000
And I want each and every one of you not to forget that.

132
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,660
I love this job.

133
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,700
Me too.

134
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm the luckiest guy in the world to work in the lingerie department.

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,480
At the Subgenius McPartment Store.

136
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,080
Here's a rose for your buttonhole.

137
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
A lot of people thought it was a radio show.

138
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
But it was really a Subgenius McPartment Store.

139
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,280
Yes the ladies love this department.

140
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,880
And all the people came down to the McPartment Store.

141
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,580
And they McParted each other.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,060
Not the McPartment Store.

143
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,940
That vulgar chain store.

144
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,540
They held their grummins over their head

145
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,580
and whirled them around in the air.

146
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,520
Every Christmas we set up the model trains

147
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,080
for the kiddies on the roof.

148
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,880
And there's Gizmo the Clown

149
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
and that jolly old elf Saint Nick himself.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,680
Quit playing with your artifact there, son.

151
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,180
In Santa's workshop children will be

152
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,620
dandled and not diddled by Santa.

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,040
Promise?

154
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,900
They'll be dandled around with their head.

155
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


156
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


157
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,900


158
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,520
They'll be falling into their diddle can.

159
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,060
They'll be falling into their diddle can

160
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,200
with their dando boy.

161
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,940
Meanwhile mighty bargains can be heaved up

162
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,060
from the deep of the subbasement

163
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,140
where bargains reign supreme

164
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,060
in Pluto's kingdom.

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
Yes and even Pluto will

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,580
Or QuiveringBrain.com or SubGenius.com.

190
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,980
Those will all point you to where you can get more of that stuff.

191
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:37,440
And before that, dear friends, we heard the Attery Squash doing that lovely song, Santa's Loft-a Mocks the Paw.

192
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,060
And yours truly, I even got to be a part of that.

193
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,440
And there's a little video of that if you look for the Attery Squash.

194
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,540
On YouTube.

195
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,220
They also are at MySpace.com, the Attery Squash, and Facebook.

196
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,400
And we heard a song also by the Psychoskeletons, the Good King Bob song.

197
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:10,120
The Psychoskeletons are, well, I don't know if they're good like King Bob, but you can find them in good time at SoundClick.com, the Psychoskeletons.

198
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,660
And then there was all those collages.

199
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,420
And, you know, in this case, they were all done.

200
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Either.

201
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:24,460
By the great Mr. Fernandinandi Lemur or the great whatever it is, the Large.

202
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,260
And you can't get a hold of them, I don't think.

203
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:35,340
I don't know nothing about the Large and not much about Fernandinandi Lemur except that I don't know where we'd be without him.

204
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,220
Here, on the Hour of Slack, number 1,237, technically.

205
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,320
And, oh, and we have a song.

206
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,320


207
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,320


208
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
We heard Tater Gumfries.

209
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,240
That's the first time anybody's heard Reverend Tater Gumfries on this show.

210
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,320
The real Tater Gumfries.

211
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,820
Yeah, as far as I know, that was the real Tater Gumfries.

212
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:09,120
And if you ever want to read the best of current subgenius writings, including fairy tales and biological and creation sciences and forbidden sciences, you can check out Kearns Holler.

213
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I don't think it's KearnsHoller.com.

214
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,400
It's a blog.

215
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,040
But if you just go Googling Kearns.

216
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,680
K-E-R-N.

217
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,400
Kearns Holler.

218
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,280
Not hollow, but holler.

219
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:37,080
Anyway, friends, before Lonesome Cowboy Dave gives us a holler in about 10 minutes, this is our New Year's show, you might say, even though it's a bit Christmassy, the way things time out.

220
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,860
By the time you hear this, it may be next year.

221
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,340
2010, the sequel to 2001.

222
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,300
It may very well be next year.

223
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,660
And Princess Wee and I have a sort of a farewell for 2009.

224
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,560
There we go.

225

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:37,120
Goodbye, goodbye to all of those things that lived before December 2009.

281
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,180
Apologies, by the way, to the Firesign Theater,

282
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:48,560
who did a little list like that long, long, long ago.

283
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,800
We have more historical 2009 things coming up.

284
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,460
When Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave calls, which should be soon.

285
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,580
However, I should mention that we have some news about festivals coming up

286
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,260
that subgeniuses and others might be interested in.

287
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,840
And the Winter Star Festival is in Ohio, in Delroy.

288
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,680
Winter Star Symposium, that's in February, around Valentine's Day weekend.

289
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,780
Yes, it is.

290
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,100
February 14th, I believe, somewhere, whatever that weekend is.

291
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,680
I'll be preaching there.

292
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,420
And Witch Disco will be jamming there in the Space Cabin.

293
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,320
And Starwood, sponsored by the same folks, Ace, will be happening.

294
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,580
We have a date.

295
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,160
It's a different.

296
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,180
It's a different date than it used to be.

297
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,960
July 6th through 12th.

298
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,860
And maybe more.

299
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,140
It may be a two-week festival.

300
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,400
But the second week will be like the detox or the...

301
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,080
The healing festival.

302
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,460
Yeah, the healing after the furious fun and craziness of Starwood,

303
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,320
which is right after X-Day.

304
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,680
Of course, we're having X-Day Festival, subgenius festival,

305
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,780
starts June 30th and ends July 5th.

306
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,580
So, and in fact, the world ends July 5th.

307
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,520
So, I don't even know why we would be discussing shows or whatnot that may happen then.

308
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,900
I'm going to switch this music over to...

309
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's see, what do I want to go to?

310
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
Oh, number one would probably be fine.

311
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,500
Number one comes before three, right?

312
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm disguised as a security guard.

313
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,160
President Obama is dropping boxes of instant noodles to doctors and nurses

314
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,880
to help them.

315
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,440
To help him blow up the bodies of victims with a car bomb.

316
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,460
Nobody has credibility with the American people on this issue.

317
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,080
The president was speaking to a group of 150 doctors from all 150 states

318
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,960
for the first time in more than a year.

319
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,040
All of the UN's offices have been shut down temporarily as a precaution.

320
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,140
On Wall Street, 8595773,

321
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,160
the first doses of swine flu are being distributed this week.

322
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,800
The New York Times is reporting that many doctors are being cut off today

323
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,780
by people anxious to get PR news.

324
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,100
And I know many are anxious to get...

325
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,620
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,420
Don't you dare get me.

327
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,820
Because I've already been got numerous times.

328
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,420
Lonesome Cowboy Dove is the other name.

329
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,620
I really get Dave. I get him. I really get him.

330
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,980
You know, some people don't.

331
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,500
I do get Dave.

332
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,180
Did anyone offer any solutions to the problem of either not getting or not getting Dave?

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,700
Especially with the delivery.

334
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,700
I've been in delivery services lately.

335
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,840
I noticed a lot of people who sing Ave Maria in the shower this time of the year

336
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,520
or maybe perhaps wear little trinkets on their testicles or other organs.

337
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,140
You know, you see the people with the Santa Claus earrings and stuff like that

338
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,460
singing merry, merry, happy, bad songs.

339
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,520
I hate Christmas.

340
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,100
But at least it's over now. So I guess I can stop hating it for a while.

341
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,980
What's up geniuses? We vomit on Christmas.

342
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,620
No, actually I had a great Christmas.

343
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:18,300
But you know, I'm in a different situation for most because my family is all subgeniuses.

344
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,920
Dave, I hear a strange hum that comes with your phone.

345
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,520
Can you like kick your phone or wiggle it around?

346
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
I'm wondering if I can either kick it or call it back.

347
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,820
It went away.

348
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,740
Tickle it.

349
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,680
Hey, the hum went away.

350
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,920
No, I can still hear it. Can you?

351
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,840
Wiggle it.

352
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,520
Can you still hear it?

353
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,240
I just heard the...

354
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,920
Oh, there...

355
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,240
No, I don't hear it.

356
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,820
I hear the hum.

357
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,720
I don't hear the hum. It's fine. I hear beautiful music. How'd you do that?

358
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,760
Oh, well, I was thinking of Brahms and Bach at the same time and it came up with Brahms and the Tinkshnurr.

359
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,320
And there you had it.

360
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,560
Actually, this is Johann George Albrechtsberger.

361
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,160
Albrechtsberger.

362
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,100
Doing the Conspiracy in E major. Titor Gumfries turned us on to this.

363
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,120
You can find it at Kern's Holler actually.

364
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,000
Johann George Albrechtsberger.

365
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,220
And you'll hear later...

366
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:17,720
Give it a little time and the listeners will hear why we're playing this type of classical music on this particular Hour of Slack.

367
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,280
The kissing goodbye of one annual event and the welcoming in of another.

368
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,840
I always wondered at why those words, you know...

369
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,000
Old father baby time is crawling along in his Alzheimer diapers and changing...

370
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,300
We're changing him. Here we go.

371
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,020
He's playing this harp in the background.

372
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,660
The little baby with the weird Monopoly guy top hat is playing?

373
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,540
Right. No, no. Old man father time baby.

374
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,300
It's the same, you know, it's like, don't tell the kids, but it's the same person.

375
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,340
That's why things don't really change much from year to year.

376
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,140
Well, I was just going to say that I was substantially aware that nothing changed this year,

377
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,620
which is quite precisely why.

378
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,760
Precisely the point of the Church of the Subgenius.

379
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,300
The conspiracy in pinks will continue to rule as long as they continue to rule.

380
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,180
And you will live in a world like that as long as you...

381
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,000
I lost my train of thought there.

382
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,140
I was staring at a bumblebee who apparently drank too much wine and was staggering around on my carpet.

383
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,340
I don't even know where it came from. It's 20 degrees below zero outside.

384
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,020
It's okay, Dave. Everybody loves to watch the train wreck of your mind.

385
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,900
And also the nematodes of your species dish. I mean, your petri dish there.

386
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,760
Well, not everybody has drunken bees on their carpet, you know?

387
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,140
Or nematodes in a petri dish of horror.

388
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,360
Actually, Dave, it's kind of sad, but Nessie and Ned nematode apparently died,

389
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,180
and only one of their little orphan babies is left in there.

390
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,460
And I think they were all eaten up by Sally Cyclops and Simon Cyclops, the copepods.

391
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,300
Because now, every time I look through the microscope, it's like Copepod City.

392
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,880
Well, they're not... they're voracious then, aren't they?

393
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:21,160
Well, they're gigantic. They're like killer whales compared to all the other little bugs in there.

394
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
They're going to start eating themselves pretty soon.

395
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,940
The copepods are so large that you can see them with the nude eye.

396
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,020
And your reading glasses.

397
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,660
It helps to have your reading glasses.

398
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,600
Also a refractory disease, some sort of optic malocclusion of some sort, biting out.

399
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,240
You can tell when they're pregnant, too. The females, anyway.

400
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,800
It's hard to tell with the men, but the male copepods.

401
00:20:49,920 --> 00:21:00,600
But the female Cyclopses, anyway, that type of copepod, carries this big wad of glass balls on its hip, on either hip.

402
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,020
And I guess those glass balls turn into eggs,

403
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
and those turn into little baby copepods.

404
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,060
And that's why my... and that's who's eating up everybody else in the Petri dish of horror.

405
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,000
My concentration camp that I keep on my dining room table, actually.

406
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,680
Well, I'd just like to ask the lovely Mrs. Princess Wiardo if she's noticed in your...

407
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:30,380
in the dining room area there and also in the other places where you sport your tomfoolery,

408
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,780
if she's seen any of these creatures getting bigger than...

409
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,040
as you claim they should have been getting.

410
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:45,400
Dave! Dave! I enjoy looking at all of these creatures right along with Reverend Stang.

411
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:53,100
I think they're quite curious and interesting, and it's always so interesting from his perspective, you know?

412
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,760
Well, that is kind of a dodge, wouldn't you say? A kind of a...

413
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,320
a brief shift of the lesson, wouldn't you say?

414
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,220
That you're kind of making a little ado about the... you know, about them getting bigger.

415
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,380
Well, it's just... it's such a fun, wiggly world, you know? It's all just so crazy in there.

416
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,480
If you know what to look for, you can watch them having sex.

417
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,100
Well, that certainly killed the show.

418
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,480
But you can watch them mutate, as you said before.

419
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:30,320
Mostly they're killing and eating, but they... well, yeah, I'm kind of the Dr. Moreau of microbiology.

420
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,960
I'm into... into kind of doing cross-breeds and so forth.

421
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,060
It's kind of tricky to get a paramecium to mate with an amoeba, but...

422
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,000
But the fun is in trying, you know? The journey's half the fun.

423
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,820
I think it's a rather ironic evocation hobby for you, don't you think? A rather odd one, considering you...

424
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,620
Poor plain god!

425
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,300
... tend to proclaim that you speak for things.

426
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,300


427
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:10,200
I think it's like a... some sort of ubermensch or something or some sort of... that will come and rescue those chosen few people who are better than the others.

428
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,280
Well, okay, first off...

429
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,580
Or less better or not quite as good as, but never... you know what I'm saying.

430
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,900
Not better, just better.

431
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,580
Just badder.

432
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,200
Slack...

433
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,780
... deep fried.

434
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:27,040
... will get you through times of no slack, as Zeppo, the bot, said.

435
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,760
But time will get you through slack.

436
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,920
No, what was the other... what was the...

437
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,200
Slack will get you... get you through times of no slack.

438
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,680
... and the turnstile.

439
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,480
That's why it's slack, baby!

440
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Yep, that's why it slaps you in the face like a hot salmon.

441
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:52,400
Well... well, friends, we're kissing goodnight to the year of 2000-ought-nine.

442
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,180
And, uh... now, Dave...

443
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,160
God, man. Oh, that's been so sweet.

444
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:58,540
I'm gonna... you...

445
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm gonna...

446
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,740
And you guys want...

447
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,820
... the baby's diaper stain bonds.

448
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Because I... I'm embracing this year so wonderfully, of nike... of two-ninety... which is... it

449
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,780
is 98-90... no?

450
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,300
Not 98-1, that's the year that the world almost comes to an end.

451
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,640
2010.

452
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:24,840
Princess, we was getting, uh, confused between, uh, 2010 and 2012, cause one... in one, the

453
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,620
whole world ends, and in the other one, something wonderful.

454
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,040
It will happen.

455
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,400
Well, this is also the warm-up, in the other way of speaking.

456
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,180
First, something is hap... going to happen, something wonderful, and then the Mayans will

457
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,160
destroy the world.

458
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,260
Yeah, one...

459
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,600
Only... only... only...

460
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:49,040
... let's face it, this ain't really 2010... coming up, or now.

461
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,960
We don't know what year it is, we don't even know what planet this is.

462
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,120
Right, it's kind of a really, really poorly done hologram.

463
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,340
On a major scale, you might say.

464
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,840
Some of us don't really know who our parents are.

465
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,860
Some of us don't even know who our kids are.

466
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,820
Some of us aren't aware that there are no such things as parents.

467
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,760
There are these, uh, other holograms that have, uh, may or still...

468
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
Now you're getting ahead of yourself, Dave, that's in future time.

469
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,780
I don't want to dump the ball, as they used to say in Spanish, but, uh, the fact remains

470
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,420
that many, uh, of the listeners out there who have the ear balls to hear, let them hear

471
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:23,840
this.

472
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
That this world is not going to continue.

473
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,280
It's going to continue too much longer in the present shape it is, one way or another.

474
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,840
Well, we have some predictions here for the year of 2009.

475
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,320
I can hardly wait.

476
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:45,860
I'm in the spirit, I'm in discernment, I'm getting, uh, an uncut wave of pure feeling

477
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,700
and knowledge from the time that is the timeless all time of all things.

478
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,060
The cash... the uncashed records, you might say.

479
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,860
And, uh, I'm... I'm... I'm seeing an increase in the number of people that are watching this.

480
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:56,860


481
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,820
Now I'm... I'm in my crystal ball, that in January 3rd of 2009, Israel will or did launch

482
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,180
a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.

483
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:15,560
But then, not four days later, Russia will or did shut off all gas supplies to Europe

484
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,840
going through the Ukraine.

485
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,060
Well, that's what they did in, uh, 2009.

486
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,560
Or will do in 2009, depending on when you're listening to this show.

487
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:26,860
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

488
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:38,480
What if you're listening to it from the vapid space of 2010 where we're not even allowed to mention what happened those last few final days of 2009?

489
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,740
Exactly. That's why we have to couch it in these terms.

490
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:50,160
Because in the year 2010, nobody's allowed to speak the truth or lies unless they're funny.

491
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,120
Well, that's where we're in trouble.

492
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,420
That's where I'm afraid it's all going to fall apart.

493
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,980
Now, this may seem crazy.

494
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,800
Now, this may seem crazy.

495
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:15,320
I predict that on January 20th of 2009, a black man known as Barack Obama will be inaugurated as 44th President of the United States.

496
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,100
Now, you may say, well, that sounds like science fiction.

497
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,180
That couldn't happen in redneck America.

498
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,580
But I say that it will.

499
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,040
Well, can I?

500
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,500
The poor bastard.

501
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,480
The poor.

502
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
Well, go ahead.

503
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,240
I was just thinking of my own personal prediction.

504
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,280
I've been staring at my ball quite as well.

505
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:43,120
And I predict alongside concurrently with your prediction that on January, is it?

506
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,520
January 20th of 2009.

507
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,600
I dare to be that specific.

508
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,320
On January of this year.

509
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,760
20, 30.

510
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,380
Sometimes towards the end of January of this year.

511
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,460
2010.

512
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:08,260
That a slack man will be inhibited from growing fungally in the orifices of most small animals.

513
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,220
Well, that's a pretty easy prediction to make, Dave.

514
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,800
Because that's always been true and probably always be true.

515
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
They always hold the slack man down.

516
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,280
Just because.

517
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,920
Because they're jealous, mainly, I think.

518
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,380
Yeah, man.

519
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,520
They don't know what it's like to be tough slack.

520
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,000
And so they.

521
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,980
But they don't.

522
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,320
They know that somebody somewhere might be having slack.

523
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,700
So they better put an end to it.

524
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,500
Yep.

525
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,060
Oh, yeah.

526
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,820
The pink man is always trying to hold down the slack man.

527
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,960
They always talk about how.

528
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,720
But it ain't going to work.

529
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,940
Big ears and stuff to hear with.

530
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,420
Like in big pineal glands to smell with.

531
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,220
And different anachronistic.

532
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,600
Oh, you're thinking of a different president.

533
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,220
That's H. Ross Perot.

534
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,280
With the giant ears and pineal gland that sticks off.

535
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,700
Hangs off the front of his face.

536
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,640
That was.

537
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,340
In a different.

538
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,760
That's what that is.

539
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
His pineal gland is hanging out.

540
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,640
It was.

541
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,400
Was.

542
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:58,700
Right.

543
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,640
Was hanging out.

544
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,040
The pineal gland is for whiff reading, isn't it?

545
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,640
Well, it's a vestigial, useless leftover that's attached to the third nostril,

546
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,780
which is actually what you use for whiff reading.

547
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,440
After you've had it opened by the surgeries in Dobbs Town,

548
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,880
by the Dobbs monks and the nun snakes and the lovely flying cherubs

549
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,880
with their sutures and needles and flitting back and forth.

550
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,260
And their bone saws cracking open the front of your head,

551
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,160
opening the third nostril, making a nice little plastic surgery,

552
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,100
winking eye right in the center.

553
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,940
The dim lights of the night table, the orderlies rushing by in their scrubs,

554
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,920
the blood on the floor, your pineal gland hanging from your forehead.

555
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,300
It's not a pretty sight, but it's the only thing you've got to look forward to.

556
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,340
And there's nothing better than a blueberry pineal gland.

557
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,840
Mm-hmm.

558
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,820
Literally all you have to look forward to.

559
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,580
Because it's right there in front of your eyes, right?

560
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:04,540
Now, I predict, I predict on January of 2009,

561
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,260
the former Union of Congolese Patriots leader, Thomas Lubanga,

562
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,980
will be accused of training child soldiers to kill, pillage, and rape.

563
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,540
You know, that does, it sounds as crazy as a Criswell prediction.

564
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,980
Just to read the action.

565
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,120
It's the most controversial news that really did happen.

566
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,720
Doesn't it?

567
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,360
Indeed.

568
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,040
Well, I know.

569
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,580
Yeah, sure, training child soldiers to kill, pillage, and rape.

570
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,140
Since when are children going to be raping?

571
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,420
Well, that's why they have to train them, I guess.

572
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,140
Well, yeah.

573
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,840
2009.

574
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,540
Post-order drills.

575
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:46,120
Now, to counter that, though, on January 26th of 2009,

576
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,620
I predict the Icelandic government and banking system will collapse

577
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,240
and Prime Minister Gerhard,

578
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,240
will immediately resign.

579
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,940
Wow, man.

580
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,220
That sounds absurd, because, yeah, why Iceland?

581
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,740
Nobody even thinks about Iceland.

582
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,640
Well, plus, we all know that its economy is,

583
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,040
there's the major economy in Europe right now.

584
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,100
And by the way, if you went into a restroom as a Latin American,

585
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,740
or a South American,

586
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,420
and you exited the bathroom as a North American,

587
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,780
what would you have been in the bathroom?

588
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,900
A Meso-American?

589
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,220
Making a big mess?

590
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,360
That's one of them.

591
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,780
The one I was thinking of was European.

592
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,720
Oh, I get it.

593
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,600
Because you'd be urinating.

594
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,040
I get that part of it.

595
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah, sure.

596
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,160
I don't know what that has to do with a prediction.

597
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,520
I'm sorry.

598
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,540
No, well, it has a lot to do with it,

599
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,600
because remember how I mentioned that the Icelandic government

600
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,280
and banking system would collapse on January 26th?

601
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,980
Well, three days later, on February 1st,

602
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,980
you are...

603
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,340
Anna Sigurðard Yttir

604
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,360
will be appointed as the new Prime Minister of Iceland,

605
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,480
the world's first openly lesbian head of government.

606
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:06,920
Wow.

607
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,120
That's...

608
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,880
Now, that sounds like something Criswell would have said.

609
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,260
An open lesbian will be Prime Minister of Iceland

610
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,440
in the year 2009.

611
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,460
But, in fact, that will happen.

612
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,560
This, to me, is like listening to...

613
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,380
is like...

614
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,980
reading my book, which I forgot to bring to the night table here,

615
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,700
entitled Predictions.

616
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,320
And it was a book written...

617
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,100
created in the 1950s.

618
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,780
It was a compilation of all the most bizarre predictions

619
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,540
of the 19th century.

620
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,120
There were things of when the automobile was first invented,

621
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,020
where in the year 2000,

622
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,700
everybody would be wearing these huge goggles

623
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,560
and large suits and so forth and stuff

624
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,360
because they hadn't invented it.

625
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,560
They hadn't invented real windshields yet.

626
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,160
Right.

627
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,260
Yeah, because the danger of flying along in the air so fast.

628
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:00,900
There was one...

629
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,100
Birds and things would hit you.

630
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,640
There was one of the year of 19...

631
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,620
in 1901 of what it will look like in 2001

632
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,100
where the roads were just...

633
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,740
there were billboards everywhere.

634
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,620
And it was very, very ironic or...

635
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,600
No, what's the wrong word?

636
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,780
Disgustingly accurate.

637
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,940
Disgustingly accurate.

638
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,100
Just like yours are.

639
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,840
I mean, the ones that you've read.

640
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,680
Well, you know, there's a wonderful old movie

641
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,260
called Just Imagine that takes place...

642
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,020
It was made in the year of 1930 or so,

643
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,600
and it takes place in the year 1980.

644
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,140
Just imagine.

645
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:38,820
1980.

646
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,500
And people have numbers instead of names,

647
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,940
and you're assigned...

648
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,520
The government decides who you're going to marry,

649
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,980
and they have...

650
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,640
Instead of eating, they take food pills.

651
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,360
Mm-hmm.

652
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,280
In the year 1980,

653
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,980
Now, in...

654
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:02,080
I predict that in February of 2009,

655
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:03,920
Melbourne, Australia,

656
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,360
will record the highest ever temperature

657
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,760
in any capital city,

658
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,360
115 degrees Fahrenheit.

659
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,760
Now, come on, not on Earth.

660
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,440
150?

661
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,600
115.

662
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,960
It was 115 degrees in February

663
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,320
in Melbourne, Australia.

664
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,100
February, Derek.

665
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,280
But remember, they're hanging upside down,

666
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,680
so everything's all different there.

667
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,080
Well, the hottest temperature in Death Valley

668
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,660
ever recorded was 115.

669
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,240
Well, but that's not downtown Big City.

670
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,460
That's just in the suburbs of Death.

671
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,220
You're right.

672
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,160
Right, the valley.

673
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,360
Well, yeah, they like it there.

674
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,860
I mean, that's why skeletons love it

675
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,580
when it's that...

676
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,180
To them, that's breezy.

677
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,280
Oh, nice.

678
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,740
Anything else is cold.

679
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
You know, if you're a skeleton,

680
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,560
100 degrees is kind of chilly.

681
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,160
Well, I predict that in the year 2009-10,

682
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,660
which is a backwards-forwards kind of way of looking at it,

683
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,740
that we will all be skeletons

684
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,480
whistling in the breeze,

685
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
conducting our everyday business

686
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,560
as if we were fleas,

687
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,240
or as we please.

688
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
You know what I mean?

689
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,940
We'd just be going to...

690
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,220
We could make a country-western song out of that.

691
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,360
Oh, I already have.

692
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,260
I've turned it into a wobbly anthem

693
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,800
where the working man,

694
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,540
who has to take over the factories

695
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,520
and start producing really, really rich grower cheese

696
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,580
instead of all these metallic objects.

697
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,400
Now, in February of 2009,

698
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,300
a Russian...

699
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,500
I predict a Russian and an American satellite

700
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,260
will collide over Siberia,

701
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
creating a large amount of space junk!

702
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,400
Space junk!

703
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,280
Peru 2!

704
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,980
Well, that's not...

705
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,240
Texas!

706
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,320
That's not such a wild...

707
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,700
Kansas!

708
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,440
Because space junk does...

709
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,000
Christmas!

710
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,080
...has since the devonics

711
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,500
actually whispered those words into our...

712
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,400
front, front, front, front, front, front, front, front.

713
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,740
Space junk!

714
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,100
People are going to think, people are going to think,

715
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,760
people are going to think you're a space junk!

716
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,580
I like when they name off the states.

717
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,240
Texas!

718
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,220
You know.

719
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:16,740
Yeah.

720
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,120
Now, the next day, I predict...

721
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,600
Oh, that one's not interesting.

722
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,280
It's...

723
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,320
Prime...

724
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,620
A new prime minister of Zimbabwe

725
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,000
following a power-sharing deal with President Bob Mugabe,

726
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,660
the greatest leader of all time.

727
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,800
J.R. Bob Mugabe.

728
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,580
J.R. Bob Mugabe,

729
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,560
who's...

730
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,960
who had inflation at the one trillion percent inflation in his country.

731
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,600
Let's see.

732
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,740
Ew.

733
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,280
Ew.

734
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:46,860
Oh.

735
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,460
Well, now, we have a whole string of assassinations and coups coming up

736
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,760
in March of 2009.

737
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,820
The president of Guinea-Bissau,

738
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,540
which I've never even heard of,

739
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,840
will be assassinated.

740
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,680
The International Criminal Court will issue an arrest warrant

741
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,180
for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir

742
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,620
for war crimes against humanity in Darfur.

743
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,540
And, lastly,

744
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,820
the president of Madagascar will be overthrown in a coup d'etat.

745
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,080
And Hamburger will be all over the highlands.

746
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,920
By the way, in Mystic, Connecticut.

747
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,240
Oh!

748
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,940
I don't...

749
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,320
Train commuters in Mexico City will be wearing surgical masks

750
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,280
due to outbreaks of...

751
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,100
swine flu.

752
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,840
Well, I predict that in such a following year,

753
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,960
in the upcoming one that we are designed to be in right now,

754
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,220
that...

755
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,700
hexagon computers will also be falsified

756
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,960
into wearing undergarments on public transit.

757
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,020
Thank you.

758
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,800
Take my word for it.

759
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:54,900
I believe you.

760
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,600
I believe you.

761
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,680
You wouldn't lie.

762
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,380
I'm not...

763
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,760
Listen to this.

764
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,440
I'm not spouting the usual trans...

765
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,580
trans bites

766
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,140
that you hear so regularly on the figu-mental radio and televisions.

767
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,940
And this is the real poop.

768
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,660
Now, listen to this.

769
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,660
Listen to this now, Dave.

770
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,660
...that the arms sing

771
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,780
for us two.

772
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,000
For us two.

773
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,620
For us two.

774
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,000
Every day.

775
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,040
Every day.

776
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,800
I don't...

777
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,780
I don't...

778
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,760
It's true.

779
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Thank you.

780
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,020
It's, um, Lolita.

781
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,340
I thought it was Marlena Daytrick.

782
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,040
No, it's Lolita doing...

783
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,940
...from Yoyoyoyotay.

784
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,180
...Theme from a Summer Place.

785
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,000
That was one of my mom's favorite albums.

786
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,900
Oh, I remember that, too.

787
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,520
In Berkish Garden, we used to sit around the patio,

788
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,860
which was actually the...

789
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,220
Never mind, I...

790
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,800
My mind's taking a bad turn, right?

791
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,720
No, I don't want to say what I'm thinking.

792
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,220
Now, uh, what else happened in, uh...

793
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,860
What else did God do in 2009?

794
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,780
Oh, he caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake in...

795
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,040
Oh, thank God.

796
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,020
...La Chila, Italy, where he La Chilad nearly 300 people.

797
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,100
That's not good.

798
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,440
God had people in Peru sentence their former president, Alberto Fujimori,

799
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,840
funny name for a Peruvian, to 25 years in prison for ordering killings and kidnapping.

800
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,020
Snappings by security forces.

801
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,500
And a political crisis will begin in Fiji in 2009,

802
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,520
when President Josefa Oiloilo...

803
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,920
Oh!

804
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,900
...suspends the nation's constitution, dismisses all judges and constitutional appointees,

805
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,320
and assumes all governance in the country.

806
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,400
What I think is very nice about their prediction, Stangeman,

807
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,820
is that you've mentioned the fact that, you know,

808
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,520
while we wonder why all these foreign wars,

809
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,380
and, uh, strange political events are occurring around the globe in such obscure places as Fiji,

810
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:05,400
it's not hard to imagine why, when we think that the man's name was Oili, Oili, Oili.

811
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,000
Oiloilo.

812
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,200
Oiloilo.

813
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,000
I swear to God.

814
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,380
Well, you know, I'm...

815
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,800
...interested in Fiji because there's Oiloilo there.

816
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,300
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

817
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
Earth means nothing.

818
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,240
What, Earth means nothing?

819
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:22,580
Yeah.

820
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:22,820
Yeah.

821
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:22,820


822
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:22,820


823
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:22,820


824
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,940
Are we getting that command again?

825
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,680
No, I got distracted.

826
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,960
It's all right.

827
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,640
Everything's okay.

828
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,260
Everything's okay.

829
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,040
I thought you were, you know, messing with the thing, and they were going...

830
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,560
Because finally, in May of 2009,

831
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,560
I predict that following a quarter century of fighting,

832
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,220
the Sri Lankan Civil War will end with the total military defeat of the LTTE.

833
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,180
Which is the Tamil Tigers?

834
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,200
I guess so.

835
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,600
Legal extremists?

836
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,280
Yeah.

837
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,240
And the legal...

838
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,560
No.

839
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:52,980
No.

840
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,300
By the same token, in South Korea, former president Roh Moo-hyun, the human,

841
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,400
will be under investigation for bribery during his term and commit suicide.

842
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:14,880
Meanwhile, in North Korea, they will announce a second successful nuclear test.

843
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,340
I call it a test.

844
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,380
In which...

845
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,200
Which...

846
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,300
Which...

847
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,780
Which...

848
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:21,920
Which...

849
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,540
Which...

850
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:22,960
Which...

851
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,640
North Korea.

852
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,520
North Korea.

853
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,220
North Korea.

854
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,500
And, uh...

855
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,560
They're always, uh, causing bad stuff.

856
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,580
Don't they?

857
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,500
I...

858
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:32,840
I...

859
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,340
I...

860
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:33,700
I...

861
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,100
I have another prediction.

862
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,200
Eh?

863
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:45,360
I believe that on October 30th of 2010, Dr. Howell will announce he's running for Congress.

864
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,440
Oh, you mean 2009?

865
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,680
I mean, well, yes.

866
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,500
That's right.

867
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:49,660
That's right.

868
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,660
Dr. Howell is...

869
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,360
Well, there's certainly a Facebook page to elect Dr. Howell, the great subgenius thinker

870
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,300
and yakker.

871
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,240
There's not only a Facebook page.

872
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:03,500
The answerer.

873
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,080
There's a...

874
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:13,700
There's an http://tinyurl.com slash electdrhowell2010 if you're interested to read about more of it.

875
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,120
Oh, oh.

876
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,020
So it's tinyurl.com slash electdrhowell2010?

877
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,820
Yes.

878
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,340
Yes.

879
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,760
And thank you.

880
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,400
There's a funny...

881
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,940
Thank you, Rocknarr.

882
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,220
Thank you very much for that.

883
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,480
Yes, Governor Rocknarr set that up, and there's like hundreds of people behind him now.

884
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,000
Hundreds.

885
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,780
So, you know...

886
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:30,980
And they've got a big...

887
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,700
Today, California.

888
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:32,980
Uberales.

889
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,620
Tomorrow, the Verde.

890
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,200
California.

891
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,260
Uber...

892
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:37,740
I...

893
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,140
I...

894
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,480
I think that's going to happen.

895
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:44,780
I think much like Upton's in Clara Lewis, he's going to reorganize the state in a way

896
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,440
that the federal authorities are going to be forced to attack Sacramento with their eyes

897
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:51,720
shut.

898
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,160
Uh, uh, wearing bunny hats?

899
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,000
No, no, no, no.

900
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,580
Now, almost halfway...

901
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,200
Huh?

902
00:42:59,660 --> 00:42:59,920
Huh?

903
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,660
I'm just trying to waste your time.

904
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,420
The bunny hats, well, now, those, yes.

905
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:14,120
And I predict that in the year 1895, glass bunny hats will be worn by the swells and

906
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,160
the gents, gentlemen and ladies of the upper classes.

907
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,980
I predict that if the women...

908
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Continue to get as much power as they want by the year 2000, they'll all be smoking cigarettes

909
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,120
and be in charge of the military, giving men the orders.

910
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,820
Well, I had to do the dishes.

911
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,260
Half part of them.

912
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,000
Gosh, they're bringing back the glass rabbit hats?

913
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,760
Now, on, uh...

914
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,320
I predict, friends, if you're planning to fly from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris,

915
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,820
don't take flight Air France 447 on June 1st, 2009.

916
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,380
Because you're going to be in charge of the military.

917
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,380


918
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:52,380


919
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,520
Because you'll crash in the ocean and all die.

920
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,900
You are uncanny.

921
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:09,140
I predict that an outbreak of an H1N1 influenza strain, commonly referred to as hog cold,

922
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,720
will be deemed a global pandemic.

923
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,460
Nostrus tangus.

924
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,180
And yet, nothing much will come of it.

925
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,600
Nostrus tangus.

926
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,000
It will be a handy...

927
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,620
It will be a handy scare.

928
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,440
Another great scare, like SARS.

929
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,180
And what was one last year?

930
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,040
Oh, bird flu.

931
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:28,900
Avian flu.

932
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,300
Yeah, we're all going to die of avian flu.

933
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,720
Now we're going to die of pig flu.

934
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,400
Next, we're going to die of monkey flu.

935
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,320
Then it's going to be goldfish flu.

936
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,260
But everyone knows that goldfish never flew.

937
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:45,060
The flying fish flew, and the flying squirrels did, but not the goldfish.

938
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:45,820
What?

939
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,940
What?

940
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,080
What?

941
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,500
What?

942
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


943
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


944
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,340
What?

945
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


946
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


947
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


948
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


949
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


950
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


951
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


952
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


953
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


954
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


955
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


956
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


957
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


958
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


959
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


960
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


961
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,340


962
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:59,520
Squims and the electronic fishes were all joined together in a gigantic melange of boo-boo

963
00:44:59,520 --> 00:44:59,740
ply.

964
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,920
They wanted to be friends.

965
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,680
They were tired of fighting and crying and pulling out each other's eyes.

966
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,060
One of the smarter fish, the river and ivory stink, condemned the rest of the fish, saying

967
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,160
that they were unfit.

968
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,180
Unfit?

969
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:15,260
Unfound.

970
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,860
And didn't taste good.

971
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,760
You're unfit.

972
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,460
All of you.

973
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,660
Damn you.

974
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,360
I had to stop there because of physical problems.

975
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:31,080
Now, Princess Wee, what is the name of the president of Iran who will be re-elected despite

976
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,980
tremendous...

977
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,220
Black Luster Blimey, I think.

978
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,920
You know how to pronounce his name funnily.

979
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,440
Zorag the Magnificent.

980
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:37,740
No.

981
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,320
Mamut.

982
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,460
Akhman-e.

983
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,960
Akhman-e.

984
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,140
Akhman-e.

985
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:43,800
Akhman-e.

986
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:43,920
Akhman-e.

987
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:43,960
Akhman-e.

988
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,160
Akhman-e.

989
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


990
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


991
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


992
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


993
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


994
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


995
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,160


996
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:44,940
Akhman-e.

997
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,520
Akhman-e.

998
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,640
Akhman-e.

999
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,500
Akhman-e.

1000
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,920
Akhman-e.

1001
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,180
Akhman-e.

1002
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,760
Akhman-e.

1003
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,080
Akhman-e.

1004
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,380
Akhman-e.

1005
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:30,440
Mississippi River Basin, attack St. Louis, leaving thousands of orphaned children and strung out moms and dads with no toothpaste and other people that just didn't want to get out of St. Louis.

1006
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:43,380
And it will go so far up the Mississippi that it will even attack St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Jude and St. Claire, Wisconsin.

1007
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,880
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1008
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:48,660
I'm sorry.

1009
00:46:48,820 --> 00:47:01,220
And we'll also be responsible for the death on June 25th, 2009, of American entertainer Michael Jackson, St. Michael, which will trigger an outpouring of world grief.

1010
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:09,660
And reactions to this event will cripple several major websites and Internet services.

1011
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:18,280
Because of the terrible tragedy of losing such an important artist who, one day before he died,

1012
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,140
was being reviled as a child molester all over everywhere.

1013
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,120
All you have to do, man, nothing.

1014
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,420
Death makes the greatest PR agent ever.

1015
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,860
Avar.

1016
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,280
Truly.

1017
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,220
No, that's your thing.

1018
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,700
Avar.

1019
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:44,480
I predict that a balloon bag baby will climb into his father's elements and continue to harangue the atmosphere from a pretty high altitude.

1020
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,580
It'll be out there all the time, you know.

1021
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,260
And that a...

1022
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,820
An irate jumble of news services will continue to fog the issues.

1023
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,180
And Hu Jintao, the new former prince...

1024
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,480
The human.

1025
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:09,900
Not prince, but the first party secretary of the Chinese thing there, will join hands and feet with all those people.

1026
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,820
And that'll be it for us, you know.

1027
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,960
I want to make these scary ones.

1028
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,260
Like the children are going...

1029
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,520
They start growing hair on their feet and big fangs, you know.

1030
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,780
Stuff like that.

1031
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,380
But sometimes America's got to wake up.

1032
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,700
Because...

1033
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,980
Well, there's good news.

1034
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,280
It's not all bad news.

1035
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:41,600
I predict that in August of 2009, Bolivia will become the first South American country to declare the right of indigenous people to govern themselves.

1036
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,360
Now, see, it did only took how many...

1037
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,500
500?

1038
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,780
Yeah, only 500.

1039
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,140
600?

1040
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,260
500?

1041
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:48,260


1042
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:48,700
500 years?

1043
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,140
Yeah.

1044
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,600
Yeah.

1045
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,620
So that's, you know, things are moving along.

1046
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,040
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop.

1047
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,980
About llama speed, I would say.

1048
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,840
Well, they can go pretty good, but...

1049
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:05,180
Yeah, I guess we're going to have to put that in the plus column and order two more fried rice.

1050
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:14,160
I predict that North Korean leader Kim Jong-il will pardon two American journalists who've been arrested for illegal entry into North Korea

1051
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,260
after a reach-around from U.S. President Bill...

1052
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:18,560
Bill Clinton.

1053
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,040
Okay.

1054
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:31,140
Typhoon Morakot will hit Taiwan, killing 500 and stranding more than 1,000 in the worst flooding in this island in half a century.

1055
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,560
Friends, there's signs in the heaven and signs in the earth.

1056
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,740
Bob predicted it.

1057
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,880
Blood belching from the earth.

1058
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,540
And great waves, tidal waves.

1059
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,820
It's never happened before.

1060
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,320
And crazy weather.

1061
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,880
That's never happened before either.

1062
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,640
These things shall be harbingers of the end times.

1063
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,300
The end for those who never became subgenius ministers.

1064
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,880
But it will be the beginning times for those who had faith in Bob, kept up the FIB.

1065
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,260
A mental case.

1066
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,060
Right.

1067
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:10,860
And kept their mentats in the right cases in case of wars and rumors of wars.

1068
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,180
And SARS and rumors of SARS.

1069
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,640
Hallelujah.

1070
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,420
Hallelujah.

1071
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,860
I can't...

1072
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,260
I can't disagree with you more.

1073
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,460
And yet at the same time, I want to pound the tambourine and say whatever the hell you like.

1074
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,240
Some sort of ditto head or something.

1075
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,140
Just, you know, repeat everything you say.

1076
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,120
Hallelujah.

1077
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,960
Hallelujah.

1078
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,520
Hallelujah.

1079
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,420
Hallelujah.

1080
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,580
Hallelujah.

1081
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,340
It's hard to pursue a future.

1082
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:46,800
Hallelujah.

1083
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,560
Hallelujah.

1084
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:47,860
Hallelujah.

1085
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:47,860


1086
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:47,860


1087
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:47,860


1088
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:47,860


1089
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,760
shock or dismay us.

1090
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,480
It's hard to think of a future

1091
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,180
that makes us feel all soft and squishy,

1092
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,540
like a beaten-up tennis ball.

1093
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,460
I think if we just have faith in our leaders,

1094
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,920
everything will be just fine.

1095
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,760
Don't you think?

1096
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,920
Just have faith.

1097
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,780
Just trust whoever is the authority.

1098
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:09,820
Give it a try.

1099
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,140
Quit questioning authority.

1100
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:11,800
God.

1101
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,160
It seems like the more you question,

1102
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,560
the more problems you have.

1103
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,460
Why not just...

1104
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,500
Oh.

1105
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,540
Kill them all and Bob sort them out.

1106
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,060
That's what I say.

1107
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,700
That was the prediction about 1984, wasn't it?

1108
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,080
But, well, now the world leaders that used to run,

1109
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,280
the world used to run on a G8,

1110
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,160
and they have improved that.

1111
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,580
It's now the G20 of world leaders.

1112
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,260
20 little cylinders popping off at one time during the season, yeah.

1113
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,840
Finding ways to make the rich richer and the poor.

1114
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:45,580
Or...

1115
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,480
Invisible.

1116
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,160
Invisible.

1117
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,620
Invisible.

1118
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,300
And you know there's...

1119
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:51,540
Invisible.

1120
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,360
Oils lubricating them pistons in them cylinders.

1121
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,820
I don't know why I said that twice in a row.

1122
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,720
I don't want to be a...

1123
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,700
Well, it's like us...

1124
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,700
Diseffective to the energy consortiums of the world.

1125
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,640
We non-rich people are the grease used in those engines

1126
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,080
to keep them running smoothly

1127
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,760
so the rich people can drive around.

1128
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,440
But, Pam, you live...

1129
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:13,560
Since...

1130
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:13,800
Since...

1131
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:13,800


1132
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:13,800


1133
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
Stang bitterly.

1134
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,260
Jealously.

1135
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,380
The Mesozoic Oink gravy.

1136
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,620
Let's see.

1137
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:22,200
When did they create them?

1138
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,900
Dinosaurs that got frozen into pie.

1139
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,000
Well, over a period of time,

1140
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,900
from about 300 million years ago

1141
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,540
to when the men from Planet X first showed up

1142
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,260
about 60 million years ago.

1143
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,320
So was that the geodesic or the harmonic age?

1144
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,620
Oh, that was the Devonian.

1145
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,540
Devonian?

1146
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:42,940
Oh, no, no.

1147
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,640
That was before.

1148
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,360
That was more like the talking Hedzian

1149
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,300
or the Elvis Costello-ian age.

1150
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,740
I get mixed up.

1151
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,660
That was which one was ahead of which.

1152
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,500
Right.

1153
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,880
It was right before the Archezoid period,

1154
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,720
which was a very, very long series of cramps

1155
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,700
brought on by the Devonians.

1156
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,700
And we...

1157
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,300
She's a woman.

1158
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,100
She knows about Archezoid cramps.

1159
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,140
I do.

1160
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,300
I actually do know.

1161
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,080
That's true.

1162
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,120
They come once every 28 million years and...

1163
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,900
Exactly.

1164
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,200
Exactly.

1165
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,320
And when the Earth goes ow, ow, ow,

1166
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,600
I'm going to, you know...

1167
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,980
That's a womanly thing.

1168
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,500
Well, the planet is a womanly thing.

1169
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,940
Only women bleed, right?

1170
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,080
I was going to go...

1171
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,220
I'm interested in going to see a bunch of women bleed

1172
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,500
in March of the year 2010

1173
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,160
when the opening bout of this year's season

1174
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,140
of roller derby starts in Cleveland

1175
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,920
with the Burning River Roller Girls.

1176
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,140
Oh, man.

1177
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,560
The Hard Knockers.

1178
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:43,600
Yeah.

1179
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,760
Our team is the Hard Knockers.

1180
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,380
But they're going to be up against the Rolling Pinups

1181
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,160
on March 13th.

1182
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,580
And then the second game is the Hell Bombers

1183
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:57,340
versus the Cleveland Steamers.

1184
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,420
Now, I kind of like them because of their name.

1185
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,460
But those are actual real roller derby teams

1186
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,660
here in northern Ohio.

1187
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,500
And the Burning River Roller Girls are going to start.

1188
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,520
We missed this last season.

1189
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,440
But I've...

1190
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,000
I've kind of gotten interested in that.

1191
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,100
For some reason, Princess Wee is not interested

1192
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,660
in seeing husky young women

1193
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,940
ramming into each other at high speeds.

1194
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,340
I only wanted to go when my friend's daughter was doing it.

1195
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,480
And once she got out of it, I have no further interest.

1196
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,500
Well, but see, your friend's daughter gave us a catalog

1197
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,420
that had pictures of all the team members

1198
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,700
of all the roller derby teams in Ohio.

1199
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,860
Which piqued your interest, and it hasn't ended.

1200
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:42,640
It piqued...

1201
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,920
It piqued...

1202
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:43,040
It piqued...

1203
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,120
It piqued...

1204
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,300
It piqued...

1205
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:43,300


1206
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:43,300


1207
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:43,300


1208
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:43,300


1209
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,060
It piqued...

1210
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,300
It piqued...

1211
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1212
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1213
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1214
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1215
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1216
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1217
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1218
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1219
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,860
I used my audio editing program, Peak.

1220
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,520
He went into a fit of Peak.

1221
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:51,020
Yeah.

1222
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,620
But...

1223
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:54,460
Well, I remember Wendy Williams,

1224
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,800
before she turned into a fish,

1225
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,320
was the head of a huge girls' ladies' wrestling team

1226
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,540
that I actually tried to join.

1227
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,320
I actually went to the auditions and...

1228
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:06,840
Did you really?

1229
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:07,980
Yeah.

1230
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,040
I had to do this zip-up mommy and the whole deal going on.

1231
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:12,340
Really?

1232
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,280
I had a wig that was really...

1233
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,720
Really itchy, too, by the way.

1234
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:19,940
And I didn't convince anybody, but they invited me back to sell wieners.

1235
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,160
I bet.

1236
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,760
If you're not too old for it, Dave, you can try again.

1237
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,380
Sodas and so forth, you know.

1238
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,720
Roller derby's coming back big.

1239
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,500
Now, let's get through the predictions here real fast.

1240
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,780
Roman Polanski will be arrested in Switzerland, Cleveland.

1241
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,080
See, he's going to be a wrestler, too, in Cleveland.

1242
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,700
Yeah, he'll be a wrestler with the roller derbies and be arrested for it.

1243
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,320
But let's see.

1244
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:49,040
A tsunami near the Samoan Islands will do its usual thing.

1245
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:55,380
There'll be an earthquake off Sumatra, which will cause Skull Island to sink even farther beneath the waves.

1246
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,920
Atlantis will rise in the middle of Kansas.

1247
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,560
That's in Revelation X, I think, or Dateline for Dominance.

1248
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,280
But it is Kansas. It hasn't been moved to Missouri.

1249
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,420
It's actually Kansas right now.

1250
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,340
But I predict that...

1251
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:17,560
European astronomers will discover 32 exoplanets in October of 2009.

1252
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:28,020
And that in November, NASA will announce that it has found a significant quantity of water in the moon's Cabeus crater.

1253
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,640
Yes, a crater of the moon harbors water as well as a small amount of cheap vodka.

1254
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,220
Wow.

1255
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,600
A goobriel goodness.

1256
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:37,460
Yes.

1257
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,280
Oh, and finally...

1258
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,620
Oh, this is the very last prediction.

1259
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:50,580
As we approach the end of the show, CERN in Switzerland will restart the Large Hadron Collider Particle Accelerator in Geneva.

1260
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:57,240
And the world will end in mass hallucinations that it hasn't ended yet.

1261
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,660
Wow.

1262
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:03,600
And it ends along with this witch disco recording from Starwood last year.

1263
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,160
That was the end of that.

1264
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,140
That was the end.

1265
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,240
And it's...

1266
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,940
The end of the show almost.

1267
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,700
Yes, yes, yes.

1268
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,780
Oh, yes, we must.

1269
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,680
We must go.

1270
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,400
We could at least have a few more really coarse arguments.

1271
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,840
Or perhaps we could do root stunts in the buff.

1272
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,760
No, no, no.

1273
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,260
We've done the root stunts in the buff and we have to go.

1274
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:35,280
It's time to go because the proper next show, the good show, will be coming.

1275
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,560
No pedagogical arguments.

1276
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,660
No...

1277
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:39,780
No...

1278
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,520
No...

1279
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,900
No, no, no.

1280
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,380
In fact, I'm fading you very slowly out right now, Dave, because we really have to go.

1281
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,500
It's...

1282
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,900
It really sounds like the hour of slack.

1283
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,740
Bye, Dave.

1284
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:02,840
It's...

1285
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This music in the background is Leo Cupper radio.

1286
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,580
Leo Cupper with a C.

1287
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,160
Again, thanks to Tater for turning us on to this.

1288
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,080
But I'm going to let us go out with a little smash.

1289
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,160
And that will be the end of this hour of slack.

1290
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,980
Thank you.

1291
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,020
You're normally such a slacker.

1292
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:28,960
It's the first time you've heard of him.

1293
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,740
Are all four of you guys in here?

1294
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,380
Is Phil in there?

1295
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,060
He just...

1296
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,300
Yeah, yeah.

1297
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:31,820
Can we...

1298
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:32,940
Do it with four?

1299
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:33,600
Yeah, all four.

1300
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,120
Okay.

1301
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,700
What are we doing?

1302
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,140
How do we...

1303
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:35,560
This is...

1304
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,320
This is...

1305
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,060
Oh, the hour of slack.

1306
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,420
They'll do the comedy.

1307
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,280
How about this is Phil?

1308
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,140
Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater.

1309
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:41,960
Okay.

1310
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,980
This is Phil.

1311
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:44,500
Phil.

1312
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,040
Let's take it again.

1313
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,420
Oh, Pete and Dave.

1314
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:48,000
Okay, there we go.

1315
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:48,760
All right.

1316
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,280
You over here?

1317
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,300
You just shut up.

1318
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,620
This is Phil.

1319
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:51,920
Phil.

1320
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,400
Pete.

1321
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,700
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

1322
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,840
And we're listening to the hour of slack.

1323
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,280
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.

1324
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,940
Because we're subgeniuses.

1325
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,260
And we're slacking off.

1326
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Now, but Bob has a beautiful face like a flower.

1327
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,860
Bob should join the Ku Klux Klan.

1328
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,160
I heard you have hair on your chest, Bob.

1329
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,780
No, there are times when Bob has something on his mind.

1330
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,940
And Bob is not very worldly.

1331
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,860
And Bob isn't the biggest sports fan.

1332
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,480
Bob said, I heard the Lions were playing the Tigers.

1333
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,920
Bob is not a sports fan.

1334
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,860
Bob was the first comedian.

1335
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,140
Bob honestly has never had an unkind word for anybody.

1336
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,160
Anybody, anybody, anybody, anybody, anybody.
