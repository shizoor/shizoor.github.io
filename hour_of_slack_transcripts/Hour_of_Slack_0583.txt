You need to pay Bob because this radio station helps you to find slack.
This radio station is one of the anti-conspiracy stations.
This radio station exists to bring back for you what the conspiracy has stolen away.
This, friends, requires that you give money.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me that's the radio stuff.
I can't believe this.
If we get out of here alive, I'll count that as a break.
I mean, there wasn't even any people here to eat.
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The subgenius.
Our old slut.
Hello.
My name is Jesus.
Hello.
Come follow me.
Hello.
My name is Jesus.
Lay down your cares.
Lift up your friends and follow me.
Are you finished?
You got a shot, radio listeners.
Is there going to be a bathroom stop?
No, no, no. I'll take your word for it.
You've got three...
Young man, don't say that word again.
There are certain words that should not be said on public air.
Lady, chill out a little bit, okay?
All these words are in the dictionary.
They're medical terms.
You two better not talk about that on the air.
And why not?
It's vile and hedonistic.
Hey, hey, hey, lady.

There's no other person in the whole world who exactly duplicates you.
Two billion, one hundred and seventy-four million people.
See this?
It's a microphone.
There are four others hidden around the room.
There's the master switch over there.

I know what one of them is.
Turn it on.
All of my phones are live automatically.
Heh.
When I start to talk, the disc retorts.
When I stop, it stops.
Why don't you try it yourself?
I think I did.
Hi, dear friends.
Good job!
Terrific!
Splendific!
Oh, gosh.
What I want you to do now, what I want you to do is cross the radio, cross over to your radio.
I want you to put your hands on the radio.
You people who think you're too cool to do so, just sit back and just imagine what you're about to miss.
I want you to put your hands on the radio.
I want you to feel J.R. Bob Dobbs coming through to you.
I want you to feel the sacred sails reaching out to you.
I want you to feel it.
I want you to feel the pinkness leaving your body and the slack taking control.
Wow, that's hot.
If you don't shut up, I shall shoot you.
It's 9.30, 5.
Let's go to the phones.
Oh, wow!

It's burning down.
Good God!
This snow is burning down.
This snow is burning down.
The time has come.
Too long to go out of your mind.
Too long.
Are you ready?
Hi, this is Ed Allen with exercises to help you towards that beautiful figure you've always been dreaming about.
Or to help you keep the beautiful figure you have.
Shall we go?
All right, here's exercise number one.
Let's get this off the ground.
I've been in this business since and every day.

Good morning, Hillary.


Yeah.

Good.
Thank you.

Oh thanks Ren and thanks to Yetis for Bob for that for the last portion of that
media barrage and a lot of a media barrage editing that'll be coming up.
Friends we have to thank Yetis for Bob there in I believe Milwaukee. Also some
of that media barrage comes from Fernanda Nunde and
and fuzzling evidence from the KPFA show. Now I've got some great source tapes to
play with here friends because you know Ren was right about stupidity and and so
forth. We we appreciate that because this is after all the Church of the subgenius
and the two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity. So
you know friends if at first you don't succeed
skydiving is probably not for you. For a truly wise man never plays leapfrog with
a unicorn. So always remember to pillage before you burn. It may be friend that
your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning to others. You can't
fall off the floor but the normal human woman would rather have beauty
than brains. Because the normal human man can
see better than he can think.
Oh yes dear friends I'm sorry I get I get I get carried away in spirit

hell, I've seen it all, done it all, can't remember most of it. But I do know, I do know,
friends, that those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't. Of course, on
the other hand, they might not be dead. They might just be electroencephalographically
challenged. But friend, my good friend, my good prayer partner out there listening to
Beradia, do you ever feel like you're diagonally parked in a parallel universe? Well, in that
case, honk if you love peace and quiet, friends, because nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently
talented fool. On the other hand, you have different fingers. Because a day without the
sunshine is like, you know, nighttime, friends.
Change, change is inevitable, except from a vending machine, I suppose you could say.
And for that matter, the Greys, or the Zaytans as we call them, gave humanity certain Zaytan
genetic components, and they helped early man over some evolutionary humps. But they
saw too late that the majority of the human race retained a great many primate impulses
that the Greys had thought to expunge.
Impulses that would lead from little wars to bigger wars, which would end as another
ancient Zaytan or Grey experiment had in another world, which is, of course, worldwide
devastation. And they couldn't genetically redesign the whole human race at that point,
so they decided they had to influence it in other ways so it would survive. And so they
decided, or so they thought they decided, to introduce the concept of higher religious
ethics to mankind. And that's what they were doing. And they were trying to change the
world.
They were trying to keep humanity from self-destructing before the experiment was over with, don't
you see?
Higher religious ethics, friends, because they had already observed Earth humanity's
tendency to contrive cosmological explanations for life and nature and death, they themselves,
the Greys in the distant past, had once had such a tendency until they'd expunged it thousands
of centuries earlier.
They were aware of an order of creature which would, in the end, destroy humanity. And


they were aware of the power of the Meta, which we call the Meta. These creatures had
a way of infusing harmonious direction into the races they visited. Why? The Zaytans did
not know. They assumed that the Meta were caught up in some megalomaniacal cultural
outreach obsession. And they decided they could use this obsession for their own purposes,
so they captured a powerful Meta in a generator field and introduced it to Earth. A variation
on that same field, by the way, is the force field, which keeps the Meta in the same field.

The Zaytans were able to capture the Meta out of the Zaytan's way most of the time,
but you see, the planetary Iamton field responded to the captured Meta and crystallized a so-called
deity around the Meta in a form the local sentient life-form humanity could understand.
The one god, they called it, the Great Spirit, Eitan, Yahweh, Gibrog-Fram, Bob, many names
in many places. The Meta's influence on the Iamton field was especially direct in certain
places, as for example, the Middle East in the time of Moses.
Eventually, the captured Meta was made to be a source of energy for the Zaytans, and

to keep this universe now safe — and the mid- oluyor הוא
I won't let you use that as a good excuse for my evil nichtness.

Well, we'll probably get Jesus in here to tell the full truth about Jesus.
Friends, I was just reading from Reverend John Shirley's science fiction book called Silicon Embrace.
Science fiction? Sure. Call it science fiction if you will.

Publishers of John Shirley's Silicon Embrace from which we were just reading because, friends, it is yes.
Perhaps it is madness. Perhaps it is insanity.
Perhaps, perhaps X-Day is merely coming.
Perhaps the end times are merely coming.
Friends, that's all it is.
Sure, it gets confusing.
For you and even me sometimes.
But, well, we've only got, what, I think my computer told me, 389 days left till X-Day.
And when I'm speaking this, what we've got about, well, by the time you hear this show, it'll be about two weeks from the X-Day drill.
1997 X-Day drill in Brushwood Campground in Sherman, New York.

We're eating it up.
We can't wait to see the vengeance.
It's acted upon the pink and upon the grays themselves, because we have no truck with the grays.
No, sir.
We just say no to the alien threat around here.
This particular saucer cult, we ain't trying to become like the grays, like them Heaven's Gate folks.
No, sir.
No, sir, ma'am.
We want to be like them Mata, the X-ist, in other words.
Praise Bob and amen.
Oh, yes.
All right.
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye-bye.

You're going to die up there.
Oh,

I wish again, I was a kid again, singing a song.
When the red, red robin comes bob, bob, bobbing along.
Wake up, red, red robin, bob, bob, bobbing along.
Bob, bob, bobbing along.
Bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bobbing along.
Bob, bob, bobbing along.
Bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob, bob.
You know, there's nothing I like more than sleep.
Here's a little song I like to sing before I hit the hay.
Masturbation can be fun.
Put a live chicken in your underwear.
Now bend forward slightly at the waist.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ah!
All right, whip it out.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hey, what's that?
It's a beautiful...

Time to zoom.

But you must put it off.
Tobacco companies provide free spitting tobacco in players' clubhouses.
The team of dentists was Dr. Dean of the dental school.
He says longtime users experienced damage to their high school boys.
He says a 13-year-old farm boy was after him for years to quit chewing.
Meanwhile, one San Francisco player says he and other users will expand to include the whole league.
Don't they know he shouldn't do something just because...
Everyone else is doing it?
No, Ben, it just got all crazy.
Didn't anybody see how foolish they were being?
I'm a nut. I'm a nut.
I'm a nut. I'm a nut. I'm a nut.
That's right.
Jimmy? Hey, hey, look at this.
What the hell?
Somebody talk to me.
What am I supposed to do?
What the hell is going on, Jimmy?
Somebody's picking up the microphone.
Look, Dave, tell me what to do.
Zoom out, you idiot.
Who the hell is this?
Supposing you have a joke, KBFA, KBFB, and KFC up in Fresno.
Would you explain to me how this nut could hold a top position in one of our intelligence agencies?
Would you answer that?
High-level covert operatives are under great stress.
They're creative thinkers who by their very nature...
See, Tom trains everyone in the CIA who's crazy.
Every day you have to jump off a plane.
You have to jump off a roof or stand in front of a train so you can lose your fear.
Is that it?
You're like a crazy person.
I'm not crazy.
There must be a way to live with it so that it does make sense.
Well, any place you have a federal building, you have a target.
That's the question everybody has right now.
Why here? Why Oklahoma City?
And you find out by finding why that building.
I don't think it's material that it was in Oklahoma City.
It's really the building.
The building could have been any city in the United States.
The question is that building.
Bob Dove!
Multi-millionaire!
High Prince of Slack!
He is alive! Alive, alive!
Step right up and find out the mysteries of Slack.
Tickets are available this way.
Yes!
Freaks! Misfits! Geeks!
Do we have a solution for you?
Come see the Reverend Ivan Stang! Yes!
Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius!
One time and one time only for just one dollar!
You can look behind the curtain to see the hideous Reverend Ivan Stang!
Is he man? Is he beast?
Only you can tell and he is alive!
Alive, alive, alive!
I want you to know, praise Bob, that although we are subgeniuses,
we are not stupid!
And although our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,
as he fits the name, subgenius,
Bob is not smart!
You know, don't get the impression that we are like some bunch of...
We're really geniuses because we understand these complex jokes
and those stupid people who know how to repair cars
don't get our jokes.
We must really be superior mutants.
No, friends, it ain't like that at all!
That is not...
We're not trying to...
And another thing, another thing about Bob that you should probably know,
old pipeface ain't gonna die for your sins.
Okay?
You can get that straight right now.
Let's just get that straight up front.
Bob will not die for your sins.
He really does not give a shit about your sins.
He doesn't care about your sins.
He is bored with your sins.
If anything, Bob merely comes and comes again and again
to justify your sins, to rationalize your sins.
Friends, Bob brings not forgiveness, but an excuse.
Do you really need to be forgiven?
For what and by whom?
Do you really feel that need?
No, you do need an excuse.
And if you don't need it yet, you're probably gonna need it pretty soon.
So, uh, you just think about it.
We're not gonna do any kind of hard...
Well, we're not gonna threaten you with tales of some hell
if you don't join up and pay lip service to our invisible monster.
No, we won't threaten you with things like that.
It's just on July 5th, 1998, all of a sudden one day you'll wake up
and, well, there'll be an empty pile of clothes
where your spouse, that dues-paying subgenius,
once was laying next to you.
And you'll walk outside and you'll have to go to work.
That spouse will be up on the escape vessels.
But we wouldn't want to threaten you with the fact that your spouse,
once on the escape vessels, could then go,
you know, I've always wanted to show that asshole a thing or two about Bob.
No, we're not into the vengeance,
the vengeance that comes with our religion.
Oh, no.
We wouldn't form a religion just to feel superior to the next...
to everybody else.
No, no.
That's what all the other...
I'll tell you what, friends, it's true.
This religion is based on hate.
And in that respect, we're simply the only religion
that'll just come out and admit it.
They are all that way.
We're just up front about it.
We're better than everybody else.
Enough said.
Bob sold it.
I smoked it.
That settles it.
You know?
I don't know what that means,
but it must be the highest honor that can be stowed.
...the highest honor that can be stowed.
That's what it says in Jack Chick publications.
Oh, beautiful family.
Everyone'll have a big fancy car,
and you'll be able to see through walls
and fly unaided from men and their black holes.
And put the Bible where they've been.
Best of all, you'll be able to look down into the crevice of Sheol
and see the sinners roasting in their own flames
while you tut-tut and chide them.
Lack of God.
And furthermore,
the price of admission
is a life of contrition.
The Savior doesn't spend much.
That's why they call him the Savior.
He saves rather than spends.
So you're out of luck.
I am blessed.
Would life for you continue
the life that flickers in you
from day to day?
Would you say a table grace
with a great big beam
sticking out of your eye
and a crown of thorns on your face?
And let him know the things
on which your mind and spirit feed?
Then do you take Jesus to the closet
and show him your pornography collection?
And you make him look
at every filthy page
while the tears of blood
run from your side
and his side squirts all over the rug?
It'll be hard to explain to your mama
the bloodstains on the shag carpeting
from his feet
pierced by the bloodstains

that burst through with the nail
attaching him to the cross
when he at last was gone.
And you would sigh with relief
when he was gone.
Believe me, you would sigh with relief
when he was gone.
But, you know, he'd never be gone
because he's omniscient and omnipresent.
So if you did sigh with relief,
he'd be back to admonish you some more
and to put more bloody handprints
on the doorknob of your door.
So we get ready to blast off now, folks.
Oh, I guess so.
Let's strap in for another rocket ride.
Oh, these old bones.
I don't know if I'm going to be able
to do this all the rest of my life.
I've forgotten how much I hate space travel.
Let's do an equipment check
just so we don't get stuck again
on whether my asteroids won't take it.
Pleasner, check.
Oxygenating decontaminating unit is A-OK.
And A-1 at Lloyd's.
All systems go.
A-OK.
A-1 at Lloyd's.
Woo!
Let's go for one more rocket.
A-OK.
Why are you Jasper?
A-OK.
Great.

Oh, oh, oh.
You gotta stop now
And do your thing
You better stop now
And get your groove
You better stop now
And do your thing
I said stop and think it over
Me and you are the type
To wear faded blue jeans out
We're the type
To go running in the rain
We're the type
To stay in bed all day
Forgetting the work
We spend all our love time
Loving one another
We're the type
You on my bed there, nude
We've met before
I know now
And you?
Jericho and Joshua
Great wall, trumpets may sound
Musicians' veins burst
And the temples of life are striving

Just never saw anybody as

As bold as I am
As wild as I am

And I don't pull any punches
And I certainly ain't lukewarm
I hear you calling, but I can't come.
Glad you have it, gentlemen.
What more evidence do we need?
Now I am a monkey.
A monkey, monkey, monkey.
I am a monkey.
I am a monkey.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Ah!
You are listening to a little video media audio blage from Yeti's Forbidden.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, no subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Oh, yes, friends.
And on, uh, side two.
So we shall venture into a new negative land.
Well, actually, it's the B side of a 45 from negative land.
And some oldies but goldies from the Duke of Madness from 1982
starring our old friend Bleepo Abernathy and Billy West,
who is now the voice of Ren, or Stimpy, or both, or something like that.
Praise Bob.
And until then, I don't know where we go.
Guess we go backwards.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.

Oh.
Oh.
And now, Negative Land.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The condolences of every person at Pepsi-Cola are with you.
Negative Land.
When your brain is doing bad.
Well, it could be this.
The taste is in the mind. I mean, it tastes better. The human mind is very important.
The taste is in the mind. The taste is in the mind. The taste is in the mind. The taste is better.
And yes, dear friends, that was a bit of a sneak preview of the new upcoming Negative Land album, Dispepsy.
Dispepsy could get them into a wee bit of trouble, dear friends.
But yes, that is Negative Land. It's actually off of a 45, which has Truth in Advertising on one side and the B side of this 45 RPM record album.
Or little record is Dispepsy. The greatest taste around and taste in mind.
That was even worse than having Jesus visiting.
Yeah, I'm glad Jesus lives in Texas.
But you know, we can get just about anyone on our show.
And so without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a guest who needs no introduction.
Who's here to be on our show. So let's give him a big Virginia ham.
The Reverend Ivan Stang.
Well, that's not necessary.
Not necessary, but Ivan, it's great to have you here.
Well, it was interesting being transported.
What about your hour of slack?
Why don't you tell us something about what's it like to do an hour of slack?
We don't do.
Well, you know what I mean. I'm simplifying it for our listeners.
In California, you do.
But we're not in California. Actually, KPF Studios was transported here to Dallas.
Yeah, that's right, folks. All the way to Dallas, Texas.
Right. Yes.
Ivan Stang has pulled his pants down.
Only Stang could get away with something so, well, so gross, frankly.
Yeah, but it works. You know, whatever he does works.
Yeah. But it works. You know, whatever he does works.
knows how to excite the rebel. Look at them.
That caller has gone into spasms
on the kitchen floor. Well, if you've got a question for Ivan
Stang, call 848-4425
on the 510 area code.
And the crowd is going wild.
All he's doing is cleaning his glasses.
He's a great physical mime, a great physical
mimic. He can really get the
crowd in the palm of his hand, and then, of course,
he uses that hand to do something
else. Put that away.
I was just demonstrating. This is a plastic
demonstration model.
All right, okay. I'm sorry.
Well, now he's combing his hair.
Yeah, he is.
The hair on his head, too.
Well, this is a popular thing.
He's done this a number of times.
Now we're watching the Jon Stewart show.
He was on Jon Stewart,
Larry Sanders, he was on Leno,
Tom Snyder,
Tom Sawyer.
Now he's ruminating about lies.
To watch our show every day.
What color do you have? Your show every day?
The Skull and Bone Society show.
All right.
George.
Bush was in that.
Once we rule the United States,
everybody will have to watch
the Skull and Bone Society.
Oh, no. I had to say the magic word.
The shaman of
international finance capital.
Nervous laughter from the audience now.
Yeah, nervous in the service of their country.
That's right.
Kind of funny. I think it's kind of funny myself.
The DAR above you is...
Do you have a question for Ivan Stan?
Thousands of DAR hags,
that is, members of the Daughters of the American Revolution,
waving umbrellas and canes,
headed for...
Just pressing the call button brings a huge laugh from the audience.
It's Doctor of the Revolution.
I wouldn't say Doctor.
Now we're applying the voltage.
Oh, thank you.
He really...
Stan really answers the question in so few...
There is no such thing as a true question.
You're sure, Bob?
That's right. Our callers do the best they can.
If you have a question, send it to Bob.
That's true. And of course, what is that address of the local church?
Oh, uh...
PO Box 140.
14306 in Dallas, Texas.
In Dallas, Texas.
75214.
Yes, that's right. It's Eternal Salvation or Triple Your Money Back.
Or Triple Your Money Back.
Beyond science, reason, and orgasm.
Instant instructions for those who follow no master.
If you die and find yourself in the pits of hell,
you'll get a signed $90 check from J.R. Bob Dobbs.
...smoking and grinning in that face that you've seen a thousand times,
and the crowd loves it.
Hey, is that little Jesus there? The young Jesus?
This is that tiny waving Jesus box that that Burning Man guy had.
Oh.
Hello?
And now we'll punch up B.
Here's one about the callers.
Okay, there's B. Now A and B.
I think my skin is turned inside out.
And my ears hear weird things.
The back of my little mouth.
And the mask has come out of my belly button.
And I can't get the whole plug up.
And I'm afraid that was, in fact, someone else.
Now let's see what this old Duke of...
...Madness show from Reverend Bleepo and Billy West sounds like, okay?
Okay? Okay?
Okay? Okay?
What?
It got to...
...some fancy frown...
...night.
This was made when you make a deal.
Do you know who you can trust?
Do you sign your life away?
Do you write your name in dust?
Hey, hey, hey!
And the dogs of the day!
Dog is dog!
Dog is dog!
Dog is dog!
Dog is dog!
The following program is broadcast for K9 Entertainment.
For human enjoyment, it is closed captioned with a translation of the following audio.

That's right!
It's time for America's favorite television comedy program
that takes a wacky look at what the world would be like
if it was run by dogs instead of people.
Schnauzer knows best!
Here come those crazy canines
Who run smarter than the rest
The dogs all know what's happening
But Schnauzer, he knows best
Be very quiet!

here on the Duke of Madness Sunday sometime special
but leave us not forget
the dog's ever-present
diametrically opposed opposite
El Gato
the cat
Presenting now the Fat Chance Radio Players
with a little story concerning
cat talk.
You know I've been thinking that life was tough until the other day.
I just finished breakfast and was heading out the door for work.
As if on cue, Trinka, my Siamese cat, leapt from the couch and jumped in front of my path.
She looked up at me and said,
Wait!
Just as plainly as day, like that.
I flipped.
Cats don't talk, but mine looked up at me and did it.
She talked.
My cat talked.
I was incredulous.
I was so excited.












Trinka, I cried.
No need to get breathless on me.
She said.
I speak now because it is the appointed hour.
Take your coat off and come back into the living room.
There is much to discuss.
My sudden state of confusion made it difficult to understand
just how I was able to calmly remove my coat,
head back into the living room,
and sit down for a conversation with my cat.
To begin with.
Began the cat.
Whittle the boys in the lab here. This is the cat.
To begin with, we cats are not of this earth.
You what?
We are from the planet Flubis,
light years beyond any star system you humans have yet detected.
We came here around the time that you would call the dawn of civilization.
We civilized the Egyptians to the point where we no longer found it necessary to care for ourselves.
The humans took care of our needs.
Food, shelter, medicine.
And it's been that way ever since.
However...
Continued the cat.
We have let this civilization thing get out of hand.
You humans have gone too far.
At this very moment, a fleet of ships from our planet is heading for the earth.
Unless all nuclear weapons are defused and permanently demobilized,
the cats from outer space will simply land and spray a special gas
that will destroy the planet.
We will destroy all human life and will do the jobs ourselves.
It is your task to warn the world of this ultimatum.
You have 30 days.
I will say no more.
Good night.
She closed her eyes and was asleep.
But... but...
I was flabbergasted.
So this was the result of four years in animal behavior?
Mother was right. Dentistry is safer.
Nevertheless, this was real.
My cat had unmistakably spoken to me.
And what she said somehow made sense.
I fell into a fitful, anxious sleep.
Any doubts I had about my experience that night were thrown aside the next morning
when I discovered my cat sitting on the coffee table,
magic marker in hand, making little circles all over my atlas of the world.
What do those circles mean? I asked.
Trinka stared solemnly up at me and then pointed to a picture of an atomic bomb she had.
She had ripped out of a magazine.
I understood.
Realizing what had to be done, I canceled my appointments for the next 30 days
and embarked on my world mission.
Needless to say, I encountered no small difficulty in being heard.
You're imposterous.
The American liaison to the UN said,
Gates from outer space!
Laughed the Russian ambassador.
Dissolve all nuclear weapons?
Told you this.
The British representative could hardly contain himself.
Everywhere I went, it was the same thing.
Nobody wanted to hear an obscure animal behaviorist rant and rave
about the imminent threat of cats from the planet Flubis.
Time ran out like sand.
Exhausted, dejected, humiliated beyond reason,
I returned home early on the evening before it was supposed to happen.
I had been away for more than four weeks.
At least I could see the end come comfortably in a familiar place
and know I had tried to warn humanity.
I opened the door.
Stepped into the living room.
And there was Trinka, my cat, dead on the couch.
I couldn't believe it.
I wept openly, and all I could think was,
Why? Why? What did it all mean?
Couldn't she have broken a window or opened some cans to get some food?
It didn't make sense.
Dazed, I wandered back out onto the patio,
sat down overlooking the backyard and put my head in my hands.
Just then, a calico cat, one of the local ones, sauntered by.
He stopped and looked up at me.
What's the matter?
He asked.
I then proceeded to tell him the whole story while I looked on, bewildered.
Just as I was almost finished, the calico interrupted me.
Just a minute, he said.
What kind of cat did you say you had?
A Siamese. Why?
No wonder.
Look, buddy, do yourself a favor.
Never take what a Siamese cat says seriously.
They're all mad. Completely mad.
And shaking his head and grinning, the cat walked off.
At least the voices have stopped for a while.
I am so tired.
8.30, boy. Time you were in bed.
I don't know.
Whoo!
Well, don't you know, baby?
We're gonna make you rock and roll. Stop!
To many of us, that is an anxiety-producing term.
You got it?
You got it out of one word.
Out of the word of...
Whoo!
Whee!
Hey, Bob.
Where are you going with that knife in your hand?
Hey, Bob.
Hey, Bob.



Where are you going with that knife in your hand?
Going down to smoke some crop.
No, I got it way down in Malaysia land.
Going down to smoke some crop.
You know I got it way down in Malaysia land.
Hey, Bob.




Hey, Bob.
I heard that the X's are coming soon.
Hey, Bob.
Heard that the X's are coming soon.
Yes, they are. They're coming.
You know I had promised you that they would.
Yes, they are. They're coming.
You know that I had promised they would.
Is this too nice?
It is.

A doctor.
Yeah, yeah, good son.


You asked me to take more care of you,

No, that's the point.
Now you're saying?
Yeah.
