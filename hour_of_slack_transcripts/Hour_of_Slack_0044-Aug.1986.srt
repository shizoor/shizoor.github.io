1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,900
No, no, no.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,940
It's a wonderful life.

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,140
It's a wonderful life.

4
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,660
We have so wonderful life.

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,100
We have so wonderful life.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,520
No trouble.

7
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,060
Just get set and get going.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,580
Amen.

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,260
Recording.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,540
Everything's going fine.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,440
No trouble.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,000
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,940
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,740
I have a bucket!

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,300
Bob?

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,540
Bob?

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,000
That's your key phrase.

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,160
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,540
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,420
I love you.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,180
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,400
With Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,640
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,360
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,440
Thank you.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,360
Are we controlled by secret forces?

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,800
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,080
Do people think you're strange?

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,740
Do you?

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,440
Then you may be on the right track.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,260
Are you abnormal?

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,260
Then you are probably better than most people.

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,080
Yes.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,420
Your time shall triumph.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,240
This is it.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,840
The only...

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
The only faith that promises...

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,060
Action, thrill, success in sex and business.

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,520
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,620
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,220
Bob is a way of life to millions.

44
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,840
Half of them don't even know it.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:59,820
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial hell.

46
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,960
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,760
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,360
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,260
Become physically attractive overnight.

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,020
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

51
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,720
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal...

52
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:37,360
...behavior to explore new ways of going over the edge and coming right back.

53
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,740
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,020
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,560
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around and channel them into an illusion of creativity.

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,560
That will fool normals and get...

57
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,520
...you set.

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,260
Bob's ass!

59
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,780
Bob's ass!

60
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,480
Bob's ass!

61
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:05,920
Bob's ass!

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,420
B-O-B Bob's ass.

63
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,300
B-O-B Bob's ass.

64
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,780
Thank you.

65
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,340
Thank you.

66
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,260
Thank you.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,380
The universe was, in fact, sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkel Seizure.

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:14,300
The Jatrovatids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the Great White Handkerchief,

69
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,960
are small blue creatures with more than 50 arms each who are therefore unique in being the only race in history

70
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,600
to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.

71
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,320
However, the Great Green Arkel Seizure theory,

72
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,840
was not widely accepted outside Wiltfordal 6,

73
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,520
and so one day a race of hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings

74
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,080
built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought

75
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,420
to calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life,

76
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,040
the universe, and everything.

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,660
For seven and a half million years,

78
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,500
Deep Thought computed and calculated and eventually announced

79
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,200
that the answer was, in fact, 42.

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,040
And so another, even bigger computer had to be built

81
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,440
to find out what the actual question was.

82
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,640
And this computer, which was called the Earth,

83
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,680
was so amazingly large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet,

84
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,520
particularly by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface

85
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,820
totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.

86
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,540
And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of information,

87
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,200
nothing that ever happened on Earth could possibly have made the slightest bit of sense.

88
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,800
Dear friends, your spare time could bring information and enjoyment

89
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,740
to hundreds in our area who have reading disabilities.

90
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,500
Dallas Taping for the Blind puts textbooks,

91
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,940
work-related materials, and recreational books on tape.

92
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,000
If you'd like to be a part of this exciting, rewarding, and dedicated world of taping

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,980
for the reading disabled, call Dallas Taping for the Blind at 871-7668.

94
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,560
That's right, you can sit there and read into a microphone, just like I'm doing now,

95
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,740
and have fun and do a service for mankind while you're at it.

96
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,740
And now, friends,

97
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,760
we'll go back to the tape recording.

98
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,380
At the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished

99
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,540
to make way for a hyperspace bypass, and the only native Earth people

100
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,780
to have survived the demolition are now being shot at behind a computer bank

101
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,060
on the lost planet of Magrathea, along with their strange companions from Beetlejuice,

102
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,480
who are currently singing an ancient Beetlejuice death anthem on the very sensible grounds that they are about to die.

103
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,660
This is what the computer bank is about to do.

104
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,020
Time.

105
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,440
It isn't the cough that carries you off.

106
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,700
It's the coffin they carry you off in.

107
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,020
Oh.

108
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,020
Hey, where are we here?

109
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,900
I think we're out in space somewhere.

110
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,260
I think we're on the inside of a...

111
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,980
Oh, this doesn't look like the studio we were in.

112
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,900
We're in the bottom of something here.

113
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,140
No, there's a light that's passed over.

114
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,440
Look, there's a giant mouth opening up and it's swallowing the Earth.

115
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,820
We're in the light of a giant pipe.

116
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
Oh, no, it's a giant pipe.

117
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,200
And here comes the giant mouth.

118
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,120
Oh.

119
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,180
Oh.

120
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,480
Oh.

121
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,320
Oh.

122
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,240
Oh.

123
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,920
Oh, now all the white batter fromp is being poured up on top of us.

124
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,580
Oh, hey, wow.

125
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,720
Frop, man, frop.

126
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,140
Frop.

127
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,640
I never used to get enough frop before, but this is too much.

128
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,100
This is ridiculous.

129
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,140
Is everybody alright?

130
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,660
I'm still here.

131
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,180
Oh, no, he's going for another puff.

132
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,180


133
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,600
He's going for another puff.

134
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,120
He's going for another puff.

135
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,380
He's going for another puff, squaw.

136
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,420
He's going for another puff.

137
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,340
That was almost finished me off.

138
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,660
If he goes for another drag, you're done for.

139
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,440
There's the giant bob.

140
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,820
Giant...

141
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,320
This can't be the real bob.

142
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,620
It's just a flat two-dimensional head made of dots a thousand miles across.

143
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,540
Boy, you put that pipe in a backwards universe now.

144
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,400
With a gigantic time warp black hole pipe.

145
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,320
Boy, that was horrible.

146
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,120
I've never been smoked by dogs.

147
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,280
Oh, we're back in rock and roll hell now.

148
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:58,920
Oh, no.

149
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,700
Is this rock and roll hell?

150
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,460
Oh, man.

151
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,980
I always get stuck here at 2 in the morning.

152
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,540
Rock and roll hell.

153
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,640
Get down, party, shoot up, and pray to Satan.

154
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,340
Ha ha.

155
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,580
Rock and roll hell.

156
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,980
Rock and roll hell.

158
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,660
Go out and kill some kids tonight.

159
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,960
Waste your life.

160
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,480
Yeah.

161
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,220
Rock and roll hell.

162
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,540
Do it.

163
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,140
Rock and roll hell.

164
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah.

165
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,760
Here in hell.

166
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Destroy your life.

167
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,220
Pray to Satan in rock and roll hell.

168
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,920
Rock and roll hell.

169
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,480
Sex, drugs, and alcohol.

170
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,240
Where all the old DJs on this show.

171
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,900
Corruption.

172
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,920
Here in this station.

173
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,700
End of it.

174
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,120
Vigilante.

175
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,060
Rock and roll hell.

176
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,800
Here is a special editorial.

177
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,200
Don't worry.

178
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,240
Bob supports the Parents Music Resource Center.

179
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,460
All your friends will be there.

180
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,100
Of its unnecessary references to the occult profanity.

181
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,340
Hell yeah, man.

182
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,140
We're having about eight caves of the bull.

183
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,480
Now we have a giant hell party by the flaming lake of Brimstone.

184
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,020
We feel that today's teenager has too many other pressures without having to worry about

185
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,360
hate.

186
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,300
And now for the subgenius devotional hour.

187
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,360
It's all in hell.

188
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,200
Devil-worshipping teenagers stole my pill.

189
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
And all the gas you want.

190
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,220
All the gas you want.

191
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:17,660
All the gas you want.

192
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,640
All the gas you want.

193
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:18,760
All the gas you want.

194
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:18,820


195
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,520
many bombs!

196
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,500
I'm talking

197
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,580
You listening?

198
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,060
Or you can pout

199
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,260
Or you can break out

200
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,100
Get up

201
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,360
Get out

202
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,600
Come on, step on it

203
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
Step into it

204
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,440
Step into the sleep

205
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,580
Girl, do what you please

206
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,800
Cause you ain't no twit

207
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,720
You ain't no twit yet

208
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,940
Step out of your clothes

209
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Girl, step into homes

210
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,040
You'll be the latest hit

211
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,080
The latest hit, yeah

212
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,180
It's about time to let my hormones wake up

213
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,960
Put off the homework, let's put on the makeup

214
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,480
Don't wait a second cause you'll stay in limbo

215
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,440
I'll give my old stuff to my sister, that bimbo

216
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
When I'm done with my homework, I'll give my old stuff to my sister, that bimbo

217
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,780
When I wear underwear, I'm liberated

218
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,760
It's like the movies, M.I.P.G. or X-rated

219
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,740
I feel just like a virgin in these clothes

220
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,020
I hope my belly button lip won't show

221
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,880
Step into the sleep

222
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,100
Start being a tease

223
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,280
Hey, you ain't no nerd

224
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,260
You ain't no nerd, yeah

225
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,480
Step into the street

226
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,540
Put guys into heat

227
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
Be a nerd, yeah

228
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,060
My little nerds

229
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,180
My little nerd, yeah

230
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,400
Wanna get to dress up

231
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,320
Move around and prance

232
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,580
Wanna get in front of

233
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,560
All my fans and dance

234
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,580
Don't try to fight it cause this is really you

235
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,780
Just burst your lips

236
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,880
And flare your nostrils too

237
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,940
I must be dreaming, this is just too cool

238
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,380
Cause in real life I wet my lips and then I drool

239
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,400
I really love

240
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,700
In the life I wanna

241
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,700
It feels so good to be a primadonna

242
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,780
Step into the sleaze

243
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,800
Girl, do what you please

244
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,920
Now you're not a wimp

245
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,880
You're not a wimp, yeah

246
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,260
Step into the lights

247
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,080
You know it's alright

248
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,480
If you wanna primp

249
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,820
You can primp, yeah

250
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,560
You can take your mind where it wants to go

251
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Tell the boys to come

252
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,960
Or tell the boys to blow

253
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,980
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream

254
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,240
I can make my life be like a magazine

255
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,540
Step into the sleaze

256
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Girl, do what you please

257
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,700
Cause you ain't no twit

258
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,660
You ain't no twit, yeah

259
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,880
Step into the beat

260
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,920
Put guys into heat

261
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,180
You're the latest hit

262
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,120
The latest hit, yeah

263
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,500
When I start to strut

264
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,780
I wanna squish in my nose

265
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,040
My body really sweats

266
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,740
But hey, that's how it goes

267
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,020
I'm in a world like Glamour Girl and Simple

268
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm never going back to clear o' sills and pimples

269
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,240
You can take your mind where it wants to go

270
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,360
Tell the boys to come

271
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,700
Or tell the boys to blow

272
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,680
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream

273
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,480
I can make my life be like a magazine

274
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,760
Be like a magazine

275
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,040
Oh, be like a magazine

276
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,180
Be like a magazine

277
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,500
Oh, yes dear friends

278
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,620
You can be like that

279
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,940
You can be like that magazine, I suppose

280
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,360
This is the horrible Madonna parody

281
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,880
I might as well tell you what's going on here, friends

282
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,340
This is gonna be a real hip show

283
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,160
This was real cool a few months ago, I suppose

284
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,940
Madonna parody here from Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

285
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,680
Up with the Hour of Slack show in Boston

286
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,980
A little bit before that and after this

287
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,060
The Serious Abuse radio show from the Rat Cave, dear friends

288
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,940
We'll be going back to that

289
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,920
But in the meantime, friends

290
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,200
Draft registration

291
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,660
You do have a choice

292
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,860
Do you have alternatives to military service?

293
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,360
I did, flat feet

294
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,760
But you may have others

295
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,840
Talk to one of the trained draft counselors at the War Resisters League

296
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,980
For an evaluation of your particular situation

297
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,780
It'll cost you nothing to learn the facts, folks

298
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,540
Remember, know the facts before you make your decision

299
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,900
For draft counseling, call...

300
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,800
214-421-1984

301
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,420
That's a good number there for a draft counselor

302
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,200
421-1984

303
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,940
I was number 30 in the lottery

304
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,540
And they didn't believe any of the lies I told them

305
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,080
Until finally they looked at my feet and said

306
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,660
Son, sorry

307
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,540
Just too flat-footed for this man's army

308
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,920
But friends, this is the subgenius...

309
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,220
Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9

310
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,180
In Dallas, Texas

311
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,120
And sorry, the phone lines aren't working tonight

312
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,740
So we can't take your prayer requests right now

313
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,560
I mean, they just flat-out aren't working, friends

314
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,640
You're gonna have to...

315
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,040
They're trying, they're trying

316
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,720
But you're gonna have to pray

317
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
You're gonna have to, you know, put something important

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,840
In an important place

319
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,360
And think about it and pray

320
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,900
And say things like...

321
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,520
Mommy asks who dabs head

322
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,580
Silly pills, Bob Slack

323
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,420
I want my pills

324
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,280
Some devil or your soul

325
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,220
My pills, gimme your pills

326
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,120
Bob pills, Bob pills, Slack Bob

327
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,020
Gimme pills, Bob

328
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,260
Yes, that's the misconceptions of many such men I...

329
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,780
That's your typical pink boy

330
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,780
Pretending to be subgenius

331
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,660
Yes, he paid his $20

332
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,000
His money was green

333
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,620
But he was still pink inside

334
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:11,640
Yes

335
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,620
It's a pathetic thing to watch

336
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,080
As he tries to quote all the...

337
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,080
All the slang that he got...

338
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,460
Hey, pull the wool over your own eyes, guys

339
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,680
Hey, yeah

340
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,200
Yeah, you'd pay to know what you really think

341
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,980
Oh, yeah, like repent and quit your job and slack off

342
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,300
Yeah, and do something to them if they can't take a joke

343
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,400
What was that? Let me open it back up here

344
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,200
Oh, wow, man, like, like, are we punk rock, man?

345
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,620
Oh, I thought it was punk to talk about Bob

346
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,980
I thought it was, like, cool or something to talk about Bob

347
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,240
Hey, we oughta hassle the clerk at best, cause she's a capitalist, man

348
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,940
Hey, do you believe in anarchy, man?

349
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,080
Well, if you don't, I'm gonna kill ya

350
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,540
Kill ya, kill ya, kill ya

351
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,020
We'll show you punk rock

352
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,620
You thought it was hair and clothes

353
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,660
You thought it was, like, big spikes and bracelets and leather and stuff

354
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,760
Yeah, you thought punk rock was...

355
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,320
You thought wrong

356
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,380
You thought it was like...

357
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,520
You are God participating in himself, says Nying

358
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,740
Hey, this guy's...

359
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,180
Wow, this guy's a real prophet

360
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,980
Hey, he's a...

361
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,340
He's a surdeer per se, for sure

362
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,080
They find more dominance when tomorrow becomes today

363
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,920
Uh, well, hey, are you the caller who stole my...

364
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,460
Alright, enough of this silliness

365
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,200
Yes

366
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,740
Say goodnight, Steve

367
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,020
Huh

368
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,720
No

369
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,780
Ahhh, yes

370
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,020
Yes, friend, I'm all hooked up

371
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
And ready to answer your questions

372
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,740
Now, we've been gettin' letters and phone calls from...

373
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,740
noble subgeniuses out there asking

374
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,260
Revren Stang, how can I be...

375
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,020
more subversive

376
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,840
How can I be...

377
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,380
of more service to Bob

378
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,740
in bringing down the community?

379
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,420
conspiracy that enslaves us and friends I'm afraid that that is entirely up to

380
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:25,980
you now the conspiracy will tell you how to be more subversive against it so we

381
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:33,780
sure won't but I can give you one helpful hint friends there's nothing

382
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:41,720
wrong with looking normal if you want to be more subversive friends you don't

383
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,880
have to show off about it if you were a uniform like high fashion of punk

384
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,860
haircut or leather and spandex and whatever unless it's really extreme

385
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:02,220
friends you're just playing along with the conspiracy joining a conformity of

386
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,680
non-conformist

387
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:03,760
you're just playing along with the conspiracy joining a conformity of non-conformist

388
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,960
you're labeling yourself as someone who the conspiracy doesn't really need to

389
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,740
worry about because you're gonna follow a predictable pattern one that they've

390
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:21,640
co-opted already but what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway

391
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:29,260
friends bringing down the state for blowing up polluters nay nay that only

392
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,220
kills people friends and gets you in jail to boot

393
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:42,020
it's stupid but not stupid in the right way Bob said a Bob said thou shall't kill

394
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:48,600
none but me unless they're literally about to kill you or if they insult your

395
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,800
ancestors that's what Bob said and you know there's nothing wrong with

396
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,100
technology friends we don't need to subvert technology after all only

397
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,360
technologies it's the only thing we've got to clean up the mess we already made

398
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,240
So who are we trying to subvert?

399
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,680
The Republicans?

400
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,940
Oh, friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.

401
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:20,780
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing anything.

402
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:28,480
All it means to most of us is patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism, friends.

403
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,500
Every yard a kingdom, every child and dog a serf.

404
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,320
It doesn't matter what party is in control,

405
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,500
as long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.

406
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,640
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.

407
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,600
I mean, as political systems go, the U.S. is one of the least evil.

408
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,000
Just as Jesus is okay.

409
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,460
It's just...

410
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,620
It's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.

411
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,760
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.

412
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,500
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street

413
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,600
who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.

414
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,500
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.

415
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,680
Work is one of the main ones.

416
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,560
That's how you're really controlled, friends.

417
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,260
You have to work for someone else to make a living.

418
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:33,240
Now, the subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.

419
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,920
But that's the rub and the bub, my friend.

420
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:41,120
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.

421
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,400
It's a whole background attitude.

422
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,560
The conspiracy is an attitude.

423
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,240
An attitude of hatred for anything weird.

424
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,840
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.

425
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,380
Now, some strange things are bad.

426
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,220
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange ones.

427
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,040
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,

428
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,980
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend,

429
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,660
so they can catch you, make you look like a kook in front of millions.

430
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,680
Now, history proves that every time you overthrow something overnight,

431
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,940
ditch some old government,

432
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,240
what replaces it?

433
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,380
Always ends up just as bad.

434
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,120
We have to break that cycle, friends.

435
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,340
And this isn't anarchy we're talking about.

436
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,060
Anarchy is just another political system.

437
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,280
Just like atheism is just another religion.

438
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,560
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone at your own pace, casually,

439
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:52,540
but with alertness to subvert the attitude of hating everything weird.

440
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,240
Remember, leftists are just as guilty as rightists.

441
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:06,400
And you don't go out subverting by being an obnoxious Bobby and forcing weirdness down the throats of normals

442
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,700
who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.

443
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,940
That just makes them hate weirdness more.

444
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,420
You should seduce them with abnormality, my friend.

445
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,760
You have to break them in a little at a time.

446
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,500
It depends.

447
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,540
And you can't indiscriminately hate all normals

448
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,400
because that only proves that you are a normal yourself

449
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,240
because you don't like them.

450
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


451
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


452
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


453
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


454
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


455
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


456
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,240


457
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,600
You don't understand yet that half of what you call normals

458
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,300
are actually weirder than you are.

459
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,020
Who do you want to be today?

460
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,040
Who do you want to be?

461
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,900
Who do you want to be today?

462
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,840
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

463
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,160
Oh boy!

464
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,460
It's so terrible.

465
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,420
It's like a trepidation.

466
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,380
And nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV.

467
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,300
I've never been on a plane,

468
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,460
and I've never stayed on a plane without the walls.

469
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,360
I've been hit more than so many times,

470
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,200
I can't remember them all.

471
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,980
And I say,

472
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,020
Who do you want to be today?

473
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,960
Who do you want to be?

474
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,840
Who do you want to be today?

475
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,940
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

476
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,060
Just like somebody on TV!

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,540
I think I'll be a telly boy.

478
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,240
I think I'll be a telly boy.

479
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,240


480
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,640
I think I'll be a punk.

481
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,100
I think I'll be a tough guy.

482
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,200
And I think I'll be a punk.

483
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,220
I might just be a fashion star,

484
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,300
all dressed in pretty rags.

485
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,220
With my head across the other side,

486
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,020
and walk around in drag.

487
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,760
Who do you want to be today?

488
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,760
Who do you want to be?

489
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,600
Who do you want to be today?

490
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,680
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

491
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,840
Just like somebody on TV!

492
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,520
Oh yeah!

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,460
Do you like to live just like a rock in the middle of the sea?

494
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,440
Do you want to suffer by yourself in a pool of blissful misery?

495
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,200
Do you feel like a saint in honest clothes with a rosary in your hand?

496
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,540
Do you want to be crazy like Van Gogh, like a stranger in a

497
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,720
strange, strange land?

498
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,780
Would you rather push the buttons and be feared by all humanity?

499
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,700
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum?

500
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,300
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

501
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,420
Who do you want to be today?

502
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,440
Who do you want to be?

503
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,240
Who do you want to be today?

504
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,320
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

505
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,600
Just like somebody on TV!

506
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,840
Who do you want to be today?

507
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,900
Who do you want to be?

508
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,280


509
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,000
Who do you want to be today?

510
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,420
Who do you want to be today?

511
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:10,420


512
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,720
Who do you want to be today?

513
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,400
To use my own super cool studly self as an example,

514
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,340
now in person I don't really appear like a mad prophet of the airwaves.

515
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:39,700
I very deliberately look like an innocent computer whiz or something.

516
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,220
If a policeman stops me for speeding, I look like a regular citizen.

517
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,120
And part of me is.

518
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,800
And so he doesn't look in the trunk to see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies of subgenius pamphlets

519
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,900
to hand out to grade school kids, which I am.

520
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,900
I get away with murder this way, friends.

521
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,760
And that time the Secret Service came to my house.

522
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,380
They took one look and said, oh, he's just a poor humorist.

523
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,480
He isn't building bombs.

524
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
Not physical bombs, nay, my friends.

525
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,840
But.

526
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:24,200
Me and perhaps many of you are from that 1970s post-hippie nihilistic generation more or less.

527
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,200
And aside from not working for a living,

528
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,480
I and perhaps you are still that same devious hippie.

529
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,740
Not a commie, nay, not a pinko, but a soldier for slack.

530
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,860
A warrior against the conspiracy of the normals.

531
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,000
And so.

532
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,900
Truly suffered.

533
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,040
To smite them.

534
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,700
But not physically.

535
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,400
Smite them psychologically.

536
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,700
With your jokes.

537
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,100
Your cryptic statements.

538
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,900
Your band.

539
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,100
Your paintings.

540
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,100
Your weird car.

541
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,900
Your whole attitude.

542
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,340
Not just your haircut and clothes, my God.

543
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,160
The normals can wear weird haircuts and clothes and they do it all the time.

544
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,200
If they are normal.

545
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,100
If they are normal, my friend.

546
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,480
They will recoil in fear and jealousy to see a free man or woman.

547
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,880
But for latent subgeni who are ripe to be saved, you are setting a good example.

548
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,920
To be weird in your own way.

549
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,940
Achieve slack in your own life.

550
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,220
My friend and those who are worthy will turn toward it as towards a beacon as a moth dives

551
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,660
headlong into the flames.

552
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,040
There.

553
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:51,660
They are not trying to steal your slack or to imitate you, but merely to see what is

554
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,240
possible.

555
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,080
Then and only then will they learn to pull the wool over their own eyes.

556
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,220
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends.

557
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,620
They have to just stumble upon Bob in their own sweet time.

558
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,100
And I'm not saying be yourself.

559
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,500
Quote unquote.

560
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,700
There are too many yourselves.

561
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,020
There are too many yourselves.

562
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,020


563
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,020


564
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:21,300
You might end up being your own conspiracy normal lynch mob self.

565
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,640
So you must try to try not to achieve the development of your Bob self.

566
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,040
That in you which is Bob-like.

567
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:39,980
And there is no rule book for this, my friend, except the one you make and the one that you

568
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,100
buy from Bob.

569
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,560
Praise Bob.

570
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,020
Praise Bob.

571
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,020


572
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,140
Ha.

573
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,460
Help me, somebody.

574
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,840
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.

575
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,240
Pull the lever.

576
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,940
Pull the lever.

577
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,060
Down, you go.

578
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,780
Oh, my.

579
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,880
Oh, my day.

580
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,640
I still have to wit.

581
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,880
Oh my god.

582
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,600
I can't wait to see Bob.

583
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,000
If you end up adding my stuff, Bill, this ocean- olarak, this rock with wonder and

584
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,020
a NBA Weaver full of brilliance.

585
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,940
You are listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON.

586
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,060
Praise Bob!

587
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,360
Yeah, people will go off and worship their stylish fashion gods,

588
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,920
their Madonna gods, their Beatle gods,

589
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,560
their Jim Morrison gods,

590
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,780
all those are false prophets.

591
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,400
They're false prophets.

592
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,060
Jerry Falwell, God.

593
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,880
How did you get in this terrible mess this week?

594
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,980
Can I get a T.I.?

595
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,020
T.I., man. Far out, man. T.I., man.

596
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,940
Slave labor in Nicaragua.

597
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,020
Making electronic parts, man.

598
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,880
A brain slave.

599
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,900
Far out, man.

600
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,380
Slave to their reality, their world, their society,

601
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,600
their way of life, their religion.

602
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,320
Their ideology, their conformity.

603
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,680
Because conformity and creativity are the same in their world.

604
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,980
It's me on the road.

605
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,580
Imagination. What's that?

606
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,340
No.

607
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,320
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

608
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,540
The sidewalk surface was dancing with tricks.

609
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,200
In mad whirling surf and colds.

610
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,220
They love more kicks.

611
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,040
They hook each other like drugs to their blood.

612
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,760
And drop troughs and traps when they're playing stud.

613
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,060
And they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending the trend.

614
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,020
Pretty folks, pretty folks, pretty folks, pretty folks.

615
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,020


616
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,800
They'll never mend.

617
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,840
Splitting their cells.

618
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,120
Looking for pills.

619
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,400
They blow their change and they don't pay their bills.

620
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
Modified modular.

621
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,880
Spandex decay.

622
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,700
Blocks of flash zeros.

623
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,380
With nothing to say.

624
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:50,600
And they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending the trend.

625
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,460
Pretty folks, pretty folks, pretty folks, pretty folks.

626
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,300
They'll never mend.

627
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,760
They do the same.

628
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,240
They location by number.

629
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,240


630
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,240


631
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,240


632
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,220
They'll never mend.

633
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,840
Splitting their cells.

634
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,360
They hook each other like drugs do.

635
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,360


636
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,360


637
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,060
to age

638
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,180
as they decompose

639
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,360
in memory's

640
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,400
cage

641
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,120
but total loss

642
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,480
is not

643
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,980
something to hide

644
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,140
when the last

645
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
big sleep

646
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,320
has started inside

647
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,340
cause they're

648
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,200
pretty folks

649
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,820
pretty folks

650
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,740
bending the trend

651
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,020
pretty folks

652
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,860
pretty folks

653
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,620
pretty folks

654
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,380
that never bend

655
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,200
the trend

656
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,440
Nash the Slash

657
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,960
from the album

658
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,740
and you

659
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,140
thought you were normal

660
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,960
and this is the hour of slack

661
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,300
the radio ministry

662
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,300
of the church

663
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,460
of the subgenius

664
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,520
this is your host

665
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,280
Reverend Ivan Stan

666
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,680
don't ask any questions

667
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,940
just do as I say

668
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,620
alright

669
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,380
we're pretty sure

670
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,920
he's a psychopath

671
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,620
now

672
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,040
how do we spot him

673
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,440
well if he's wearing

674
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,180
a Napoleon hat

675
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,640
it's easy

676
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,080
otherwise

677
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,760
he'd come in all sizes

678
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,440
and shapes

679
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,700
from 11 year old girls

680
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,720
to 80 year old men

681
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,740
they all look perfectly normal

682
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,640
I keep telling you

683
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,100
this is a sick

684
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,140
perverted nation

685
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,820
all the time

686
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,320
and nobody wants

687
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,220
to listen to me

688
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,800
nobody wants to

689
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,240
hear about Bob

690
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,940
nobody

691
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,900
I try to tell everybody

692
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,820
what's going on

693
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,560
they won't listen to me

694
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,080
well

695
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,780
to tell you the truth

696
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,080
I can't stand it anymore

697
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,500
Bob

698
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,500
Bob

699
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,960
Bob

700
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,760
Bob

701
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,440
Bob

702
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,940
Bob

703
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,500
Bob

704
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:01,500


705
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:01,500


706
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,460
Bob take care of me

707
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,660
Bob just do away with them all

708
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,100
I don't want them anymore

709
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,060
they'll probably lose you soon

710
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,480
but you better see

711
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,380
what a son of a Aur Gutenberg

712
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,380


713
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,360
breach like that

714
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,420
it was lost

715
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,420


716
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:21,420


717
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,680
Eraus

718
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,420
Es ist nicht

719
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,420


720
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,420


721
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,420


722
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:30,920
Coney

723
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:30,920


724
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:30,920


725
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:30,920


726
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:30,920


727
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,920
cuando

728
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,140
in your room

729
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,040
I've been

730
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:50,400
It's not just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

731
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,200
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu.

732
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:02,740
It's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity parents and then cruised the streets with bloody feet.

733
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:13,600
It's not just those starry old vics on the park benches with looks on their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

734
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,780
It's not just the anesthesiologist for Negi.

735
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:25,580
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

736
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,320
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

737
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,860
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car hood.

738
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,900
It's not just that the old ways were best.

739
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,740
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

740
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,880
It's not just the kill-a-shit ganja from the dark side of the bush.

741
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,500
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

742
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,720
It's not just the dino bones for Nunu.

743
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,080
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

744
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,200
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

745
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,920
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

746
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,320
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a bitch who thinks workers are property.

747
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,700
It's not just the blueness of the wound, cleanliness, and the blood of the dead.

748
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,360
It's not just the blood of the dead.

749
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,360
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

750
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:49,180
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a dino more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

751
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:57,840
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

752
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,520
It's not just the doorway to doom.

753
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,540
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

754
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,020
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max.

755
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,300
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

756
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,300
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

757
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,800
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

758
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,640
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

759
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:35,080
Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

760
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Not off. He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

761
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,100
In his back pocket. Just you try it.

762
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,560
I don't use a clump of mud.

763
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,820
I don't use a tape recorder.

764
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,020
I don't use things that don't always run.

765
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,840
I don't use a tape recorder.

766
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,360
Bob is masking tape.

767
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,320
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

768
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,260
Bob is a rooster and Bob is a hen.

769
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,560
I can't even make a thing on my mind.

770
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,100
They're saying I don't smoke bottles.

771
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,980
They're squirming.

772
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,780
They're trying to take over everything.

773
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,020
Bob!

774
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,280
We want Bob!

775
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,860
Where is Bob? We want Bob!

776
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,820
Right now! We want Bob!

777
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,100
Okay, Bob's probably not gonna be here in physical manifestation.

778
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,420
Where is Bob? He's everywhere.

779
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,340
Check yourself and feel up your Bob gland and make sure it's overactive like it's supposed to be.

780
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,500
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.

781
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,700
Now wait a minute!

782
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,340
No, you wait a minute. I love that area.

783
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,100
And I...

784
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,900
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose.

785
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,480
To put an end to war.

786
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,100
Naturally, such a goal may be attained.

787
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,500
But...

788
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:23,480
Men of vision, men such as you, Doctor, gathered here, exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success, we hope to achieve a goal.

789
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


790
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


791
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


792
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


793
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


794
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


795
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:23,480


796
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,640
We believe exciting new techniques leap years ahead of the others.

797
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,220
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.

798
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,300
Well, there you have it.

799
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,100
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

800
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,320
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women.

801
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,680
And as such, we can accomplish wonders.

802
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,840
Like any other church, the Church of the Subgenius has divine tenets!

803
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,940
Divine rules!

804
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,280
Divine orders!

805
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,000
The first rule of the Subgenius Church is...

806
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,620
Too much is always better than not enough!

807
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,780
Can I get a too much?

808
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,840
What is it always better than?

809
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,880
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

810
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,040
Hello, Paul. Welcome to the End Times.

811
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,820
In today's video,

812
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,380
in today's End Time essay,

813
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,000
we will be covering the difference between

814
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,720
the Gaprofram and the Bloodyhead Launcher Society itself.

815
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,040
As seen here in our first slide,

816
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,780
the Bloodyhead Launcher Society goes on forever.

817
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,100
There is no end, and there's no use resisting.

818
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,880
There'sgear.org whatthereisno Hallelujah whatthereisno

819
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,760
What there's screen permit here.

820
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,180
There'sJoke.

821
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,180


822
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,180


823
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,440
Haaa!

824
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,020
Sneers, isn't it?

825
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,940
There.

826
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,760
Oh, I know where the slur's at.

827
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:12,860
Hungeness.

828
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,840
Senoun desk.

829
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:19,840


830
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:19,860
I'm still here.

831
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:19,900
And...

832
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,080
A piece which is under hell.

833
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't let them whitewash your subcontinent mind and sell it back to you for a hefty profit.

834
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:33,340
Some of you think I'm talking revolution. Well I am. But not stupid revolution.

835
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,020
Do machines get smarter and city hall get dumber?

836
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:46,340
Well forget it for now. That's exactly the way they want you to behave so they can have an excuse to mount their gun turrets against all the supposed fringe group cybernobbies.

837
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:54,320
Now come on, keep those thoughts to yourself. You shouldn't depress anybody. You'll be seen as a downer spreading bad karma.

838
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:06,180
People don't want to be reminded of it. This is the theme of the neurotic 80s. The human race is cracking up. The toxic waste of the me generation of we.

839
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:13,320
The McCarthyite witch hunters are back and in too many ways to support them. They're out for us.

840
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,260
Physical perfection and mental health.

841
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,600
There's no indication that you're a white side.

842
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,440
Oh but don't bum us out. We want to have fun.

843
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:29,120
Just watch that soft core porno who's so dicky with a reverence. A reverence sometimes can be a light of the country.

844
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,000
On some occasions, baphomay seems to be associated with an apparition of a bearded head.

845
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,100
In any case, we found indisputable evidence for the charge of secret service.

846
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,000
Is it all that you can at some time?

847
00:48:51,260 --> 00:49:00,060
Smug, a walrus or a bat, there's a 언 long请 Affair in the哈哈哈

848
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:10,440
Say the world you'll never cheat.

849
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,440
No

850
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:11,740
No

851
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,980
No

852
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,680
No

853
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,200
No

854
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:14,240
No

855
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,340
No

856
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,740
There's a world going on underground

857
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,460
Geez, this is awful, Dad.

858
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,940
Clark's loaded on dope and he's killing people.

859
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,600
Tell it to the X-mas bunny, kid.

860
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,460
You watch the Astros.

861
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,660
I love it.

862
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,480
It's a shake.

863
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,720
Shake it.

864
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,400
Get free.

865
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:50,080
When you're a jet, you stay a jet.

866
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,720
There's only one thing Rick would say.

867
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,960
How do I know?

868
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,380
I'm here.

869
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,200
Not in some very lonely place.

870
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,020
How do I know I'm not on a...

871
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,500
Got a problem?

872
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,300
Bring it to the friendly people.

873
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,620
People touching people.

874
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,080
People rubbing against people.

875
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,780
People developing the nuclear first strike capability to incinerate people.

876
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,360
Sound like a flash in the pan?

877
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,320
It's gotta be.

878
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,480
You don't settle for less.

879
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,360
You don't have to.

880
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,040
You're you.

881
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,580
And you've got needs bigger and more earth-shaking than your grandfather could have dreamed.

882
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,820
How do we keep bringing them to you, year after year, bigger and better?

883
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,800
By using the technology of tomorrow on the consumers of today.

884
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
The now people.

885
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,980
People on the go.

886
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:11,180
Going from smart shopper to new low value in the time it takes to dial our number.

887
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,680
Call now, won't you?

888
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,000
For more of what you've come to expect from us.

889
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:18,940
Style.

890
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,600
Mood.

891
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,180
A certain dependable kind of image.

892
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,060
An image of the way you'd like people to be.

893
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,120
Passive.

894
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,420
Pretty.

895
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,480
White.

896
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,420
As white as the complexion of our finest women.

897
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,640
Grown right here by our special process.

898
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,880
As white as the hair of God.

899
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,380
White as the hair of God.

900
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,640
White as it was in life.

901
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,420
As white as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

902
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,440
Who are we?

903
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,280
We're the happy people.

904
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,300
Happy to live in a world of images.

905
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,260
Images of war.

906
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:00,720
Family.

907
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,420
Crime.

908
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:10,680
Fun images that help rinse away unsightly self-images so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

909
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,400
After all, aren't you what everything's here for?

910
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,400
You're what we're here for.

911
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,000
That's why we made everything.

912
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,600
And that's why everything made you.

913
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,080
And that's why you made us.

914
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,260
Who are we?

915
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,720
We're the money people.

916
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,920
The people who take your money.

917
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,080
No more money hassling.

918
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,180
But what about little Dicky, you say?

919
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:54,800
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?

920
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,320
Put away those straps and buckles.

921
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,660
Dicky's safe with us.

922
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,040
He's even learning to speak again.

923
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,060
Our way.

924
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,240
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.

925
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,100
Simplicity.

926
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,260
Reliability.

927
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,860
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.

928
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,440
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.

929
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,440
Like you, we thought there was a world out there.

930
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,180
A world of value.

931
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,620
A world that needed meaning.

932
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,360
Beauty.

933
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,320
Love.

934
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,120
A world that needed a better product.

935
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,540
Uh-uh.

936
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,100
There's just you.

937
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,240
And you want to know something.

938
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,380
You want to know just exactly what it is you're supposed to do.

939
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,040
You don't really care why.

940
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,680
Just so long as it's the right thing.

941
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,860
It's natural.

942
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,440
Everyone wants to do the right thing.

943
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,000
But sometimes it's hard to know just what the right thing is.

944
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,680
Let's say you're black.

945
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:26,540
And you've just lost both your arms and legs defending U.S. interests in El Salvador.

946
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,920
You come home and get thrown in jail for life for beating up four white cops.

947
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,720
You want to know just exactly what is it I'm supposed to feel.

948
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,280
We can't give you all the answers.

949
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,820
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

950
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,740
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

951
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,580
Love.

952
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,540
Children.

953
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,720
God.

954
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:04,800
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy, grown right here by our special process.

955
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,860
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

956
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,080
Who are we?

957
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,980
We're the normal people.

958
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,080
That was Michael Pepe.

959
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,880
Yes, Michael Pepe.

960
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,180
Remember that name, folks.

961
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,080
Off his tape, Life Itself.

962
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,800
The greatest hits of Michael Pepe.

963
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,540
You can find out more about Michael Pepe.

964
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:40,540
And more creatures like that from the Church of the Subgenius.

965
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,460
We'll give that box number at the end of the broadcast.

966
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:45,460
I am.

967
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,100
I am.

968
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:46,940
I am to come.

969
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,280
I was.

970
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:47,900
I was.

971
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:48,640
I am.

972
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,480
I am to come.

973
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:49,860
I was.

974
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:50,500
I am.

975
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,220
I am.

976
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,240
I was to come.

977
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:52,560
I was.

978
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,160
I was.

979
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,040
I am.

980
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,500
I am.

981
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,320
I am to come.

982
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:57,780
I was.

983
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,420
I was.

984
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,080
I was.

985
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,560
I was to come.

986
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:00,740
Oh!

987
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,500
I was.

988
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:02,060
I was.

989
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:02,860
I was!

990
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,380
I was.

991
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,300
I was to come.

992
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:04,480
I was.

993
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,040
I am, I am, I am to come, my boy.

994
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,600
I am.

995
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:07,600


996
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:07,600


997
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:07,600


998
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,040
Dynamic overdrive.

999
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,740
I'm operating in ten thousand revolutions.

1000
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,480
My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

1001
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,040
I am certain you know what reality is.

1002
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,420
No matter what I do to change it.

1003
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,380
Normal I remain.

1004
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,060
No matter who you turn into.

1005
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:35,660
Normal can be just as bad as riding in a wheelchair

1006
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:45,160
Today, serious heresy is a deviant state of consciousness.

1007
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,420
Not so much deviant opinions

1008
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:53,180
as having a kind of experience

1009
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:59,300
which is different from regular experience.

1010
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,540
We are taught what experiences are permissible

1011
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,360
and therefore if a person has so-called strange experiences

1012
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,720
and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people

1013
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,600
he is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

1014
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,620
are you feeling alright?

1015
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,900
Because people feel

1016
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,160
that they are not feeling alright.

1017
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,160


1018
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,160


1019
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,160


1020
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,320
Distinctly uncomfortable

1021
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,900
when they realize that they are in the presence of someone

1022
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,140
who is experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

1023
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,340
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

1024
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,060
A cigar or something.

1025
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,960
They look like a human being

1026
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,540
but because the state of experience is so different

1027
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,220
you wonder whether they really are.

1028
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,220
And in rather the same way

1029
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,160
in a very everyday kind of sense,

1030
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:53,500
because it is the symptom of a certain circumstance

1031
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,560
when you are sitting in a bar drinking

1032
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,720
and you find you have a drunk next to you

1033
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,820
and he turns to you and says,

1034
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,480
I say,

1035
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:08,660
and you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man

1036
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,580
because he has become in some way

1037
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,380
what we mean by non-human.

1038
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,440
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow

1039
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,400
increasingly cloudy skies once again

1040
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,760
with some rain in the forefront.

1041
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,280
crawled in and I must say I'm happy.

1042
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,040
All right boys, Bob's got you hooked.

1043
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,000
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

1044
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,840
You know that Bob's doing something spooky again, ain't he?

1045
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,260
That's what you're listening to here.

1046
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,560
Yeah, yeah.

1047
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,460
That's the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

1048
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,400
It's the kind of Bob that follows you home.

1049
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,020
It's the kind of Bob that calls you out

1050
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,580
in the middle of the night and hangs out in the city.

1051
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,380
Hey, let's kill Bob.

1052
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:06,680
I got, I saw these hot dogs, Bob,

1053
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:15,540
and they're like when my daddy got killed

1054
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,900
with a baseball.

1055
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,320
Cause those are the kind they sold there.

1056
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,460
Ohio.

1057
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:33,120
Ohio.

1058
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,580
She's gone to Ohio.

1059
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,380
They've got paddle wheels there.

1060
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,840
Paddle wheels.

1061
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,120
Bigger than a Panzer tank, Bob.

1062
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,700
Bigger than a Panzer tank.

1063
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,900
Bob.

1064
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:06,140
Ohio.

1065
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,140
In Ohio.

1066
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,480
You got Ohio.

1067
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:13,060
Ohio.

1068
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,460
Ohio.

1069
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,020
Ohio.

1070
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,740
Five years.

1071
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,740
Come on.

1072
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,100
big, big, big, big, big, big,

1073
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:33,760
Bigger than a Lego Wall dibular that makes aB presidente Cracker

1074
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:33,760


1075
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,700
the loudspeaker spoke up and said,

1076
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:48,380
the loudspeaker spoke up and said, the loudspeaker spoke up and said, the loudspeaker spoke up and said, The loudspeaker spoke up and said, The loudspeaker spoke up and said,

1077
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,660
A loud speaker spoke up and said,

1078
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,580
Christianity is stupid.

1079
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,500
Christianity is stupid.

1080
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,520
Christianity is stupid.

1081
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,740
Christianity is stupid.

1082
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,900
Christianity is stupid.

1083
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:26,620
Oh, dear friends, and now we come down near the end of an hour of slack with this song,

1084
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:30,440
this offensive song from negative land.

1085
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:33,340
I must admit, this is just really disgraceful.

1086
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,160
Friends, that P.O. Box you can write to for more information about the Church of the Subgenius

1087
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,380
and its publications is Bob.

1088
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:47,660
Friends, you can write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1089
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,420
It's in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1090
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:57,360
Thank you for listening, dear friends, and stay tuned for the Monday Morning Show

1091
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,200
with Johnny Horton and Norm Warden.

1092
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,980
Other things.

1093
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:01,800
Give up!

1094
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,900
Christianity is stupid!

1095
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,660
Christianity is stupid!

1096
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,460
Christianity is stupid!

1097
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,280
Christianity is stupid!

1098
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,420
Give up!

1099
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,520
Give up!

1100
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,400
Give up!
