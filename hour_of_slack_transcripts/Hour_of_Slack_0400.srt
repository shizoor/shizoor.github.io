1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
And now we are made again.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,240
Listen to those fireworks, friends, and welcome.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,100
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 400, believe it or not, but keep your heads down, friends,

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,240
because it's also the X-Day special.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,680
Broadcasting on X-Day, July 4th, 1993.

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,540
Five years to X-Day.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,220
And count.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,320
The Soap Genius.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,940
Hour of Slack.

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,300
Ignition.

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,660
Liftoff.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:29,440
The Soap Genius.

13
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,480
The Soap Genius.

14
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,100
The Soap Genius.

15
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,400
The Soap Genius.

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,980
The Soap Genius.

17
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,860
The Soap Genius.

18
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,760
The Soap Genius.

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,500
Yes, we always have to do that on X-Day.

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Whoa, X-Day Eve.

21
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,260
Got to be careful.

22
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,040
Sound effects can...

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,460
Sound effects can...

24
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,540
Sound effects can...

25
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,860
Sound effects can...

26
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,780
It can hurt.

27
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,520
It can hurt bad.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,940
It can tear you up.

29
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,420
And, uh, yes.

30
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:46,220
And we're so happy to wish you a happy X-Day Eve.

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,820
And as I said, we're broadcasting from Dallas at this time in your past.

32
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,780
Most of your past, at least, on July 4th.

33
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,640
A false independent day.

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,100
What we call one day before the beginning of the world.

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
X-Day, the real Independence Day.

36
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,480
July 5th, 1998, which we have to celebrate in advance.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, when a dog's prophecy tells us that the men from Planet X

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,600
and the sex goddesses of the escape vessels will rupture up,

39
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,820
the true subgenius dues-paying members

40
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,660
and those on Bob's mailing list database disks.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,240
So, uh, this being the day that pinks celebrate

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,260
and pat themselves on the back for being, uh,

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,240
well, just so goddurn free.

44
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,340
Well, uh, we've got a real all-American show planned.

45
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,120
All you Rush Limbaugh and Barney the Dinosaur fans

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,460
will just love what came in the mail this week.

47
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,500
And by the way, folks, uh, did you know,

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,840
did you know that Rush Limbaugh is Barney the Dinosaur

49
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,360
in a Rush Limbaugh suit?

50
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,960
It's true.

51
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,760
And, uh, tip of the crown to Princess.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,980
We are dope for that, uh, research.

53
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,340
But, friends, we've got a tape,

54
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,360
in the, in the mail, uh, this last week

55
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,960
from the, uh, the, the new improved Juke Savages

56
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,480
who had previously sent a fantastic tape

57
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,460
that was, it was intense,

58
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,600
but it was so, uh, peppered with the, uh, F word

59
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,980
that, uh, oh, it was, it was painful,

60
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,440
but we couldn't do anything with it.

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,120
Well, now this new album has come out

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
from the new improved Juke Savages

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,160
with Krishna Fats.

64
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,540
And the Night Nurses.

65
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,140
This album called

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,940
Radical Militant Vegetarians in Nazi Land.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,620
And I just want to say that I am proud,

68
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,160
proud to be, uh, presenting this, uh,

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,620
on the Hour of Slack.

70
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,860
Uh, yes.

71
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,300
Regarding my politics,

72
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm an anarchist.

73
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,900
Regarding everyone else's,

74
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm a Nazi.

75
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,160
I don't want to live in Nazi land.

76
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,140
I don't want to live in Nazi land.

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,420
I don't want to bury my head in the sand

78
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,480
and have to pretend that everything's grand.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,400
I don't want to live in Nazi land

80
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,460
where the media's controlled,

81
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
the mass mind's programmed.

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,620
I don't want to live in Nazi land

83
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,740
based on dominance and violence

84
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,800
where the flames of hate are fanned.

85
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,640
I don't want to live where fear's the plan.

86
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,720
I do not like green eggs and ham

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,220
and I don't want to live in Nazi land.

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I love love, and get it straight,

89
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,320
I hate hate.

90
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,960
I don't know if people hate love,

91
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,600
but you can see people love to hate.

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
There's no debate, get it straight.

93
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,800
Look around, it's the human state.

94
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Is it fate? It isn't great.

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,980
Do you think it might be too late?

96
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,040
People love, love, love, love, love to hate.

97
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,600
There's no debate, state that people love to hate.

98
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,620
There's no debate, state that people love to hate.

99
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,400
People love, love, love, love, love, love to hate.

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,540
They love to hate, they love to hate.

101
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,520
The Nazi in all of us loves to hate.

102
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,320
It's so much better.

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,880
It's better than taking responsibility for yourself.

104
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,960
And now, by the same guy who brought you

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,880
knee-grin cakes, spits, warts, fakes, chips,

106
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,920
scoots and gypsies, ladies and gentlemen,

107
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,240
the next president and red wizard of Nazi land,

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,300
enough dope with the cuckoo cuck squad,

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,260
I'm Jack of vocals, singing their newest hit,

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,020
It's out there in Nazi land.

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

112
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,380
Joe and the Poop!

113
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,080
Do you wanna live in Nazi land?

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,040
Did you already live in Nazi land?

115
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,180
Do you wanna live in Nazi land?

116
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,340
Where the Nazis in control have a Nazi plan?

117
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,340
Where only if you're white do you count as a man?

118
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,520
Where a woman's only role is baby land?

119
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,360
Every negro and kite should understand.

120
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,740
And the Asians, Latinos, and everyone with a tan.

121
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,760
Do you wanna live where everything's planned?

122
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,380
By Adolf Duke, the right hand man of the lords?

123
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,800
I hate the cuckoo cuckoo clock's plan.

124
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,980
Wouldn't you rather have to drive a van?

125
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,820
Hey, wouldn't you rather live without a plan?

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,280
Hey, I'd rather have a plan.

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,380
I'd rather have a friend named Stan than have to live in Nazi land.

128
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,040
I do not like green eggs and ham,

129
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,500
but I'd rather eat green eggs and ham.

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,360
Would you rather eat green eggs and ham than have to live in Nazi land?

131
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,380
What is this trip about green eggs and ham?

132
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,420
Is that what they eat in Nazi land?

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Watch out, you get n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nazis in your spines.

134
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,180
Watch out for people with n-n-n-n-n-nazis in their spines.

135
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,940
I mean, I can see you.

136
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,280
How can you not see me?

137
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
See higher.

138
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,700
Nazis need love too.

139
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,680
See higher.

140
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,880
Nazis need love too.

141
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,500
Nazi land is in a fluke.

142
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,740
Let's take all hatred out on spooks and kooks and kikes and gooks and jukes.

143
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,720
Now Adolf Duke might make you puke, but he's smooth and sharp and cool as a kuke.

144
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,820
And you tell me, was it just a fluke that over half the whites voted for Adolf Duke?

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,900
And if you're not a white supremacist kuke, you've gotta be spooked or ready to puke.

146
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,660
It's unreal.

147
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,260
How can you not see me?

148
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,460
It's unbelievable.

149
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,640
See higher.

150
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,820
Nazis need love too.

151
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,780
See higher.

152
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,020
Nazis need love too.

153
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,240
I mean, Adolf Duke says Jesus is the most important thing in his life.

154
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,920
Well, something ain't kosher here.

155
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,080
I mean, do you feel like you're being condomized the only one?

156
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,700
I mean, don't these Nazis realize they would have incinerated Jesus because he was Jewish?

157
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,560
And his mother was Jewish?

158
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,600
Holy funk.

159
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,160
They would have incinerated the Virgin Mary because why?

160
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,800
Because her divine lover was the God of Abraham.

161
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,600
Hey, none of these people were Christians.

162
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,620
And they certainly weren't National Socialists.

163
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:20,020
In Nazi land, Nazi land, they can always hire a band, but their favorite band in Nazi land is always Adolf Duke and the Cthulhu Tux Band.

164
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, there are always riots in the stands because they love to hate like all their fans.

165
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,060
But I don't want to live in Nazi land.

166
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,040
I'd rather hear a different band.

167
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,200
But in Nazi land, they just don't understand.

168
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,120
In Nazi land, they didn't get it.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,880
Nazis might be aliens disguised as Nazis.

170
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,840
And don't get me wrong, okay, I like Nazis.

171
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,000
I mean, I don't have anything against Nazis.

172
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,180
Some of my best friends are Nazis.

173
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,260
I mean, I can see you.

174
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,620
How can you not see me?

175
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,700
Do you want to not see me?

176
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,820
Do you want me to not see you?

177
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey, what a joke.

178
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,560
Take a Nazi to lunch.

179
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,080
Hatred doesn't let us any time cease by hatred.

180
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,280
Hatred ceases by love.

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,340
They didn't get it.

182
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,220
What do you think?

183
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,520
Love them to death.

184
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,620
See, how?

185
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,060
Nazis need love, too.

186
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,760
See, how?

187
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,120
Nazis need love, too.

188
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,840
I don't want to live in Nazi land.

189
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,740
I don't want to live in Nazi land.

190
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,060
I'll tell you.

191
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,740
Just say no.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,620
No.

193
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,520
No.

194
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,740
No.

195
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,320
No.

196
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,900
No.

197
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,800
No.

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,440
No.

199
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,880
No.

200
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,320
No.

201
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,620
No.

202
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,360
No.

203
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,540
No.

204
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,700
No.

205
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,420
No.

206
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,840
No.

207
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,620
No.

208
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,480
No.

209
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,640
No.

210
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


211
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


212
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


213
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


214
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


215
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


216
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


217
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


219
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


220
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


222
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:58,640


223
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:17,300
So, how dare you.

224
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,060
Okay, let's be serious.

225
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,180
Okay, I swear that I haven't been here for a while

226
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,700
but I do remember CEOs standing up and being like,

227
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:25,700


228
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:25,980
This just isn't right.

229
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,980


230
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,980


231
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:34,340
I almost got kicked out of high school for playing this song at a football game the night Jimi Hendrix died.

232
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:37,920
Yes.

233
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,100
And I'm probably going to end up sounding like, wait a minute, I've got to hear this.

234
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:13,040
Oh, my God.

235
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:47,600
Oh, my God.

236
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, my God.

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,820
Oh, my God.

238
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,340
Oh, my God.

239
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,560
Oh, my God.

240
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,460
Oh, my God.

241
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh, my God.

242
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,680
Oh, my God.

243
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,980
the airwaves.

244
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,960
As far as, again, as far as

245
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,880
the news media is concerned, it's because all

246
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,820
these people are, oh, they're

247
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,780
lapping up all these

248
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,820
pudgy white boys in

249
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,100
suits with Bibles who say,

250
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,320
oh, now these

251
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,980
liberals have tried

252
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
to clutter everything up and make it

253
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,060
too complicated. But the problem

254
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,860
is actually real,

255
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,740
real simple.

256
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,960
We're smart

257
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,520
and manly.

258
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,200
And they're stupid

259
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,180
and womanly.

260
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:01,260
And

261
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,780
they're good at

262
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,840
saying everything between

263
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,380
the lines

264
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,760
so that when they say,

265
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,440
when they say, quote,

266
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,540
liberal, unquote, you know what

267
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,860
they really mean.

268
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,580
You know,

269
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,840
they really mean those pesky

270
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,540
homos

271
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,960
and Jews

272
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,300
and the uppity women and

273
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,240
minorities.

274
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,240
Don't kid yourself. That's exactly

275
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,500
what they mean.

276
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,480
And the commies are down

277
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,340
and out these days, so now we have to

278
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,340
find anti-American demons

279
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,180
in our own backyards.

280
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,440
And, I mean,

281
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,060
the perspective has been

282
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,380
totally skewed by the

283
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,400
conspiracy to such an extent

284
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,480
that most of

285
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,380
you actually consider

286
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,160
President Clinton

287
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,820
to be a

288
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,280
liberal.

289
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:56,980
A liberal!

290
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,940
A liberal!

291
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,900
If Clinton is a liberal, then I

292
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,020
must, I myself must not

293
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,920
be anywhere on that

294
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,000
damn scale. And I'm not.

295
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,780
And if you're still on that

296
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,100
skewy scale, then you are a complete

297
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,120
sucker. We've got another song about

298
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,940
that coming up.

299
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,600
SNL, Suckers and Losers.

300
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,340
There was an article

301
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,060
in the paper today about the success

302
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,340
of the

303
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,740
right-wing talk shows,

304
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,280
which is now called,

305
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,700
conservative talk shows.

306
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,300
It seems in the Dallas area,

307
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,080
you can hear 15

308
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,360
conservative shows.

309
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
And you can also hear two

310
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
liberal shows. Now, both of the liberal shows

311
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
that they mention are by

312
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,700
namby-pamby black guys.

313
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,380
Bob Ray Sanders and

314
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,400
Jesse Jackson. They didn't mention

315
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,680
the not-so-namby-pamby

316
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,740
show by a black guy,

317
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,320
by John Wiley Price. No,

318
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,400
no, sir. Dallas Morning News didn't mention that,

319
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,140
but they're liberal bias.

320
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,040
That's right. Uh-huh. And if you

321
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,000
step back, dear friends, and

322
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,860
snap out of it, and look

323
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,220
at the guests and the experts

324
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,100
that they feature, you'll find that

325
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,100
shows like Nightline and

326
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
McNeil-Larer, which are

327
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,280
sometimes called liberal,

328
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,080
are actually really

329
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,580
conservative, pro-establishment,

330
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,100
et cetera, et cetera. Another thing

331
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,200
they didn't mention, they don't seem to mention,

332
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,660
one of those little lies of omission,

333
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,120
oh, Clinton said, I hate to

334
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,100
defend Clinton. That's not really,

335
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,080
that's not what I'm doing, but, you know,

336
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,640
they talk about, uh, oh,

337
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,260
how can, Clinton, he's

338
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,180
a coward. He took

339
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,180
that draft deferment so he wouldn't have to

340
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,120
go to Vietnam. You know who else

341
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,280
took that little draft deferment

342
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,000
so they wouldn't have to go to Vietnam?

343
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,580
But they don't talk about these guys.

344
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,820
Secretary of Defense

345
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,420
Dick Cheney did the same thing.

346
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,980
Why, former

347
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,100
drug czar William Bennett

348
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,480
did the same thing.

349
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,040
Pat Buchanan,

350
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,840
did the same thing, and

351
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,760
our own Senator

352
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,620
Phil Graham, the Antichrist.

353
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,080
Chicken hawks

354
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,220
all in. And here's another thing.

355
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,700
Remember the total

356
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,400
arrogance when

357
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,940
Clinton held up all those

358
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,060
planes at the airport while he

359
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,980
got a $200 haircut?

360
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,840
That news story

361
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,040
that really caused everybody to

362
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,980
totally lose patience with him and

363
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,740
think of him as some sort of

364
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,000
remembered Communist Party official?

365
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,900
You remember.

366
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,220
Well, they announced in small

367
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,440
print on page 12

368
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,200
that it

369
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,360
didn't happen.

370
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,980
The media, a few reporters,

371
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,380
invented the story from whole cloth.

372
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,180
No planes had to wait,

373
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,300
and the haircut might have been free

374
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,700
for all anybody knows.

375
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,180
The falsehood made

376
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,200
front page news, but the retraction

377
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,900
was on page 12.

378
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,820
Liberal biased media,

379
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,280
and sometimes conservative media,

380
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,280


381
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,280


382
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,280


383
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,480
chad

384
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,380
everywhere for them.

385
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,920
While the Lanes

386
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,100
and

387
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,120
media

388
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,140
are

389
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:22,240
only

390
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,720
neutral against unlimited

391
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:34,420
upside down and but by god by wotan it is appointed it is appointed to men once to die

392
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:44,600
but after this the judgment uh yes the judgment shall be coming up dear friends because every day

393
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:56,500
is x day when you have a gun and as it saith in isaiah 6.5 and strangers will stand and feed your

394
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:05,720
flocks and the sons of the aliens shall be your plowmen and your bind dressers and this know also

395
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:13,720
that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves

396
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,480
you

397
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:23,460
a covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents uh sound familiar yet friends

398
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:32,220
unthankful unholy and women wearing pants and short haircuts and that's from two uh timothy

399
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:42,480
larry three one and two uh friends because you know if you could see a galaxy being born like

400
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,920
the spurt of

401
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,580
infamously

402
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


403
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


404
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


405
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


406
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


407
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


408
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


409
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


410
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


411
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


412
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:44,580


413
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:53,400
infected blood from between the thighs of some huge incestuous demon you would be ashamed of your

414
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:00,380
own puny little existence you would see yourself as nothing more than an abortion a deformed hunk

415
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:07,940
of snot that was hatefully spat out by a stellar nebula but you were sane enough or paranoid

416
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,580
schizophrenic by society's standards to accept the beauty and purity of this you might as well be a

417
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,240
ыми

418
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:22,020
it being a moment you spoken manly so much that you can't even imagine not of adventure

419
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,340
pate

420
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,620
book

421
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,340
calvary

422
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,800
as well

423
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:25,800


424
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,920
luthier

425
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,040
leately about this

426
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,800
yourself

427
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,580
something far's out there

428
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:44,580
a comic book

429
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:53,940
Oh, the pinks like those fake 4th of July explosions, don't they?

430
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah, well, on 7-7-98, they'll be going,

431
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,880
Whoa, I guess these subgenius fireworks are just a mite stronger.

432
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:17,880
Yes, but we shall have our revenge, our vengeance,

433
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:25,060
and here's that other song from the new improved Juke Savages.

434
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,400
In honor of family sensibilities, the expletives have been deleted.

435
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,620
It was said before his coming,

436
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,600
Lo, they have baptized you in endless taxes,

437
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,740
But upon his coming, lo, he will baptize you in holy fun.

438
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,780
The suckers and the losers are the ones who will pay

439
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,220
For all the money that's lost, all the money that's gone away.

440
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,140
Bail out the S&Ls, the insurance companies, and the banks.

441
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,120
Here's two bucks bent over, nobody even bothers to say thanks.

442
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,640
Hey!

443
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,860
I didn't know you were here.

444
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,520
We're into S&L.

445
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,180
Hey, sucker.

446
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,360
Hey, loser.

447
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,280
You've been had, and you're such a good sport, you're not even mad.

448
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,040
I can dig it.

449
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,820
Who can figure it out?

450
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,040
Are you dumb or numb, or do you want to shout?

451
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,700
But it's no good to shout, so don't shout about it,

452
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,020
And it certainly won't help to pout about it,

453
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,460
But you'll pay till you die.

454
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,820
There's no doubt about it,

455
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,000
And your kids will be paying long after you're gone.

456
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,780
It ain't over yet.

457
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,900
It goes on and on and on.

458
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,840
Hey!

459
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,340
I didn't know you were into S&L.

460
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,880
Don't you wonder?

461
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,920
Where did the money go?

462
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,440
And don't you wonder?

463
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,280
Where did the wealth go?

464
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,160
Don't you wonder?

465
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,160
Go ahead and wonder.

466
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,580
But...

467
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
You'll never know.

468
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,900
Doesn't the government insurance take a load off your mind?

469
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,700
Don't you feel safe and protected?

470
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,600
You know what I like?

471
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,900
I mean, about democracy, everyone's equal,

472
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,000
So instead of letting a few people be screwed,

473
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,820
You know, by unscrupulous bankers and developers

474
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,540
And the politicians they own,

475
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,640
We've had the law like, you know, the FSLIC

476
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
To make sure everyone gets screwed,

477
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,860
Except, of course, for the people who don't.

478
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,060
And the people who get to come.

479
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,980
And it's not the people who mishandle the money who pay,

480
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,400
But all the suckers and losers who look the other way.

481
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,600
We weren't paying attention, were we?

482
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,120
We aren't paying attention now, are we?

483
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,180
Were we too busy to pay attention?

484
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,700
Now we'll pay lots more money.

485
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,320
Were we afraid or ashamed to name the game?

486
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,380
Well, someone thinks it's funny, and I...

487
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,100
I like it! How about you?

488
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,820
I like being expletive-deleted over by people I don't even know.

489
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,180
That way, you're sure it's nothing personal.

490
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,060
I mean, you know, some of these people have more money than they can earn.

491
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,840
You know, some of these people have more money than most suckers and losers can even imagine.

492
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,740
And worked out a little scam, and you've got to hand it to them,

493
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,320
Because if you don't,

494
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,580
The federal government, out buying for what?

495
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,500
Will come and do it for them.

496
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,960
Then they can let the IRS do it for them, you know,

497
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,160
And send you to jail,

498
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,920
And then you pay for the money these guys stole.

499
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,920
Now, doesn't the government insurance take a load off your mind?

500
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,420
Don't you feel safe and protected?

501
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,620
Just go F-S-L-I-C,

502
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,700
K yourself, I mean just go F-S-L-I-C,

503
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,500
K yourself, go F-S-L-I-C,

504
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,420
K yourself!

505
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,540
Pay me, pay me,

506
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,360
I support it.

507
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm not gonna complain because as an American,

508
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,560
I'll fight to the death for rights and freedom.

509
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,100
You know, like the right of the CIA to sell drugs,

510
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,280
So they don't have these little funding problems, you know,

511
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,200
The freedom of fat cats to steal money from you,

512
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,360
The same way someone stole lamb from the Indians,

513
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,620
Because they do it on paper,

514
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,500
And don't actually stick people up.

515
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,640
I mean, think about it.

516
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,220
You know, if somebody robbed you on the street for,

517
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,500
You know, 15 bucks,

518
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,840
We'd talk about jail for, you know, years, okay?

519
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,080
But somebody oozes away half your wealth, life savings and lifestyle,

520
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,720
To some S&L bailout inflationary bull expletive deleted,

521
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,740
And we talk about a plaque with their name on it,

522
00:28:59,740 --> 00:28:59,740


523
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,960
You know, I'm gonna go to the airport or something,

524
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,520
And why?

525
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,160
Because they stole it legally,

526
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,420
You know what that means?

527
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,540
Go S-L-I-C, K yourself, just go.

528
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,260
I mean, forget the L.A. looting,

529
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,200
We're not talking about 800 million,

530
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,780
We're talking about over 200 billion,

531
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,020
And that's with a B, baby, and counting.

532
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,580
Now that's looting.

533
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,220
You know, I mean,

534
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,460
I never even voted for this,

535
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,940
Social Security or the F-S-L-I-C,

536
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,200
But I really like supporting a system that is so socially insecure,

537
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,200
That money is pouring down invisible drains,

538
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,580
F-U-S-L-I-C, K protected,

539
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,840
Because the rest of us will happily pay for it.

540
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,840
I mean, are we gonna complain about abuse and mismanagement?

541
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,280
Not those of us who are good citizens,

542
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,360
We just bend over, no gasoline needed,

543
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,260
Doesn't the government insurance take a load off your mind?

544
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,620
Don't you feel safe and protected?

545
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,120
Just go S-L-I-C, K yourself, and...

546
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,240
Now if you're thinking of bitching,

547
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,160
All I can say is,

548
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,900
America, love it or leave it,

549
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,320
Why don't you fly back to Russia?

550
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
You're walking on the fighting side of me,

551
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm proud to be a sucker and loser from Muskogee.

552
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,500
Expletive deleted,

553
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,600
Anytime the guys behind the scenes want to

554
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,660
Expletive delete us over, you know,

555
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,980
To pay money or send kids to die in the deserts and jungles,

556
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,240
Me and all the good ass people,

557
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,580
We're Americans,

558
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,420
We'll be the first in line,

559
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,120
And we won't listen to the detractors and complainers,

560
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:37,020
And we promise not to listen to anything bad anyone says about it,

561
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,540
And if we do hear something about it,

562
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,760
Most of all, we promise not to think about it.

563
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,700
And you call that American?

564
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,820
Don't give me that.

565
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,640
Patriotic bull, expletive deleted,

566
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,540
You ignore the loss of freedom through economic manipulation,

567
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,920
Because it sounds too complicated,

568
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,420
And besides, you're too busy watching the game,

569
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,040
And don't get me wrong,

570
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,980
I've got nothing against football,

571
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Okay, I like football,

572
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,320
Some of my best friends watch football,

573
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,500
But don't call me unpatriotic,

574
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,120
Because I'll stand against the accepted view,

575
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,460
And call it like I see it,

576
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,360
Don't you get it, George?

577
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,160
This is patriotic!

578
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,880
Let me see if I've got this right, alright?

579
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,320
It's like the opposite of a sticker.

580
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,140
I give my money to an S&L bank or insurance company,

581
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,840
Only when I come back for it,

582
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,400
Like if you lost it, or snorted it,

583
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,200
Or invested it in junk bonds in a company your brother-in-law owns,

584
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,280
I can go F-S-L-I-C-K myself,

585
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,160
And I don't have to worry,

586
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,520
Because it's insurance.

587
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,780
Only,

588
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,940
I'm insurance.

589
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,700
If you lose my money,

590
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,180
I pay for it.

591
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,680
And if you lose someone else's money,

592
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,420
I pay for it.

593
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,440
And we call it chaos with the banking laws,

594
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,360
The F-S-L-I-C chaos with the tax laws,

595
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,780
The F-S-L-I-C chaos with military spending,

596
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,460
The F-S-L-I-C chaos with foreign aid,

597
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,220
The F-S-L-I-C chaos with inflating the currency,

598
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,660
The F-S-L-I-C chaos,

599
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,660
I mean, why go F-S-L-I-C-K yourself

600
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,500
When you can pay through the nose,

601
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,440
And let the government F-S-L-I-C-K you

602
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,720
And the expletive deleted?

603
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,120
Why?

604
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,960
Because we are the government,

605
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,800
We are fizz-licking ourselves,

606
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,600
So let's go for it,

607
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,240
Let's F-S-L-I-C-K ourselves,

608
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,160
I mean, come on,

609
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,780
It's a free country,

610
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,200
So just go F-S-L-I-C-K yourself,

611
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,540
Just go F-S-L-I-C-K yourself,

612
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,080
F-S-L-I-C-K yourself.

613
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,000
Here you go.

614
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,460
Let's go Milet,

615
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,040
Down with the taoist heads.

616
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,360
My team will go.

617
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,140
No, we haven't done anything yet.

618
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,240
Bu Lan,

619
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:35,420
Oh, yes, dear friends, the new improved Juke Savages, and well, so much for, oh, by the

620
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,980
way, that album, once again, is called Radical Militant Vegetarians in Nazi Land, and I doubt

621
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,080
if it's really on CD or anything, it's just on cassette, from Holy Funk Records and Tapes,

622
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:54,360
and you are listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry, Hour of Slack, some output from,

623
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,820
or at least presented by, the Church of the Subgenius for you, and now we're going, well,

624
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,460
Sister Mary Squared and I will be taking...

625
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,800
Put some Cowboy Dave to hell.

626
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,720
Yes.

627
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,280
Thank you.

628
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,740
It will hurt.

629
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,940
Why are you stopping?

630
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,060
I don't see any dinosaurs around.

631
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,720
There's something wrong.

632
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,720
I can't seem to move.

633
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,020
I feel like, like I'm being sucked under.

634
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm sinking.

635
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,060
Call Brachiosaurus.

636
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,760
Call the Braticus.

637
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,680
Call somebody before we're buried alive.

638
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,220
He suddenly found himself, sees her behind.

639
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,980
By a man in a dirty sheepskin coat.

640
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,800
For a split second, he feared he had been tricked.

641
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,820
Flashed through my mind that I had been betrayed, he wrote, and that I had been brought here

642
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,260
unarmed, not for negotiation, but for execution.

643
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,580
He took himself free and prepared to fight for his life, but hastily, it was explained

644
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,720
to him that this was the ancient Stang custom, that all envoys were dragged before Stang as

645
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,260
a sign of voluntary submission.

646
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,500
Call this voluntary?

647
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,820
He ran across the courtyard toward the yurt, halting at the entrance and saluting the Stang

648
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,580
in a local fashion.

649
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,820
He then remained standing, waiting to be addressed.

650
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,120
The Stang, reported Lady, had a very striking appearance.

651
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,400
He must be six or eight inches high.

652
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,900
His beard was short and red, his voice pleasant, and he speaks distinctly, fluently, and with

653
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,220
dignity.

654
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,080
After stroking his glasses for several minutes and studying the Russian carefully, the Stang

655
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,440
at last spoke.

656
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,960
How, he inquired, wherefore art thou come, and what dost thou wish of me?

657
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,380
Well, I, uh, that is to say, it's all rushing over me.

658
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:04,800
So far, I'm not sure.

659
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:04,800


660
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,760
I cannot tell you how fast that I, I can form no orderly record of my sense impressions,

661
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,240
but it seems that the very first thing I remember was being pushed in my baby buggy by my Aunt

662
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,600
Minnie.

663
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:22,820
I was looking up at the stars when suddenly I saw, nearing down, the hideous, hairy face

664
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,040
of an enormous spider!

665
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,560
Can we leave now?

666
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,360
I mean, jeez, this is, this is, you guys call these, that was, that's a script, right?

667
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,780
You call that a script, right?

668
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:34,900
Yeah.

669
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,220
That's a script.

670
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:35,360
That's a script.

671
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,140
Okay, now I know what a script is.

672
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,400
Now I've seen a real script.

673
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,300
That's a little different, manly script I've seen before you guys.

674
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,120
Oh, this script, yeah, I've seen scripts before.

675
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,640
How come we don't hear the music?

676
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,620
Aren't they playing some kind of music or something?

677
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,360
They're playing music.

678
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,300
We just can't hear it.

679
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,300
It's dog music.

680
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,620
You mean, wait a minute, oh, we're on the air?

681
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,420
No, we're not on the air.

682
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,060
Oh, okay.

683
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,640
Gee.

684
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,720
We didn't put this on the air.

685
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,600
Uh, cause I was afraid, if we did a thing where we acted like we thought we were on

686
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,780
the air, that's like the oldest, but we really knew we were on the air.

687
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:04,780


688
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,160
Yeah, I know.

689
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,200
We were acting like we didn't know.

690
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,320
Yeah.

691
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,580
It is so old.

692
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,020
I'm done now.

693
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,280
They'd see right through it.

694
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:09,860
What?

695
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,300
What?

696
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,640
You know, yeah, we would never do nothing like that.

697
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,420
Get, get, get Monica out of here.

698
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,020
You've got the wrong woman.

699
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,540
Get her out of here.

700
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,780
Oh, Monica's all right, Dave.

701
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,160
Don't worry about little Monica.

702
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,600
What are you, what are you gonna do to her, man?

703
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,040
Oh, we, oh, we're, we're changing her.

704
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,960
Yeah, she needed to be changed, that's all.

705
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,760
Your, your child only, oh, she's a little bit older.

706
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:34,760


707
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:34,760


708
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:34,760


709
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,260
Your child only needed to be changed, Dave.

710
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,460
She's not my child.

711
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,500
She, she's not my real child.

712
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,440
I'm protecting her though, now, for this, this moment in time, because I was given a

713
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,500
rip from God.

714
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,160
Oh, that's okay.

715
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,520
And I was trying to keep her awake.

716
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,880
Just take some of this limousine.

717
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,820
You'll feel better.

718
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,580
We're your friends and your father's, Dave.

719
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,520
We'll take care of little Monica.

720
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,180
Well, look, she's already changing.

721
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,080
She's changing herself now.

722
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,400
You ever see that movie, The Fang?

723
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,660
I've never seen that movie.

724
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:04,660


725
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,740


726
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,740


727
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,740


728
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,740


729
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,740


730
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,740


731
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:04,840
I've never seen that movie.

732
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:04,840


733
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:04,840


734
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,520
She's a little, a child evolved so quickly.

735
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,960
The little, the little spider legs sticking out of her back now.

736
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,840
Don't worry, she acts like it hurts, but that's just part of the change, Dave.

737
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,160
Oh, she moves so much differently.

738
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,380
She can climb the walls with such ease now.

739
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,100
She's, she's a child of Bob now, Dave.

740
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,960
She'll never want to come back to her folks after this.

741
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,820
I'm kind of really depressed about that part.

742
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,940
Oh, well, you don't want her back, do you?

743
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
I mean, she's a child.

744
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,100
Well, it's not my fault.

745
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,720
I know.

746
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,500
The little, the little spider legs and her stuff, and then they got her, and you got

747
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,540
her growing a bob-dob.

748
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,080
She had to have lizards biting things on her nipples.

749
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,560
The little pipe.

750
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,520
And you know, that little pipe there looks, look, she can already talk now.

751
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,460
She can't bring back a grown child.

752
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,220
And notice, when she opens her mouth, the little pipe doesn't fall out.

753
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,600
It's implant, it has tap roots that go up deep into her brain, Dave.

754
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,540
I hope it's only tapioca smoking in a pipe, because I could get into one hell of a vile

755
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:04,720
mouth in two weeks.

756
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:04,720


757
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,900
malediction from these guys.

758
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,460
Some of them are bigwigs in another church

759
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,480
I won't care to mention.

760
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,220
You know what I mean?

761
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,620
Oh, those Scientologists?

762
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,900
No, left-handers, bud.

763
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm talking about people with distended forefingers.

764
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,540
They could put a hex on us right now.

765
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,380
I know they...

766
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,860
Oh, but you'd be surprised what they can do

767
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,800
with those distended forefingers.

768
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,660
They can reach places that you wouldn't even think

769
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,000
a doctor would even think to reach.

770
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,080
A child has to...

771
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:37,120
We go into the crevices of the mind

772
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,980
and we probe.

773
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,700
Oh, yes, oh, yes, Sister Mary.

774
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,920
Go probe deeper.

775
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh, I have always wanted to explore this part of you.

776
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,940
The pain isn't taking you away, is it?

777
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,880
Now do it today.

778
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,360
I guarantee.

779
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,420
David, fantastic, David.

780
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,820
I've always wanted to bend over a little bit further,

781
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,320
David.

782
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,220
Oh, David.

783
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,140
Oh, my God.

784
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,900
I like the probe.

785
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,420
This is getting way out of hand.

786
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,480
Oh, oh.

787
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,920
Let's crank the probe.

788
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,500
Oh, yes, open it up wide, wide open.

789
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,060
Oh, I see now.

790
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,900
I see.

791
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,020
Oh, gee.

792
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,940
You have to see it.

793
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,340
A bish.

794
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,760
A new bish.

795
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,060
It's a new bish.

796
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,300
And we got some new business here, friends.

797
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,540
Grasp your afterlife firmly.

798
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,660
Decide upon your destiny.

799
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,880
Find the nearest priest of the great...

800
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,300
...spider.

801
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,900
Convince him of your virtue.

802
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,180
And have the sacred bites set upon your head.

803
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,260
Become a sacred mark.

804
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,920
For only in this way can you enter into the web and avoid the maw of the spider at the

805
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,900
center of the world.

806
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,120
Cool.

807
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,820
Selection and mutation.

808
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,180
That was my big idea.

809
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,800
To make the robots evolve.

810
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,420
They were designed to build copies of themselves.

811
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,020
But they had to fight over the parts.

812
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,960
Natural selection.

813
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,020
And I found a way of jiggering their programs with cosmic rays.

814
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,820
Mutation.

815
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,500
And look at this robot night, though.

816
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,600
Can you believe they did it all themselves?

817
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,360
Get away from me, you filthy robot peasants.

818
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:28,500
All around, whenever, the first time you come to the robotville, you know, all these horrible robots, uh, these sleazy robots press around you asking you if you want special services.

819
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,940
You know what I mean?

820
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,300
What?

821
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,120
Customer services.

822
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,600
Hey, you buy uranium?

823
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,400
Got mercury?

824
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,220
Old-fashioned TV set.

825
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,720
Okay, that's a pleasure, pal.

826
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,060
Make it with android girls.

827
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,140
Sell your fingers.

828
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,560
Moon King relics.

829
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,820
Prosthetic talking pens.

830
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,540
Airship.

831
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,200
Chip market.

832
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,920
Micro-legions.

833
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,880
Home-cooked food.

834
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,740
Set-up factory.

835
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,320
Chrome-crows.

836
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:46,940
Flag vault.

837
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,660
DNA step-code.

838
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,160
Nanotunes.

839
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,020
Tumbleweeds.

840
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,280
Hey, me be you.

841
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:51,440
Supply taxation.

842
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,440
Me be you.

843
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:52,840
Leftlessness.

844
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,980
Pay my songs.

845
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,040
You sell camera.

846
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,440
No risk brain tape.

847
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:56,880
Air fun.

848
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,900
Brand new voice prints.

849
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,260
See vacuum bells?

850
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,980
Stray mother.

851
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,480
Elroy.

852
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,340
Dust bath enema.

853
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,900
Here we go.

854
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,200
DNA.

855
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,160
Death code.

856
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,160
Anytime.

857
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:13,480
Well, just settle back on your divan and prepare for a new range of experience.

858
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,140
You don't act like me.

859
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,560
But I wish I knew what it was, frankly.

860
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,640
Well, no, there is no business to go through.

861
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,160
This is just a lot of old rehashing of the same old business to go through.

862
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,280
Nothing changes.

863
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,920
Nothing changes.

864
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,260
Nothing changes.

865
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,240
It doesn't.

866
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:57,360
This man is a crybaby almost, Tocqueville.

867
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,960
Who he wasn't supposed to die to just clear a wanted list of 7.

868
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,000
My god, he is my God.

869
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,220
Can't do this.

870
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,220


871
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,220


872
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,220


873
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,240
the

874
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,240


875
00:42:59,240 --> 00:42:59,240


876
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,800
his hand and it'll be all right. Abandon hope all ye who enter here. I don't know if I'm really

877
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,260
hip to a lot of the points of your religion, man. First of all, you take a small baby in here

878
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,460
and you make it metazycled into this huge baby, like about 30 years old or something like that.

879
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:22,540
And then you have a sex bondage orgy with it. You talk like weird in paradigms and backwards

880
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:28,580
names and stuff like that. And then you try and conduct me across river Styx and stuff with

881
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,300
K-Ron or whatever the hell it is. And I still don't understand the bottom of the digit point,

882
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,300
the central roof collapse of your religious values. It's all part of the ride. This is

883
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,860
just still part of the ride in hell land. You're in an amusement park. An amusement park. Yeah,

884
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,960
I know. This is hell land. We shouldn't have given him two. Oh, we should have. We should

885
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,720
have just given him one. I know. We should have only just, if we had only given them,

886
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,420
we would have had some more left over. When did the ephemeris come here?

887
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:06,060
Conspiracy land. Oh, I tell you, I love conspiracy land. I like to go to, I like the hate, the hate train.

888
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,520
Oh, yeah. Right when you're going out, you get to like throw tomatoes at all your favorite conspiracy dudes.

889
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:20,900
Yeah, after like five hours. I've always wanted a maroon Madonna on an island with wet noodles and flaming tomato cans.

890
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,440
I'm starting to like this a little better. Oh, yeah. I'm waiting till the nightlife kicks in.

891
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,600
Oh, yeah.

892
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,020
The water, don't drink that fake water that they have running through hell land.

893
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,180
Okay.

894
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,000
Through Cerebus' kingdom.

895
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,640
Okay.

896
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,180
You don't want to drink that water, Dave.

897
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,140
Anything but the water.

898
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,040
Look what he's going for.

899
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,620
He's drinking.

900
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,820
Look at his telepathy.

901
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,500
He's brain rotting.

902
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,740
I look like an oomphalo in the rear view mirror.

903
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,280
We could mold them.

904
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,400
We could shape them.

905
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,600
Just like little Monica.

906
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,900
We will build an empire.

907
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,360
See?

908
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:58,720
Kyle.

909
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,580
See, Kyle.

910
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,960
Drop all.

911
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,840
Drop all.

912
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,800
Praise Bob.

913
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,360
Praise Bob.

914
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,080
Praise Bob.

915
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh, what was I thinking, Reverend Stang?

916
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,600
I'm sorry.

917
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:06,980
Oh.

918
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,860
I just wish I could get the hell out of backseat.

919
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,320
Why?

920
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,600
Because I don't know if I think this is very nice.

921
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,760
You guys would do this.

922
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,680
I think hell land's freaking him out.

923
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,400
What about sex hurt land?

924
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,000
Freaking me out.

925
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,320
Oh, sex hurt land.

926
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,220
Sex hurt land.

927
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,440
He'd love sex hurt land.

928
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,320
He would love sex hurt land.

929
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,080
You mean that weird 60-year-old colonel or whatever he is?

930
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,580
He would.

931
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,160
He would.

932
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:30,400
He would love it.

933
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,460
I heard that one rant.

934
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,000
That weird 60-year-old colonel talking about sex hurt pain and all that stuff.

935
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,940
I think you're sick.

936
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,420
I don't think he's getting enough of the parasympathetic vibrational raise.

937
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,840
He'd be much more comfortable if we would just crank him.

938
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,560
Crank him up to about 10 over there.

939
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,540
Why?

940
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,080
What are you doing?

941
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:48,740
Get your...

942
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,120
Don't put that around my leg.

943
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,940
You calm down.

944
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,360
All right.

945
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:51,800
Come...

946
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,220
Tricky.

947
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:53,740
Look, we...

948
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,560
He must have spent $25 to come to the... to the... to the Abusement Park to theme his

949
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,560


950
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,560


951
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,560


952
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,560


953
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,560


954
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,560


955
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,560
own world and he's still...

956
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,480
All for nothing.

957
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:00,920
He's still...

958
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,640
Yeah, yeah, he's not...

959
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,080
All for nothing.

960
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,600
I sweated up a nice new shirt.

961
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,580
That's one thing for sure.

962
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,400
Dry clean bills.

963
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,460
And I vomited all over my pants.

964
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,420
This is a little too heavy for me, you guys.

965
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,380
You said we're gonna go... go take a few rides and go eat some popcorn.

966
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,580
Maybe you'd rather go to Dollywood.

967
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,660
I've been to Dollywood.

968
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,960
There's nothing like this, man.

969
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,160
Dollywood, I went out looking for hookers afterwards and I fell down.

970
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:21,780
It was...

971
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,700
That wasn't bad.

972
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,560
This is different.

973
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,580
This is something else.

974
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,320
I don't know if I could take this.

975
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,260
I could feel different parts of my brain growing.

976
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:28,560
I don't know if I could take this.

977
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,040
I don't know if I could take this.

978
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,340
I'm overlooking him like he's getting splashed.

979
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,160
I don't think he should tell the difference between hell land and sex hurt, you know?

980
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,780
I don't think so.

981
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,440
I think something must have sucked through his brain, that device in his head.

982
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,920
It isn't working.

983
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:43,980
We must do something.

984
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,300
You know, he's...

985
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,640
Maybe he went to like a parking lot land.

986
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,520
Oh, yes, parking lot land.

987
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,200
That's a normal land.

988
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,260
A reality land.

989
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,740
Reality land.

990
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,440
The one with the cigarette butts on the ground and theえー...

991
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,920
Right.

992
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,780
On the college campus, right?

993
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:55,880
Right.

994
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

995
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:56,900
Oh, I like that.

996
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,260
It has a sidewalk...

997
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:58,540
And you're like...

998
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:58,540


999
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,700
Yes, it has some grass and trees and stuff.

1000
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,400
Reality land.

1001
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,300
You'd like that, Dave.

1002
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,140
I'd like it a lot.

1003
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,260
Should we go to reality land or parking lot land?

1004
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:06,660
Yeah, let's go there.

1005
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,760
For crying out loud, man.

1006
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:13,600
Let's have a hot foot Sunday and think about Retz, the capital city of Venus.

1007
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,980
I've never been there, but I heard it's beautiful.

1008
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,120
Confusion land.

1009
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:17,960
That's it.

1010
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,640
That'd fit in perfectly.

1011
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:20,720
Confusion land.

1012
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:20,980
It would.

1013
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,020
I'd just sit around and look at a cigarette butt.

1014
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,960
I think it'd be like...

1015
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,280
Cigarette butt land.

1016
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,440
Oh, that's reality land.

1017
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,160
Butt land.

1018
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,660
Butt land.

1019
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,380
Butt land.

1020
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:28,940
That's it.

1021
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,880
The land of butts.

1022
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,560
I've been there half my life.

1023
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,780
He's got a point there.

1024
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,780
You know, in a way, what's he going to learn?

1025
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:37,280
Butt.

1026
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,320
Butt.

1027
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,300
And it's a big butt you got.

1028
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,180
Man, that's an old radio joke.

1029
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:43,560
I know.

1030
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,840
This isn't radio show land, Dave.

1031
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,620
That's right.

1032
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,780
It's not radio show land.

1033
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,700
So I can just...

1034
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,960
I can take off my glasses and my shirt and my pants and my suit and tie and I can dance

1035
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,860
around the room, right?

1036
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,500
Yes.

1037
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,400
Yes, Dave.

1038
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:57,640
Yes.

1039
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,760
Swing and langhams.

1040
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,060
Woo!

1041
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,060
I should leave my valuables at the door.

1042
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,560
Shake it, baby.

1043
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,140
Shake it.

1044
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,000
But I'm not going to.

1045
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,280
Just, Dave, just take a stress pill and calm down, Dave.

1046
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,020
I don't know what a stress pill is as it exists.

1047
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,440
It's all right, Dave.

1048
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,580
You don't need to struggle or fight.

1049
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,600
No.

1050
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,920
Just take a stress pill.

1051
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:20,720
Don't resist.

1052
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,160
My face is melting.

1053
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,940
Why don't you come over here and let me rub your shoulders, huh?

1054
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,420
My shoulders are melting.

1055
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,440
My shoulders are melting.

1056
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,140
It's a nice neck rub.

1057
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:34,520
Lay down on this nice, comfortable, long, cryogenic freezing tube.

1058
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,260
The back of your ears.

1059
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,420
The top of your head.

1060
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,480
Just shake that chakra till it's all clean.

1061
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,280
Just let it go.

1062
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,160
Let it flow.

1063
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,600
Let it go.

1064
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:43,800
Think of Bob.

1065
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,020
Focus on Bob.

1066
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,760
Don't think of your own name.

1067
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,700
Just think of the name of Bob.

1068
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:50,900
Bob.

1069
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,660
The smell.

1070
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,280
The pipe.

1071
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,320
Bob.

1072
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,480
What is that mix?

1073
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,560
The cloying fumes filling the little box in which you lay.

1074
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:04,880
It's a clean cure-all.

1075
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,460
It's like a little tater box with children's stories on it.

1076
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,540
Just happy up, Dave.

1077
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,940
I'm feeling better.

1078
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,280
I can see the smiling visage in the middle of my cerebral cortex somewhere.

1079
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,140
It's flashing. It's panning right and left now.

1080
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,340
I didn't know it was going to be like this.

1081
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,440
It's kind of fun, isn't it, Dave?

1082
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,100
Not really, but it's better than that other thing before.

1083
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,520
You can sort of perversely twist yourself around to kind of somehow having a good time, couldn't you?

1084
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:43,260
And therefore you might be able to actually simulate a smile and attract a lot more radio listeners that way.

1085
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,860
Being happy is fun.

1086
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,360
If you smile, we'll let you see Monica again, Dave.

1087
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,500
Oh, and you'd love Monica.

1088
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,100
She's changed.

1089
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,120
She's changed.

1090
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,440
She has.

1091
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,800
That garter we got her looks beautiful.

1092
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,540
Big improvement over the dirty diaper.

1093
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,440
It is. It is a big improvement over that.

1094
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:05,660
So just lay peacefully, Dave, and let the change come over you.

1095
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,840
You feel the little nub growing at your lip, your lower right lip.

1096
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,440
Yeah, I thought that naughty growth was some sort of tumor again.

1097
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,420
Oh, no. Look, it's extending.

1098
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,820
Look, it's growing out.

1099
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,080
Oh, that's rather attractive.

1100
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,280
I think I could use that.

1101
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:20,880
Oh.

1102
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,200
Oh.

1103
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,500
We call that the stem.

1104
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,480
Yes, you can use it.

1105
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,360
It's the root of wisdom?

1106
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,300
In fact, you have to use it.

1107
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,260
Yes, that's what we could call it.

1108
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,720
It's a pipeline to wisdom.

1109
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,300
A rod.

1110
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,740
A label incisor.

1111
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,260
A shaft.

1112
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,440
Yes, the bowl is the...

1113
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,520
A hard cylindrical round thing.

1114
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,160
Packed with frappy, Dave.

1115
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,040
It's packed with the finest frappy in town.

1116
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,560
It does taste like a delightful frappy.

1117
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,420
Suck it and it'll shake.

1118
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,400
It's like dangling against my lower chin now.

1119
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,420
I feel kind of like a...

1120
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:51,880
Like a...

1121
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,960
A bandy rooster.

1122
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:55,020
All excited and sexual and stuff.

1123
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,520
Am I cocky enough?

1124
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Oh, don't be too cocky.

1125
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,560
He's doing much, much better now.

1126
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,160
He'll be ready to send out into the streets soon.

1127
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,280
As long as they don't start pecking corn.

1128
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,180
I think he is.

1129
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,860
Soon we will have him working for us.

1130
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,380
Wait, wait, wait.

1131
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:12,740
Diligently.

1132
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,680
I want to go over to that slushy stand over there or whatever it is.

1133
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,820
Get some kind of soft drink over there.

1134
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:19,440
Oh, no.

1135
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,380
You can't drink it.

1136
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,660
So you don't drink it yet, or go to the bathroom-

1137
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,660
My mouth is parched!

1138
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,420
You must learn the mantra that will keep you alert.

1139
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,780
Now, just repeat after me.

1140
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,500
Stay awake.

1141
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,540
Stay awake.

1142
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,320
Bring in the money.

1143
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,280
Bring in the money.

1144
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,800
Cast out NEGG.

1145
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,700
Cast out NEGG.

1146
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,500
That's right.

1147
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,100
Just stay awake, bring in the money, cast out NEGG.

1148
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,820
Stay awake, bring in the money, and cast out NEGG.

1149
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,500
Stay awake, bring in the money, Jim.

1150
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:45,840
Just stay awake.

1151
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,060
Bring in the money, cast out NEGG.

1152
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,840
Stay awake, bring in the money, and cast out NEGG.

1153
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:49,840


1154
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:49,940
Eeggy.

1155
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:50,680
It's free.

1156
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,560
Crush the money.

1157
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,200
Crush, crush.

1158
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,180
Crush the money, Toys.

1159
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:53,560
Eager.

1160
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,480
Else, what if you call on the rest of the people

1161
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,320
that have visited Keyland?

1162
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,520
Crush the eagerness.

1163
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,640
Crush the eagerness.

1164
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:58,860
Hello?

1165
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,660
We need this on camera.

1166
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,860
Crush the eagerness.

1167
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,740
Crush the eagerness.

1168
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,540
Crush the eagerness.

1169
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,280
It's flowing.

1170
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:05,920
It's swelling.

1171
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:06,400
It's swelling.

1172
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,340
He's not going to be able to panhandle it

1173
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,340
if it blows.

1174
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,720
Hello?

1175
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:10,980
We might...

1176
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,140
Hello?

1177
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:11,980
We could use him.

1178
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,960
We could.

1179
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,000
He has a sort of innocent...

1180
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,660
What's that word?

1181
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,060
An innocent wife-like patheticness

1182
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,360
that causes...

1183
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,180
You would do very well at the Dobstown airport.

1184
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,320
Yes, exactly.

1185
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,900
My skull's running.

1186
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,920
He's running peanuts to the orphans in Dobstown.

1187
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,940
What's this green ooze running down my front now?

1188
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,180
This is getting weird again.

1189
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,240
This is getting weird again.

1190
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,320
That's pity juice.

1191
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,100
That's to make the normals give you money.

1192
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:36,480
Oh.

1193
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,300
It has a purpose in it.

1194
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,180
It will give me money.

1195
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:39,760
Yes, yes.

1196
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,020
And soon others will come to drink of it.

1197
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,360
Can I smear my whole body in pity juice?

1198
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,740
To suckle up the green juice

1199
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,320
of your...

1200
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:48,540
Of your chest.

1201
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,120
Oh.

1202
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,200
I would enjoy that.

1203
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,620
This is better than all the themed stuff combined.

1204
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,120
Having a bunch of, like, mutant people

1205
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,920
and stuff like with the hair falling off their body

1206
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,040
licking my chest with green stuff coming out of it.

1207
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,820
Well, he does like sex-hurt land after all,

1208
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,080
I can say.

1209
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:04,480
Oh, he'll be good.

1210
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,260
He's doing great.

1211
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,100
He'll be good for dozens and dozens of vials

1212
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,480
of the pudding, the antidote pudding.

1213
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,520
Hey, uh...

1214
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,960
We must let people know how he gets it.

1215
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,180
Oh, no.

1216
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:15,980
That's a deep-seated...

1217
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,860
The mic is still off.

1218
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,520
I don't care.

1219
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:18,920
Okay.

1220
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,820
All right.

1221
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,840
That's...

1222
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,280
That's...

1223
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:21,860
That's good.

1224
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,640
That's good.

1225
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,480
But no more drinks?

1226
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,200
Go ahead.

1227
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,020
Release the bats.

1228
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,240
Release the bats.

1229
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,640
We've got enough pudding now,

1230
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,920
or at least for most of us.

1231
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,080
A few may have to swallow

1232
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,760
without being, well, you know,

1233
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,800
I mean, once those barbs are...

1234
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,140
And...

1235
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,240
And dead-bedded like they're embedded in my...

1236
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,580
The chin of my chest?

1237
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,640
Yes, but you have given of so much antidote pudding

1238
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,340
that others will not have to suffer like you have, Dave.

1239
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,660
You have given.

1240
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,380
You have sacrificed.

1241
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,040
You will be remembered by Bob

1242
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,360
in a more fond way than those who lived.

1243
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,340
I've been absconded in a tiny little tuna fish can

1244
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,800
and then tacked onto the roof of some, like, weird beer belly joint.

1245
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,920
But you get to play the game.

1246
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,420
Over and over.

1247
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,000
You'll be hooked up to the virtual reality game,

1248
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,260
the tick game.

1249
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,260
I don't like the hookings of that game.

1250
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,560
It goes over and over.

1251
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,940
Yes, yes, they're nice, but just keep shooting away.

1252
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,320
You'll get used to it.

1253
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,320


1254
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:17,320


1255
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,700
As your score improves, you'll get more lives, you see.

1256
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,520
And then you can stay in the game longer and longer

1257
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,980
and kill more and more ticks.

1258
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,340
Oh, look, there's another one.

1259
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,180
Can we find that cactus?

1260
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:28,880
Shoot it.

1261
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,480
Scorpions, too, on your feet.

1262
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,860
No, you don't need to squeeze the control knob so hard.

1263
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,080
You'll get calluses that way.

1264
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,180
You're going to be here for a long, long, long time, Dave.

1265
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:40,760
Christ!

1266
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,780
And you don't want those calluses from the play buttons to get too big.

1267
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,600
Pfft.

1268
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,960
They'll interfere with your aim.

1269
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,100
You won't be able to hit the ticks as they come around the cacti.

1270
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,260
Oh, jeez.

1271
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,940
You'll lose the game and have to play even longer, Dave.

1272
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,100
Wait a minute.

1273
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,980
This joystick is becoming like a huge noise.

1274
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:05,020
Nose nozzle.

1275
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,680
We really had it going.

1276
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:06,960
We did.

1277
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,040
He thought he was in the room.

1278
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:08,360


1279
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,180
It's so easy to fool him.

1280
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,720
It is.

1281
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,340
None are so blind as those who have no eyes.

1282
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,760
When they're only confused, they forget they're in hell.

1283
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:17,320
Oh.

1284
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:24,140
That's the respite we give them only to remind them once again of what has truly happened to them.

1285
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:28,040
And just where that $20 to Bob went.

1286
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,580
Where did he go?

1287
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,900
Don't worry.

1288
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,200
You'll get triple your money back, Dave.

1289
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,280
Triple your money back.

1290
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,260
You promised me triple my money back.

1291
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,100
You promised me triple my salvation.

1292
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,480
And plus we brought the free book, Hell on $60 a Day by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1293
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,360
It's only $30.

1294
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,480
Oh, I could use something like that.

1295
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,320
It's got like the $50.

1296
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,440
$50 motels and stuff.

1297
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,500
Yes, yes.

1298
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,000
It should last a couple of days.

1299
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,980
Like the Greek diners and everything?

1300
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:51,640
Mm-hmm.

1301
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,020
Okay, I suppose I could use something like that.

1302
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,580
But I don't know.

1303
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,320
So far, this doesn't seem like I want to get involved too much.

1304
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:57,740
Well.

1305
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,720
It's first place.

1306
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,100
Oh, now he changes his mind.

1307
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,340
Well, I know, but it's like so complicated.

1308
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:02,940
They always change their minds.

1309
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:09,820
At first place, I don't understand how if I'm in hell and if I'm not in hell at the same time,

1310
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:14,560
and this is somehow reality, and one of these states is supposed to preclude before reality or after reality,

1311
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,720
I think you're just trying to go further and confuse me.

1312
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,600
And...

1313
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:17,780
Oh.

1314
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:18,700
Us?

1315
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,160
No.

1316
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:19,980
Confusing?

1317
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,080
No.

1318
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,160
You're all just here, Dave.

1319
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:23,700
Oh, contrary, Dave.

1320
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,060
Dave, we're friends.

1321
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,260
Oh, just keep the closer fluttering by, and I can hardly...

1322
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,760
Oh, we're trying to lay it on the line.

1323
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,480
We read you all the fine print when you signed.

1324
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,040
Didn't you hear us?

1325
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,980
I heard you, but I didn't understand exactly what you were saying.

1326
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,800
We were whispering in the corners of your ear.

1327
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,480
We asked you if you understood, and you said yes.

1328
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:38,680
Yes.

1329
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:38,920
Yes.

1330
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,800
Turn off the machine.

1331
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,380
I understand.

1332
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,840
I'm amiable.

1333
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,760
I like to go along with stuff.

1334
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,040
That's why you're here.

1335
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,200
That's exactly why you're here.

1336
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,620
That's why you're such an honored guest.

1337
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,800
You've been so good.

1338
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,820
You've done so much good for mankind.

1339
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,100
You've been a good little boy.

1340
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,360
I feel like a prisoner.

1341
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,760
I feel like one of those big, huge balloons could come down any minute, like a road to

1342
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,200
Escapade.

1343
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,880
Oh, now, David, don't go on this rampage, or I'll have to pull out the discipline stick.

1344
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,400
Oh, right.

1345
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:07,460
He doesn't even remember it from the last time.

1346
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,020
Oh, that's why we got so confused and signed the thing to begin with.

1347
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,360
Well, he had already signed it before that time.

1348
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:15,500
Before that time.

1349
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:15,780
Oh, that's right.

1350
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,540
See, but we just go...

1351
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,120
They go through...

1352
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:17,980
They go through fake signings.

1353
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,400
Oh, it's just so much fun repeating the process over and over and over again.

1354
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,520
And then when you make them remember all the hells they forgot all at once.

1355
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:28,980
Oh, my gosh.

1356
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,180
Oh, my gosh.

1357
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,600
Hey.

1358
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,240
Yes.

1359
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:32,760
Okay.

1360
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,380
Praise Natas and above all the...

1361
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,800
But the thing is, if you're just sitting there listening to the radio...

1362
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,160
Wait, I'm not listening to the radio.

1363
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,040
No, no, no, not you.

1364
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,920
I mean one.

1365
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,900
If one sits out there...

1366
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,540
There are like millions and millions of listeners across this world that are listening to this

1367
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,260
station now.

1368
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:52,920
Yeah.

1369
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,700
If they just sit and listen to the radio, in a sense, is the radio their soul at that

1370
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,100
moment?

1371
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,860
Or is their soul listening to the radio?

1372
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,320
Or is their soul a quiet place behind that which listens to the radio?

1373
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,340
Oh.

1374
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,660
A question that will have to be answered next time, dear friends.

1375
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,880
When we continue with...

1376
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:22,920
When we continue with the story of Lonesome Cowboy Dave in Hell, recorded last week at

1377
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,940
WCSB in Cleveland on the Brain Rock Radio Theater Show.

1378
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,960
Actually, there were many hours of tape recorded then.

1379
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:40,660
And we'll have to continue that story on next week's Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1380
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,800
Ah, yes.

1381
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,960
And that post office box, number to write to will be coming right up.

1382
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:46,760
Now, if you're...

1383
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,320
Waiting for a radio to tell you something about a soul, then do you have a soul?

1384
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,480
Or is it...

1385
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,800
Are you just blind to it?

1386
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,860
Well, I...

1387
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,960
Well, they had a sale in Kmart today and they sold...

1388
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,860
I bought my soul for 99 cents.

1389
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,360
Really?

1390
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,740
They sold a soul?

1391
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,380
So, uh...

1392
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,940
So you can sell souls?

1393
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:07,740
Yeah.

1394
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:09,680
Well...

1395
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,500
Now...

1396
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,420
They have good deals over at the flea market.

1397
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,580
Well, of course, that's the thing about Kmart.

1398
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,340
They sell...

1399
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,780
Darn near everything.

1400
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:18,700
Almost...

1401
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,140
I almost said it's the D word.

1402
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:23,460
They sell darn near everything at Kmart.

1403
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,220
That's a fact.

1404
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:24,820
Yeah.

1405
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,780
Kmart is...

1406
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,780
I'm going to instruct you on a little live-on riff.

1407
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,400
Oh, wait.

1408
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,280
We're going to get instruction.

1409
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,640
You can variate if you want to.

1410
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,420
What is it?

1411
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,720
Starting with the exact center, or number one needle.

1412
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,620
Is this our soul?

1413
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,680
Push this needle forward as far as it will go into position E.

1414
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,600
I think that everything is dead and alive.

1415
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,480
But he says the soul is at position E.

1416
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,660
Push the needle.

1417
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,820
Get to position E.

1418
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,360
World tenement 64A.

1419
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,240
You're required to sit in a reclining locker for four and a half minutes

1420
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,860
by two strange people.

1421
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,100
Two small people.

1422
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,700
Continue to read laboriously in your direction.

1423
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,200
Trying to make you sweat.

1424
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,160
If you don't sign this before four o'clock tomorrow, then all the rest of this is null.

1425
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,660
I didn't sign this last part.

1426
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:13,900
This is null and void.

1427
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,280
This whole contract is null and void.

1428
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:16,700
That's the swing.

1429
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,720
Swing, set, assembly, instruction, manual.

1430
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,020
That's not your contract.

1431
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:20,720
Oh.

1432
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,300
You've got your contract on disk.

1433
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,360
You didn't sign it with ink, Dave.

1434
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,500
No?

1435
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,020
No.

1436
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,520
Nor even with blood.

1437
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,020
No?

1438
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,820
You signed it with your feelings.

1439
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,800
You signed it with your acceptance.

1440
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:34,940
With your mind.

1441
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,560
And with your eagerness to do only good and to serve mankind.

1442
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:39,420
With your soul.

1443
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,020
To add something to...

1444
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,920
What a sucker.

1445
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,960
You idiot.

1446
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,800
You deserve to be in hell for being such a wimp.

1447
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,680
For being such a...

1448
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,140
Don't fight!

1449
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:47,560
Such a dupe.

1450
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,440
Such a...

1451
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,180
For believing those...

1452
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,200
So easily condoled.

1453
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,700
Simpering.

1454
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,980
Who are ridiculous.

1455
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,560
Those churchy things.

1456
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,440
There's...

1457
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,420
And of course, he thought he would go into it through satire.

1458
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,560
So easy to mold.

1459
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,120
So that he wouldn't be too corny or anything.

1460
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:11,760
So that he could cause people mirth and joy without stooping to corny preaching or something like that.

1461
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,460
I won't.

1462
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,680
He just couldn't take hold.

1463
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,060
But that's real funny.

1464
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,520
I hope you boys are having a good time.

1465
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:27,860
I bet you thought this old church thing of yours was gonna be big, big fun.

1466
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,300
Big barrel of laughs.

1467
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,040
Oh yeah.

1468
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:37,580
I bet you thought you were gonna be some kind of high school lord.

1469
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,200
That Bob fellow of yours.

1470
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,520
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1471
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,120
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn...

1472
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,780
Damn long eternity.

1473
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,820
Oh by the way, here's that triple your money back.

1474
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,300
Uh, it's, uh, what, sixty dollars?

1475
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,500
Well, one for you, Smith.

1476
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,860
One for you, Jones.

1477
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:06,220
And, uh, don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

1478
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1479
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,960
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry.

1480
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,040
Hour of slack.

1481
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,840
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed,

1482
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,400
stamped envelope to...

1483
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,460
Got your pencil ready?

1484
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:32,440
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1485
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:40,240
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1486
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,400
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1487
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,020
Oh, man, smell that gunpowder.

1488
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,780
Uh, uh, uh, background music.

1489
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:11,660
The, uh, sick with the, uh, rant on, uh, right wing and liberal media.

1490
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,780
Instrumentals were by Zug's Rift.

1491
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:19,700
And by Doctors for Bob.

1492
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:25,360
We also heard from the KPFA Subgenius Show in Berkeley with...

1493
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:25,980
Oh, yeah.

1494
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,740
...puzzling evidence and...

1495
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,720
Oh, man, smell that gunpowder.

1496
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,760
...and Hal Robbins and liberal media.

1497
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:43,740
And also, towards the end, with the great Michael Pepe talking about radio souls.

1498
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:47,840
Shut up.

1499
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,800
Shut up.

1500
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,060
Shut up.

1501
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:54,340
Shut up.

1502
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,640
Shut up.

1503
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,600
Shut up.
