1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,000
that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,760
No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,960
as some were the microscopic studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,000
Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,280
And yet, across the gulf of space,

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,500
minds immeasurably superior to ours

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,320
regarded this earth with envious eyes.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,420
And slowly and surely,

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,380
they drew their plans against us.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,140
And now,

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,100
The S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-So Genius Hour of Slack!

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,920
Praise Bob!

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,300
This is it!

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,460
your last big chance to win back your soul.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,720
X Day is coming.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,440
Kiss all your calendars goodbye and prepare yourself

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,920
to greet the men from Planet X in power and glory

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
at the coolest campground in the United States.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,500
With sideshow marvels,

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,360
spontaneous doctor band combustion,

22
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,920
trained prairie squid,

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,760
frop enhancement workshops,

24
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,460
acu-beating, psychic surgery,

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,420
human fights, live freaks of nature,

26
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,720
and acid casualties,

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,180
fat sperm antidote pudding cook-offs,

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,780
private adult sex-hurt seminars,

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,080
self-mutilating preachers and oddly normal-seeming people,

30
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,680
sex goddesses,

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,080
elder,

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,340
and the like.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,640
Ex-day is coming.

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,500
Are you ready for the finals?

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,800
Which will it be?

36
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,480
Spaz Outlaw Holiday Forever or The Last Roundup?

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,220
Can you handle Judgment Day?

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,620
Will you simper while the world ends or will you get slack?

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,140
Brought to you by JR Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

40
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,100
See www.subgenius.com for more information.

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:30,540
Experience the anxiously awaited moment, the nail-biting suspense of July 5th, 7am.

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,380
Only $30!

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,040
None may stop us and none may escape once the gate closes.

44
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,700
Praise Bob!

45
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,140
Experience the

46
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,620
spouse thing

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,020


48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,700
open

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,460
service too!

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,200
Don't forget to pay a visit to Jimmy последue whatever's coming your way

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,680
Release that

52
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,660
Thanks, that's all.

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,520
Well, Rubik's Cube.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
Oh, yes, dear friends.

55
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,120
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1838.

56
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,300
What we just heard was the band Rubik's Cube

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,300
recorded performing live at 24X Day

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,420
or what we should now call the 26th X Day Drill.

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,140
Our numbering is kind of strange.

60
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,700
The first Hypercube X Day Drill.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,340
And hey, sorry, don't blame me or Bob

62
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,340
or even Hypercube that the world didn't end on a human schedule.

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,780
I guess those old Xists from outer space

64
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,280
are defying the law.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,520
They're determined to keep us guessing.

66
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,340
Gotta be ready any minute, friends.

67
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,740
But yeah, we not only survived the first drill

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,260
held at Land of Id in Land O'Lakes, Florida,

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,980
owned by the spectacularly talented

70
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,040
Reverend Exanthia Octoshroom,

71
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,200
who's also a fellow junior scientist like me and Dr. Howell.

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,780
We not only survived,

73
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,380
but we plan to do it all again next year

74
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,800
at Land of Id

75
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,280
because we're going to be doing it again next year.

76
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,920
That site is perfect,

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,460
perfect for our size and kind of attendance.

78
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,080
Everyone who was there and at previous drills

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,460
agrees that it was the best X Day ever.

80
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,460
But then we always do.

81
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,900
Tropical storm Elsa hit Tampa in force

82
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,680
just after my plane back to Texas got out of there.

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,980
But it created some challenges,

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,140
details of which you'll hear soon enough.

85
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,040
But first,

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,020
the rat hole clench has their own drill

87
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,120
or had their own drill

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,220
and created their own media barrage

89
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,660
about the end of all reality,

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,580
according to Bob.

91
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,380
12 minutes worth.

92
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,240
And here it is from rat hole clench.

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,100
Not to be confused with the rat cave of old.

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,740
Pray Bob.

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,480
He manipulates the necessary controls

96
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,580
to broadcast the message on the tape over the air.

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,900
And not that captive radio has

98
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,100
an eye to do his work just fine.

99
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,620
I've read many reports

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,880
and they say that we can't Turn sugar выс

101
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,080
I don't even know why I want that.

102
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,640
Brad to be noise sleepers.

103
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Risk- vår

104
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:15,800
atur

105
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,440
some terminology about the end or end times.

106
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm going to be repetitive because I want it to sink in.

107
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,500
You'll learn about end-time terminology,

108
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,980
end-time numerology, end-time catastrophes,

109
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,520
end-time organizations, and end-time leaders.

110
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,880
It's the marker we've been waiting for,

111
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,500
the spacecraft from the level above human,

112
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,880
to take us home to the literal heavens.

113
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,960
For people that have a particularly strong case of alienation,

114
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,820
this can become a very powerful segment of your life.

115
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,480
There is a vision of another kind of world

116
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
in which we could live a lot better,

117
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,680
and maybe the UFO can take us there.

118
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,860
And this is what happened, or could happen,

119
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
on a certain day called X.

120
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,620
Some people would look at it as the best moment of their life.

121
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,140
Or will it be, as many believe, the final judgment?

122
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,680
A lot of people have done extensive research into this

123
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,260
and have discovered that flying saucers have a tendency

124
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,800
to make a lot of appearances.

125
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,280
And they've found that they can make a lot of appearances

126
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,360
around about a important event happening on Earth.

127
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,980
It's an amazing coincidence.

128
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,220
There are no coincidences.

129
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,920
This is way out of the realm of fiction or supposition

130
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,980
or conspiracy theory or speculation.

131
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,840
This is absolute documented fact.

132
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,420
On July 5th, 2019, at 7 a.m.,

133
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,040
the Xists shall make a mass landing on this planet.

134
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,280
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this foretold rupture,

135
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,800
this day of the universe.

136
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,160
And the day of judgment,

137
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,740
when all those who paved their church dunes

138
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,960
will be lifted up in power and glory

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,780
to gain new homes and bodies aboard the pleasure saucers

140
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,840
of the sex goddesses,

141
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,860
all the while watching the hapless pigs twitch and bleat and wail

142
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,800
in the death throes of their world.

143
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,380
Not because some general or madman will push a button

144
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,500
and reduce our planet to ash,

145
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,940
but because, as the fundamentalists see it,

146
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,120
God has had it planned that way for at least 1900 years.

147
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,520
If there really were a day called X,

148
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,220
we would have been in a state of ecstasy.

149
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,640
People have always had a fascination with the heavens.

150
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,700
UFO groups celebrate this connection to the stars.

151
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,540
Mainstream religion rarely, if ever,

152
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,740
recognizes biblical passages as describing extraterrestrial sightings.

153
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,800
New agers look at the year 2000 as a time of rescue via,

154
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,740
listen to this, friendly spaceships.

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,480
Now, I'm not saying that God did not do this,

156
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,880
but God worked through the UFOs to produce this.

157
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,700
A bizarre marriage of science fact, fiction, and hope.

158
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,140
Research suggests that 20% of Americans believe in UFOs.

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Is this why some of these people are joining UFO cults

160
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,160
instead of mainstream religions?

161
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,700
The best known group that started out in the grips of cult paranoia

162
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,140
and evolved into a major religion is

163
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,100
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master

164
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,120
and his church of the subgenius.

165
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,580
A prophet with honor in his own land and in his own time.

166
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,760
Part circus style entertainment and part sales pitch.

167
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,220
At their recruitment meetings all across the country,

168
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,860
they were extremely persuasive with their sci-fi pitch to potential members.

169
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,260
It's rumored that followers are under some type of mind control.

170
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,220
Praise God! Praise God!

171
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,060
To me, he was a fabulous man.

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,760
I would say he was among the greatest of the great.

173
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,660
The energy that I felt from him

174
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,700
put me into a state of almost fear and awe.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,220
He provides a way for people to have both the mystical experience

176
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,780
and the experience of sexual freedom and letting go of everything.

177
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,580
He had this sense of,

178
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,560
apocalyptic doom.

179
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,760
There's no limit to what he could do.

180
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,440
He could destroy the earth.

181
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,360
I don't know what that is.

182
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,160
But I know who the devil is and he hates you

183
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,340
and he has a plan for your life

184
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,600
and it's to rip your family apart, it's to destroy your kids,

185
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,280
it's to pull you out of church and make you not believe in God.

186
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,100
He's not politically correct

187
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,520
and he's not part of the anti-Christ movement.

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,740
You see, some people have the idea

189
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,780
that the only people that care anything about E.T.

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
or extraterrestrials or UFOs and all that,

191
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,300
are a bunch of pot-smoking hippies sitting around a campfire somewhere

192
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,800
and singing Kumbaya or OM or whatever else they do

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,140
and that's all they do.

194
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,880
And I mean, you know, nut jobs.

195
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,440
But the truth of the matter is,

196
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,700
some of the smartest people in this country

197
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,200
have their eyes focused on the heavens.

198
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,560
You get into the people that are in the business of making money

199
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
and they are in the business of supporting

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
the knowledge of extraterrestrials.

201
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,720
Their unorthodox gospel began to take shape.

202
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,420
Once they realized the money in that,

203
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,620
the benefit to that,

204
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,340
the sheer joy and outrage and pleasure

205
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,440
for the public and themselves in all of that.

206
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,060
They turned their New Age and Christian ideologies

207
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,360
into a business that went searching for followers.

208
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,200
They brought a lot of color and excitement

209
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,840
to small towns of people who lived on farms

210
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,220
who didn't have a lot to do.

211
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,720
And people left with something.

212
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,500
They left sort of fascinated by it.

213
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,400
They were intrigued by the concept of,

214
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,500
could this actually be?

215
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,060
You're going to hear all kinds of stories

216
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,920
before you get there and afterwards

217
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,440
and I'm going to make up a few after I come back.

218
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,220
We were out looking at the stars,

219
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,980
just enjoying the night.

220
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,880
And suddenly you look behind us

221
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,220
and they're hovering on the ground next to us.

222
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,880
It was the most incredible light show.

223
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,780
It had all the colors of the rainbow.

224
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,220
And they went around the perimeter of the craft

225
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,720
and they were all just like scintillating,

226
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,780
dancing, just like vibrating.

227
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,520
It was just incredible.

228
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,160
They just hovered there and it was completely silent.

229
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,680
And they'd been coming around for a long time.

230
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm just lucky I got to see them.

231
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,980
It cleared the minds.

232
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,340
It made you, your mind stronger.

233
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,700
It was the most unreal weekend I can ever remember.

234
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,460
Can't get any better than that for testimony.

235
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,120
Who are these people?

236
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,600
What drives them to participate?

237
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,480
Participate in acts that society calls madness.

238
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,780
Let's look at the word subgenius.

239
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,600
It does not simply mean just below a genius.

240
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,980
Sub-G intelligence level can range far, far below genius.

241
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,420
I don't want to sound like a dummy here.

242
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,440
They're not smarter than me.

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,480
But they're very smart.

244
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,340
You're only limited by the credulity of your audience

245
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,240
and your own imagination in making up these stories.

246
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,720
That there shall come in the last days

247
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,720
scoffers saying, where is the promise of his coming?

248
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,000
For the skeptic, for the agnostic,

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,320
for the atheist,

250
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,280
I invite you, come, see, and believe.

251
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,760
All these events happen right on the day.

252
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,500
Right on the day.

253
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,020
In the first four events.

254
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,100
Why wouldn't it be logical then to say

255
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,460
that the other events are going to happen right on the day?

256
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,080
The doomsday people would do well to study up.

257
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,760
On this day called X.

258
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,460
And that's why it is very important

259
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
that this information starts to get out now.

260
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,680
That man can prepare himself for a landing

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,700
and is really our future.

262
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,800
We're going to have an apocalyptic event.

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,720
We're going to have a convergence of spacecraft

264
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,820
from various galaxies around the universe.

265
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,100
And they're going to bring us

266
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,200
women covered with hair,

267
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,640
standing eight feet tall.

268
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,000
It looks like a potato.

269
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,720
Deformed.

270
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,140
Disfigured.

271
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,800
Yet strangely

272
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,120
irresistible to millions.

273
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
And it comes from Mars.

274
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,180
Impossible.

275
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,160
Unbelievable.

276
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,180
Fantastic.

277
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,480
But I tell you it could happen.

278
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,540
People are always afraid of what they don't understand.

279
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,500
But there will always be some fool who would pick up a lit bomb

280
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,960
and say, this is interesting.

281
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,040
And it will go off in your hands.

282
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,980
Can we get beyond our primitive fears?

283
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,980
As the aliens come closer,

284
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,440
they're weeks away, they're hours away,

285
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,900
things start getting strange.

286
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,140
And so this day called X,

287
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,160
which began in such an ordinary way,

288
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,760
is no ordinary day.

289
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,420
And it's so hard to know in advance

290
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,300
how any man will react when that day comes.

291
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,800
It certainly occurs to you that,

292
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,080
well, what if this is the big one?

293
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,340
Because you're not expecting the big one

294
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,120
at that particular moment.

295
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
You'll never be expecting the big one when it happens.

296
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,540
And it's right on the verge of coming down.

297
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,340
And when it comes, it's going to spring forth just like that.

298
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,760
It's going to come all of a sudden.

299
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,560
It's all been building up to this point.

300
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,800
But now, somewhere in the next few days,

301
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,160
few weeks, few months, few years,

302
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,500
the Lord's the only one that knows when.

303
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,280
But this thing is going to bust loose.

304
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,040
And when it busts loose, you know what it's going to do?

305
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,060
It's going to find the church asleep.

306
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,860
The church is going to be completely asleep.

307
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,100
The prosperity preachers are going to be up there

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,780
naming it, claiming it, and blabbing it, and grabbing it.

309
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,700
That's all they know to preach.

310
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,820
And the people are going to be comfortable in their faith,

311
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,080
feel good about their religion,

312
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,120
and they're patriotic and love the country,

313
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,520
and everything's going to be hunky-dory and all that.

314
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:06,760
And we go.

315
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,940
Now, oh, listen to this.

316
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,420
This really blessed my heart, friends.

317
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
Bob Dobbs can never die.

318
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,340
He represents more than just a man with a pipe and a know-it-all grin.

319
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,300
He represents the quest of all mutants for freedom.

320
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,560
Check that out.

321
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,940
Check that out.

322
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,500
Put that in your satanic pipe and smoke it, punk.

323
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,500
Check that out.

324
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,460
Oh, and by the way, he can smoke whatever he wants to

325
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,860
in that psychotic, satanic pipe of his.

326
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,600
I don't care what he smokes.

327
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,180
I don't care how much he smokes.

328
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,080
He ain't never going to be the most high, okay?

329
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,820
So you can just put that in your psychotic pipe

330
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,580
and smoke it all day, all night, all month, all day,

331
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,340
and you will never be the most high.

332
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,980
He's got delusions of grandeur.

333
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,960
They want to imagine themselves as the forerunners of the future.

334
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,420
They want to imagine themselves being on the threshold of what is to come.

335
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,340
They say he is a false prophet.

336
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,340
The latest example of spiritual con men at work.

337
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,980
I don't think too much of that.

338
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,660
I wouldn't have it in my house.

339
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,280
I think it's filthy.

340
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,800
At best, they were wasting their money.

341
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,520
And yet his words are so powerful in their convictions,

342
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,700
that millions have believed his ominous prediction.

343
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,340
I believed it. I totally believed it.

344
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,680
I was like a walking robot.

345
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,760
I believed everything they said.

346
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,500
All too many people have uncritically bought into the story,

347
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
not because the evidence is there,

348
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
but they want to believe it's true.

349
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,740
To this day, the question of when this prophet of doom

350
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,660
believed the apocalypse would take place is still unanswered.

351
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,580
He did give us some milestones,

352
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,540
some dates for milestones to think around.

353
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,700
We just assume that the people that have gathered those dates

354
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,500
know what they're talking about.

355
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,720
But that's not the case.

356
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,580
I know how those dates are arrived at.

357
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:45,660
It had pursued the goal of having the people transported out of this world

358
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,500
into a better world that existed in another dimension.

359
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,660
The instrument of that transporting was to be some flying saucers.

360
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,940
Those flying saucers never came.

361
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,700
Even when J.R. Bob Dobbs' prediction proved wrong,

362
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,800
his followers continued to believe that the apocalypse was imminent.

363
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,300
If the spaceships don't land,

364
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,020
I'm not going to have any great anxiety and go in a dither.

365
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,520
There'll be a reason for it.

366
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,860
You see, everything comes down to it.

367
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,540
There's logic and reason in life.

368
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,640
There's great organization in the cosmos.

369
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,140
Because we're disorganized and have, you might say, gotten off the highway,

370
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,900
that doesn't mean that the highway doesn't exist.

371
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,640
You didn't pay attention to the traffic signals.

372
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:31,780
But the problem is,

373
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,220
what can we now conclude from what's been presented?

374
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,280
I don't care who you are or where you come from,

375
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,080
if you haven't sent your $20 into Bob, you're going to burn.

376
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,840
Mother Teresa, I don't care how many people she's helped,

377
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,420
if she hasn't sent her $20 into J.R. Bob Dobbs, it's going to burn in hell.

378
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,320
I don't care who forestyear

379
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,300
If you destroy Robert's profits,

380
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,300


381
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,300


382
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,300


383
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,400
and what Bob's doing with Bob's business

384
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,400


385
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,400


386
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,500
Little Lisa,

387
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,200
Millie,

388
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,740
No, don't agonize.

389
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,900
Thank you, Rat Hole Clench, for that hypnotic media barrage.

390
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,140
But now for one of the most powerful recordings from the Florida Ex Day drill,

391
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,560
the second sermon of Father Joe Mama.

392
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,480
I missed the beginning of the first one,

393
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,980
and I hope for a recording of it from somebody somewhere.

394
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,000
But first, let me explain.

395
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,620
For this sermon, Papa Joe dressed all in black

396
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,540
with a Dracula cape lined with red,

397
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,680
a skull and crossbones on his chest,

398
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,620
and he had his expert makeup artists

399
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,640
apply a perfect skull face makeup on his whole face

400
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,660
in black and white grease paint.

401
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,840
So keep that in mind.

402
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,280
Also, because this was the night of the 4th of July,

403
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,860
you hear fireworks going off in the back.

404
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,740
You hear explosions in the background constantly.

405
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,900
Explosions which perfectly punctuate

406
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,100
the bloody subject of this classic

407
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,580
and thoroughly post-woke retro-futuristic rant

408
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,520
by Father Joe Mama.

409
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,360
Oh, hell yeah!

410
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,000
Hello, friends, and welcome

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,880
to the real Ex Day 1998,

412
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,160
the final reckoning!

413
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,520
Yeah!

414
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,780
And we know it's the last Ex Day

415
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,540
because the conspiracy has shown their hand.

416
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,860
They're always lying to us,

417
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,380
but now, now they're not even trying

418
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,700
to hide their deception.

419
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
It's obvious for all to see.

420
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,480
We've always had a crisis,

421
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,180
some sort of emergency to justify them

422
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,920
seizing our liberties and enforcing

423
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,080
their anti-democratic top-down dictatorships.

424
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,960
For two decades, it was the Islamic terror,

425
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,700
the terrorist group,

426
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,080


427
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,080


428
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,100
and the terrorist group,

429
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,100


430
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,180
But now that Bin Laden and ISIS are gone,

431
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,580
we've swapped that out with a new threat

432
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,820
of domestic terrorists,

433
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,200
the angry white male.

434
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,320
Now, I ask you,

435
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,140
do I look angry to you?

436
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,820
Do I sound angry to you?

437
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,360
And what in Bob's den could I possibly be angry about?

438
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,260
Yes.

439
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,420
Such a threat?

440
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,720
There's always out there literally hundreds,

441
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,900
and yet even while this threat is precipitated

442
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,280
throughout the world,

443
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,400
hundreds of thousands of brown people

444
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
are fleeing across our border.

445
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,980
It'll be millions in just a few months.

446
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,960
Too bad they forgot to tell them

447
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,420
they're heading in the wrong direction.

448
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,440
But in case that threat isn't scary enough,

449
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,540
the conspiracy has another.

450
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,360
Even more frightening threat.

451
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,460
Mutating virus strains.

452
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,160
COVID was great while it lasted,

453
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,000
but now the guilt is off the flower.

454
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,940
People are starting to come out again

455
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,660
and resist their mandatory shutdowns

456
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,480
and mask mandates and digital passports.

457
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,100
So along comes COVID 2.0,

458
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,940
the never-ending story.

459
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,900
It changes, don't you see?

460
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,280
So you're never safe,

461
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,100
whether you're vaccinated or not.

462
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,260
And in the unlikely event that the other two threats

463
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,400
are going to be the same,

464
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,400


465
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:00,400


466
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,600
and not scary enough to beat you down into submission,

467
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,840
we have the ultimate endgame.

468
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,820
Climate change.

469
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,780
The world is going to die by 2032

470
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,600
unless you surrender all your power

471
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,260
to the conspiracy and do everything they want.

472
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,480
And if you express any doubts,

473
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,420
you're unscientific.

474
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,980
All right.

475
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Because the debate is over.

476
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,900
And how dare you even question it.

477
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,300
You see,

478
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,380
it's not enough to have one doomsday scenario.

479
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,600
Oh no.

480
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,400
We need all of you to be prepared.

481
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,360
All three simultaneously a trifecta of terror.

482
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,920
They want you to feel helpless

483
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,940
and that there's nothing you can do

484
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,720
to avoid your doomsday damnation.

485
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,820
We're all going to be blown up by white supremacists

486
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,800
while dying of a deadly virus variant

487
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,720
just as the world burns up

488
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,880
from rising temperatures

489
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,960
and then drowns in rising sea levels.

490
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,480
If one doesn't get you,

491
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,340
the other ones will.

492
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,480
Conspicuously absent, however,

493
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,240
from this list of life-threatening doomsday scenarios

494
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,400
is the fact that

495
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,520
the one threat that really is real.

496
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,620
And that will be here

497
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,120
tomorrow, July 5th.

498
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,840
I'm talking about an all-out invasion

499
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,400
by exes exterminators.

500
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,680
They're on their way here, now.

501
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,960
Do I hear a praise bomb?

502
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,260
Praise bomb!

503
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,560
Yes, this planet is doomed.

504
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,440
And we can't change that.

505
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,560
We don't want to change that.

506
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,220
For the wages of subgenius sin

507
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,340
and dobsian defiance are death.

508
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,400
But just because Earth is dead

509
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,980
doesn't mean we are.

510
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,740
No, no, no, no.

511
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,580
The exes are coming and the pigs are bumming.

512
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,620
But as I look out

513
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,120
amongst our subgenius audience

514
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,740
here today,

515
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,840
the only bumming I see

516
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,740
is of cigarettes.

517
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,160
And perhaps even a few

518
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,680
other inhalable substances.

519
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,120
No, no, no.

520
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,080
We are not bumming

521
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
because we're looking forward to the end times.

522
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,500
The planet may be condemned,

523
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,260
the conspiracy may be condemned,

524
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,000
the Pins Anormals may be condemned,

525
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,100
but we aren't.

526
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,180
We've made our choice.

527
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,600
And once the shooting starts,

528
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,040
we aren't going to run away from the fighting.

529
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,660
We're going to run to it!

530
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
Now, we're going to be joining the aliens

531
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,760
not only on their mopping up operations,

532
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,860
but also when it's all over

533
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,640
and going with them to Planet 10,

534
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,360
the exes' promised world.

535
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,100
A new promised planet

536
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,380
with no pigs.

537
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,220
No pigs and normalcy.

538
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,460
It all sounds rather unbelievable, doesn't it?

539
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,860
But then again,

540
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,300
what in the last few years

541
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,140
was believable? I mean, really?

542
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,640
If you have a

543
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,280
dobsian doubt about whether

544
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,400
Bob will fulfill his promised prophecy,

545
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,060
just look how the conspiracy

546
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,000
itself is starting to prepare the public

547
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
for the mere possibility of aliens.

548
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,480
They are showing

549
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,440
aerial footage of military aircraft

550
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,680
shooting UFOs

551
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,300
on TV

552
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,620
and TV!

553
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,700
The very last order

554
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,780
by the previous president

555
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,060
was to release all information

556
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,800
regarding UFOs within 180 days.

557
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,220
That was signed at the end of December

558
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,140
and by my math,

559
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,920
well, what do you know?

560
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,000
It comes out right about July 5th.

561
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,640
Here we are.

562
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,380
Now, why would they do that?

563
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,320
Maybe when people go bursting in

564
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,840
and they say,

565
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,440
Run to the hills! They're here!

566
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,460
They're killing us, the UFOs!

567
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,420
All the conspiracy ties

568
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,600
will blow their eyes and go,

569
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,140
Oh please. They've been planning that now for months.

570
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,700
They're just releasing the footage.

571
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,900
Once again,

572
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,160
the truth is the precise opposite

573
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,760
of what our leaders

574
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,540
and the media are telling us.

575
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,480
There is a reason

576
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,120
for us to be excited

577
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,700
and his name is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

578
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,680
Do I hear a praise Bob?

579
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,800
Praise Bob!

580
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,860
His pipe has been hiding

581
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,620
in plain sight for all these years.

582
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,860
Right beneath the conspiracy's nose.

583
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,420
Right beneath his nose!

584
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,240
We didn't expect

585
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,220
them to ever admit it.

586
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,140
To paraphrase the 007 movie

587
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,200
Goldfinger,

588
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,080
No, Mr. Bondage.

589
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,540
We expect you to die.

590
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,280
And die they will.

591
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,540
Die they must!

592
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,940
For,

593
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,560
if this planet is to be purged

594
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,420
of its conspiracy contaminating

595
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:26,420


596
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,120
and torments,

597
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,080
it must be completely cleansed.

598
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,360
And we cannot allow this sickness to be spread

599
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,340
throughout the solar system,

600
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,520
nay, through the universe,

601
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,780
through all sorts of other hitchhiking spacecraft.

602
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,520
The only race that can be trusted

603
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,560
to be,

604
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,960
well, how should you say,

605
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,840
allowed to continue to exist

606
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,320
would be the subgeniuses

607
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,140
for they have a life long history

608
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,680
of fighting the conspiracy.

609
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,720
They won't carry that terrible virus

610
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,080
with them to Planet X.

611
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,120
So have confidence, dear friends,

612
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,700
that this conspiracy will go all out

613
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,380
like this. That they wouldn't

614
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,420
reveal their hand unless they knew

615
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,480
the gig was up.

616
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,380
This is going to be the final X-Day.

617
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,300
All the real subgeniuses

618
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,180
can feel it in their bones.

619
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,160
Do I hear an amen?

620
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,340
Amen!

621
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,380
That feeling is a good feeling,

622
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,480
friends. The opposite of what

623
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
the pinks and normals are going to be feeling

624
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,240
in their bones as they are fed through

625
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,420
the conspiracy. Pink people

626
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,240
shredders.

627
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,480
But hey, you can't make an

628
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,980
omelet without breaking a few eggs, right?

629
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,080
Or breaking a few heads

630
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,180
come X-Day as we assist with the

631
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,060
pop-up operations and enjoy the

632
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
biggest fireworks of all time.

633
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,340
So if you ever had any

634
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,280
wonders, just ask

635
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,360
yourself this. If it were a real

636
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
X-Day, would it be

637
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
crowded? No.

638
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,300
No! It would only

639
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
have a select few.

640
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,080
We are that precious few!

641
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,560
After all, weight is very expensive

642
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,400
on a flying saucer going in all

643
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,740
sorts of directions and out of space.

644
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,640
So you expect it to be small

645
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,320
and potent. And that's what we

646
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,920
shall be tomorrow.

647
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,080
So prepare for the real

648
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,200
Independence Day, July 5th,

649
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,960
tomorrow morning at 7am,

650
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,040
as we finally leave this

651
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,580
cursed conspiracy world

652
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,320
sailing for a

653
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,400
lifetime! Amen!

654
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,300
Ladies and

655
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,860
gentlemen, Papa

656
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,040
Joe Mama.

657
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,480
Another round of applause!

658
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,340
If jolting were possible during the squeeze...

659
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,540
...

660
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:01,540

00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,300
Everything was recorded with cushioned equipment.

671

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,240
I'm going to look at a couple more.

741
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:05,860
I've got my mind set on the theme of monsters.

742
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,740
What's your favorite part of the game?

743
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,280
I like the monsters.

744
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,420
To me, they were monsters.

745
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:12,500
I love them.

746
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,600
fish rain from the sky in real life right in front of your face and you're

747
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:25,220
not even tripping yet so that's a wonder of X David in in Ohio we had different

748
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:32,240
miracles tornadoes lightning strikes deadly tarantula bites and things the

749
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,360
rate shows that put out the power everywhere all over Ohio except that one

750
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:45,580
obscure campground we had to keep it secret that we still had ice or it would

751
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,660
have been they would they would have gone all mad max Thunderdome on us

752
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,880
anyway the X X day is always an adventure and that's the cool thing

753
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,560
about it that's why you remember it I don't have to camp in a tent anymore but

754
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,160
I did for many years and I didn't have to drive from Texas to Ohio but I did 30

755
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
times and it was worth it

756
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,460
because this time I didn't have to I didn't even have to drive to the airport

757
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:19,440
these guys took such good care of me and dr. how Philo Philo you listen did you

758
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,360
up man he could have I've gotten lots of tapes from fire and reminding me that it

759
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:34,940
was me that so don't friend you didn't you came to X day no matter the cost no

760
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,220
matter the inconvenience the of the oppressive heat and

761
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,540
unbelievable humidity remember to drink lots of water I would like Burning Man

762
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,120
which also is but by the end of what you're just screaming at everybody

763
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,860
around you it's just been such torture but it's so wonderful I'd go back to

764
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,020
that every year if I could I really would but it's too close to next day I'm

765
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,760
too expensive and you're my friends all who were part of it in the old days say

766
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:09,340
it's so doubt but I would still go I just can't afford it have hot 100 20 US STbad

767
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,340


768
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,340


769
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,340


770
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:37,940
too sold out I suppose. These festival things are great and the best thing, the show, everybody knows, they probably see recordings of it or whatever later if there was anything good. The main thing is standing in the middle of the road talking. My feet always get real tired, I forget to sit down. But sitting around a campground and just the talking between the people, it's amazing how that works.

771
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:58,880
Some of us can be basically anti-social, but for some reason it sometimes changes the next day. Next thing you know somebody's pregnant and has to get married and damn them christen them some red-headed stepchild and they grow up and end up playing on the stage. So there you go.

772
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:13,420
Oh, Starwood is similar, bigger and with a somewhat more gullible general customership, but there's a lot of crossover. I'm married to that also.

773
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:27,360
But Price Bob, we found a new home. X Day or Exanthia Day, whatever, and her dad, her dad actually started this place.

774
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,740
And she's been here since.

775
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,880
She was 11. She was the subgenius. I've met her dad. I can't wait to see his museum.

776
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:43,080
And this is a wonderful place, cool vibes. The residential part reminds me of Trailer Park Boys hippie style.

777
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,600
And I told that to a couple of the workers here and they said, that's exactly it.

778
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,220
So thanks for coming, everybody. And that was a hell of a Papa Joe Mama rant.

779
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,040
Well, I'm sorry to get so strike with you and everything, but you know, I was he he asked why he asked for it.

780
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,180
His name is Blondie and he's a pig.

781
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,700
Reverend Ivo Stang.

782
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,040
Let's give Bice Rose a round of applause.

783
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,000
What makes Bob holla, what makes Bob holla?

784
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,680
When I ask Bob here.

785
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,520
explained this way. And he said, well, when a little sweetie pie in a misker twirls by

786
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:46,080
and rolls those big blue eyes, oh, I holler. And when some pretty chick says she loves my

787
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:55,000
fiddle legs, well, now then, that can do the trick. Oh, I holler. Slack makes Bob holler.

788
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,480
You can find pictures and videos of X Day at the Facebook page called X Day 2021.

789
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:09,300
One of the first events was an impromptu jam, which had Reverend Pease and Reverend Fid

790
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:15,740
Chooley on vocals. They were also co-organizing the festivities with Dr. Fox of Hypercube

791
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:22,300
and Rutenberg on bass, and I forget on drums. I may have to edit this for the broadcast radio version.

792
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,740
But it was nice of you.

793
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:32,980
My name's Bill. I'd like to be a subgenius too. Here's my $35. Can you tell me what to do?

794
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:43,680
Tell me what to do, Bob. Tell me, tell me, tell me, Bob. Tell me, tell me, tell me now.

795
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:54,100
Bob, how come nobody thinks I'm funny and cruel yet? I paid my $35. I thought everybody was going to think I was funny and cruel.

796
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:03,160
This isn't fair. They're all laughing at me. They're all laughing at me. What the f**k? What did I do, Pease?

797
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:09,740
Well, the first thing you did was try to join the church. It's a big f**k. You don't know what's good.

798
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,880
If you didn't know, you can't be funny. It doesn't matter anyway. None of us are.

799
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,540
No, that's not fair. I paid my $35. All of you, you literally have to be my friends.

800
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:23,720
Is he funny now?

801
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,660
I paid.

802
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,720
You, you, you, you, you all have to be my friends and you all have to think I'm super funny.

803
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,080
You have to think I'm funny. I paid for it. I have a card in my wallet.

804
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:45,120
Is this guy funny? I don't know. All I see is a bunch of honey on a show. Man. Go, go, go.

805
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:52,680
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that swag. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that swag.

806
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,820
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

807
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,380
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

808
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,700
Time control. Time control. Time control. Time control.

809
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,380
Bob never asks you to meet on the square. Bob never says that it's level here.

810
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Bob always knows what's going down. Bob is a friend and he's coming around.

811
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,080
Do not fit. He'll be here. F**k the exit.

812
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,840
And it'd be clear. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

813
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,580
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme swag.

814
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,900
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme gimme, gimme, gimme,

what the fuck

829
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,000
oh

830
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,800
babe

831
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,460
ario

832
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,460
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!

833
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,160
X-Day!

834
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,580
I left my whiskey in El Segundo!

835
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,840
El Segundo left his whiskey in you!

836
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,500
Oh!

837
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:45,900
...of all things, other humans, and we are content to call them kinks, can be satisfied by other things,

838
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:57,040
by games of power or accumulation of wealth, or simply by feeling that they got the best of everyone else.

839
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:07,760
The art of the deal, after all, is the art of the steal, the art of getting more of the other person's stuff than you should.

840
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:15,380
This is also called making a profit. And to twisted minds, this is their idea of slack.

841
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:15,880
But it's not.

842
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:23,420
Just like all false slack, they keep jonesing and thirsting after more of it because it does not really satisfy.

843
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,500
Not like being able to tell a good joke and get a good laugh.

844
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,940
Eh, Reverend Stang, would you agree with that?

845
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,920
Oh, I would never disagree with that. Whatever you said.

846
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,200
We may not be funny, but we're trying to be funny.

847
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:50,720
And even the failure can provide humor, and the humor exudes slack into the atmosphere.

848
00:46:51,380 --> 00:47:00,620
Well, one time when Philo and I were researching rival cults, before we put together the pamphlet for Bob,

849
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:11,180
we went to the trouble of, well, we studied the direct mail advertising of the Scientologists, the Masons, and all kinds of more obscure cults.

850
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,760
Hell, there is!

851
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,560
And we went to an Eckhankar meeting in Dallas.

852
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:25,040
They're fairly typical New Age theosophy-derived descendants of the Alice Bailey teachings and so forth.

853
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,780
Bunch of looney tunes and woo-woo stuff.

854
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,140
Not Johnny-ed.

855
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,660
They, um, their meeting was pretty solemn.

856
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,040
The Dallas Eckhankar people were, there was probably about thirty people there.

857
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,640
And there's some ladies that were...

858
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:48,000
kind of running things, and they were speaking worshipfully of their leader, Sri Darwin Gross.

859
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,580
He was the, uh, he was the main guy at that time.

860
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,700
Sri Darwin Gross.

861
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,080
And they had a picture of him on their pulpit, their lectern-type thing.

862
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,640
And just at the moment that she was going,

863
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:09,700
and then there is him, he, who needs not be named, but yet he is Sri Darwin Gross.

864
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,580
The picture fell off the damper.

865
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,060
And the damn lectern!

866
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,620
That was funny.

867
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,800
Did it reveal another picture underneath it?

868
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:17,180
If only.

869
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,100
Oh, yeah.

870
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,700
Philo and I could barely contain ourselves.

871
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:27,040
Uh, and that, that did improve the Eckhankar lecture for us.

872
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,860
However, it happened to me one time.

873
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,480
I started getting a little bit too serious about Bob.

874
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,560
It was one of those times when,

875
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,000
oh, somebody gave me some drug or something before I went on stage.

876
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,780
Coffee or beer or something.

877
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,980
And I, I got, I wasn't, I didn't do my usual thing.

878
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,320
I got a little too serious about,

879
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,620
ecology, and you can destroy the planet and all this.

880
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:58,860
And the picture of Bob, it was a really big one right behind me, fell to the ground.

881
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,680
And I realized I'd let Bob down.

882
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,600
It was me letting Bob down because it wasn't funny.

883
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,580
God damn it.

884
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,980
Well, Bob heard you when he wanted to jump down and be the first thing to jump down.

885
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,800
And he wanted to be destroyed, uh, with the rest of the planet.

886
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,260
Yeah, I'm lucky the whole station collapsed on me.

887
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,340
That has happened to some Bobbies.

888
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,380
It is strange how that works out.

889
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,640
As if there's some master ironist at work.

890
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:31,320
The imminent will that stirs and urges everything and plays mean pranks.

891
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,400
Yeah, in case any of your Bob's are listening, you guys are really cool.

892
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,440
Thanks.

893
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,660
My mom tunes in regularly.

894
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,400
People, yeah.

895
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,840
Preaching hellfire and damnation.

896
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,380
Will you guys say hello to Andy Goodman for me?

897
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,160
When we see her, we'll say hello to her for you.

898
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,280
Okay, thank you very much.

899
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,620
And don't forget, some people come to the show and just watch TV.

900
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,200
And then they say, all three of my brains are somewhat disconnected.

901
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,020
Then they say, phew.

902
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,060
And then they go, Slack, attack.

903
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,080
They have their emotional brain, their intellectual brain.

904
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,020
Attacks on Slack.

905
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:10,640
Oh, I see.

906
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,120
There we go.

907
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,840
Okay, now what is he saying?

908
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,580
Attack on Slack?

909
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,180
He wants an attack on Slack.

910
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,040
No, no, no, no.

911
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,620
The press administration is trying to develop a new tack on Slack.

912
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,240
Oh, a new tack on Slack.

913
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:23,580
A new tack on Slack.

914
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,740
Yeah, he's talking about Slack is just overused, overused.

915
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:29,580
He wants to have a new tack on Slack itself.

916
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,640
I thought he was saying attacks.

917
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,940
I'd like a tax break on Slack myself because we never get enough Slack.

918
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,300
Well, sir, I'll tell you right now, the Church of the Subgenius does not tax any of its members.

919
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,180
We don't believe in tax.

920
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,740
Tax is anti-Slack.

921
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,140
Very good, very good.

922
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,220
I'll have to buy more brochures and hand them out.

923
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,240
All you need is your $30 donation.

924
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,920
I am a member, thank you very much.

925
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,500
Oh, good, good.

926
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:04,300
I promise you going forward in this administration, we will, read my lips, have no taxes in the Church of the Subgenius.

927
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,740
There he's doing some liquid Slack right now.

928
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,380
That's a promise.

929
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,280
And I can keep that promise.

930
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,440
It's one I'll not break like I normally or sometimes have been known to have to do.

931
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,760
Right now it's 7.20 in the morning in Knoxville.

932
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,660
College of hard knocks.

933
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:34,200
So, yes, we will be, I think I'm going to put out my platform.

934
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,520
On my website very shortly.

935
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,640
My platform for administration of the Church of the Subgenius into the next 100 years.

936
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,700
Wow, that'll be cool.

937
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,260
And you can rest assured that in this church your taxes will only go down below zero.

938
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,980
We may even pay you money to join this church in the future.

939
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,300
A tax rebate.

940
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,600
A Slack tax rebate.

941
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,180
A Slack tax rebate.

942
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,360
Thank you.

943
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,080
Thank you very much.

944
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:13,520
An anti-Slack tax rebate that gives you a hedge against the future Slack attacks against you.

945
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,820
I can see it now.

946
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,580
You don't know when they're going to be coming, those Slack vampires that will be coming around each corner.

947
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,440
You'll be slurking and lurking along and there when you least expect it.

948
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,540
Slack attack.

949
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:27,640
Slack attack.

950
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,140
And now you'll be with your special secret anti-Slack tax rebate.

951
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,180
From the Church of the Subgenius.

952
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:51,100
You can flash that anti-Slack tax rebate and defer that horrible attack against your Slack in such a way as to cause the monstrous intrusion to completely dissipate.

953
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:57,040
Many Flacks are wary of enacting the anti-Slack attack tax.

954
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,580
And yet...

955
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,120
Yes, we're going to try to be an example.

956
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:04,120


957
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,060
For all administrations around the world.

958
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,220
For all men.

959
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,080
And what is this whole thing about gay marriage?

960
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:23,180
In the Church of the Subgenius, we believe that any kind of creature should be able to marry any other type of creature without state sanction.

961
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,820
Ah, creature comfort.

962
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,020
I could be married to you right now.

963
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,280
We're over the airwaves and we don't even know it.

964
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,380
And who do we need the state to sanction that anyway?

965
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,020
Certain things like...

966
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,640
Was that a stake sanctioned? Like a teeth on a stake?

967
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,780
The Subgenius ministers have been marrying people for years.

968
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,760
We've married groups of people to each other.

969
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,580
We've married things to each other.

970
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,540
With short duration marriages.

971
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,680
Right, through the Universal Life Church.

972
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,380
No, through the Church of the Subgenius.

973
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,920
No, through the Church of the Subgenius.

974
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,980
Yeah, you don't need to have any...

975
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:03,240
When I got my kids from the Church of the Subgenius, it says I was an affiliated minister for the Universal Life Church.

976
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:12,600
We just say that to make people feel good, but you know, we've been giving up our own ordinations for thousands of millennia.

977
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,920
Oh, I love it.

978
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:21,680
Is it true that Bob is either coming or going, but he's like somewhere in between, like in quantum physics or something?

979
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,080
In a state of indeterminacy.

980
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:30,280
Well, it is true and not true at the same time, believe it or not. That's kind of a hard concept to address.

981
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:30,780
No, it is.

982
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,880
It's actually very... I mean, from what else I've read, it seems like it makes perfect sense.

983
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:45,840
He's sort of in between... he balances on the interstitial range between the two counterclockwise vortices of slack.

984
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,020
Bob is alive and well in the jungles of Indonesia.

985
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:59,380
Those are counterclockwise opposite turning vortices separated only by a small interstitial range of slack.

986
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,760
I'll take you down down to Indonesia.

987
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,280
On top of which Dobbs dances for your pleasure.

988
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:12,060
This city known as Bob's Town, that little place called Dobbs Town. Come along with me down to Subgenius Land.

989
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:29,280
Yes, in the secret language of subgenius symbology, we speak to the lesser creatures living close to nature that the ancients felt all things to be interconnected in an intricate web of being.

990
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,220
Nature's natural.

991
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:38,880
And there the 60 sack of hogs went on and on.

992
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:45,880
We're going to finish this work in just a little bit and then we'll give you your regular programming back.

993
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,220
I'm shaving Hal's pelt right now.

994
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,760
Ooh, it feels so good.

995
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,200
How much yeti is Hal?

996
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,500
Hal, are you at least 80, 90 percent yeti, right?

997
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,560
I'm afraid so. The physical tropisms are...

998
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:00,740
I could celebrate your yeti heritage, man. It's cool.

999
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,480
Unmistakable.

1000
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,220
Do you ever wax your pelt?

1001
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,580
No, that would be excruciatingly painful.

1002
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,880
I've waxed my pelt a few times.

1003
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,140
What is the issue with that mental state which lets you meditate better?

1004
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,080
California.

1005
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:23,200
The Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley, long ago but still fresher than tomorrow's headlines.

1006
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:30,160
This is the Hour of Slack from Church of the Subgenius. See subgenius.com for details.

1007
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,720
That's subgenius.com.

1008
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,040
And now, recorded live at 24X Day, the band called Rubik's Pube.

1009
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,760
That's Rubik's with an X, Pube.

1010
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,520
They drove to Florida all the way from Pennsylvania.

1011
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,720
Praise Bob!

1012
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,980
I can't live by myself anymore.

1013
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,960
I need some help from my big brother.

1014
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:16,260
His old is listening and he's awful good at watching me.

1015
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,380
And I think he'll watch me forever.

1016
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,320
And nobody wants to listen to whoever says anything.

1017
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,060
That's just wild.

1018
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:39,980
Oh!

1019
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,520
A few days later, a safe resolution.

1020
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,920
An hour later, deuces stop by.

1021
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,620
Well, that's it.

1022
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,620


1023
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,620


1024
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,620


1025
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,620


1026
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,620


1027
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,200
So, Asha, why don't you play whatnot?

1028
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,200


1029
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,200


1030
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,000
We're running.

1031
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,520
Can you play anything that make you feels like alcohol?

1032
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,560
I don't want to be a part of your plan

1033
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,360
Doesn't mean I'll do the things that you can

1034
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,240
You're giving me an anxiety

1035
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,740
I don't want to be part of the man

1036
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:02,980
Said he's doing me no harm

1037
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,700
But the things that he does

1038
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,140
Takes a fucking life

1039
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:12,920
I don't want to be a part of your plan

1040
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:22,600
Doesn't mean I'll do the things that you can

1041
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,940
guitar solo

1042
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:46,280
Bye, bye, bye

1043
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,940
Hey, wait, I'm getting a no-go signal.

1044
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,040
Now I'm losing one of the craft.

1045
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,840
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?

1046
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,080
I'm off-contact.

1047
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,280
A lot of dust blowing up there.

1048
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,420
Okay, they're calling those two little peewee dogs

1049
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,560
or the pumpkin birds, I think they're calling them now.

1050
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,440
Can anybody hear?

1051
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,180
Okay.

1052
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,540
Come in, come in.

1053
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,420
No, I'm sorry, the Red Seed is...

1054
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,380
We lost the Red Seed.
