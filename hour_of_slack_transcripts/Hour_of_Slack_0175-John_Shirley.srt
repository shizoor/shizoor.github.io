1
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,760
And man has always peered fearfully into his own future.

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,140
Ah.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,700
We ain't got no legs.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,180
That means I ain't got no legs, you ain't got no legs, and them men in there ain't got no legs.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,920
Now what does that sound like to you?

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,820
The self-genius.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,180
Our health.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,380
We like.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,020
It gets up and kills.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,000
The people it kills get up and kill.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,260
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,360
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,000
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,160
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,100
constantly scanned throughout our program

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,900
should seek help from the National Health Service.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,560
Or a shelter in an approved safety unit only.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
Man has always peered fearfully into the future,

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,020
dreading the glimpse that will show him all his dreams turn to dust.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,580
Shut up!

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,420
Shut up!

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,500
Shut up!

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,100
Shut up!

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
Shut up!

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,460
when the growl and yae say nobody you know

26
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,160
And then the start of your apparent lack of a sense of fit

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,080
I thought it would tell you you are gonna be jedoched

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,340
I would���t a0

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,300
Who would?

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Ever

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,860
by

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:55,980
You

33
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,580
im

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:56,900
a

35
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,760
Is anyone who differs from everyone else easy enough to think about there?

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,380
The overwhelming majority of normals do not even know that they comprise a conspiracy.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,900
A conspiracy. A small percentage, however.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,700
The controllers are conscious and active as a conspiracy.

39
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:37,480
Intent on robbing you, me, and even our leader, J.R. Bob Dobbs, of our rightful inheritance of slack.

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,160
Look, I know how this sounds. I know everybody says this.

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,320
But you've got the wrong man. I'm not the guy.

42
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,420
Anything you do to me is going to waste your time and energy because I don't know anything.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm not one of those people. I mean, I'm not one of those. I'm really not.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,040
One of which people? You seem to think we've brought you here for some specific reason.

45
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,660
You seem to know why you're here.

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,440
No, I absolutely don't. I don't. I mean, I know that you people are the man.

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,100
I mean, I know that you're the company police and the ones who look for...

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Well, I know what you look for. I mean, everybody knows. It's no secret.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,380
And I just want you to know I'm not one of those people.

50
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
I'm not one of those people.

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm not one of the ones you look for.

52
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,180
Who told you what we're looking for?

53
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,060
Well, I don't know. I was just a kid.

54
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,100
I mean, the other kids would talk about the company police, the special police.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,880
People just talk about it. I mean, you know, they just gossip.

56
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, not with disapproval. I mean, it's something...

57
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,940
I guess it's something you have to do. People have to do that.

58
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,560
I mean, it's not like we disapproved. We just talked about it.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:19,980
Literally.

60
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,360
And how do you know we have to do it?

61
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,660
Well, you're there. I mean, you're doing it, so it must be necessary if you're doing it.

62
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,200
I guess.

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,980
You know, you're talking differently now.

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,260
Well, different for what?

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,540
You're talking as if we're a good thing.

66
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,860
As if you're not worried about us.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,520
Well, what did I say before?

68
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,600
Well, yesterday in the cafeteria, you said that we were taking people away for no reason.

69
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,860
You thought nobody was listening, but we have a recording if you'd like to hear it.

70
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,980
You said that we were taking people away.

71
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
What was it you said?

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,760
To maintain an atmosphere of terror.

73
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,100
I believe that was it.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,940
Oh, I...

75
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,040
Did I say that?

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,820
Well, did I say it was a bad thing for you to be doing that?

77
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
I mean, if that's what you're doing...

78
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,900
I'm not pretending I know, but I mean...

79
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,380
I assume you have to keep people on their...

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
What's that for?

81
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,740
Now look, this is really pointless.

82
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,680
You don't have to use that.

83
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,380
If you want me to sign a confession...

84
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,360
If you want me to sign a confession, I'll do it.

85
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm ready for rehabilitation if you think it's necessary.

86
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,240
Okay.

87
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,720
I mean, if I said the wrong thing, I didn't realize it.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,680
Look, don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

89
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,380
If you break that, I won't be able to work.

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,660
I won't be able to work if you don't do it.

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:51,660


92
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:51,660


93
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
Look, it'll cost the company money.

94
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,100
It'll cost money.

95
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,460
Don't.

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,080
No.

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,780
Use the micro-3.

98
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,020
And maybe the micro-2.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,420
Well, no. The micro-2 is a bit too dilatory.

100
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,000
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!

101
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,800
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

102
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,380
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!

103
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,580
The spinal fluid can damage the mechanism.

104
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,660
If... Yeah, that's a bit...

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:21,760
better.

106
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,520
Yeah, the micro-3 is really more

107
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,420
suitable for this.

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,820
Oh, there. That's it. He's responding very well.

109
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,780
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,120
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

111
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,400


112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,720
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,560
AAAAAAAAHHHHH!

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,600
Now, how is that?

115
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,540
This is not

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,340
necessary. This is really pointless.

117
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,620
I want

118
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,740
to know why you're doing this for no reason.

119
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,620
I want to know what... I mean, there's

120
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,040
no reason!

121
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,320
I thought you knew everything.

122
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,740
You were talking as if you knew everything.

123
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,400
Why, you know

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,040
all about us, don't you?

125
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,480
You were the great expert on us.

126
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,380
Did you know about this?

127
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,560
This... makes you

128
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,280
afraid of your own hands and feet.

129
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,600
I mean, it's just an

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,700
injection. It's just a chemical.

131
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,640
But it's funny

132
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,260
how an injection can change everything.

133
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,140
Now, there.

134
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,200
Look, don't!

135
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,340
Look, I...

136
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,680
AAAAAAAAHHHH!

137
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,560
The house left.

138
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:31,680
Open.

139
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,740
Untie his hands.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,480
I believe it's working.

141
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,640
Give him the saw.

142
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,660
Give him the saw.

143
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,840
Give him the saw.

144
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,420
Give him the saw.

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Give him the saw.

146
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,620
Give him the saw.

147
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,220
Give him the saw.

148
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,460
Give him the saw.

149
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,540
Give him the saw.

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,400
Give him the saw.

151
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Give him the saw.

152
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,300


153
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,240
AAAHHHHHH!

154
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,980
You give him the saw.

155
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,980
You give him the saw.

156
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:57,860
Friends, that was John Shirley with Michael Chachalach or Chachalax or...

157
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,840
I really don't know how to pronounce it exactly.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,320
But, yeah, John Shirley.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Now, and friends, this week's Hour of Slack is a spotlight on John Shirley.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,780
Now, most of you have read 1984.

161
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,420
Or else you will after I have just now told you to do so.

162
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,780
Every generation has its George Orwell.

163
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:34,680
And part of the duty of our church, of the subgenius, our church, the People's Temple Agricultural Mission,

164
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,460
P.O. Box 893 Georgetown, Guyana, South America,

165
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,220
is to bring to the attention of our members anything that they must know.

166
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,820
No matter how painful.

167
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
How awful it may be.

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,380
During the last year, I've been reading nothing but Russian history and John Shirley.

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,040
John Shirley is a cyberpunk sci-fi author.

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,320
If you were going to pigeonhole him, it doesn't really apply anymore.

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:11,700
But part of that gang of wacky Zenos and depressing, horrible prophets,

172
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,020
including William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Lou Scheiner,

173
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
who are all the same.

174
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,160
Who else?

175
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,580
Huh?

176
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,540
Yeah, Rudy Rucker, reverends, all.

177
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,440
In fact, the most, probably the best John Shirley book you could just go out and pick up

178
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,700
would be one of the Eclipse series.

179
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,560
Eclipse, Penumbra.

180
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,140
For the first one is Eclipse.

181
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,180
They're about the conspiracy, dear friends,

182
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,240
and how the conspiracy does tend to get in a...

183
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,540
onus.

184
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,020
I'm gonna read excerpts from Shirley's stuff,

185
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:00,800
but what mainly spurred this focus on Reverend Shirley is a new tape I got from him

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,020
with lots of keen, keen, ranting, horrible songs.

187
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,460
But the conspiracy, for those of you new to the Hour of Slack,

188
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,700
the conspiracy is them.

189
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
Not us.

190
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,460
Them.

191
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,680
Them.

192
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,720
Them.

193
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,020
The they, theym who took away your real slack.

194
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,420
Of course, you're not one of theym, are you?

195
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,060
Never were, either.

196
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,940
Not even when they made you wanna be.

197
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,980
In fact, that's why they wanted your slack.

198
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,000
It's why you had slack in the first place.

199
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,000
They did manage to steal most of it,

200
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,540
but they obviously haven't gotten it all.

201
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,100
They haven't gotten Bob, or else you wouldn't be listening to this show,

202
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,480
as long as there's one free Bob among us,

203
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,740
their system cannot be complete.

204
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,620
Because, by nature, it's a closed system,

205
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,920
and if we can keep their system incomplete,

206
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,880
it'll close down all of its own accord,

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,160
by their own law, the law of normality.

208
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,100
The conspiracy, friends,

209
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,020
that which forms the background of your entire life,

210
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,380
it's your inferiority complex,

211
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,200
your delusions of grandeur.

212
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,600
It's the reason for all your problems.

213
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,940
The thing that lives in Washington,

214
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,560
its weight makes the planet groan.

215
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,960
The thing that lives in Washington,

216
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,820
is a kind of living stone.

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,740
The thing that lives in the temple,

218
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,200
the temple with five sides.

219
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,660
The thing that lives in Washington,

220
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,080
takes children for animal hides.

221
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,300
The mound incubates power,

222
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,880
with that, the heart is diamonds.

223
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,240
The word remarks of the hour,

224
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,700
well, it's just the clock that's crying.

225
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,180
The thing that lives in Washington,

226
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,460
it's got a thousand whims.

227
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,040
The thing that lives in Washington,

228
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
oh, don't you recognize him?

229
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,740
Cause you know his name is Legion,

230
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,040
and you know his name is Trust.

231
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,540
Would you like to take a meeting?

232
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,160
Would you like to lunch with us?

233
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,480
Would you like to smile on TV,

234
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,920
as you smile with blood and pus?

235
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,100
Yeah, there are razors on the wind,

236
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,500
there's a shining cloud of ages.

237
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,920
While satellites slowly spin,

238
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,440
and the turn keys check their gauges.

239
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,560
And the therapist is closing,

240
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,120
and the interface engages.

241
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,780
And you hug your shrink-wrapped skin,

242
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,280
as they pay you out your wages.

243
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,440
One division of Illusion

244
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,060
additional

245
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,500
The thing that lives in Washington

246
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,060
It's a kind of living stone

247
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,120
And you know it's in a temple

248
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,780
A temple with five sides

249
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,240
And you know this thing in Washington

250
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,500
Will it take children for animal hides?

251
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,580
Oh no

252
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Well I know

253
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,080
Show me, show me, show me the way

254
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,920
Show me, show me, show me the way

255
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,000
Show the God with a prayer

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,280
A prayer to work for us

257
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,120
If only Lord I knew where

258
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,200
Those creatures of God was

259
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,580
Oh no

260
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,520
Well I'd reach out

261
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,120
And I'd stop the count

262
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,940
And I'd stop the count

263
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,060
Of its constant counting out

264
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,900
I'd reach out

265
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,440
With my mortal hands

266
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,580
And I'd stop the count

267
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,720
Of its constant counting out

268
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,680
I'd dig its hearts in my hands

269
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,560
And I'd close my hands

270
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,360
And I'd cross it in my hands

271
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,540
And I'd close my hands

272
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,300
I'd cross it in my hands

273
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,880
The thing that lives in Washington

274
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,840
Show me

275
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,560
The Thing That Lives in Washington

276
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,580
The Thing That Lives in Washington

277
00:17:49,540 --> 00:18:07,460
The Thing That Lives in Washington

278
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:37,100
The Thing That Lives in Washington

279
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:51,300
The Thing That Lives in Washington

The Thing That Lives in Washington

282
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:37,580
The Thing That Lives in Washington

283
00:20:37,600 --> 00:21:06,900
The Thing That Lives in Washington

284
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:37,580
The Thing That Lives in Washington

285
00:21:37,600 --> 00:22:06,740
The Thing That Lives in Washington

286
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:23,360
The Thing That Lives in Washington

287
00:22:43,580 --> 00:23:06,420
The Thing That Lives in Washington

288
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:37,520
The Thing That Lives in Washington

289
00:23:37,600 --> 00:24:07,580
The Thing That Lives in Washington

290
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:37,580
The Thing That Lives in Washington

291
00:24:37,600 --> 00:25:05,880
The Thing That Lives in Washington

292
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,980
The Thing That Lives in Washington

293
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,940

The Thing That Lives in Washington

296
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:35,440
The Thing That Lives in Washington

297
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,700
Like a beautiful dream

298
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,860
They'll know we're not playing games

299
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,020
Let's do some crimes

300
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,780
Let's do some crimes

301
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,940
Let's do some crimes

302
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,700
Let's do some crimes

303
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,500
Steal the parts to a nuclear bomb

304
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,260
Pick a city you can't stand

305
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,340
Do something that's so overwhelmingly wrong

306
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,320
Feel the world in your hands

307
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,660
Oh, we could go to the liquor store

308
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,480
Knock over a 7-Eleven

309
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,260
Might have to dust them just to make sure

310
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,220
Let God sort them out and head on

311
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,420
Let's do some crimes

312
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,100
Let's do some crimes

313
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,060
Let's do some crimes

314
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,000
Let's do some crimes

315
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,460
Let's do some crimes

316
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:48,760
Let's do some crimes

317
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,560
Let's do some crimes

318
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:49,560


319
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:49,560


320
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,600
We robbed the White House of sewage lines

321
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,420
I've got a wrench that'll fit

322
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,040
Pour it on them from behind

323
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,960
Give them a taste of their own s**t

324
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,200
Let's do some crimes

325
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,700
Let's do some crimes

326
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,500
Let's do some crimes

327
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,620
Let's do some crimes

328
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,700
Let's do some crimes

329
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,860
Let's do some crimes

330
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,540
Please

331
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Let's do this cry time, come on

332
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,500
Let's do some cry

333
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,500
Let's do some cry

334
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,680
Come on, come on

335
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,460
Let's do some cry

336
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,360
Let's do some cry

337
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,480
Let's do some cry

338
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,820
Come on, come on

339
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,560
Let's do some cry

340
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,260
Let's do some cry

341
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:52,360
Let's do some cry

342
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,800
Let's do some cry

343
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,980
Let's do some cry

344
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,720
Let's do some cry

345
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,620
Don't need a reason, don't need rhyme

346
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,760
Let's do some cry

347
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,000
I got the time

348
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,760
Let's do some cry

349
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,560
Aborg

350
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,160
Lyrics available link in the description

351
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,680
If you're watching now and not yet刹

352
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,820
Tell the band I didn't kill anyone.

353
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,440
No, I'm just trying to have me some fun.

354
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,640
Well, yes, on the one hand, I guess I would assume that it is.

355
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:50,400
But for the life of me, I can't understand how a group like Iggy Pop and the Stooges

356
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,720
or some other group like that, how they are really a reflection or a mirror of what's really going on now.

357
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,420
Well, they have to be.

358
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,520
No one would buy their records.

359
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,360
No one would see the rock acts.

360
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,020
Well, if they're a mirror of the young generation, then we're in bad trouble, aren't we?

361
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,360
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit up your poop chute.

362
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,780
Whatever.

363
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,680
Mock worst.

364
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,300
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit up your poop chute.

365
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,800
Sausage.

366
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,660
Mock worst.

367
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,180
No time for relationship.

368
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,780
Skip the whole day.

369
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,380
Little bit.

370
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,460
Gotta keep it up.

371
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,040
Ah, yes.

372
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,480
Dear friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack,

373
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,020
originating here from Dallas, Texas.

374
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,740
God only knows where all it's going to.

375
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,080
I'm going to, continuing with our focus on the writings,

376
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,600
mainly of John Shirley.

377
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,020
Not only because he's a friend of the church, but just because, I mean, even if he wasn't,

378
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,200
we'd still owe it to you to tell you about him.

379
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,880
And this, of course, you can pick his books up in different places,

380
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,080
but he's written some things just for the church.

381
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,540
In fact, there's a book I've been trying to put together,

382
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,660
collecting anecdotes for, called Bummers.

383
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,400
It's what you might call it.

384
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,320
It's all a book about what can go wrong with drugs.

385
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,160
And John Shirley wrote this for Bummers.

386
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:45,000
By the way, everyone who wishes to is welcome to submit their own Bummer tales

387
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,740
for inclusion in this book whenever and if ever we sell it.

388
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,220
But here's what poor John had to say about cocaine.

389
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,440
Cain.

390
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,400
About ten years later, I'm quoting, once again, I'm quoting John Shirley.

391
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,080
About ten years later, I'd given up psychedelics, mostly,

392
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,160
because I tended to dissolve into my environment if I took them.

393
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,560
It didn't take much.

394
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,080
Even now, when I look at a blank wall closely,

395
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,820
it swims around a little, looking missable, shifting with subtle patterns.

396
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,540
Never had a flashback, though.

397
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,600
But I was living in New York and was making money writing,

398
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,400
and my wife was doing other things.

399
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,000
Four.

400
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,660
Moolah.

401
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,840
And we tended to blow it on cocaine.

402
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,740
Sometimes heroin and cocaine, but mostly coke.

403
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,940
Sometimes I mainlined it.

404
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,700
I tell this story with reluctance.

405
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,260
I don't like to think about it.

406
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,100
I've been off cocaine, off drugs.

407
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,740
Well, I'd take a little mild mescaline or MDMA if someone offered it and have done,

408
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,300
but mostly I steer clear now.

409
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,980
And coke was the only hard one to get away from.

410
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,480
I'm convinced that, at least relative to man,

411
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,940
good and evil are quite real,

412
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,160
and that there are good drugs and evil drugs.

413
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,120
Good drugs can become bad drugs if they're misused.

414
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,060
I learned a great deal from psychedelics,

415
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,580
but one mustn't take them too often or under the wrong circumstances.

416
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,620
And you shouldn't use them at all if you can't handle a car that drives the mental freeways at top speed,

417
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,560
pressing its own accelerator to the floor.

418
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,360
But evil drugs are always evil drugs.

419
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,000
Cocaine, heroin, and PCP especially.

420
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,460
The TV is a good place to be.

421
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


422
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


423
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


424
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


425
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


426
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:32,100
It's a TV commercial that shows the rat dosing itself to death on cocaine is no bull dookie, so to speak.

427
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,320
Some people have more resistance to coke addiction than others,

428
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,380
but anyone will duplicate the fate of that white rat if they have enough coke.

429
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,720
Cocaine will rewire your brain.

430
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,320
It'll push your pleasure buttons.

431
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,560
We'll use reward conditioning to make you its Pavlovian lab rat.

432
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,240
It pretty much ate through the bonds with my wife,

433
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,400
and the marriage fell apart.

434
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,460
I remained faithful to cocaine, however, and got deeper into shooting up.

435
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,900
One day, I went rabid with it.

436
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,720
I had two good grams and a fresh needle, and I got feverishly into sticking myself.

437
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,540
The needle became as important as the drug.

438
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,500
I associated the needle with the indescribably powerful rush of cocaine pleasure,

439
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,460
so that the needle was lasciviously desirable.

440
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,280
I was queer for the needle.

441
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,340
I wanted the needle, the hard needle shoved in a new aura,

442
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,660
as one of the many sex change cuts I was making on my arms and legs, my thighs.

443
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,460
I was babbling, gasping, buzzing beyond searching for a vein.

444
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,020
I had a heavy dose of it in me, and I was hallucinating from it.

445
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,000
Yes, you hallucinate from heavy cocaine.

446
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,820
So I couldn't see a vein anyway, just a writhing nest on my arm.

447
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,460
I shoved it in at random, and I couldn't feel the pain of the clumsy jabbings,

448
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,680
because cocaine is an anesthetic.

449
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,020
I was freezing out.

450
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,880
I wasn't getting off as good now,

451
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,040
and I was suddenly deep down, bone marrow scared,

452
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,380
because I knew that the coke crash was on the way.

453
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,300
A bad cocaine crash, especially the sort you get from mainlining,

454
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,480
is the worst thing I've ever experienced.

455
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,240
It makes my other drug bummers paradisial by comparison.

456
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,360
It makes you wish you were dog poop so that you could be something higher than you are.

457
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,640
It's the profoundest depression combined with unendurable weakness and pain,

458
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,080
and every individual nerve ending.

459
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,360
Every single one like a short-circuiting socket, smoking and sparking and turning black.

460
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,840
It is exactly as I imagined hell would have to be for Adolf Hitler or someone worse.

461
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm using no hyperboles here.

462
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,040
No need for exaggeration.

463
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
The crash is a welcome mat for suicide.

464
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,400
I was terrified of it, and the only way to put it off, since I didn't have any downers,

465
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,880
was to try and stay up.

466
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Keep shooting.

467
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,320
It wasn't just my fear, though.

468
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,920
I couldn't have stopped then, even if there was no crash.

469
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,660
I was in the programmed cycle the white rat was in.

470
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,300
I was trapped in pushing the button.

471
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,580
Pushing the button made me push the button, made me push the button,

472
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,680
but the cocaine ran out.

473
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,360
My heart was beating so fast it was all blurred into one beat.

474
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,740
The distortion of my sight was so thick I couldn't see past an arm's length.

475
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,980
Beyond that, it was sort of a hurricane of color and shape.

476
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,520
I was blowing up.

477
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,540
Only, it was taking forever, exploding as if I'd swallowed a hand grenade, but in slow

478
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,100
motion.

479
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,740
I felt like the guy in Scanners whose head gradually explodes from psychic attack.

480
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:40,980
But I kept jabbing, trying to glean some coke from the floor, from my bedspread, from the

481
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,120
scrap of foil it had come in.

482
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,760
I added water to those things, trying to get the last little bit, shooting up dust from

483
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,260
the floor.

484
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,560
Miracle, I didn't get an embolism or something.

485
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,500
I was in a state of shock.

486
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,500


487
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,520
I was babbling, jabbing myself randomly, only now my hands would no longer hold the

488
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:56,860
needle.

489
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,620
They shook too much to hold it, but the jabbing didn't stop.

490
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,620
There were needles all over me.

491
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,900
There were needles jabbing themselves viciously into my flesh, all over my body.

492
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,480
I could see them.

493
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,440
They were like plastic steel big mosquitoes the size of hypos.

494
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,940
They were swarming all around me.

495
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,560
They were jabbing, and now it hurt and there was no pleasure.

496
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,800
But they couldn't stop.

497
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,380
I could see my hands on them now.

498
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:35,660
I had a hundred ectoplasmic hands, and the hands wouldn't stop, even though I screamed

499
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,140
at them.

500
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,660
My roommate came home and called an ambulance, and they took me overdosing to the hospital.

501
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:47,120
The needles kept stabbing me all the way, and they had to put in a tube in my lungs

502
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,700
because they were filled with fluid.

503
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,460
I almost proceeded Belushi.

504
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,540
And then the girls came in.

505
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:51,540


506
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,920
The crash hit me when I was in the hospital with the nasty tube down my throat, and the

507
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,260
sheets were made of sandpaper, and I had a third degree sunburn on my body.

508
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,180
But that's how it felt.

509
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,460
I couldn't rest, but I was so exhausted I wept from it.

510
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,860
It went on for a day or two.

511
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,980
Afterwards my whole body below the neck was puffed up from needle jabs and coke damage

512
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,760
to the tissues.

513
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,740
It looked like I had a terminal skin disease.

514
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,520
It took weeks to go away.

515
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:20,960
Nightmares.

516
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,140
About the needles.

517
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,600
It was worse than that.

518
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,980
I can't talk about it any more than this, though.

519
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,540
I can't think about it any more.

520
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,600
I lived through it, and I stopped using cocaine.

521
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,140
From the Confessions, dear friends, of John Shirley.

522
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,200
Read it and weep.

523
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Here's a song of his that probably applies.

524
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,880
John Shirley, Read It and Weep.

525
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:48,880


526
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,420
John Shirley, Read It and Weep.

527
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,420


528
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,420


529
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,900
John Shirley, Read It and Weep.

530
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,160
Pauline, I'm burning out, baby.

531
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,180
Pauline, I'm working out, baby.

532
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,060
I squandered my youth like pocket change

533
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,460
Oh Lord, I spent it all and I spent it strange

534
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,480
I used to feel love and pain

535
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,660
And I'm never gonna feel it again

536
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,420
Hey, later

537
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,080
Party

538
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,940

Party, party now

543
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,980
Hey, later

544
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,440
I used to know what was laid out for me

545
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, I'd give anything to have that certainty

546
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,560
Just as chaos is a machine

547
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,000
Whose blueprint we've never seen

548
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,700
Hey, later

549
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,240
Party

550
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,020
Party, now

Hey, later

558
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,600
The cocaine wind blows from the past

559
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,660
Yes, a pitiless blowing and a parent blast

560
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,540
Oh, and it's whistling, whistling out of time

561
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,920
As it wails through my ribs and through my spine

562
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,940
Hey, later

563
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,480

564
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,520

567
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,520
Oh, party now

568
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,380
Hey, later

569
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
Chaos

570
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,720
Chaos is a machine

571
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,900
Whose blueprint we've never seen

572
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,160
And vacuum seems to be the only way to get out of this mess

573
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:41,340
And vacuum seems to be the only way to get out of this mess

574
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:41,340


575
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,080
At the heart of things

576
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,640
At the heart of things

577
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,360
Well, empty church bells ring

578
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,220
Well, empty church bells ring

579
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,500
And vacuum seems to be the only way to get out of this mess

580
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,100
Hey, later

00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:55,540

Party

585
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,860
Party, now

586
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,440
Hey, later

Hey, later

590
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,760
I don't know what I want to do

591
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,960
I don't know what I want to do

592
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,520
But there's hope now

593
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,680
But there's hope now

594
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,060
Now that I've met you

595
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,620
Now that I've met you

596
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,020
And I'll try to fly home

597
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,300
Before we die

598
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,700
Before we die

599
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,600
But I won't try to get in

600
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,380
I'll just stand outside

601
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,960
I'll just stand outside

602
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,820
Party

603
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,340
Party, I'll party

604
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,820
Party, no

605
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,480
And I'll pay later

606
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:44,820
Party

607
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,900
Party, no

608
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,620
And I'll pay later

609
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,040
Party

610
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,140
Party, no

611
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,820
And I'll pay later

612
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,240
Come on

613
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,620
Give me a few more minutes

614
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,560
Just give me a little longer

615
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,580
Here's the bill, sir

616
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,500
I can't pay it now, man

617
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,560
Just give me a few more minutes

618
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,220
Here's the bill, sir

619
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,180
I don't want the bill now

620
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,600
I'm gonna pay later

621
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,960
I'm gonna pay later

622
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,180
It's time to pay up

623
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,100
Oh, party

624
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,420
Oh, party, now

625
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,160
I'll pay later

626
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,380
No, no, no

627
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,660
No, it's time to pay

628
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,040
It's time to pay

629
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,060
It's time to pay

630
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,580
It's time to pay

631
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:42,760
It's time to pay

632
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,760
It's time to pay

633
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,240
Oh, yes, dear friends

634
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,280
Yeah, John Shirley

635
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,180
This is a pretty depressing

636
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,500
Sort of

637
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,920
Downbeat show, you might say

638
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,980
My friend John Shirley

639
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,540
Is a pretty downbeat

640
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,380
Kind of guy sometimes

641
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,720
Here's a

642
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,280
Well, a list of books

643
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,220
By John Shirley

644
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,060
Uh

645
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,560
You can pick up right now

646
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,880
A Splendid Chaos

647
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,900
A collection of short stories

648
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,920
Called Heat Seeker

649
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,060
Um, Black Hole of Carcosa

650
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,680
Is that one with the subgenius elements in it

651
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,340
His, uh

652
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,860
Classics, Eclipse

653
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,140
Eclipse Penumbra, and coming up

654
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,500
Eclipse Corona, and another short story

655
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,860
Collection called The Moorman

656
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,140
And he's done some

657
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,180
Horror novels, one is called

658
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,940
Sellers

659
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,020
And one called

660
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,460
In Darkness Waiting

661
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,280
This, I'm gonna read some excerpts from

662
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,920
In Darkness Waiting

663
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,160
Just to give you some idea of how sick

664
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,660
This man really is

665
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,320
This is near the climax

666
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,260
The

667
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,860
Insect evil spirit

668
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,220
Beings have taken over the inside

669
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,360
Of the slaughterhouse

670
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,820
One of the faces detached

671
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,640
From the group and came at him

672
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,280
A lean snarling man with a steel mallet

673
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,500
In his hand, shrilling

674
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,700
He said, I want the woman, I want the woman

675
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,700
And flashing the mallet down at the big man's head

676
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,780
The big man grabbed the other's

677
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,100
Mallet hand and let her go

678
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,220
So he could claw at the lean man's face

679
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,340
And the two of them, wrestling furiously

680
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,800
Tottered off into the milieu

681
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,940
She had fallen, she realized

682
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,220
And was lying on the floor

683
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,500
Instinctively she crawled towards the wall

684
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,240
To the nearest shelter, the meat cutting table

685
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,120
With its saw

686
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,860
She crept underneath and bowled herself up there

687
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,040
In the shadows, a pile of rotting meat shavings

688
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,340
And bone dust between her legs

689
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,580
Between her back and the concrete wall

690
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,840
Cushioning her, maybe they wouldn't see her here

691
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,460
At first

692
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,380
What she saw looked like a

693
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,520
Barroom brawl or a riot

694
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,620
Raging out of control

695
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,500
Several hundred of the higher ones

696
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,140
Turned against one another

697
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,040
The pilots whirring above

698
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,400
Crawling on the dead

699
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,540
But then she saw it for what it was

700
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,820
She saw a fountain of red spray

701
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,360
The red spurting

702
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,280
From here, from there

703
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,320
But united by fields of

704
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,320
Telekinesis

705
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,520
The warring psychic fields

706
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,280
Projected by the pilots

707
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,980
Creating bubbles in the red spray

708
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,360
Butting thunderheads of electromagnetic force

709
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,140
Their conflict

710
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:24,900
Shattering the spray into mist

711
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,460
That was sculpted by the uncontrolled

712
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,600
Power of mind

713
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,040
Made to conform to the imagery

714
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,500
Crackling from the tortured minds

715
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,120
Of the pilots

716
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,640
Images painted in the air

717
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,940
In blood spray

718
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,880
Airbrushed scarlet

719
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,020
Nothing given detail

720
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,100
On secondary colors with bits of

721
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,800
Levitated bone and sinew

722
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,500
And blue under flesh and hair

723
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,440
And torn skin

724
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,100
A brief image of a woman's living head

725
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,940
Exuding toothy worms

726
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,160
As if Medusa's snakes had turned

727
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,820
Against her, dug into her skull

728
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,620
Emerged from her eyes and mouth

729
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,160
A man with a human

730
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,960
Face on one side of his head

731
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,360
A gargoyle on the back

732
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,060
The two melding together, compressing fluidly

733
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,240
To become one pathetic grotesquerie

734
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,140
Human inadequacies

735
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,040
Hopeless struggle against moral

736
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,000
Disillusion

737
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,120
A hawk ripping a rabbit open

738
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,160
A rabbit devouring its own young

739
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,200
A fetus chewing its way out

740
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,920
Through a woman's pregnancy

741
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,320
Swollen belly

742
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,300
Its snaggly teeth

743
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,280
Flecked with its mother's

744
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,540
Shredded uterus

745
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,700
A dog reaching back to gnaw

746
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,340
Chunks of meat from a

747
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:41,340


748
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:41,340


749
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:41,660
Worm's mouth

750
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:41,660


751
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,340
Side

752
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,820
Jesus Christ

753
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,900
Writhing on his nails

754
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,140
As a pig with human hands

755
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,940
And giant insect wings

756
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,020
Thrusting its snout into the wound

757
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,900
On its side

758
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,560
Flies, flies choking the mouths

759
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,920
And noses of children

760
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,560
Dying in a Nazi execution pit

761
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,520
Nazis choking Jews

762
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,900
And Israeli Jews hanging Nazis

763
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,500
A pope in full regalia

764
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,780
A wheelchair

765
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,000
A man's

766
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:15,380
Organ

767
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,780
Growing fantastically oversized

768
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,760
Till it thrust into its owner's mouth

769
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,280
And smashed up into his brain

770
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,180
So that blood squirted from the place

771
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,220
His eyes had occupied

772
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,060
An old woman shaking in a nest

773
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,860
Of rattlesnakes and scorpions

774
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,560
Her wheelchair changing shape

775
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,660
To become a pair of steel-spoke jaws

776
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:35,860
Clamping her down

777
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,080
Another sweet-faced old woman

778
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,200
Feeding on a pretty little girl's

779
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:41,740
Throat

780
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,440
A man with a cactus for a member

781
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,240
Thrusting it into a delicate

782
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,620
Victorian lady

783
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,260
A child's head lopped

784
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,320
With a single stroke of a mallet

785
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,800
The head spinning away to change shape

786
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,820
Becoming rubbery

787
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,720
Bloating, bursting open in the air

788
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,340
To erupt a furious

789
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,600
Swarm of blood-sticky bees

790
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,800
Leering demonic faces

791
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,100
Vomiting happily

792
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,200
Eyes wide with pleasure

793
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,760
As bits of maggoty flesh

794
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,800
Gushed over their horny lips

795
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,920
A lamprey

796
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,920
Engorging on Marilyn Monroe's

797
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,380
Ripe bosom as her skirt blows up

798
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,400
The bills flow down

799
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,560
From her to become the wings

800
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,060
Of vampiric moths

801
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
Which descend in a cloud

802
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,540
On the singer Madonna

803
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,640
Sucking her into a

804
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,580
Draggled bag of wizened flesh

805
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,080
The flesh falls away

806
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,540
From her skeleton which embraces

807
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,560
The fat lady, compressing her

808
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,900
Corpulence so tightly her skin rips

809
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,660
And her suet-lumpy yellow fat

810
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,060
Squeezes out between the dead white bones

811
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,740
Like dough, flows like human lava

812
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,220
Into a hardening shape

813
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:53,920
Of a soldier

814
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,860
Thrusting a bayonet into the belly

815
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,020
Of a soldier who thrusts another bayonet

816
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,080
Back into the first

817
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,160
Both thrusting in, out, in, out

818
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,520
Each thrusting wildly in each other

819
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,500
But showing no pain

820
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Their faces imbecilically happy

821
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,840
Until they reach some kind of climax

822
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,380
Where they explode into fragments

823
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,700
Which twist and reform

824
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,540
Into children burning

825
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,060
With napalm running down a road

826
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,620
Sizzling and screaming and becoming

827
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,840
A group of Nicaraguan children hit by

828
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,000
The anti-personnel shells fired by the Contras

829
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,980
The children torn limb from limb

830
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,040
By the flechettes and tiny razors

831
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,640
So that their blood runs down an invisible screen

832
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,260
And paints itself into the shape

833
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,080
Of a man stepping into his children's bedroom

834
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,040
With a shotgun

835
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,100
Blowing heads and headlines

836
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,240
Off into the air

837
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,180
And that was from John Shirley's book

838
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,900
In Darkness Waiting

839
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,080
Well, have I got your interest up?

840
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,340
Peaked your interest a bit maybe?

841
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,320
Maybe some of you want to know

842
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,340
What this John Shirley guy is really all about

843
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,660
Well, they're cheap books

844
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,800
I mean, I don't mind recommending

845
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,820
This high quality book

846
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:10,820


847
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:10,820


848
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:10,820


849
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,340
This high quality book

850
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:11,340


851
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:11,340


852
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,880
Is high cultural literature to

853
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,140
All of you who might have

854
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,160
Some interest

855
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,240
And here's one last song from him

856
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,420
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

857
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,820
Which I guess

858
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,680
Sort of fits

859
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,520
At this point

860
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,680
He's one off the же

861
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,020
Super

862
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,740
Growing there, I got to wash my hands, wash my hands again.

863
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:20,160
I better rub deep and hard, they could be hiding in the pores.

864
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,780
Like men in foxholes, cowering in wars.

865
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,520
I'll never, I'll never get clean.

866
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,420
I wish I had a sponge with barbed wire.

867
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,980
Maybe then I could get myself clean.

868
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,300
I can't get myself clean, I can't get myself clean.

869
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,460
I, I can't, I can't get myself clean.

870
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,320
I can't, I can't, I can't get myself clean.

871
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,160
I can't, I can't, I can't get myself clean.

872
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,020
I can't, I can't, I I can't get myself clean.

873
00:52:51,220 --> 00:53:04,640
OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD! OCD!

874
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,620
The whole bloody world is obscene.

875
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,820
Wash my hands again

876
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Till my, till my fingerprints are gone

877
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,980
Something dirty crawling on me

878
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,740
Were all of us originally wrong

879
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,820
Till my fingerprints are gone

880
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,580
Were all of us originally wrong

881
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,560
Till my fingerprints are gone

882
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,420
Were all of us originally wrong

883
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,360
Just being alive's the original sin

884
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,140
Just being alive's the original sin

885
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:41,120
Just stepping outdoors is giving in

886
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,100
Stepping outdoors is giving in

887
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,040
Being alive is the original sin

888
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,020
Stepping outdoors is giving in

889
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,880
Being alive is the original sin

890
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,840
Stepping outdoors is giving in

891
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,660
OCD

892
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,540
OCD

893
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,360
OCD

894
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,540
It can't happen to me

895
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,280
It can't happen to me

896
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,460
Better check the locks

897
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,440
Are you sure they're closed?

898
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,700
Must stuff the window cracks

899
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,740
With all my filthy clothes

900
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,000
OCD

901
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:11,960
OCD

902
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,820
OCD

903
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,720
OCD

904

OCD

905

OCD

906

OCD

907
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,180
OCD

908
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,440
Being alive is the original sin

909
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,340
Stepping outdoors is giving in

910
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,440
Drive, drive, drive the nail in

911
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,380
Drive, drive, drive the nail in

912
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:33,100
OCD

913
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,020
OCD

OCD

916
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,200
Hit the walls with bare knuckles

917
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,960
Tighter, always tighten that buckle

918
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,740
Tighter, always tighten that buckle

919
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,720
Go over the rug with a fine-tooth comb

920
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,400
Go over the rug with a fine-tooth comb

921
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,640
Check the wall cracks in my home

922
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:52,800
Check the wall cracks in my home

923
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,240
OCD

924
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,220
OCD

925
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,180
OCD

926
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:00,740
OCD

927
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,040
I don't know if I can stop

928
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,940
I don't think

929
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,940
Then I can start

930
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:09,700
OCD

931
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,580
OCD

932
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,860
Stop it for me

933
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,780
Stop it for me

934
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,720
Stop it for me

935
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,660
Here's a gun, stop it for me

936
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,620
Take this gun, stop it for me

937
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,480
Someone please stop it for me

938
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,160
OCD

939
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,560
OCD

940
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:27,520
OCD

941
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,340
OCD

942
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:29,980
OCD

943
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:36,460
OCD

944
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,040
OCD

945
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,040


946
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,040


947
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,040


948
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,360
Mr. Smith, it is not at this time treatable

949
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,200
However, sometime in the near future

950
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,000
We hope to have a treatment

951
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,880
We hope to have a treatment

952
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,780
We hope to have a treatment

953
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,680
Maybe hope to have a treatment

954
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,620
Maybe this gun

955
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,700
Maybe this gun

956
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,440
OCD

957
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,340
OCD

958
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:14,500
OCD, OCD, OCD, just being alive, just being alive is the original sin.

959
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:22,220
And just stepping outdoors is giving in.

960
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,340
Well, it can't happen to me.

961
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,040
Well, it couldn't, couldn't happen to me.

962
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,060
No, it couldn't happen to me.

963
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,200
Couldn't.

964
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,320
OCD couldn't happen to me.

965
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,500
OCD couldn't happen to me.

966
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:49,320
OCD couldn't happen to me.

967
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,160
Well, OCD couldn't happen to me.

968
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,940
But don't you wish it could, friends?

969
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,200
No, yes, it does have to end soon.

970
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,320
This is the...

971
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,820
It's the end, but if you don't want your...

972
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,940
I mean, some of us don't want to be treated, okay?

973
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,320
You know, we don't want the treatment.

974
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,740
And if you want more of the same,

975
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,420
the song that wouldn't die, friends, that's it.

976
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,140
You can write for free information about the Church of the Subgenius,

977
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,720
which has presented this John Shirley special.

978
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:30,940
Just write for free information from Bob at Box 140306.

979
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,360
Ah, you didn't have a pencil ready, did you?

980
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm going to say that again now that you do have one.

981
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:45,840
Write to Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

982
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,920
And just say, Bob, I've got OCD, and I want more.

983
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,920
And he'll bring it to you.

984
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:00,480
By the way, make a quick little announcement here.

985
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:09,340
You know, a couple of years ago, I worked for six months on a film called China Run,

986
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,620
and it's showing this Thursday night on Cinemax.

987
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:17,640
It's the only time I know of it ever being on TV and probably never will be again.

988
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,440
But China Run, Thursday on Cinemax.

989
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,760
Also, at the science fiction convention this weekend,

990
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,800
there will be a Subgenius revival, 9.30.

991
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:38,140
Friday night at the Marriott Hotel, Coit and LBJ.

992
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:44,300
Coit and LBJ, Friday, 9.30, science fiction convention, Subgenius revival.

993
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,020
And I don't know what else.

994
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,260
Maybe worse.

995
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,420
Free to the public.

996
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:54,320
That's why I can mention it.

997
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,640
It's very clean.

998
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,500
Stay tuned.

999
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,240
It's very clean.

1000
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,780
I clean that gun every day.

1001
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,240
Again.

1002
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:06,280
Again.

1003
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,020
Again.

1004
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,900
I clean that gun every day.

1005
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,240
It takes a lot of work and order.

1006
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,360
I oil all the parts.

1007
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,680
I clean that gun every day.

1008
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:16,760
Again.

1009
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,600
Gotta put it somehow like this here.

1010
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:29,260
I clean that gun every day.

1011
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,240
I clean that gun every day.

1012
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,240


1013
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,260
I clean that gun every day.

1014
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:31,320
I clean that gun every day.

1015
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,320


1016
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,320


1017
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,320


1018
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,320


1019
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,320


1020
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,600
guitar solo

1021
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,720
guitar solo

1022
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,340
Waiting around the train station

1023
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,440
Waiting for that train

1024
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,320
To take him

1025
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,260
Take me away

1026
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,560
From this

1027
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,920
Lonesome town

1028
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,320
guitar solo

1029
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,520
A whole lot of people

1030
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,340
Putting in a lot of attention

1031
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,480
And my old lady

1032
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,260
That's putting me down

1033
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,820
guitar solo

1034
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,920
Fear

1035
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,380
Is a part of me

1036
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,000
Gonna be down in my

1037
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,600
Part of me

1038
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,600
In my soul

1039
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,600
Way down in this

1040
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,440
Part of me

1041
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,100
Way down in my heart

1042
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,260
Way down

1043
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,520
In my heart

1044
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,740
guitar solo

1045
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:23,560
Hey hey

1046
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,700
Too bad you don't have

1047
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,740
Any more of the ground

1048
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,680
Guitar solo

1049
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:30,900
Guitar solo

1050
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,780
Too bad you and me

1051
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,860
Had to part

1052
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,100
Yeah

1053
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:36,580
Yeah

1054
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:36,860
Yeah

1055
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,720
Yeah

1056
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,380
In my prayer

1057
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:42,260
To come in

1058
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,800
In my prayer

1059
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,600
To come in
