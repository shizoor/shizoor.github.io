1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,500
Are you a voyeur?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,920
Do you like to watch?

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,580
Uh-huh.

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,040
What's your name?

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,000
Bob.

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:08,880
Hi, Bob.

7
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:09,660
How are you?

8
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,760
How are you going to do with it, Bob?

9
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,440
Tell me.

10
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,500
Tell me how you're going to get my name in your room right now.

11
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,200
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,020
What would you do with it?

13
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,680
Oh!

14
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,340
Baby, if you came in my room right now, I'd want you to put your...

15
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,920
Oh, boy.

16
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh, yeah, Bob.

17
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,160
Uh-huh.

18
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,760
Uh-huh.

19
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,780
Do you think you can find...

20
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,260
Uh-huh.

21
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,900
Uh-huh.

22
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,480
Do you think you can find my sub-G spot, Bob?

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Uh-huh.

24
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,460
Come on, baby.

25
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,560
Find it for me.

26
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,100
Uh-huh.

27
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, Bob.

28
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,380
Oh, yeah.

29
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,640
Uh-huh.

30
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,240
Uh-huh.

31
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,560
Uh-huh.

32
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,540
Four, three, two, one, go!

33
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:55,120
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slang, sponsored by the Church of

34
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,820
All of the Sub-Demons.

35
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,400
Oh!

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000


37
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:00,700


38
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,200
Oh!

39
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,200
Oh!

40
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,420
Oh!

41
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:02,420


42
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh!

43
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,940
Oh!

44
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:02,960
Oh!

45
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,140
Oh!

46
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


47
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


48
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


49
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


50
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


51
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


52
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


53
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


54
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


55
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


56
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


57
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


58
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


59
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


60
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


61
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


62
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


63
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


64
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


65
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


66
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


67
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


68
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


69
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


70
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


71
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


72
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,140


73
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,540
Well, now, you keep talking about this Bob

74
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:18,700
And yet, I've never heard, you sent me several of the books and the tapes and stuff over the years.

75
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,740
I've never actually heard Bob's voice.

76
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,600
I've never seen a photograph of him.

77
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,120
Well, you've seen plenty of photographs of him.

78
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,840
You pick up any old Better Homes and Gardens, Popular Science.

79
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,880
From the 50s and early 60s, Bob modeled for ads.

80
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,960
He's that guy with the pipe.

81
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:46,240
The grinning, sort of a Ward Cleaver-ish, Dick Van Dyke-looking fellow with this sort of slightly crazed grin.

82
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,580
And he's got a pipe.

83
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:54,100
You may have seen pictures of him spray-painted on bridge abutments and dumpsters and so forth.

84
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,020
Let me quote it.

85
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,260
I created light and created darkness, created goodness and created evil.

86
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,200
I, the Lord God, do all these things.

87
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,160
God is the source of evil and he admits it.

88
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,220
What's the burr under your saddle?

89
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,900
That's like if you hit your hand while you're nailing a hammer and close your penis in the door of a car.

90
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,660
Or like the channel changer maybe takes off and it's weird crap, man.

91
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,560
That's what it is, Captain Whiz Boy.

92
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,220
It's weird.

93
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,860
Did I disconnect the wrong person?

94
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,900
I don't know if that was.

95
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,740
It was a person, was it?

96
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,200
No, it probably wasn't.

97
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,460
Another one of those discarnate voices from The Void.

98
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,440
I don't know what I'm doing.

99
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,220
Speaking of The Void, how's your show?

100
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,680
I don't care.

101
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,740
He wants to go home.

102
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,020
I don't care.

103
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,900
He didn't want to come in.

104
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,160
I don't care.

105
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,100
What are you, all caught up with hours of slack?

106
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,840
You don't need anything?

107
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,580
I'm copying an old rerun of us being funny years and years ago back when we were funny.

108
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,660
Back when we were funny.

109
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,100
Yep.

110
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,960
Now we're just old and want sex.

111
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,860
Sure.

112
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,420
Speak for yourself.

113
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,300
I don't even want that.

114
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,100
I just want to go to bed.

115
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,440
I was talking to you about my plans to think of something absolutely new and revolutionary

116
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,020
which would change the whole face of the world.

117
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,780
The function of the Order of Dionysus Abasios is both the destruction of Christianity based

118
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,340
on the principles of the Satanic Bible as written by Anton Zander-Levay.

119
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,200
Being of teenagers from authoritarian slavery.

120
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,260
Adolescence is only a social invention by nature.

121
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,880
Teenagers actually are adults should be treated as such as puberty is nature's endowment of

122
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,140
adulthood.

123
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,000
And so they should be teenagers should be free to go out with older adults regardless

124
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,260
of how much older to become like a teenager to become one of them again.

125
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,160
Do you remember these?

126
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,220
Mother sits there and looks at the young child.

127
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,160
She says, my dear child, we're going out into the wide world and you're going to meet an awful lot of strange people.

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,380
You must listen to your mother.

129
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,600
Don't contradict her and always remember these words.

130
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,880
Don't take gum.

131
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,740
Don't take candy.

132
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,740
Don't get in strange cars.

133
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,880
Don't talk to strange men.

134
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,660
Keep your legs crossed.

135
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,460
Your panties up and come home from school in a group.

136
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,300
The poor little girl gets in a modern car today.

137
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,960
Even a Nash just for an instance.

138
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,900
Boy, the guy settles the car, pushes the button.

139
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,600
The bitch comes down.

140
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
He gets your head caught in the drink.

141
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,380
You don't even know you had it.

142
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,740
Right.

143
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:32,760
Because trying to prove that there is, you know, that there is or isn't a heaven or hell is like trying to prove that little pink elephants don't exist in another galaxy somewhere.

144
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
We can't prove it.

145
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:41,580
But personally, Satanists do have principles, whereas an anarchist will do just whatever he wants to do with your life.

146
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,620
And being out of control is very unsatanic.

147
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,440
Do you like lying?

148
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,260
Because your name's not Eric and you're the jerk of the day and goodbye.

149
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,280
And oh, no.

150
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,080
Don't tell me.

151
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
They gave me Ron from Seattle.

152
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,260
Bobby, how's my lying, pandering carnival barker of hate and misinformation today?

153
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,380
Excuse me.

154
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,980
Excuse me.

155
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,580
Bob, listen.

156
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,420
Please give me my time.

157
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,260
That's right.

158
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,940
I'm Terry Carr from the voice of the Midlands.

159
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,560
Midlands Radio.

160
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,020
All the way from Leeds, Lancashire.

161
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,180
And tonight we're going to have a very interesting guest.

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,920
He says he's the man who is responsible for, if you've heard of it, I'm sure some of you have, the Church of the Subgenius.

163
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,360
I'm sure you've all heard of the name Bob.

164
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,180
I've seen some of the quotes.

165
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
I've seen some of the graffiti around town lately.

166
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:32,640
And is it a satanic cult or is it just another little hyper kick, a group of crazies on the land looking for some fun?

167
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,120
We'll be back in five minutes after some words and we'll be talking to Reverend Armit Say.

168
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
Praise Bob!

169
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,660
Praise Bob!

170
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,060
You've enjoyed Garrison Keillor's homespun storytelling for decades.

171
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,340
now delight as America's heartland humorist brings to life the most memorable event of the decade,

172
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots.

173
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,460
Old Mrs. Laramie was surprised at the ease with which she was able to waltz out of that electronic store

174
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,280
with the new stereo boombox.

175
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,140
But then the store was owned by the man.

176
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,000
And of course she didn't know how to hook it up,

177
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,500
so she put a call out to the fix-it man, Otis Brown.

178
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,040
And he said to her, he said, Mrs. Laramie, he said,

179
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,660
you got blood all up on the side of this thing.

180
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:36,820
And she remembered just how on her way home she had used that boombox to clock a Korean grocer.

181
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,400
Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots, available on cassette from the Public Radio Catalog.

182
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,180
The L.A. Riots

183
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,720
No matter how many rules you have,

184
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
you're still gonna die.

185
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,460
With missionary zeal,

186
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,040
you spit on the fur coat.

187
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,200
You have to wear the leather jacket.

188
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,000
You eat cheese from a goat.

189
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,960
Lay a march and you ride.

190
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,800
And you throw and you scream.

191
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,420
All you do, everybody, is scratch in a big ugly machine.

192
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,660
Or get the correct.

193
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,300
God tell me what to do.

194
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,700
You got blood all up on the side of this thing.

195
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,560
No matter how many rules you got set,

196
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,400
you're still gonna die.

197
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,940
Love and früher bandicoot.

198
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,600
bass solo

199
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,740
guitar solo

200
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,260
drums only

201
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,160
what it means

202
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:14,840
how harmony

203
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:14,840


204
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,360
how harmony

205
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,300
how harmony

206
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,020
how harmony

207
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,180
How marionette

208
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,180


209
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,180


210
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,100
Let the PC without seal cast the very first stone

211
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,520
But if you live in a gas house, you better leave me alone

212
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,700
Unless you're a duck-eyed hermit, you're probably the problem too, my friend

213
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,860
You've been sucked into the corporate death fence

214
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,440
You owe the Mercedes-Benz, Mr. Correct

215
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,120
Don't tell me what to do

216
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,500
No matter how many moves you got better

217
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,820
Still don't wanna do

218
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,560
Do, do, do, do your thing

219
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,620
Do your thing

220
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,240
Lie in bed

221
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,240


222
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,600
You're a idiot

223
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,660
Bang, wagging puppet

224
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Now you're drunk just like us

225
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,320
But you think you're a mother

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Nothing but a prude

227
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,280
You're afraid of sex and nudity

228
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,420
A vegetarian in Doc Martens

229
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,140
With a game of stupidity

230
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,300
Mr. Correct

231
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,920
Don't tell me what to do

232
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,300
Do that part again

233
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh, Mr. Correct

234
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,580
Don't tell me what to do

235
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,480
No matter how many moves you got better

236
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,100
You're still gonna die too

237
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,840
No matter how many moves you got better

238
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,780
You're still gonna die too

239
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,760
Mr. Correct

240
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,660
Mr. Correct

241
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
I'm talking to you

242
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,540
Mr. Correct

243
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,360
Hey, Mr. Correct

244
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,340
Hey, Mr. Correct

245
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,560
I bet you got your back to work every day

246
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,480
You're living a sick life

247
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,960
You're the power of the house probably

248
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
You're not sure you're a good kid

249
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,420
You're lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying, lying

250
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,440
Hello

251
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,460
Hello, friends, and welcome

252
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,540
The sermon tonight is entitled

253
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,820
What If?

254
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,360
It is called that for good reason

255
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,940
Because you see, everywhere I go across this great nation

256
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,260
Everywhere I tour, every performance I give

257
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,860
Some sincere but misguided Christian

258
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,220
Accompanied me in the parking lot

259
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,760
And barks a curse we've all heard a million times

260
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
For the last 2,000 years

261
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,260
Sinner!

262
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,440
They shriek, eyeballs bulging and bony finger pointing

263
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,400
You may laugh now

264
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,180
But come Judgment Day

265
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,840
What if?

266
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,980
You're wrong!

267
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,280
You're wrong!

268
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,320
You're wrong!

269
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,640
If I had but a dime for every time that thinly veiled threat was hurled towards the subgenius

270
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,620
I'd have more money than all the trial lawyers in California and New York combined

271
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,420
Yet, as mean-spirited as this rhetorical question sounds

272
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,500
It is in fact a legitimate challenge

273
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,500
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

274
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,480
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

275
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,480


276
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,740
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?

277
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,500
Such a premise is difficult for subgenius to contemplate

278
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,320
Such a premise is difficult for subgenius to contemplate

279
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,400
Because one of the cornerstones of good salesmanship

280
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,780
Is confidence in the product

281
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,100
We will succeed because we know we will succeed

282
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy

283
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,140
To even question the outcome is not only defeatist

284
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,040
And anti-Dobbsian

285
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,500
It is the subgenius sacrilege!

286
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:19,400
It is the subgenius sacrilege!

287
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,880
And yet, in the interest of open theological debate

288
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,000
We will consider just this once

289
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,480
The question of what if we're wrong

290
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,340
Now theoretically speaking

291
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,320
Not that it is statistically probable

292
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,360
But hypothetically imagine if you can

293
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,260
A world come July 5th, 1998

294
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,540
Where there is no excess invasion

295
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,740
Where there is no excess invasion

296
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,460
Oh, it's painful!

297
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,380
It's painful, dear friends, I understand

298
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,120
But remember, this is only theoretical

299
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,020
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft

300
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
A globe not littered

301
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,460
A globe not completely polluted

302
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,600
With the corpses of conspiracy dupes

303
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,360
Oh dear friends

304
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,320
It would be a sick society

305
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,140
Still dominated by paints and normals

306
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,660
An earth where corporations, governments and well-equipped armies

307
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,820
Still loyal to the system

308
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,060
Continue to uphold the status quo

309
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,400
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarian grasp

310
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,980
On the very throat of freedom

311
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,880
Oh, it's a nightmarish vision indeed

312
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,060
One that makes my head spin

313
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,400
But one we will contemplate nonetheless

314
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,040
In the interest of free and open debate

315
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Yes, dear friends

316
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,520
This dark future of Dobbsian defeat

317
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,200
And conspiracy conquest

318
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,720
This desperate future

319
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,300
Where the last subgenius forces are holed up

320
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,580
In the underground bunkers

321
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,340
Awaiting the final onslaught

322
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,000
By conspiracy mercenaries

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,480
Is a vision we do not want to contemplate

324
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,040
But we'll this one last time

325
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,020
As the Kelvin bombs explode

326
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,180
Far above on a planetary surface

327
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,300
Stay and use subgenius gemmels

328
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Huddled beneath a flickering light bulb

329
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,460
Pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels

330
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,720
Subway tunnels and underground sewers

331
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,240
Examining any and all possible attack routes

332
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,400
They will be determined

333
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,860
Determined to fight to death

334
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,640
And take the maximum number of normals with them

335
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,180
Why?

336
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,240
Because we hate you!

337
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,620
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob

338
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,740
Through a dignified Dobbsian death

339
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,740
It is even

340
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,260
It is then

341
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,620
That some weak of heart heretic will step forward

342
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,740
For probably some Bobby

343
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,160
Who always dreamed of being a real subgenius warrior for wartime

344
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,700
But when the chips are down for Dobbs

345
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,900
Wants to cash out

346
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,280
This weak-willed wannabe Bobby

347
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,040
Will show his first real courage

348
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,780
When he steps forward and whines

349
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,480
The Reverend's staying

350
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,220
You promised we'd have something to show

351
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,200
For our membership fee

352
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,960
The bunker will fall silent

353
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,160
Like a tomb!

354
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,380
The collected gas

355
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,740
Will cause the barometric pressure to plummet

356
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,080
The bobbing above will pause in divine reverence

357
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,980
Stain will slowly turn to the trembling traitor

358
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,260
Glare into his frightened little face

359
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,880
And with the thunder of Daniel Webster

360
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,680
Will proclaim the same answer

361
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,620
I gave the Christian in the parking lot

362
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,020
And that is this

363
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,840
Even in hell

364
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
We'll have the one thing

365
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,920
The conspiracy tried to deny from us

366
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,700
All our living lives

367
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,100
The one human right

368
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,300
They'll never be able to take from us again

369
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,660
No matter how much they lie about what we did

370
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,940
Or what they didn't do

371
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,700
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain

372
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,600
No matter how much they beg

373
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,080
Pray or grovel to their God

374
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,740
I'm talking about respect!

375
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,000
Self-respect!

376
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,880
The only commodity that can't be bought

377
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,160
Traded, negotiated, or stolen

378
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
In any of the conspiracy marketplaces

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,580
Appreciate!

380
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,420
Hallelujah!

381
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,700
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals

382
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,840
Who serve the system

383
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,120
They may have stolen our freedom

384
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,620
Our slack and even our lives

385
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,240
But by virtue of our very defiance to them and their ways

386
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,200
We've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want

387
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,180
And you want to know why?

388
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,320
Why?

389
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,520
Because their religion is based on submission

390
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,980
While ours is based on independence

391
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,480
Yes!

392
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,180
Praise God!

393
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,320
Give me a praise, Bob!

394
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,760
Praise God!

395
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,580
So that, dear friends, is our answer

396
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,200
That's what we get even if we're wrong

397
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,740
Come Judgment Day

398
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,040
The honor and dignity of self-respect earned

399
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,140
Through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom

400
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,740
Only the devil could possibly resent a man

401
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,240
For wanting to be free

402
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,420
Any God that wouldn't want his followers to be free

403
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,440
Is no savior but a tyrant

404
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,860
An enslaver of souls

405
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,040
A devil in disguise

406
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,100
And that leads me to my question

407
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,180
To the Christian

408
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,800
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it

409
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,600
What if

410
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,180
What if you're wrong?

411
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,440
Come Judgment Day!

412
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,780
Praise God!

413
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:08,780


414
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,060
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friend

415
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,000
Because remember

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,440
Your very soul dangles in the balance

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,560
Come and it's the word of our praise, Bob!

418
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,020
Amen!

419
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,040
Praise God!

420
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,280
Praise Father Joe Mama!

421
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,260
Oh yes, dear friends

422
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,160
Praise Father Joe Mama

423
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,540
A beautiful, beautiful sermon there

424
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,280
From the Pittsburgh Revival

425
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,260
A couple of weeks ago

426
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,540
Yes, and what else do we have there?

427
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,740
Oh, Mojo Nixon's song, Mr. Correct

428
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,200
From his new album, Whereabouts Unknown

429
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,780
We heard Garrison Keillor's L.A. Riots

430
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,840
From the Not For Broadcast album by The Onion

431
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,700
And a little bit of Bleepo Abernathy

432
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave

433
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,300
Trying to introduce the church

434
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,260
In his first with distracting media briefings

435
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,840
And a little bit of garage material

436
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,880
From Reverend Nick Nolan

437
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,000
And of course, Bob Larson

438
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,960
But you know what, friends

439
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,940
What Father Joe Mama was saying

440
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,420
About that one side of the conspiracy

441
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,140
It makes you wonder

442
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,480
It makes you wonder which side of the conspiracy is running things

443
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,160
I started getting paranoid about

444
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,340
Well, uh

445
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,240
The Masons, let's say

446
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,260
Let's just say

447
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,920
For all I know

448
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,180
I'm really worried about the Illuminati

449
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,940
But, uh

450
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,780
You know, it started with that

451
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,200
America Online logo

452
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,780
Which is a triangle with a circle in the middle of it

453
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,500
Looks just like the old eye in the pyramid

454
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,520
Or the eye above the pyramid

455
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,500
You know, and uh

456
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,400
I mentioned that to my friend Emot

457
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,240
And Emot said, oh, that's just the beginning of it

458
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,640
Haven't you noticed those, uh

459
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,060
Triangles in the eyeballs?

460
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,640
Ball shapes are just everywhere

461
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,180
And in fact, they've even gotten quite obvious about

462
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,940
The names of these businesses

463
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,160
You guys ever notice the red arches

464
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,060
That form a big M of the Sonic hamburgers?

465
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,840
Get it? Sonic?

466
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Masonic?

467
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,000
I think I'll have Masonic Burger now

468
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,940
Or, he goes, did you know that Philip Morris cigarettes

469
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,400
And General Foods were both owned by this gigantic conglomerate

470
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,740
Kraft Foods?

471
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,460
Kraft?

472
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,500
The, as in, the Kraft?

473
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,820
Yes, friends

474
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,460
And not to mention when they replaced that Popeyes

475
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,640
Place next door with Church's fried chicken

476
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,400
Uh huh

477
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,520
But it doesn't stop there

478
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,420
If you look around

479
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,180
Next time you drive through town, friend

480
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,100
Just keep your eyeballs open

481
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,720
You may see things you didn't want to see

482
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,680
Buildings one after another that look like

483
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,040
Well, like the Temple of Scythe

484
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,340
Or the Temple of Solomon

485
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,120
If it's not the arches

486
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,020
It's that Temple of Solomon shape

487
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,920
That you see etched onto Masonic aprons and symbols

488
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,440
My old supermarket nearby here

489
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,680
Menards, I believe he pointed out

490
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,580
Looks just like that

491
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,640
All of the Sam Walton stores

492
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,900
Walmart, Sam's, Hypermart

493
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,120
They're in the grand Masonic design, my friends

494
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,380
Computer places

495
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,920
Computer City, Discovery Zone

496
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,180
The Best Buy stores

497
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,960
All subtle Masonic symbols

498
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,600
And go buy your local water pumping station

499
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,100
The gas company

500
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,480
The gas company in most small towns

501
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,660
Is in the same building as a Masonic lodge, my friends

502
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,480
The electric company

503
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,920
They all, all of them, my friends

504
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,120
Are part of one conspiracy or another

505
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,060
You know, but what do they

506
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,200
You try to talk about things like this and

507
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,420
They call you

508
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,220
Well, the polite term

509
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,540
Conspiracy researchers

510
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Or conspiracy buffs

511
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,680
Or conspiracy nuts

512
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,660
Or conspiracy kooks

513
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,200
Or conspiracy crackpots, my friends

514
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,300
Those are the real polite terms for

515
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,060
The folks who attempt merely to lift the veils

516
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,440
Peer under the rocks

517
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,300
And pry into the business of the authorities

518
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,980
So called

519
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,180
What I want to know is for you guys

520
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,860
My friends, how come the conspiracy researchers

521
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,640
Get worse pressed than some of the conspiracy perpetrators

522
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,120
Heh, it must be a conspiracy

523
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,660
And you know, I can wax as sarcastic

524
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,340
As the next guy about some conspiracy theories

525
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,260
I like to think I'm skeptical to the bone

526
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,520
But I actually do believe a large percentage

527
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,060
Of those conspiracy theories

528
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,460
And worse still, I believe in the conspiracy

529
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,760
Yes, the plot

530
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,480
By ordinary, normal, everyday people

531
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,880
To label conspiracy researchers as loonies

532
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,600
Or as part of a conspiracy

533
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,480
Now, contrary to unpopular, bending friends

534
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,720
It's still possible to use mass media

535
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,080
To expose mass media conspiracies

536
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,300
But you have to couch your expose carefully

537
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,020
You have to make it look like a satire

538
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,280
Or a comic book

539
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,700
Or a radio show

540
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,400
Like this one

541
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,140
Which is pieced together from the dead parts of history books

542
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,120
And of course some conspiracy theories are just that

543
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,920
They're just theories

544
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,480
Improbable, paranoid

545
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,580
Predicated on a few facts

546
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,840
Like the one about the masons creating the grains

547
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,660
They've obviously got it backwards

548
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,980
Others are founded on pure coincidence

549
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,060
And these, I would consider kooky, wouldn't you?

550
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,680
And you know, one man's apparently

551
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,240
Paranoid lunatic as the next man's dedicated researcher

552
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,160
And, uh, you know, the problem is the domino effect, though

553
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,960
There's those who see conspiracies everywhere

554
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,060
Literally everywhere

555
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,640
The crazy old bircher lady who feels commies under her bed

556
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,060
Is just a stereotype

557
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,460
Nor is the religious nut who sees Satanists everywhere

558
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,560
Nor the UFO cultist who mistakes something

559
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,640
That could be cured with Prozac

560
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,760
For messages from the Space Brothers

561
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,840
But you know, there might be something to some of it

562
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,780
And once you're fairly sure of one conspiracy theory

563
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,680
Start to tie into neighboring conspiracy theories

564
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,640
And pretty soon you'll believe in quite a few conspiracy theories

565
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,180
And you'll start to sound like one of those nuts

566
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,520
Unless you're selective about who you tell it to

567
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:02,440
And that's one of the things that inclines you towards the conspiracy view of history

568
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,440
It's the way the more trusting people around you respond to the very idea

569
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,940
And you know, try discussing the CIA's more heinous misdeeds in polite society

570
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
People edge away

571
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:23,140
They just can't allow themselves to believe that men whose portraits still hang in city halls and corporate headquarters

572
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,500
Were in fact in the middle of the world!

573
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,860
And they're not a game more of monsters and eager collaborators with Nazis!

574
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:34,620
Cause that would imply that that smiling, rosy-cheeked, glad-handed politician they just voted for

575
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,060
Might be involved in something worse

576
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,940
Paranoia has a bad rep these days

577
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,860
But as the ancient saw goes

578
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,060
It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you

579
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,580
And they are!

580
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,060
People should be a lot more paranoid

581
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:53,980
And a lot of so-called normal people are!

582
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,500
And a lot of so-called normal people are!

583
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,120
Oh, they're in fact as paranoid as you can get.

584
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,540
They're just paranoid about the wrong things.

585
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,960
Since the FBI has no proof for organized satanic ritual murder cults,

586
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,600
the many little Christian fundamentalist conspiracies have invented them.

587
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,240
The same guy who can't believe the Army could ever do anything evil and anti-American

588
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,780
may be convinced that the devil sends heavy metal bands out to corrupt our youth.

589
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,480
He's paranoid about marijuana feeds, but he drives drunk.

590
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,440
He's paranoid about sex and violence on TV,

591
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,860
but thinks everybody should have their own automatic weapon.

592
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,920
He's learned that the media is controlled by liberals

593
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,440
because he listens to right-wing blather all day long on the radio.

594
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,300
Shut up, little man.

595
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Nobody asked you to say anything.

596
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,760
Shut up.

597
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,500
Shut up, little man.

598
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,480
Shut up, little man.

599
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,600
Put the burr under your saddle.

600
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,980
The burr under the saddle is you trying to shut us up and tell us where to hell.

601
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,640
Jesus says, believe in me or to hell with you, and I don't like that.

602
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm getting tired of you guys trying to tell us where to go, what to do.

603
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,380
I'm not telling you where to go and what to do.

604
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,520
God's telling you what to do or where you're going to go if you don't do it.

605
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,540
But you know what?

606
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,060
What?

607
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,200
That's not a choice.

608
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,080
That's coercion.

609
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,320
How do I know I'm not talking to a disembodied alien right now?

610
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,160
Well, if you don't have a clue that you're talking to a human being, then you're pretty stupid.

611
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,160
How do I know?

612
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,060
Prove it to me.

613
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,200
You can't prove it to me, can you, Bill?

614
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,060
See, ha, ha, ha.

615
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,160
You can't prove it to me, Bill.

616
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,760
You can't prove it to me.

617
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,100
Bill, Bill.

618
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,140
Empirically, you cannot prove it to me beyond any doubt.

619
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,280
To anybody that you've ever talked to, Bob, how do you know you've talked to anybody?

620
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,580
You're just living in a fantasy world behind a microphone.

621
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,360
Prove you've talked to anybody, including me, Bill.

622
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,340
Because there's repetition.

623
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,360
Because.

624
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,900
Because, my friend, I'm a human.

625
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,780
I have a human voice.

626
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,540
That's how you know.

627
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,440
Odds are you're talking to a bill.

628
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,460
Get real.

629
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,060
Just because you have a voice doesn't mean you have a brain.

630
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,240
Correct.

631
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,840
I would be more of what I would call a cubophilic Satanist as opposed to a pedophile.

632
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Because everything that he says makes 100% sense and there is little or nothing that he says that you can argue with.

633
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,520
Hole.

634
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,940
Every single kid who says any word you put the perfect word you utter in his mouth has the face you make.

635
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,840
There's a way it starts.

636
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,620
But no one 얘기를 in the face with any of the best High School students.

637
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:39,620


638
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,200
Imagine being actually the co- DIY person if you hear your way through the wife speaking from the car.

639
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,560
As American.

640
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,600
Students saying, is this the free life?

641
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:47,600


642
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:47,640
Yeah, that's right.

643
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:47,940
רים please put your ass in there.

644
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:47,940


645
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:47,940


646
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,280
I'm afraid she's ever been here.

647
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,780
Well, fuck and take care of this thing.

648
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,420
The.

649
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,760
Icon and fire.

650
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:51,740
The dis.

651
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,100
He's heard and heard so long

652
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,420
Cause Toby has to have a girl to call his own

653
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,020
I must have a girl to call my own

654
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,260
For I am Toby, son of Goom

655
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,460
You pitiful, doving-legged earth fools

656
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,440
Milling about in your cage of only three dimensions

657
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,080
Toby, go find me a nymph

658
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,860
You don't know what real love is

659
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,960
Maynard, bring me a woman

660
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,240
Bring me a bongo, bongo baby

661
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,440
Give me a fury

662
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,760
A hundred of little furies

663
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,860
I want more

664
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,060
Bring me harpies with chests of steel

665
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,180
And bring me the furies themselves

666
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,580
I want Medusa

667
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,660
Yes, I will make love to Medusa

668
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,600
Let her turn me to stone

669
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
I could be no stonier of heart

670
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,140
Than I am already

671
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,560
If only the fools would leave me in peace

672
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,140
To complete my experiments

673
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,020
They want to know who I am and what I am

674
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,880
Well, I'll show them

675
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,260
I'll show them all

676
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

677
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

678
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,260
Oh, it's here in this dark cave on the Aegean Sea

679
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,860
Where lights have been seen for scores and scores of years

680
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,360
Fishermen have noticed lights in this cave

681
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,200
For a period of five weeks at a time

682
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
During the summer solstice season

683
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,840
And after that time, the lights appear to

684
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,320
These crop circles, or frock circles as they're called

685
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,280
Originally appeared in wheat fields in England

686
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,360
And Ireland

687
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,420
Ireland?

688
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:49,420


689
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,040
Scotland

690
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,700
Lately, they've been appearing as concrete circles

691
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,440
In the center of New York City in Chicago

692
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,320
Decorated with the bodies of mutilated cats

693
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,040
Mysteriously mutilated cats

694
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
What could this mean?

695
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,240
There are no secrets in the Church of the Subgenius

696
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,320
And I will not be endangering myself or my family in any way

697
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,100
Despite rumors to the contrary

698
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,400
Because you, dear listener

699
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,880
Will probably not believe a word of it

700
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,920
It's all just more quaint fiction to you

701
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,940
Just a lark, a joke

702
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

703
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,780
Well, if the frock circles and the smoke from Bob's pipe

704
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,060
Are just a joke

705
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,340
Then what is your life?

706
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,580
Your very life, my friend

707
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

708
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
Where to begin? Where to begin?

709
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,180
There are so many impossible stories and bizarre events associated with the church

710
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,080
that it is hard to choose where to start.

711
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,860
This is like the Lucians in the Hollow Earth.

712
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,900
It's like the matches.

713
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,180
It's weird matches.

714
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,060
I mean, these people from the...

715
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,960
To set the tone, let me tell you what I've seen with my own eyes

716
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,680
while visiting Palmer Vreedys.

717
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,060
Vreedys, actually the artist Hal Robbins, a.k.a. Dr. Hal,

718
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,820
in his San Francisco apartment in 1993.

719
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,460
Well, I...

720
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,340
Lies and Vreedys began an apparently innocent brag fight,

721
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,980
each proclaiming their abilities in the most outrageous terms.

722
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,460
But after a quarter hour without significant gain,

723
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,660
Vreedys began...

724
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,720
Vreedys became agitated and suddenly swept lamp and telephone from an end table.

725
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,280
He then seemingly lifted the table into the air without touching it.

726
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,840
It shot out the window and crashed onto the sidewalk two floors below where it burst into flame.

727
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,320
Vreedys changed the subject immediately and the event was never spoken of again.

728
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,400
Having set the tone with that story,

729
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,560
I can pretty much...

730
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,700
say anything I want to and be assured that no listener will believe a word of it.

731
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,720
On the same visit, I took a trip into the desert with D. Woodman Atwell of puzzling evidence.

732
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,280
A harrowing experience all around,

733
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:37,700
for I saw him apparently drive his truck through a concrete wall without damage of any kind to anything.

734
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,340
I was then shown a series of missile silos

735
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,860
from which shone beams of bluish-green light.

736
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,260
For a period of about two hours around midnight.

737
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,360
This is February of 1992.

738
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,320
There were a number of unusual gravitational and magnetic events in the area around this time.

739
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,720
There were also a number of what I took to be very large sandstone rock formations

740
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,980
which appeared to change positions when I wasn't watching.

741
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,100
You

742
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,740
think about it, though, friend,

743
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:26,600
I mean, really, reality, and even its distant relative history, are actually a hell of a lot weirder than any science fiction.

744
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:39,540
If something as far-fetched as Nazis getting paid by the CIA to train Middle Eastern fanatics to fight the commies can be real, and it is,

745
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:46,340
then why not the CIA and aliens conspiracy, huh?

746
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:54,080
I mean, if the CIA conducted mass experiments on the citizenry with LSD, and it did,

747
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:02,980
then why wouldn't it use some covered Christian organization to turn earnest young weirdos into Manchurian candidates

748
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,500
and make them kill anti-establishment rock stars or even presidents,

749
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,520
just to make all earners...

750
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,780
...and all these young weirdos look more insane than the CIA?

751
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,260
It's infuriating.

752
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,840
You know, you can't just uncover a conspiracy and leave it at that.

753
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:27,840
You always have to take into account the deliberate disinformation possibilities.

754
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:35,820
For instance, maybe the feds pay Bob Lazar to talk about crashed saucers on air bases

755
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,500
and souls stealing their gray aliens.

756
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,820
In order to distract researchers from something far worse!

757
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,180
The murkiness level can become literally maddening!

758
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,360
And that just might be the whole idea.

759
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,020
No doubt about it, you can go overboard, friends.

760
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:01,520
Why overboard?

761
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,900
There's those who believe the Holocaust was a hoax and all the rest of us are crackpots.

762
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,660
You know, heck, if you're gonna go that far, you might as well believe that World War II didn't happen

763
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:20,080
and the next logical step is to believe that nothing the press ever reported really happened.

764
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,020
And pretty soon, praise Bob, you've got mountains of proof that you're always right

765
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,140
and everybody else is always wrong!

766
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,840
And of course, naturally, the conspiracies that people tend to believe in are the ones that make them look good

767
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,440
and, uh, absolve them of responsibility.

768
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:37,260
...

769
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,100
...

770
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,520
...

771
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,040
...

772
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,520
...

773
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


774
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


775
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


776
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


777
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


778
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


779
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


780
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


781
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


782
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


783
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


784
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


785
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:39,520


786
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:39,700
...

787
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,900
...

788
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,220
...

789
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,680
...

790
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:44,760
...

791
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:44,760


792
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:44,780
...

793
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:44,780


794
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:44,800
...

795
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


796
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


797
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


798
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


799
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


800
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:44,800


801
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,500
called the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

802
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:57,880
And to this day, thanks to that hoax, thousands of frustrated nasty old rednecks believe that the Jews control the world.

803
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,740
Now, believing that lets them off the hook.

804
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:07,380
The reason for their poverty and misery isn't that they're a bunch of lazy, ignorant, alcoholic po-buckers.

805
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,960
It's the Jews' fault!

806
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,520
Uh, but...

807
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:18,840
By the same token, bitter black people who think that all white people must be out to get them can find plenty of reinforcement in the nation of Islam cult.

808
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:28,240
Inevitably, friends, those who are the most paranoid about a particular conspiracy become a conspiracy themselves.

809
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,400
So where is the balance?

810
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,820
Which conspiracy theories should you believe?

811
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,260
For that matter, which conspiracy should you join?

812
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,120
Well, friends, we're here to tell you about the Church of the Subgenius.

813
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,760
You know, we started a lot of those conspiracies ourselves.

814
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:55,940
You can always come to Bob to find a conspiracy made just for you.

815
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,320
You can write to Bob.

816
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,260
I'm going to give you that free information post office box.

817
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,920
Just say, Bob, send me that free information.

818
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,260
And Bob is at post office box.

819
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,660
One.

820
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,140
Four.

821
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,880
Zero.

822
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:08,500
Three.

823
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,060
Zero.

824
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:09,380
Six.

825
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,940
That's box.

826
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,380
One.

827
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:10,740
Four.

828
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:10,960
Oh.

829
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,180
Three.

830
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:11,320
Oh.

831
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,540
Six.

832
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,980
Dallas, Texas.

833
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,020
Seven.

834
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,760
Five.

835
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,200
Two.

836
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:15,880
One.

837
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,220
Four.

838
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,700
That's right.

839
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,900
Dallas, Texas.

840
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,720
That's where we're at.

841
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:27,020
I remember a time when I thought all that babble about multiple gunmen in Dealey Plaza and the Oswald Doubles and so forth was silly.

842
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,540
And it is getting awfully crowded up there on the grassy knoll.

843
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:36,220
But, you know, as I got more educated about the JFK puzzle, I learned.

844
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,840
I learned a terrible truth.

845
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,580
If you investigate deeply enough, sometimes you become part of the conspiracy.

846
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,920
I'm now a participant in the JFK cover-up.

847
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,820
I know why the Kennedy family had to go along with the Warren Commission.

848
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,500
But if I told, it would jeopardize lives.

849
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Stop laughing.

850
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'll tell you, man.

851
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,900
You start out paranoid about them, and the next thing you know, you're one of them.

852
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,100
And maybe it's an infinite regression.

853
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,960
Maybe there's no escape.

854
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:23,380
Maybe there's no one single truth that everybody should believe in.

855
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,480
Not even Bob.

856
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,600
Maybe everything is a conspiracy.

857
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,820
You know, who knows?

858
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,740
Maybe one of these days we'll find out even that's not so funny after all.

859
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,140
Good thing this is just a comedy show.

860
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,360
Hehehe.

861
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,660
This is nothing compared to the bizarre political and extra-legal connections of the Church of the Subgenius.

862
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,280
Ivan Stang is known to have made trips to England and South America in the past few years to meet with, among others,

863
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,240
high-ranking members of the P2 Masonic Group,

864
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,120
and an organization of which the Priory of Scion and Bilderberger Group are sanitized fictionalizations.

865
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:18,060
Stang and Drummond are known to be 33rd-degree masons, and Stang's position in a control group hinted at as a Texas Mafia is hereditary through his father, an ex-district attorney for General Dallas.

866
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,760
Stang has employed a man named Doug Smith to pose as the real-life person of Ivan Stang.

867
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,600
Stang, however, is his real name, although he now uses the Smith name in his daily affairs.

868
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,200
I have met Smith and can assure you they are two very different people of interest.

869
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,640
They have entirely different capabilities.

870
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:44,440
Smith seems to be a victim of arrested development, and though he is the nicest guy you'd ever want to meet,

871
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,960
Stang is perfectly correct in calling him dumb as Dave.

872
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:59,640
I have never met Drummond, but the stories I've heard are as strange as anything yet.

873
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,840
Relate.

874
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,760
Now, I've seen the real Doug.

875
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,360
I've seen the real Doug.

876
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,180
And he is just...

877
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,720
He's as smooth as buttermilk pie.

878
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,860
He would never do a harmful thing to another human being.

879
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,400
This other man, now, you can see there's a big difference.

880
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,820
Look at his chin right there.

881
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,240
There's a big scar on his chin.

882
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,860
And I don't see how they can get away with that.

883
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,080
I've told all my kids so far that this is it with me.

884
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,220
Boy, I'm just giving up on everything the government ever said ever again.

885
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,340
I just don't believe it.

886
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,560
You see what that hit on Donnie here the other night?

887
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,880
That a man who could actually make a million, make a million, make a million, make a million, make a million.

888
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,380
We all should talk to our survivors and they talk about it.

889
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,660
You're right.

890
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,120
Donnie Jenkins.

891
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,320
I never.

892
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,380
So let's say pour about eight identical glasses of tap water.

893
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:55,600
Send your loving energy selectively into one of them, basically bless the water, eve the room.

894
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,220
They'll switch it glasses on you and then go up to the water's glasses,

895
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,200
with little dowsing rods and you'll find that the one that had been blessed is the one with the

896
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,320
largest energy field not only that but it's also the one that tastes the best it's the story of

897
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:17,380
the lost jewelry of Atlantis not that again well there it is in all its effulgent splendor because

898
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:24,300
we have with us Philo's brother oh yeah it's only in nomenclature that's true but you know I suppose

899
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,220
there are areas there are places where Philo is his brother that's true but it's never brought up

900
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,320
quite that way and so even on his business card it says Philo's brother yeah well and he is known

901
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,040
I don't know what the future is my mom sometimes refers to Philo as my brother though

902
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,880
your brother I just can't believe what he did this time I just have to get to the bottom of it

903
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,040
once and for all and whether a preference for poop dog hats runs in the family actually it's not

904
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,160
she doesn't ever say

905
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,280
you

906
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:01,440
your brother yeah your brother that doesn't make any sense because she doesn't even know my brother

907
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,320

910
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,280

912
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,740

914
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,720

00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720

uh oh

919
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,660
that's what happened to pet parakeet Pete he was hurled out of a speeding taxi in the middle of a busy downtown intersection

920
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,720
then dragged in a phone booth while trying to make a phone call

921
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,500

00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,200

925
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,080

926
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,580
oh my brother

927
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,700
no that's not your line that's the other guy's line he says who's his brother

929
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,800

932
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,260
your heart will bump

933
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,140
uh etc and so forth

934
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,220
uh oh

935
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,440
punch the punch the wrong brain

936
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,880
punch the magic dragon

937
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,380
okay don't be scared and hang up just speak now don't walk don't walk green light speak go through the door

938
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,180
and speaking of dragons I could tell you about

939
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:37,880
and answer the phone

940
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,160
and if you're watching channel 2 you see that we've synced up every single sound effect

941
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,700
caller

942
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,040
hello

943
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,600
hold in

944
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,260
it's a slim lead I know but it might get us somewhere

945
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,280
police are there

946
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,980
just one just you

947
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,040
turn that caller to the cold and damp

948
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,220
there he goes oh Hal just turned him around now he's all cold and damp

949
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,280
that gets him evenly done on all sides so uh state short question please

950
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,800
the phone's busy so so go ahead and talk

951
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,880
you see there's so many different approaches to this question of bind over matter or transcendental reality

952
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:22,020
is when I breathe in I visualize the energy of the universe which is very abundant by the way this is the same kind of energy I think as the tesla technology energy field

953
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:28,540
is it's it's similar to the energy of consciousness or mind over matter it's a very powerful energy

954
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:37,520
so you imagine this energy coming into your belly button as you breathe in as you breathe out you breathe that energy through

955
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:46,000
uh in this case through the tips of my fingers laser like into the spoon and I become at one with the spoon

956
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,920
oh yes friends you too can become at one with the spoon

957
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,420
if you're ready to give your all to Bob or at least a 32 cent stamp

958
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,100
come on go for it man write for the free information

959
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:07,420
here's that number again it's got music by Arnold Mathis in the background okay here it comes

960
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:18,920
just write to Bob my friends at post office box 140306 Dallas Texas 75214

961
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,900
once again that's Bob

962
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:20,900


963
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,380
box 140306 Dallas Texas 75214

964
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:44,420
and as I said this is Arnold Mathis in the background before that before this we heard a little bit of puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell on the KPFA Berkeley subgenius or a non sub anti subgenius show whatever it is

965
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,900
and coming up more and having been more of Einstein's subgenius

966
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,440
and coming up more and having been more of Einstein's secret orchestra

967
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,740
that's ESO radio brought to us from WCSB in Cleveland praise WCSB

968
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:14,460
and oh and praise Reverend Mike Cole for interviewing that satanist Joe Autrich which we've heard little bits of in between we're just scavenging WCSB like crazy

969
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,620
and thanks to Steve Bevilacqua who rescued that on tape and put horrible music with it

970
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:20,880
and thanks to Steve Bevilacqua who rescued that on tape and put horrible music with it

971
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:45,920
oh what's uh who else should I credit oh Nenslow some of the disinformation about the church of the subgenius which I was reading there on with lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz on that ESO show that was written by Nenslow I should definitely give Nenslow credit for that those particular lies about the church of the subgenius

972
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,480
I thought they were very effective lies myself one way or another

973
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,880
I thought they were very effective lies myself one way or another

974
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,460
So, we'll plunge back in.

975
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,040
Thank you.

976
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:09,700
Thank you.

977
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,320
Well?

978
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,780
Well, I just don't know.

979
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,020
I just don't know.

980
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:26,220
I don't know.

981
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:32,920
I wandered into this little spook house restaurant or whatever it was.

982
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,740
They were all having some kind of a party.

983
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:42,600
And then they set fire to the walls and just kept partying away while the place burned down around them.

984
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,540
It was like a vision of hell itself.

985
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:55,140
But people just kept paying money, walking in, slinging drinks at the bar, their clothes on fire.

986
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,860
Instead of just laughing it up, it was as if they didn't feel any of it.

987
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,900
It was kind of a cult.

988
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,260
And in the end, they were all dead.

989
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,000
I stood outside and watched the place burn to the ground.

990
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:16,060
It was like they all acted like this was something they did every night.

991
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,140
You got me.

992
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,400
Don't ask me.

993
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,860
Man, I don't know nothing about it.

994
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:35,840
I'd just as soon stay here working at the quick shop for a buck, 280 an hour.

995
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,500
I ain't going to send my money to that preacher.

996
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
That's just what he wants me to do.

997
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:51,320
I'm supposed to believe in some kind of deliverance by alien space fellers.

998
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,060
And if I believe on Bob,

999
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,140
then I'm going to get to ride them escape flying saucers.

1000
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,000
And I just, I don't buy into that.

1001
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,820
Some of my friends, now some of my friends are believers.

1002
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,840
Some of my friends are believers.

1003
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,060
I'm not trying to put them down.

1004
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,780
But I ain't going to give away all my worldly goods.

1005
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,520
I've already been through.

1006
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,520
I had religion once.

1007
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,380
I was in the Jehovah's Witnesses.

1008
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,860
Had me give my Cadillac away.

1009
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,020
The world was supposed to end on April 23rd.

1010
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,920
We all sat around Hilltop waiting for the end of the world.

1011
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,760
After a while, we got bored waiting.

1012
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,520
We lined off.

1013
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,380
So I ain't going to fall for none of that stuff this time.

1014
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,540
But you know what I heard that was really sad?

1015
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,960
I saw in this newspaper, it said the Loch Ness Monster was dead.

1016
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,080
I seen it right on the cover of that newspaper.

1017
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,200
It's so sad.

1018
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:02,120
It looked like a giant prairie squid or a big oyster with flippers on it and a cute little otter's head.

1019
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:09,660
And she was, did you know it said in there she was over a thousand years old?

1020
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,920
And left a little tiny baby Loch Ness Monster homeless.

1021
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,980
Friends, you don't want to let that little baby Loch Ness Monster go hungry, do you?

1022
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,780
No.

1023
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,200
For in her belly are thousands of...

1024
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:24,960
Spiderlings.

1025
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:36,560
Well, here in the Church of the Subgenius, we offer special food and toys and modeling clay and clothing to those slackless children.

1026
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,300
You know...

1027
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,840
Even cosmetics and toiletries.

1028
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,140
Those kids that you see the pictures of on milk cartons, they're not lost, friends.

1029
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,300
They've just found Bob.

1030
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,320
They are frolicking with the baby Loch Ness Monster now in a special swimming pool...

1031
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,860
at the home for slackless children in Malaysia.

1032
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,440
Oh, there is no secret Neptune agenda.

1033
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,000
Look, Ness is... Ness is dead.

1034
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,000
Ha ha.

1035
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,660
It was all a big hoax.

1036
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,740
Well, we prefer not to go into too much detail at this time about...

1037
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,260
the origins.

1038
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,900
Since our own research is not complete.

1039
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:22,820
But the Church of the Subgenius does seem to have a direct connection with the program known among...

1040
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:26,760
conspiracy nuts as the Neptune Agenda.

1041
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,520
And in fact...

1042
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:28,920
Neptune Agenda.

1043
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:36,160
Yes, the Neptune Agenda, which we can trace the beginnings back to the discovery of sonar in 1915.

1044
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,220
It's a watery, fishy theory of philosophy and conspiracy.

1045
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:51,360
Well, it seems that after the first use of sonar to detect German U-boats in the North Atlantic, unusual and cryptic Morse code messages began to be received...

1046
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,800
by listeners in 1915.

1047
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,820
And in fact, the code was used in many different areas.

1048
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,920
A separate code of a logarithmic nature was created to communicate with what turned out to be aquatic mammals.

1049
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:09,980
I probably shouldn't elaborate further here because some of the things I've picked up about this seem very new-agey.

1050
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:11,580
Nessian.

1051
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,220
Stupid.

1052
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:17,220
Having to do with ley lines and a global network of crystal skulls...

1053
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,300
used as mind control transmitters to direct the actions of...

1054
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,820
technologically advanced, or left-brained, humans.

1055
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,420
I can hear the teller recurrence.

1056
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,120
This is the way I navigate.

1057
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,140
I move my body close to the earth.

1058
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,600
The teller recurrence.

1059
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,680
It will talk the insides of my earth.

1060
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:37,820
Sonar.

1061
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:39,540
Sonar.

1062
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:43,460
You can hear the whales of the briny deep...

1063
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,420
moan out their love songs.

1064
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,940
They can hear me, yes, you can.

1065
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,280
Lonesome cowboy dogs.

1066
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,800
Dave up there on the prairie could hear them whales all the way out in the ocean.

1067
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,020
And he knew he wasn't going to be lonesome for long.

1068
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:09,220
He'd heard from old Bob what fun a giant cetacean, sea-going mammal could be.

1069
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,440
Oh yeah, they're not that different from human beings, really, the way their bodies are set up.

1070
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,280
They're warm-blooded.

1071
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,300
Warm-blooded.

1072
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:17,540
Mmm.

1073
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,280
When you're in the freezing frigid air...

1074
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,340
in the Atlantic Ocean...

1075
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,220
and you got you a...

1076
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:25,720
a kind of...

1077
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,440
romantically inclined she-whale...

1078
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,680
and you're a particular...

1079
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,480
lonely cowboy preacher with a guitar...

1080
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,900
you smell that ambergris floating on the seashore there.

1081
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,580
Oh yeah.

1082
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,340
Oh yeah.

1083
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,460
You'll drop your sheep and your horses and just...

1084
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,760
shuck your chaps and...

1085
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,160
liquid-fired wind-rolls and...

1086
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,380
go swimming right out there.

1087
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:59,280
Oh yeah, lonesome cowboy Dave riding them dolphins all the way out to meet his queen,

1088
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,860
the great blue whale in the center of the North Atlantic.

1089
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,440
Yes.

1090
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,140
Dave Tristed, just as had his mentor Bob.

1091
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:20,740
But unfortunately, whereas Bob was man enough to handle a female blue whale,

1092
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,740
Dave got tangled in the harpoon ropes and was last seen...

1093
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,360
with his wooden leg a-floppin'...

1094
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,800
as she sounded one last time.

1095
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,300
On the Blue Dips with Davy Jones-Logger,

1096
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,000
we've got a thousand-thinning stories of Neptune...

1097
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,080
Yep, Dave's back down there underground,

1098
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,160
underwater,

1099
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,060
underneath the Great Web.

1100
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,400
I can't...

1101
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,580
I can't breathe.

1102
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,720
I feel like I'm suffocating.

1103
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,760
This is not as much fun as it was before.

1104
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,880
I'm like, I'm just gonna relax and just bandage my...

1105
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,900
Sheep.

1106
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,280
He was deep, deep inside the blowhole of the she-whale.

1107
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,280
He thought he was gonna be having some kind of a big, hot date that night.

1108
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,600
And here he was, stuck halfway in the blowhole, halfway out.

1109
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,880
She couldn't...

1110
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,040
She couldn't...

1111
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,040


1112
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,040


1113
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,040


1114
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:20,740
spout.

1115
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,100
And that's about all he could do.

1116
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,720
Oh, baby, Leviathan be thy name!

1117
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,780
I got a wooden leg!

1118
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,420
He was...

1119
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,460
But they later got over their marital differences,

1120
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:38,920
and Dave took up residence inside Mrs. Monstro.

1121
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:46,120
I'll take all the garbage, I will take all the garbage.

1122
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,340
What can I take all the garbage out of?

1123
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:54,400
All he had to do was occasionally empty the garbage out of Mrs. Monstro.

1124
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:04,560
He'd scrape up the old license plates and tin cans and used syringes and so forth

1125
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,240
that washed into her stomach that managed to get through the baleens.

1126
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,600
He'd have to empty that stuff out now and then.

1127
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,980
He was like a parasitic life form inhabiting the body of the she-whale.

1128
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,480
Little mangan's here, little mangan's there, little harpoon cleaning here,

1129
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:22,980
little...

1130
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,060
Oh, it's so shiny!

1131
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,340
The only...

1132
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:33,720
Their only natural enemy was Eskimos and Norwegians who had broken...

1133
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:39,820
and Japanese whaling boats who had broken the international laws against such things.

1134
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,480
Dave was...

1135
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,320
Dave of the whales.

1136
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,160
I'll learn this baby's song, and then I'll record it,

1137
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,240
and make a million...

1138
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:49,900
million dollars!

1139
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:56,480
And Dave thought he was gonna be a big rock and roll star with Cetacean Whale Song Rock.

1140
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,460
See, now, these songs last about a year and a half.

1141
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,160
It takes about two years to compose them.

1142
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,040
I figure if I just shrink it down in a data bank,

1143
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,400
it'll take away all the way down to, like, say, three vibrations for every 25 seconds,

1144
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,140
I could have a perfect three-minute pop rock song.

1145
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,900
Whale, whale, whale, whale, yeah!

1146
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,420
Whale, whale, whale, whale, yeah!

1147
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,980
But unfortunately, the new age composer, Yanni,

1148
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,220
But unfortunately, the new age composer, Yanni,

1149
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:20,220
beat him to it.

1150
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,160
beat him to it.

1151
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,500
And made all the big money.

1152
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:22,800
And made all the big money.

1153
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:27,420
Dave and his wife, the female blue whale, Mrs. Monstro,

1154
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:27,500
Dave and his wife, the female blue whale, Mrs. Monstro,

1155
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,580
were left in the gutter,

1156
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,240
were left in the gutter,

1157
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,560
singing bad country-western songs for...

1158
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:38,720
hoping for spare change from the citizenry and tourists

1159
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,200
who would walk down the boardwalk there.

1160
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:42,500


1161
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,200
Legending for men who never learned to live in the wild.

1162
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:49,200


1163
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,720
Losing out to a whale like that, a man like that,

1164
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,240
there's something wrong with him.

1165
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,540
Well, no actually, like I said the whale is not like it's a different order of animals,

1166
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:11,520
they're mammals, they're not that different from a person,

1167
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:18,720
they have a vestigial sort of hind leg and rather a longer tail than people do,

1168
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:26,720
but you know they breathe air they cry tears they weep tears just like you or i well like you anyway

1169
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,980
and they don't seem to be able to take very good care of their fingernails

1170
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,880
the way is that this fungal growth seems to have traveled all the way

1171
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:46,020
to the base of the spine and this basal area here is completely covered with the fungus

1172
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:51,080
long cow babe don't you know what they're doing to yourself

1173
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,480
prop prop zippy prop
