1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,000
B.D.I.s flexing, flexing, eager to crush out life.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,880
Great teeth gnashing with rage, powerful fingers flashing with hatred.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,680
And now, for the first time on the air,

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,240
The Self-Genius Power of Splash!

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,760
How were we to dislodge him from his perch and bring him back alive?

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,020
That is how the Batiks, the natives, make a complete roof over your head.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,440
Bizarre.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,340
Bizarre.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,700
Bizarre.

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,720
Bizarre.

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,000
Defeated, citation needed, teen actress in a bar stumbling into a car.

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,940
What does it really take to get the sex these days?

13
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,400
Haven't you got enough disillusionment in your life?

14
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,780
We're not showing disrespect to the people on digital spy.

15
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,120
Is this the slow to camera cruise?

16
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,720
In fact, we're tuning in to...

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,060
You've touched up the issue, the throne's on watch for you.

18
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,740
Haven't you got enough disillusionment in your life?

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,400
Some act to drug assaults the law.

20
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,180
It's surely clear what we think.

21
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,820
Opposing views on the rolling news.

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
Now we don't know what to think.

23
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,040
Glossy, medical and the shots.

24
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,580
She knows that Photoshop.

25
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,500
But still to replicate.

26
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,640
The figure and the face.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,520
Is utmost in her mind.

28
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,300
Our viewpoints misaligned.

29
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,200
Is no one willing to make common sense these days?

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,700
Haven't you got enough disillusionment in your life?

31
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,460
Will your children see?

32
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,620
A world that you always visualize.

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,820
Still not showing credence to a bunch of grumpy idiots.

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,220
Solutions to problems that never ever existed.

35
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,940
Haven't you enough disillusionment in your life?

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,000
Haven't you got enough disillusionment in your life?

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,640
In your life.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
In your life.

39
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:33,980
In your life.

40
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:33,980


41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:33,980


42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:33,980


43
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,480
Haven't you got enough disillusionment in your life?

44
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,900
Haven't you seen enough to know that it won't just turn out nice?

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,040
Everywhere you go you see the battle run.

46
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,740
And often you see the battle run.

47
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,740


48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:04:00,660
But here want to show you something else.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,840
Riding in the rink.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,040
NATURAL

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,040


52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,380
The song has been made open to the public in the setting of reality.

53
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,380


54
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,380


55
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,380


56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:16,380


57
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,600
If you матери, everything didn't go as it should, right?

58
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,560
If you want to accept all this.

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:21,640
No matter what.

60
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:32,840
of the Attery Squash at myspace.com slash the attery squash. Like the superhero Hancock, I,

61
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,800
your hero, Reverend Ivan Stang, have been seeking clues to my own past,

62
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:47,880
and Mr. Sistar found this particular one in his netcrack queue, the voices of Bob and Connie Dobbs.

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,780
What about that fellow we saw last month? His reaction was perfect. Ivan, the perfect slave,

64
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,720
desire to work, perfect health, and obeys every command. With half the people on earth in his

65
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,960
condition, we'd have the epitome of civilization. How many would turn out like him? Not enough to

66
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,060
take care of the wild ones. Then you must find out what it is about Ivan that produced the effect.

67
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,480
I've performed every practical test on him.

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,620
His body chemistry is basically the same as the rest.

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,560
Well, you'll have to figure it out.

70
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,240
I don't believe it can be done in short time.

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,860
All right, so what's on your mind, Ragnar?

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,480
No, it's all about preparation X-Day.

73
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,060
All right.

74
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,220
Yeah, because X-Days are coming.

75
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,300
That's right.

76
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,280
Will you be on the saucers, or will you be left below?

77
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,820
Left below.

78
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,040
Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,960
With the rest of the other pinks.

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,500
Who will be?

81
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,620
Ready to fry in a pink hell of your own creation.

82
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh, it's not even like hell. You know, you just work a dead-end job for the rest of your life.

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,500
Mm-hmm, and that's your hell. Your pleasure saucers could also be your pain saucers.

84
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,280
All the slack in the universe will gravitate towards Planet X.

85
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,500
So there's only one difference between being left below and the world as it is today.

86
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,540
Hmm, I don't know.

87
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,880
Some X-Days.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,540
The X's.

89
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,840
The X's actually recreate the Earth and clone everybody.

90
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,400
Hmm.

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:37,280
You see, Mark, you might not realize this, but you're actually a clone of a clone of a clone that goes back many, many generations of cloning.

92
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,860
Fortunately, though, there's no replicative fading.

93
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,420
There's no genetic, you know, dilution there.

94
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,400
Very few errors in the transcription, if any at all.

95
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,360
Sometimes, though, you know, little anomalies do pop up, but it's usually to your benefit.

96
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,740
Usually you'll gain, like, a mutant power or something.

97
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,360
Hmm.

98
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Yeah, everybody must get cloned.

99
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:11,260
Okay, who has an official clock locked to Greenwich Mean Time who's not filming?

100
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,200
Come on, I mean.

101
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,820
It's not fashionably late enough yet.

102
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,340
No, seriously.

103
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Does anybody...

104
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,740
No, but, Matty, don't you have a cell phone?

105
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,080
I have a cell phone.

106
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:20,640
I have a cell phone.

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:20,960
But...

108
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,520
But...

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,060
Again, why are we worried about time?

110
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,880
In four minutes, hours will be meaningless.

111
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,800
What time is it, baby?

112
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,040
Years will mean nothing.

113
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,000
We'll age instantly.

114
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,760
Two minutes.

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,380
Die and be burned up.

116
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,340
Two minutes.

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,020
Two minutes.

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,340
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

119
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,680
It's a time-space warp.

120
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,500
I don't suppose anything.

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,320
It's not something that anybody really does.

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,460
We've seen some strange things tonight.

124
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,800
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.

125
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,020
God only knows where they came from.

126
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,420
The vortex took them.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,720
Just...

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,260
Just took them away.

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,340
I don't know what place they're in.

130
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,460
I don't even know what time they're in.

131
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,480
I don't know what time they're in.

132
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,480


133
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:40,400
Oh yes, and we must remember when we're gathered here for X Day, every god damn 13th time for

134
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,680
me.

135
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,560
Friends, an X, let's face it, is just a cross that's been knocked over.

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,520
Friends, we survived X Day 11 and have brought back to civilization the recordings from that

137
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,160
subgenius religious holiday.

138
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,920
Thanks to Fernand and Andy Lemer and Bob for the titles and future collages.

139
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,420
The Vortex took them, just took them away.

140
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,080
And Dr. Mr. Sister found that excerpt from the day time ended.

141
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,380
This is Hour of Slack number one.

142
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,540
Thank you.

143
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,900
1164 from the Church of the Subgenius.

144
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:29,900
Much of this show was recorded just after X Day 11, July 6th, 2008, on Dr. Sinister's

145
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,280
show, Radio Sinesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

146
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,420
Speaking of insane and obnoxious, anybody have any comments on the death of Jesse Helms?

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:47,360
That was far out overshadowed for us by the death of Larry Harmon, the creator of Bo

148
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Zo.

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,320
Bozo?

150
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,200
Hardly anybody knows who Jesse Helms was, but Larry Harmon, I mean Bozo was...

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
He was Bozo, man.

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,100
He created thousands of other little Bozos like him.

153
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,400
He was a dynasty of clowns, just like you should be, my friend.

154
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,000
You should not call this show.

155
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,020
You should instead drink all the detergent you can, even go for Drano in your veins,

156
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,040
and then dress up like Bozo.

157
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,340
It was ironic that on the...as Larry Harmon lay on his deathbed and died, he was dressed

158
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,340


159
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,340


160
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,340


161
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,340


162
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,820
like a clown.

163
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:17,820


164
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:25,240
There was a movie being shown at X Day, starring the amino acids, that begins with a Bozo party

165
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,360
clown being murdered, so that an amino acid can then do tricks at the children's birthday

166
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,640
party.

167
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,600
Thank you for coming along with me down to the bottom of the deep sea.

168
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,780
Now turn the record over and I'll see you on the other side.

169
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,580
Honk, honk, honk, honk.

170
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Hey, you're the Bozo I am.

171
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,220
Hey, what are you doing in there?

172
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,440
Shh.

173
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,260
You want to blow it for us all.

174
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,320
Oh, I'm not.

175
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,320


176
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,180
I think we're bozo.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
No, you're not going to blow it for me, buddy.

178
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,780
Get the hell out of here.

179
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,280
Hey, what's that stupid guy with a pipe on your head?

180
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,380
Get on out of here, you sub-monster.

181
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
You're no good.

182
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,080
I'm a call on the cops.

183
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,660
The hell?

184
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,140
We tried to kill Jesse Helms by mailing him a subgenius pamphlet years and years ago.

185
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,940
That has often worked.

186
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,920
Inadvertently, sometimes.

187
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,540
It used to be whenever we'd mail a pamphlet to a celebrity, they would die a little while later.

188
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:22,620
We killed Philip K. Dick, L. Ron Hubbard, Stan Winston just recently.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,940
Winston Churchill?

190
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,480
Larry Fine?

191
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Well, no, that was...

192
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Adolf Erstweil?

193
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
And then you sent one to Tim Russert?

194
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,460
Well, that was an accident.

195
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,880
So, yes, friends, we will have to have another big party, I guess, the next day, next year.

196
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,060
Except for the fact that...

197
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,440
Bob's whole lesson of X-Day is that we don't know what day or planet this is.

198
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,300
Could be tomorrow.

199
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,420
Ye never know when the master of the world ends tomorrow.

200
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,640
The world does end tomorrow, and you may die if you don't have that subgenius membership card in your pocket.

201
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,720
And even if you do, you will die.

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,160
But those with the membership card will be resurrected into beautiful new bodies

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,940
aboard the escape sausages of the sex vessel men.

204
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,720
You lied!

205
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,400
You lied to me!

206
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,980
I want my money back!

207
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,040
I want my money back!

208
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,280
Three times!

209
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,360
Newbies.

210
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
Three times my money back!

211
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
The new kids, listen to that.

212
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,600
Salvation!

213
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
Here is the salvation!

214
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,140
Look at this guy.

215
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:32,780
Wait, wait, wait.

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,020
We can't handle you.

217
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,060
Salvation.

218
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,400
Look, you guys have to understand that I've heard these exact same lines since 1996.

219
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,920
Every 7-0-1.

220
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,360
No, no, no.

221
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,980
Somebody's got to do it.

222
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,820
It's a tough job.

223
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,820
You weren't eating your alien jankum.

224
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:58,100
But J.R. Bob Dobbs was the one who said, and it wasn't him that said it, it was Jehovah One,

225
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,580
delivered the message into Bob's head that on July 5th, 1998 at 7am, the world would end.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,080
By these stripes, we know that it is not yet 1998.

227
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,920
And the lesson of X-Day remains that you don't know.

228
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,520
You don't know what year this is.

229
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,300
You don't know what planet this is.

230
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,320
You don't know, like Santa Claus might, whether you've been good or bad.

231
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,300
Are you ready?

232
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,860
A rupture could happen at any second.

233
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,740
And I wish it would in the next 10.

234
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,940
It wasn't that easy, Armin, it wouldn't have.

235
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,880
To another countdown.

236
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,000
So, yeah, that's right.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,940
It's a lesson, sure.

238
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,260
Yeah, an important lesson that everybody should learn.

239
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,000
That you've got to be right with Bob at every moment.

240
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,340
Ready to be ruptured.

241
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,520
Have your membership card in your pocket.

242
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,860
Wow, that meeting was tough.

243
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,180
What are you going to do?

244
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,860
Hoist a couple of brewskis?

245
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,300
Nah, I was just going to go back and try and fondle the old woman.

246
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,720
She's avoiding me for the last three, four months.

247
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,940
I don't know what the hell's wrong.

248
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,780
Could it be my breath?

249
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,360
My eyebrows or the bob pin?

250
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,760
You know, it's your breasts.

251
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,200
But let's go down to Doc Fropp's camp.

252
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,640
And we can hang out and goo and all that stuff.

253
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,540
He's going to do anything about these breasts?

254
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,720
Well, I don't know.

255
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,520
But at least we can get some rest.

256
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,520


257
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,520


258
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,520


259
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,520


260
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,520


261
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,100
I hope we can get some goo.

262
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,600
And so they wandered into the camp of Dr. Fropp and the Goo Goo Breast.

263
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,640
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to kick your fire onto your tent like that.

264
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,180
It's hard to see.

265
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,320
Got any goo?

266
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,780
Come on, man. Could you just get...

267
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,780
He's not here right now.

268
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,800
Look at all these guys waiting to get goo.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,900
Where's Doc Fropp? He must have left.

270
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,960
He's the enabler who keeps you stabler.

271
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,860
He's up at the inflatable pavilion.

272
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,660
Frog watching, I think.

273
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,760
And in a little while, they were all watching the frogs.

274
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
And the frogs are watching Fropp.

275
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:03,520
I was rather horrified to watch the long lost daughter of Dr. Legume, who had just been rediscovered,

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,000
gazing upon her own father's nakedness in the baptism pool.

277
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,520
They didn't do that back in the old days.

278
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,840
Like the daughters of Noah.

279
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes.

280
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,420
They didn't consider the old days.

281
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,120
But, you know, this is like a new paradigm.

282
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,500
These kids today aren't like they used to be.

283
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,420
Demure, quiet.

284
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,120
Now they break coffee tables with ball peen hammers.

285
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,840
For fun.

286
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,520
They take off the clothes at the drop of a hat.

287
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,320
It's gonna kill your grandmother.

288
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,880
Not like this in Budapest. No, no.

289
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,440
It's not even...

290
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,820
Please hurry up and kill your grandmother.

291
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,060
Barbara?

292
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,160
Barbara?

293
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,260
I'm tired of living.

294
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm leaving you this note to let you know that I've gone off to join a strange cult.

295
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,220
If within three weeks you do not hear from me,

296
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,060
I, your former... your husband...

297
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,180
Oh, Jesus Christ, this is taking a long time.

298
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:02,980
What?

299
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,620
Alright.

300
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,140
If you do not hear from me in three or four weeks,

301
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,760
send the preponderance of the rest of the...

302
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,820
Oh, screw it.

303
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm leaving forever.

304
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,920
Barbara, this is Mel.

305
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,720
I just wanted to call you.

306
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,060
Please call me back.

307
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,940
Oh, hell, I'll just tell you.

308
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,780
I'm pregnant.

309
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,320
Hi, Mel.

310
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,980
This is your friend, Tom.

311
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,020
I was wondering where you've been.

312
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,240
I ain't seen you hoisting a few after the meeting

313
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,380
in the last few weeks.

314
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
I was wondering if it was that breast thing I got to take care of.

315
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,720
You know what I mean?

316
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,920
Yeah, this is Ted over at work.

317
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,080
Your friend, the guy with the breasts.

318
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,040
Yeah, you haven't been by.

319
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,220
I haven't been by in the last several months.

320
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,340
Well, we just wanted to...

321
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,520
Oh, hold on, hold on. I'm here. I'm here.

322
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,160
I'm here. I picked up...

323
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,360
Look, it'll never happen again.

324
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,700
You just don't understand.

325
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,240
This X-Day was a lot of pressure.

326
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,220
It's a lot of laughs.

327
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,980
I'll tell everybody when I come in, okay?

328
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,840
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

329
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,020
I'll be ready for the meeting.

330
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,580
Pass out the toast.

331
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,640
Everybody's staring at me.

332
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,560
Except me.

333
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,980
Like the employee who walked in late.

334
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,040
We're on the West Coast.

335
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,560
You should say something important now.

336
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,520
At least you look...

337
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,580
If you drove for...

338
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:23,920
Okay.

339
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,480
Dumbass!

340
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,540
Dumbass!

341
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,120
We're all suckers.

342
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,560
We're all suckers.

343
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,600
I can't eat this.

344
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,940
Look, little Dobbs said communion wipers from last year.

345
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,060
Now that would be a good fuck-em if it...

346
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,540
They can't eat this.

347
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:41,540


348
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,720
They can't take a joke moment.

349
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,000
I think these are...

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
They have a...

351
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,400
Burgot mold seems to be growing on these little pieces of bread.

352
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,640
Ancient...

353
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,820
Yeah, you can pass them out. Pass them around.

354
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
And then people eat them and then they pass out.

355
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,760
If we eat those, will we wake up from our trance and be on the saucers?

356
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,600
It is a little embarrassing for the subgeniuses who tell off their boss on the Friday before X-Day

357
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,020
and then run up all their credit cards, max them out,

358
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,320
and, uh...

359
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,060
Then they have to go back.

360
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,220
You fathead!

361
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,300
Why I oughta...

362
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,360
I don't know how many times that's happened to me.

363
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,160
Well, some of them have to max out their credit cards

364
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,020
just getting to X-Day.

365
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,960
Mm.

366
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,020
Well, most people use cars

367
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,200
or something with wheels.

368
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,100
And then, uh, once they get there and they're stuck,

369
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,660
uh, the brushwood people put them to work.

370
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
To work off their...

371
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:35,860
Debt.

372
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,880
Wagons full of firewood.

373
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,540
So, so back to the...

374
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,680
Basically, we were stuck at brushwood

375
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,820
and somebody came up to us and said,

376
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,080
How'd you like to take garbage out?

377
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,320
And we said, sure.

378
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,580
And, uh...

379
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,400
And then...

380
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,980
You took out the...

381
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,160
Garbage?

382
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,440
Time to take out the garbage.

383
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,280
So that's where all those anonymous and chicken-head people...

384
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,600
Aha!

385
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,620
And so the X's said it was time to take out the trash.

386
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,240
And so they did.

387
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,540
Every single time.

388
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,520
And the last little thing

389
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,520
was to take out the trash.

390
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:24,780
And when they got back,

391
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,180
they were like,

392
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,260
Oh, I'm so sorry.

393
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,260


394
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,260


395
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,260


396
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,320
I'm so sorry.

397
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,320


398
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,340
I'm so sorry.

399
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm so sorry.

400
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,840
I'm so sorry.

401
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm so sorry.

402
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,820
A helpless drunken beer blather from Delaware.

403
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,940
Yes! Yes!

404
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,520
That's right!

405
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,660
Oh!

406
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,400
Attention, subgeniuses.

407
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Oh!

408
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,760
Subgenii!

409
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm one of you!

410
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,060
Can we say subgenii? Is that okay?

411
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,300
No!

412
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,300
You guys are sure new.

413
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,260
I never came here to...

414
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,980
The newbies room.

415
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,980
This is the first X-Day or something.

416
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,380
We got some spring chickens over here.

417
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,100
Spring chicken heads!

418
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,640
And the first X-Day with chicken heads.

419
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,340
The first chicken head was X-Day, actually.

420
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,620
Well, once the X's get here and see the choice of beer,

421
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,340
I'm sure they'll turn around and go right back home.

422
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,040
That's right!

423
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,720
Although, I guess at least it's not Heineken's.

424
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
It is half blue ribbon, goddammit.

425
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,040
Cover the sheep!

426
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,140
Wear me as a lamp!

427
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,340
I'm a lamp!

428
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,460
I will provide quite good coverage for your living room.

429
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:38,460


430
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,300
I will run out of the lighting,

431
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,640
kill if you will,

432
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,280
or entertaining friends.

433
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,240
You're gonna be a charmer!

434
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,420
I am a great planter!

435
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,820
Beast-chips!

436
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,420
Well, granted, I mean, you have to say,

437
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,300
you didn't ask for it, you got it.

438
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,740
Everyone say hi to Chicken Head!

439
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,540
Hi, Chicken Head!

440
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,460
Now, chicken...everybody...

441
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,720
The doctor says they have to wear a helmet!

442
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,780
The doctor says they have to wear a helmet!

443
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,720
They have to wear a helmet!

444
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,440
They have to wear a helmet!

445
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,060
The doctor says so!

446
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,740
Make the chickens give us head!

447
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,200
Well, maybe Pete there has learned something

448
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,980
and came back to tell us who it was amongst us

449
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,020
we had to look out for.

450
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,060
I know who it is!

451
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,800
I know who the monster is!

452
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,460
Who is it, Charlie? Tell us!

453
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,120
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

454
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,220
What are you waiting for?

455
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,280
Come on! I swear I know who it is!

456
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,280
Well, come on, Charlie, come on!

457
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,540
Tell us! It's...

458
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,460
The Spiderman!

459
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,260
Understand the procedure now.

460
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,040
Sit back and watch the pattern.

461
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,380
And this pattern is always the same,

462
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,620
with few variations.

463
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,320
They pick the most dangerous enemy

464
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,540
they can find, and it's

465
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,900
The Self Genius

466
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,540
Power of

467
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,780
SWAT

468
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,940
And I take it this is not unique,

469
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,420
by no means.

470
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,180
Their world is full of Power of

471
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,280
SWAT

472
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,200
And we'll go from one to the other

473
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,520
and destroy their radios.

474
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,480
One to the other.

475
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,540
One to the other.

476
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,920
One to the other.

477
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,460
You know, we tell the people

478
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,140
we always sacrifice the newest people

479
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,480
if the sausage doesn't come out.

480
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,460
You know what?

481
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,460


482
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:30,460


483
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,500
We were never here last year.

484
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,420
I dare you.

485
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,280
You know, um...

486
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,440
Maybe the reason the Spiderman

487
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,240
sausages didn't come is because

488
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,900
they screams

489
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm really sorry.

490
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:41,840


491
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,860
I'm really sorry.

492
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:44,920
Outsiders!

493
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,980
Outsiders!

494
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,040
Outsiders!

495
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,660
Outsiders!

496
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,900
Outsiders!

497
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,160
Outsiders!

498
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,320
Outsiders!

499
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,380
Outsiders!

500
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Those impetuous youths from Chickenhead sure could drink a lot of Pabst Blue Ribbon before 7 a.m.

501
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,560
Someone was drinking bad champagne up there.

502
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,880
Did you see all those beer cans lining the stage?

503
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:28,200
Were those really beer cans, though, or were those perhaps the very aliens we'd been waiting for?

504
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,360
Stout little guys with aluminum plastrons?

505
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,420
I think Stang is on to something. Did you hear him talking?

506
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,580
No, I was on something. I wasn't on to you.

507
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:37,960
Oh, never mind.

508
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,400
Yes, and that's just when that phalanx of bobbies descended, waving their arms wildly,

509
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,620
surrounded Ivan Stang with the same lame jokes.

510
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,420
It caused him to...

511
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,580
to have what we call an incident, and he's under observation now.

512
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,420
It's a pretty dull show, actually.

513
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,900
Well, of course it's a dull show, but it's not a real show, Mr. Stang,

514
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,600
or whatever your real name is. Just hold your hand up this...

515
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,140
How many fingers am I holding up?

516
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,280
Just a moment, Doctor. I'll handle this.

517
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,660
This may seem a dull show to you, Mr. Stang, but there are millions of listeners

518
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,160
to whom this is a very important matter.

519
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,820
To them, this subgenius business that you started is no...

520
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,300
joke, and somebody is going to have to answer to someone one of these days,

521
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,800
and it might as well be today, and it might as well be now, and it might as well be you.

522
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,840
I just... I just meant that it was sort of boring observing that Stang guy.

523
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,400
Oh, oh yeah, right.

524
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,180
Right now.

525
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,920
Real snooze-worthy. Man, it'll put you to sleep.

526
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,400
You should see him when he gets manic, man.

527
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,240
There's like times of the day he's like... totally somnamb, he's just like laying there,

528
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,920
and then he'll just jump up and... he starts smashing his teeth, and he's pulling...

529
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,540
he's trying to pull out his bottom jaw.

530
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,080
All right, all right, it's bad enough when he does it, you know.

531
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,340
Really?

532
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,660
He'll need you to do it, but...

533
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,120
Anyway, the amino acids played, they were great.

534
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,540
They played a really lively set.

535
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,540
Do not attempt to flip the tape when you reach the end of side one.

536
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,400
No matter what you are told by later instructions on the tape, there is no side two.

537
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,100
However, if you do discover one, don't look at it.

538
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,660
Say it's done.

539
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,500
battlefield

540
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,260
You

541
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,180
need to make this a part of a video

542
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,180


543
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,180


544
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,420
Seriously, you despise me.

545
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,660
OMFG

546
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:36,660


547
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,820
Bye Bye!

548
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,160
Thank you.

549
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,900
Thank you.

550
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,980
Thank you.

551
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,560
Thank you.

552
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,720
Thank you.

553
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you.

554
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,620
Thank you.

555
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Thank you.

556
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,080
Thank you.

557
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,020
Thank you.

558
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:47,900
Thank you.

559
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,560
Thank you.

560
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,540
Thank you.

561
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,720
Thank you.

562
00:29:59,360 --> 00:29:59,980
Thank you.

563
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,260
Thank you.

564
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,460
Thank you.

565
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:02,800
Thank you.

566
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,440
Thank you.

567
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,500
Thank you.

568
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:03,540
Thank you.

569
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:03,900
Thank you.

570
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:04,560
Thank you.

571
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:04,680
Thank you.

572
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,460
Stupid politicians.

573
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,660
Oh, yeah?

574
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,540
Well, you won't get away with it.

575
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
We've got some friends waiting for us.

576
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,520
When we don't show up, they're going to follow us out here looking for us,

577
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,040
and they're going to bust up this whole weird place.

578
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,600
Please let us go.

579
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,020
We'll promise never to tell anyone about it.

580
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,780
I'm afraid that's impossible.

581
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,740
And as far as someone discovering this,

582
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,380
that doesn't bother me in the least.

583
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,740
You'll have to excuse me now.

584
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
I have work to do.

585
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,640
Remember what I said.

586
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,420
Behave yourselves, and you won't get hurt.

587
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,880
Come on.

588
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,640
All I can say is this, my friends.

589
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,100
Thanks to J.R. Bob Dobbs,

590
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,620
this is the only day of the year

591
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,940
that I have to get up at 6 o'clock in the goddamn morning.

592
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,920
That's right, Bob!

593
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,860
Those of you with conspiracy street jobs, believe me.

594
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,220
This is just as Bob suffered

595
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:02,260
as Bob suffered.

596
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,740
For the pinks, by wearing polyester,

597
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,940
I suffer for the jobbed.

598
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,220
Just say, I'm so sick.

599
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,260
I'm waking up one day early

600
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,480
and putting on a suit.

601
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,580
Let's see if another caller...

602
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,940
Not after this.

603
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,420
Hello, you're on the air.

604
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,760
Hello?

605
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,680
Hello.

606
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,480
Dr. Sinister?

607
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,240
Yes, sir.

608
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,800
Oh, this is the Reverend Angry Larry.

609
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,700
Hey, there.

610
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Angry Larry!

611
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:30,900
Yeah!

612
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,360
Now, Larry, calm down.

613
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,880
Remember your blood pressure.

614
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,380
You mean all nasties.

615
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,280
Ha, ha, ha.

616
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,000
You guys having a delay?

617
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,000


618
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,420
I can tell, because I'm driving through Cleveland right now.

619
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,640
Oh, yes, we are big fans of the delay.

620
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,180
Don't be careful, Cleveland.

621
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,680
Going to drive through you.

622
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,400
Hi.

623
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
Hello, Dave.

624
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,580
Hey, what's going on, Larry?

625
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,340
How you doing?

626
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,780
Just driving home to Detroit.

627
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,160
Well, it looks like you're about halfway there.

628
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,580
We have had a great time at X Day this year.

629
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,360
It was great.

630
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,340
We had a lot of fun.

631
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,740
No new organs to speak of?

632
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,100
The, uh...

633
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,380
No.

634
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,840
Reverend Angry Larry is one of the roadies.

635
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,640
He's like the road manager for the amino acids.

636
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,420
Right.

637
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,160
And I own everything.

638
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,200
And yet, he's never...

639
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,340
Yeah, he's...

640
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,100
I was explaining that to Dr. Howell earlier, that you own everything.

641
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,740
And yet, mysteriously...

642
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,300
Everything that the aminos touch.

643
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,880
And yet, mysteriously, I've never seen you standing with all fours.

644
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,160
I've seen four of them at the same time.

645
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,120
Well, they debuted their new motion picture.

646
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,840
Well, the aminos don't hang around, really, so...

647
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,160
As I understand it, they find the smell of humans and other primate types rather offensive.

648
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,800
They aren't the only ones.

649
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,700
Yeah.

650
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,600
Yeah.

651
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,820
They've got a plan.

652
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,260
The man with the plan.

653
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,580
Can you give out the website for where to see the amino movie at all?

654
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,220
Oh, yeah.

655
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,120
Yeah, absolutely.

656
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,880
It's www.fetishist.com.

657
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,320
Fetishist.com.

658
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:02,940
Fetishist.com.

659
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,200
Is that F-A-T-A-L-E?

660
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,800
Right.

661
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,440
As if it was Fatali.

662
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah.

663
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,340
Like a femme fatale.

664
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,980
Femme fatale.

665
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,160
That's number one in a series of four.

666
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:20,160
And we're looking at their number four is going to have some stars in it.

667
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,020
Some stars?

668
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,480
Oh, so you're...

669
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,060
Oh, yeah.

670
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,600
What are things?

671
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,640
I've been waiting for the astronomical educational one.

672
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,420
We're looking at Ted Ramey.

673
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm looking at Ted Ramey.

674
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,700
And possibly Pee Wee Herman, because as you know, he owes me.

675
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,860
He owes me, too, as a matter of fact.

676
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,140
He owns you, man.

677
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,300
Pee Wee Herman.

678
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,460
I paid his subgenius membership, so...

679
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,900
And he sends me a Christmas card every year, but, yeah, we want him to be in the amino movie.

680
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,400
You know, I'm young enough that I learned what masturbation was from the Pee Wee Herman incident back in the 80s.

681
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,200
Really?

682
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,460
You're far too tall to play him on screen.

683
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,540
Yeah, it's like...

684
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,960
It's like seven or eight when that happened.

685
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,800
Man, I didn't learn from Pee-wee when I was that age.

686
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
Who explained it to you?

687
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,840
Pee-wee himself?

688
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:09,500
No.

689
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,560
Here's what you do now.

690
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,660
Hold on to this thing.

691
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,080
I had seen in the paper that he was arrested for indecent exposure.

692
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,500
Why did you know what that was?

693
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,680
You Googled indecent exposure.

694
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,980
Well, they didn't have Google back then.

695
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Parents had to tell their kids about Pee-wee.

696
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,400
Parents had to tell their kids.

697
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,280
Now, listen, son.

698
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,860
We don't want to cause a big problem, but...

699
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,140
Shut up.

700
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm trying to watch Pee-wee.

701
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,140
Yeah, Matt.

702
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:38,540
Matt Pee-wee, I don't think you should be watching Pee-wee every time I catch you out here.

703
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,820
You're watching Pee-wee.

704
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,480
Is that why they call him Pee-wee?

705
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,280
Oh, my God.

706
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,840
Where did you hear such things?

707
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,400
You just...

708
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,940
Get over here right now.

709
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,300
You're going to go through your choice.

710
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,720
Hi, me.

711
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,220
Oh.

712
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,060
The tyrannosaurus Rex was bad because he...

713
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,760
You know there's no basement at the Alamo.

714
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,640
Hey, me.

715
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,240
Hey.

716
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Hey.

717
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,520
Hey.

718
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:57,960
Hey.

719
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,420
Okay.

720
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,040
Okay.

721
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,580
I...

722
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,040
All right, kids.

723
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
Now, settle down.

724
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,880
Pee-wee will be back in just a moment.

725
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:12,880
On this screen may be projected the total scientific knowledge of the crowd from its

726
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,480
primitive beginning to the day of its annihilation.

727
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,640
We refuse an emergency.

728
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,560
Screams, relaxing conoises the

731

Wench

732
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,400
Reverend Angry Larry, were you aware that there was a UFO sighting during the Amino Acids concert?

733
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,560
I heard about that.

734
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,800
You may have wondered why the audience suddenly fled the terrible music.

735
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,940
It wasn't just that the music was bad.

736
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,620
There was fire in the sky, my friends.

737
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,140
Yeah, that had nothing to do with the Aminos.

738
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,680
It could have been some of their enemies.

739
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,140
I was thinking it was their limo coming to pick them up as soon as they finished the show.

740
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,540
They're known for short concerts.

741
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,900
Well, they got tired of waiting and they took off.

742
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,880
The Amino ship is not very...

743
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,060
It's almost like a Pinto.

744
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,140
More of an Appaloosa.

745
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,140
It's not that well built of a machine anymore.

746
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,700
It's gone through a lot.

747
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,960
And part of the reason why they want more money is so that they can find the part to rebuild.

748
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,480
Speaking of money...

749
00:37:52,180 --> 00:38:01,000
We meant to give the Amino Acids their pay for the show, but by golly, they just weren't around when we had to leave.

750
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,040
They drank it out.

751
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,940
We'll have to square that away later.

752
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,700
It's only because the rest of the roadies left me there.

753
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,000
And I, once again, I felt so much like staying.

754
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,040
It's unbelievable.

755
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,320
I even told Pops or Nostril about that.

756
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,140
I said, yeah.

757
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,320
They left me.

758
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:30,300
So, therefore, I had to load the equipment all by myself while my lovely wife was up there working in the kitchen.

759
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,620
Packing a mean load.

760
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,940
I know the feeling.

761
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,720
Now, this time, you know, I was replaced by a female clone.

762
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,940
A Stangina that has previously been known as Priestess Pisces.

763
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,300
Yes.

764
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,280
She took on the weight of the world and had the nervous breakdown.

765
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,540
So, that's what...

766
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:05,820
And Reverend Steve Sinek and other people did the official Stang act of videotaping while performing.

767
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,880
That's another tricky thing.

768
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:13,020
I basically, I sat back and watched the whole thing.

769
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,940
Well, you did marry Steve Sinek off to a beautiful, wild, subgenius girl.

770
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,280
That's right.

771
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,860
That was one of the...

772
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:24,900
Actually, one of the most bizarre moments of any X-Day.

773
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,820
I did not even know she was a subgenius.

774
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,160
Reverend...

775
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,680
Well, no, actually, technically, I don't think Allison ever did send in her 30 bucks,

776
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,180
but she certainly qualifies on many other levels.

777
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,820
It was good to have her there.

778
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,120
She looks great.

779
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,380
I did grab your tripod you left.

780
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,660
Hey, keep your hands to yourself.

781
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,620
Oh, we were wondering.

782
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,140
Tripod?

783
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,160
You have it.

784
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,820
I thought you were grabbing my pod.

785
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,880
Yeah.

786
00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:00,320
That's actually Reverend Steve Sinek's tripod, and he was on his honeymoon and probably forgot that particular leg.

787
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,560
Oh.

788
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,300
The third, that third leg.

789
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,180
The last leg of the journey.

790
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,700
Yeah.

791
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,060
I can't blame him.

792
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,580
It was a pretty confusing evening there towards the end.

793
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,820
Well, you need your third leg and a third eye.

794
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,740
It was just...

795
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,860
A third nostril to get through when the times were tough.

796
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,040
We are all the slaves of a great...

797
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,780
And powerful civilization.

798
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,400
Let us prepare for our rulers.

799
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,020
It was just like Burning Man, minus 30,000 people.

800
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,980
And a lot of interesting acts.

801
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,900
And minus one crazy torching the man early.

802
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,280
Actually, the guy that burned the man prematurely is a friend of Dr. Howell's.

803
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,440
It is so.

804
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:57,780
Really?

805
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,600
Yeah.

806
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,680
Dr. Howell...

807
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,100
He's been sent away for...

808
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,140
Re-grooving?

809
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,700
He's been sent away for...

810
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:05,840
For valuation?

811
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,180
From 18 months to four years for arson.

812
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,960
Oh, great.

813
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,160
Wait, wait, wait.

814
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,100
For Burning the Burning Man?

815
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,420
For Burning the Burning Man.

816
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,620
Yes, they call that arson.

817
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,920
And the reach of the Burning Man organization, or the BAMORG.

818
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:17,960
Oh, yes.

819
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:17,960


820
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,120
Or Borg, as we call it, is a long one.

821
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:20,620
Yeah.

822
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,820
They made me stop selling that little Burning Man image mug that I made.

823
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,220
Oh, those folks just don't want to...

824
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,240
It wasn't even a photo.

825
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,160
It was a dang drawing, a painting, artwork of a Burning Man with Boba.

826
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,060
They're protective of their weird kook religion.

827
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,580
Well, it occurred to me that that's the trademark lawyer the Church of the Subgenius

828
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:40,880
needs.

829
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,720
If they're that on top of it, that they stop Reverend Ivan Stang from selling a CGI image

830
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,360
of the man.

831
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,720
And they're the lawyers for me, boy.

832
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,000
A legal pit bull.

833
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:51,840
That's right.

834
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,240
Bulldog!

835
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:52,900
Uh, hi, Ivan.

836
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,300
Just sit down.

837
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,460
I'll have the secretary be bringing you some papers to sign.

838
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,560
I'll be right back.

839
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,480
I'll take a nap.

840
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,480
Gee, what a swell-looking office.

841
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,240
You're sure this guy isn't way out of our price league?

842
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,240
Uh, I don't know.

843
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,420
Do we have a price league, or are we...

844
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,860
Careful.

845
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,780
If you damage that cushion, you're going to have to pay for it.

846
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,700
Twenty thousand price leagues under the lawyer.

847
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Oh, shh.

848
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,940
Here he is.

849
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,400
Coming back.

850
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,060
Here you are, sir.

851
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:23,660
Now, just sign on this sheet here, and this one here, and this one here.

852
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,820
How about if I just take the time to read this first?

853
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,780
Uh, well, why don't you just, uh...

854
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,120
Mary Lou, Mary Lou, Mary Lou, just take a quick look.

855
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,880
It's just a formality.

856
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,960
Just a formality.

857
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,040
You can skip right through and just sign at the bottom.

858
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,620
This, uh, all rights in perpetuity clause.

859
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,300
Why is that all in Latin?

860
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,340
That looks like it was written in blood.

861
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,180
Ah, this is, I think, written in a pig's blood.

862
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,400
But I'm just going to sign it here, because I want to go get a burrito.

863
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:44,500
Here we go.

864
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,220
There you are.

865
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,480
Here we go.

866
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,860
There you are.

867
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,220
Yes.

868
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:46,720
.

869
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,740
The brain of these primitives seemed quite suitable for our purposes.

870
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,100
We have made the most excellent choice.

871
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:44,360
We have made the most excellent choice.

872
00:44:44,400 --> 00:45:07,600
We have made the most excellent choice.

873
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,960
Speaking of the amino acids, how come I've never seen any of them strip naked and jump into the baptism pool?

874
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,520
They really don't need it.

875
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,680
They were baptized when they first arrived in 1962.

876
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,400
They've got good taste.

877
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,840
I thought they were just washed down the tubes.

878
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,420
The first one that hopped out of a vortex.

879
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,360
Washed up.

880
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:38,860
And pretty much told them at that time that, well, the world's not ready for you gentlemen yet.

881
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,920
And he wanted them to come back in 1998.

882
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,380
I don't get that.

883
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,920
The gentleman part, that's for sure.

884
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:51,080
And the other part is, I thought that the amino acids were a slathery form of DNA scoop,

885
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,660
which is spun in a cyclotron and then spat out by doctors and so forth.

886
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,800
And that seems like a rather creamy mixture to actually withstand such pressure.

887
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:01,780
Oh, no.

888
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,440
It will all be revealed in some of the one film.

889
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,540
So it's kind of a throwback.

890
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,100
It will be in black and white.

891
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,760
And that's...

892
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,980
Actually, we're the...

893
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,700
We're trying to get Ted Raimi to play Bob Dobbs.

894
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,300
What?

895
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,220
If I can't...

896
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:22,720
What?

897
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,320
What?

898
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:23,820
What?

899
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,780
What?

900
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,180
What?

901
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:25,300
What?

902
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:25,680
What?

903
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:25,840


904
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,340
He is a very big subgenius fan.

905
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,180
And an amino acid fan, too.

906
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,180
Some of the things that happened out there.

907
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,300
Now, what was the last big role that Ted Raimi was in?

908
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,680
Well, I know he did just about every movie that his brother ever made.

909
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,580
His brother Fred Ramey

910
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,720
Sam Ramey

911
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,580
Sam, man

912
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,840
Well, he was in Xena, Warrior Princess

913
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,580
He's in the Spider-Man movies

914
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,840
And he would show up in the Spider-Man movies

915
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,520
And the Spider-Man Chronicles

916
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,540
I think he was in the

917
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:06,640
Same theater as Pee-Wee

918
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,500
But, Reverend Angry Larry

919
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,440
Aren't you familiar with the history

920
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,100
Of what happens to people who play Bob Dobbs

921
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,820
Or pretend to be Bob Dobbs?

922
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,260
Right

923
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,900
Well, then

924
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,340
Well, we were just trying to figure out

925
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,940
Who else could possibly do it

926
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,840
We were only doing that just so that

927
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,920
Ted might just show up on the set

928
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,740
And, well, we could put his name in the credits

929
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,780
I've always assumed

930
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,980
Well, we're working on the contract

931
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,620
To have Andy Serkis play J.R. Bob Dobbs

932
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:41,420
He's known for his work

933
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,540
In his roles as Gollum and King Kong

934
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,940
That makes him ideal for the part

935
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,440
Right, right

936
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,680
Oh, then that, you know

937
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,960
We can only

938
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,400
Bob has to be a performance capture situation

939
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,540
Because you can't photograph Bob

940
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,060
He, ever since 1967 or so

941
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,600
He fogs film, erases tape, and so forth

942
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,740
Even if you're not trying to take a picture of it

943
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,680
If he looks at your camera

944
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,940
That pretty much erases everything

945
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,900
Because of the quantum singularity in his head

946
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,400
Well, but that can all be added to that

947
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,880
It has to be added in, in post

948
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,680
Well, singularity

949
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,420
Right, everything about Bob has to be added in post

950
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,800
Yeah, it will all be done in post

951
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,460
Hmm

952
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,620
Post haste

953
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,160
Because you're never going to actually make it

954
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,600
Make it work and make it stick

955
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,120
Because his head is too elusive

956
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,520
It's post time

957
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,320
We were lining up some actors

958
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,160
For the subgenius movie

959
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,700
We definitely have Johnny Depp

960
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,800
To play Ivan Stang

961
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,920
Because he looks so similar

962
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,460
And Scarlett Johansson as Princess We Are Doe

963
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,120
Oh, come on

964
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,820
Why not

965
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,720
Oh, never mind

966
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,580
Jim Carrey as Dr. Philodrummon

967
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,000
Because of the rubber face

968
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,760
And other rubber parts

969
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,140
Well, why not let Pee Wee then play Bob?

970
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,080
Dr. Howell was going to be played by Wilford Brimley

971
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,540
And unfortunately Larry Harmon died

972
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,320
Before he could play Lonesome Cowboy Dave

973
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,720
Blackstrap Molasses

974
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,700
That'll keep you going

975
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,920
Now, why couldn't Dr. Howell just be played by Dr. Howell?

976
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,200
Well, Dr.

977
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,400
Hey, I'm available

978
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:15,400
It's me out here

979
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,840
I'm trying to get you work, Doctor

980
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,320
You know, it's funny

981
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,560
A lot of people

982
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,660
I'm a member of Actors Inequality

983
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,360
People seem to know Dr. Howell better

984
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,600
For his voice work on that

985
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,520
Hiya kids, hiya

986
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,780
Just as for some reason

987
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,440
They seem to know Princess Wee

988
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,320
And myself better for that silly

989
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,780
Numa Numa song

990
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,300
Which I told you before

991
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,320
If I'm in a bad mood, I watch that

992
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,220
And it brightens me

993
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,740
And it makes me smile

994
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,740
It makes the revered angry Larry less angry

995
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,620
When I watch you two do the Numa Numa song

996
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,220
Every time you're feeling retarded

997
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,580
Like a silly loser

998
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,620
You've watched out and go

999
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,000
I'm not nearly as bad as some people

1000
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,720
Can I pollute the air with just one thought?

1001
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,360
And I know it's boring

1002
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,240
And it's been said many times before

1003
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,260
But don't you realize

1004
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,700
The possibilities of an angry Larry

1005
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,460
Find how that would change the dynamic

1006
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,540
Of the Three Stooges

1007
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,380
What if my wife and I were to die?

1008
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,960
And Moe came up and slapped an angry Larry

1009
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,780
And instead of him going

1010
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,220
God, that never occurred to me

1011
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,720
Instead of him going

1012
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,000
Something like he said

1013
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,580
Hey man, you do that one more time

1014
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,360
It's the angry Larry song

1015
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,980
Angry Larry fine and laid back Moe Howard

1016
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,900
What a horrifying nightmare

1017
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,480
That's when Moe had his hippie period

1018
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,840
He lost his edge, you know

1019
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,460
His smiling, friendly, stoned old time

1020
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,420
Well everyone, I am going to get off the phone

1021
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,100
So I can actually listen to the show

1022
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,600
Because it's on this funny

1023
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,240
But it's on now

1024
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,640
I hope that

1025
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,380
We're listening to it

1026
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,340
We're listening to it on the

1027
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,780
You are?

1028
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,900
Can I listen?

1029
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,760
That Amish buggy

1030
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,020
That you're still on your way out of Sherman with

1031
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,120
Hey Larry, before you go

1032
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,080
When are we going to see the amino acids

1033
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,460
On Saturday Night Live?

1034
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,440
I don't know

1035
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,480
When Saturday Night Live gets some taste

1036
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,500
You probably know Lorne Michaels, don't you?

1037
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,180
When Saturday Night Live comes back to life

1038
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,940
I tell you what, Stang

1039
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,940
I know you were on the Jon Stewart show

1040
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,460
You need to contact Jon Stewart

1041
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,380
And tell him you want to see him

1042
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,140
You want to come back on

1043
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,080
And push your new book

1044
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,620
I think

1045
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,960
He wants to come in from the cold

1046
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,540
I got carried away

1047
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,140
I smashed his watch

1048
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,680
And he's never spoken to me since then

1049
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,720
That was a watch his grandmother gave him

1050
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,300
Right

1051
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,280
You weren't supposed to put your hand on his lap

1052
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,420
In the middle of filming, too

1053
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,060
Well, that too

1054
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,740
But he's a famous celebrity, man

1055
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,060
I know how you felt

1056
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,100
How can I keep my hands off him?

1057
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,080
Well, now you have to go on the Stephen Colbert show, Stang

1058
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,840
It's like a baby

1059
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,900
You want to pinch his cheeks

1060
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,780
And you know, Stang

1061
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,040
You should go on Stephen Colbert

1062
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,180
Yeah, I should

1063
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,080
I'll do that

1064
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,760
I should

1065
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,880
Somebody should do that

1066
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,140
Yeah, somebody should

1067
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,520
Really should

1068
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,060
You should?

1069
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,000
Yeah, you should

1070
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,340
Should is a very strong word

1071
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,320
Well, okay

1072
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,860
I am going to hang up

1073
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,240
And have a great evening, everyone

1074
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,460
Real quick before you go, Larry

1075
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,900
It's been great hanging out with everyone this weekend

1076
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,780
Hey, Larry

1077
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,680
Real quick before you go

1078
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,840
Hold on, wait a minute

1079
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,100
Yeah, real quick before you go

1080
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,960
Can you repeat the website for the Amino?

1081
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,440
Acids movie?

1082
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,600
Oh, www.fatalpictures.com

1083
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,160
Or they can go

1084
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,220
Or they can go on to the aminoacids.com

1085
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,680
Or you can just go to SubSite

1086
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,100

1087
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:25,940
And you can look it up

1088
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,500
That's right

1089
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,700
Thanks for your contribution, sir

1090
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,840
All roads lead to SubSite

1091
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,600
Exactly

1092
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,680
Thank you, everyone

1093
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,500
Praise Bob, Larry

1094
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,980
Thank you, Larry

1095
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,840
Bye

1096
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,640
Angry, Larry

1097
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,620
And happy moving in the city of the future

1098
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,580
The lab will fix it

1099
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,400
And now priestess Pisces

1100
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,800
And the fat-free amino acids

1101
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,280
At 11X Day

1102
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,920
It's getting scary down here, Bob

1103
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,660
Conspiracy's thicker than molasses

1104
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,160
And an Alaskan winner

1105
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,840
I don't know how we're going to make it, Bob

1106
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,020
We really need to make it

1107
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,180
We need to

1108
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,960
Where are you, Bob?

1109
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,180
Bob?

1110
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,680
Where are you?

1111
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,440
Damn you, Bob

1112
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,860
You keep fucking us over

1113
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,180
You bastard

1114
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,620
Where are you, Bob?

1115
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,080
I don't know, you broke my neck

1116
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,700
Where are you, Bob?

1117
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,340
ū

1118
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:04,340
I kind of feel like I've been dropped

1119
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,760
Like a bad prom dress

1120
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,020
Do you know where Bob is?

1121
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,500
We should put up wanted posters

1122
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,540
You know, like, Lost Bob

1123
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,360
Please call

1124
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,220
Or write to the sacred P.O. Box

1125
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,360
If you've seen Bob

1126
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,180
Missing in action

1127
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,120
But we're trying to gain traction

1128
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,400
Of course I can't blame him

1129
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,340
We just kill or maim him

1130
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,020
But he's missing in action

1131
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,740
And we're trying to gain traction

1132
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,060
But I ain't seen him

1133
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,140
And goddamn, we need him

1134
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,600
Where's Bob?

1135
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,480
Have you seen Bob?

1136
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,020
Bob?

1137
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:01,600
Bob?

1138
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,480
Where is Bob?

1139
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,800
I feel so dejected

1140
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,900
Ew!

1141
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:38,380
Ew!

1142
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,260
Fucked and rejected

1143
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,160
Goddamn you, Bob

1144
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,220
Fuck you, Bob

1145
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,420
Wrote me hard and put away wet

1146
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,820
Is this all I get?

1147
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,280
You don't answer my calls

1148
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,920
Or my emails

1149
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,720
I've sent you

1150
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,900
42 letters

1151
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,820
What about the baby, Bob?

1152
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,580
Don't you care about your son?

1153
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,360
You bastard!

1154
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,000
You weren't around, so I put your son in the convent

1155
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,540
And they're taking care of him

1156
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,080
You fucking bastard

1157
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:37,820
And I know you beat me and you mistreat me, Bob

1158
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:37,880
But I'm not taking care of you, Bob!

1159
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,000
and you did all that surprise butt sex

1160
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,600
when I was trying to take a sleep.

1161
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,180
But I really forgive you, Bob.

1162
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,820
Bob, if you'd just come back,

1163
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,180
I swear that I'll clean up the house for her

1164
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,700
and I'll be a good little girl for you, Bob.

1165
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,140
Just, Bob, I'm sorry that,

1166
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,600
I'm sorry I was so mean to you, Bob.

1167
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,040
Please, just come back, Bob.

1168
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,580
Bob, I just don't know,

1169
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,280
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1170
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,640
Please, Bob.

1171
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,640
Please, Bob.

1172
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,220
Please, Bob.

1173
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,960
Please, Bob.

1174
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,500
All the way from Berkeley.

1175
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,140
Don't mention it.

1176
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,220
I do appreciate you coming here.

1177
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:12,680
Anytime, Michael.

1178
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,920
We have to do this next year.

1179
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,780
He is the host of his own program,

1180
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,200
Puzzling Evidence on KPFA.

1181
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,080
And the Ask Dr. Howell Show

1182
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,140
on Pirate Cat Radio 87.9 FM

1183
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,700
and on the internet at piratecatradio.org.

1184
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,780
No, piratecatradio.com.

1185
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,620
That's .com, Howell.

1186
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,340
What?

1187
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,240
It's piratecatradio.com.

1188
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,340
Didn't I?

1189
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,200
Oh, yeah, you're right, Rocknar, of course.

1190
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,080
It's piratecatradio.com.

1191
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,940
And it's kpfa.org.

1192
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:44,920
kpfa.org.

1193
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,480
N-W-R-E-K dot org.

1194
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,680
A little taste of, uh...

1195
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,740
N-W-C-S-B dot org.

1196
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:52,940
Dot org.

1197
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,400
This has been Synesthesia.

1198
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,620
We'll be back same time next week.

1199
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,100
It's not a threat, that's a promise.

1200
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,480
Praise Bob.

1201
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:57,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1202
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,480
Praise Bob.

1203
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,420
Praise No Money Mark.

1204
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,820
Praise Governor Rocknar.

1205
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,480
Thank you.

1206
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,440
Until next time, folks.

1207
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,000
Keep it surreal.

1208
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:18,340
And now, Reverend Motormack of motormack.com at 11X Day.

1209
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,360
It appears we have been screwed once again by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1210
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,940
and I wish to express my disappointment.

1211
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,200
My disappointment that I had to take off from my conspiracy job

1212
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,360
and come here on vacation for at least five days.

1213
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:36,820
My disappointment.

1214
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,800
That I had to party like it was the end of the world.

1215
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,680
Get drunk.

1216
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,120
Get naked in the hot tub.

1217
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:45,180
Rave.

1218
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:45,800
No, I'm sorry.

1219
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,740
No rave.

1220
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:48,700
Rave.

1221
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,180
Don't rave.

1222
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,840
Eat the best food in the world.

1223
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:56,780
Drink some of the most amazing forbidden drinks that you could ever experience.

1224
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:57,520
Jacob!

1225
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,300
When, you know, if it wasn't for J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1226
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:05,120
right now, this morning, I'd probably just be in my bathroom whacking off.

1227
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:06,860
Jacob!

1228
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:07,780
Jacob!

1229
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:07,780


1230
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,040
Where is he?

1231
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,100
Where is he?

1232
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:08,400


1233
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:09,680
Jacob!

1234
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:10,220
Jacob!

1235
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:10,280
Jacob!

1236
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:15,220
So I just have to say how disappointed I am in J.R. Bob Dobbs

1237
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,380
and in Ivan Stang for making this possible.

1238
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,800
I'd rather be wearing these.

1239
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,080
Very good point.

1240
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,780
Well, Motormack, there are bathrooms right up there.

1241
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,240
Broke the blame.

1242
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,300
If you want to resume your jacking off, I was thinking about that very thing myself.

1243
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,120
We have video cameras.
