1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
What the hell do you think they were doing?

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,020
Are you ready now?

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,640
Yes, I'm ready.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,640
Close your eyes and think to yourself,

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,140
there's no place like home.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,640
There's no place like home.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,880
There's no place like

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,380
The Self Genius

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,080
Power of

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,620
Swaggy!

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,380
You too can destroy something

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,320
if you just watch for the chance.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,640
I only know that he is a man with hair on the palm of his hands

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,120
and no blood in his face.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,700
This is PR.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,680
Do you see a man with,

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,720
to, especially with?

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,960
Now these are the very tense questions.

19
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,040
That does things.

20
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,620
That does things.

21
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,220
What?

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,620
Do you see?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,340
Do you see?

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,500
This is the show.

25
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,580
There's no question about it.

26
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,280
4.1

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,700
Beavitt to Lemur.

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,100
A bug girl cave of

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,840
strange subsonic sounds

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,660
of subsidence

31
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,820
of a catholic continental

32
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,780
battle.

33
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,840
That's our crowd at the arrival of Dr. Howe.

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,360
Oh, well, here we are.

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,440
Let's go in among them.

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,140
Remember, there's no such thing as bad publicity.

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,960
Just a wave and...

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,640
It'll be over.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,100
Okay, you want one of these?

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,760
I'm gonna take one.

41
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,140
Okay.

42
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:37,480
Let's go.

43
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,320
If it were Rob, she'll be go, go, go.

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:41,840
But no.

45
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,780
Hi, everybody.

46
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,680
This is Dr. Howe and Owl

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,600
getting up with the chickens

48
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,680
to bring you this special presentation.

49
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,040
Part of the subgenius propaganda saturation

50
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,780
in January 2007.

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,980
We're going to be looking at subgenius

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,220
oddities throughout the ages

53
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,560
on our program tonight

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,880
and examine some of the strangest

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,540
quips and conundrums

56
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,340
that ever came toddling down the pike.

57
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,720
How, for example,

58
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,220
did royal deaths

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,340
transform English politics?

60
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,080
It is important to bear in mind

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,900
that deaths of kings

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
were no ordinary

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,340
deaths.

64
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,140
But you can't assassinate a bum.

65
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,780
Only

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,280
someone of importance.

67
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,380
Thank you.

68
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Thank you very much.

69
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,600
So Dr. Howe

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,380
played his little guitar

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
and hiked on down the road.

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,840
Peace, friends.

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,480
Oops.

74
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,660
It looks like his horse has thrown him.

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Damn nag.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,200
He used to just play that one measure.

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
I wish he'd stop criticizing all the time.

78
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm just tuning up the instruments here.

79
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,600
Oh, yeah.

80
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,440
It is tuneful.

81
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,260
Why, it's the Synthron 3000.

82
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,420
You don't have to do anything.

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,900
It tunes itself perfectly.

84
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,540
It even sings a song for you.

85
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,580
Well, this one loops.

86
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,520
It just plays forever.

87
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,760
The little organist over there

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,220
never stops.

89
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
Drive it or park it, lady.

90
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,020
Well, no one can sink the show.

91
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,480
It's going to sink under its own weight

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,260
or float

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,880
as it bobbles and boops.

94
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,220
I don't want to do any more show.

95
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,400
It's scary out here.

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,500
I want to go home and go to sleep.

97
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,780
I don't want to do any more Red Bull.

98
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,720
That's the movie.

99
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm all dizzy.

100
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,520
What, you're looking for the best movie?

101
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:42,900
Yeah.

102
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,240
Okay, I think it's right over there.

103
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,360
It's right behind you there.

104
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,740
See?

105
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,320
It's on the floor.

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Now it's in the water.

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,500
Those who would stand

108
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,120
at that.

109
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,320
Those who stand over there.

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,740
This tuneless radio

111
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,420
jamboree.

112
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,400
And now, phylo drumming.

113
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,180
Thank you.

114
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,900
Thank you very much.

115
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,520
I have agitated

116
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,060
for this agreement

117
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,700
in the past

118
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,440
and I will in the future

119
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,600
for my testimony

120
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,460
and my coinage will be required

121
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,140
for.

122
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,600
This successful

123
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,360
operation.

124
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,800
Thank you.

125
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,500
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

126
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,860
Now we will continue on

127
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,360
down here by the prophet

128
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,940
where we notice

129
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,520
familiar spirits are gathering

130
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,280
about his head.

131
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,460
We should not

132
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,540
seek the

133
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,780
truth

134
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,480
here.

135
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,040
Yes.

136
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,580
We will be willing to pay

137
00:04:59,580 --> 00:04:59,760
for it.

138
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,260
We will be willing to pay for the truth.

139
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,900
So, so dearly.

140
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,760
You finally want to buy some truth?

141
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,100
Yeah.

142
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,420
Give me some truth, man.

143
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,740
From the land beyond, beyond.

144
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,460
Yeah, thanks, thanks.

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Here. Here's your money.

146
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,200
Wow, this is great, man.

147
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,080
This is a big bag of truth for just a little bitty.

148
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,080
It didn't cost me much at all for this truth.

149
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,140
Wait, this is all I get?

150
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Oh.

151
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,580
This truth didn't cost me.

152
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,660
Yeah, this is cheap truth, man.

153
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,780
I bet this truth may just be

154
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:28,840
just a little bit.

155
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,340
What did you do in there?

156
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,760
Just a little bit.

157
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:29,760


158
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,700
Sort of true, right?

159
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,120
Answer me.

160
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,960
You think it's just sort of true?

161
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,140
It's kind of true, truth.

162
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,280
All right.

163
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,320
Truth is sold for one quarter.

164
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,780
Yeah.

165
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,720
You and me.

166
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,440
But it's not really absolute truth.

167
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,100
It's more like sort of true.

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,840
Why?

169
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,140
Because I'm really mad.

170
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,720
It's kind of true.

171
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
You're just a little bit.

172
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,220
Just a little bit true.

173
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,860
But it's still the truth.

174
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,020
But it's still the truth.

175
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,380
This time it's perfect.

176
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,220
We're coming back.

177
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,400
Monsters.

178
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
We'll be armed with the truth.

179
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,500
Just the sort of true truth.

180
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,700
Not the real absolute gold truth.

181
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,740
The sword of truth.

182
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,200
The shield of justice.

183
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,420
Well, this is just a cardboard sword of truth.

184
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,680
The jockstrap of consupiscence.

185
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,880
Wait, I don't want to wear that.

186
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,860
The chest protector of invulnerability.

187
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,080
Does he realize that he's not even on the air?

188
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:20,760
No.

189
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,140
He can't tell?

190
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,560
This is Earth's final warning.

191
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Is Mary down there at the bottom of the sound well?

192
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,480
I really wish we'd have her.

193
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,540
I think we should have had a little bit more restraint.

194
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,980
What are you doing down here?

195
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Now we're trying to find that caller.

196
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,920
Did you hear that caller?

197
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,020
He just stormed out of.

198
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,620
He was down there.

199
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,500
He just stormed out.

200
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,080
Slamming the door.

201
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,700
Where are you going?

202
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,600
Having a temperature check.

203
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,360
Hey, come back, caller.

204
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,940
I'm here.

205
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,940
Oh, there he is.

206
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,940
Oh, we thought you stormed out and slammed the door behind you.

207
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,500
We were talking about the problems involved with succession.

208
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,620
We all know California listeners.

209
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,980
Ripped away from the union.

210
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,560
And there's 13 internationalists.

211
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:53,860
Wow.

212
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,260
Now, are you listening in California?

213
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,060
Who, me?

214
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,840
On the internet?

215
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,460
I'm listening to you.

216
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,460


217
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,460


218
00:06:59,460 --> 00:06:59,820
I'm listening in Hawaii.

219
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,920
You're the one in Hawaii, huh?

220
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,880
Where ocean breezes waft or palm-scented shores.

221
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,060
Where the mangoes grow in the mangrove groves.

222
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,440
You're not in the beach?

223
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,860
Okay, you probably.

224
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,980
You're on the MiG island there.

225
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,600
Are you on North Shore?

226
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,320
Are you in?

227
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,580
MiG island?

228
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
Sprayed by Russian air?

229
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,520
Your server's out there on a little place.

230
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
Everybody's going surfing.

231
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,980
Looks like I'm driving somewhere.

232
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
I can't even think.

233
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,560
In your woody.

234
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,320
Oh, pardon me.

235
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,520
Because, you know, the funny part is there is age one listener.

236
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,260
Hey, put that away.

237
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm not even listening.

238
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,440


239
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,440


240
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,440


241
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,440


242
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,440


243
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,640
I'm going to go to Hawaii.

244
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,000
Oops, sorry.

245
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh.

246
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:30,680
Oh.

247
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,700
No, we do have one internet listener we can see in Hawaii on our map of internet listeners.

248
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,000
And she can see us.

249
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,680
What?

250
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,540
Well.

251
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,940
Do you want me to put this away?

252
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,980
I just thought I would.

253
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,500
Yeah.

254
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,780
Okay.

255
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,180
All right.

256
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,060
It's scaring everybody.

257
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,080
Put that away.

258
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,320
What's that smell?

259
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,340
Oh, sorry.

260
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,200
But the top of the sea was so elastic that it grabbed in its chin and forced it to desist

261
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,560
us from this persecution.

262
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,420
Now, that's in Revelations 13.

263
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,420
Oh, that's in Revelations 13.

264
00:07:59,420 --> 00:07:59,420


265
00:07:59,420 --> 00:07:59,420


266
00:07:59,420 --> 00:07:59,420


267
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,380
Of course, we like to say Revelations 13 on the show.

268
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,000
And Revelation X on the show, too.

269
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,460
You know, that famous subgenius book has now been reprinted.

270
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,680
And you can get this from a brand spanking new copy.

271
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:15,680


272
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,180
Yeah, thank you.

273
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,480
Thank you.

274
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,960
It has.

275
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,420
I know you have.

276
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,280
Just like this one I'm holding up here.

277
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,640
This one isn't for sale.

278
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,280
This is what we call a special advance premium.

279
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,240
A loss leader.

280
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,280
But you can get it in the stores.

281
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
And this is the one that has the funny and grusting pages.

282
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,680
Fight and claw your way into the bookstore aisles.

283
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,420
No, I'm not.

284
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,420


285
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,420


286
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,540
No, I'm not.

287
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,540


288
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,540


289
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,540


290
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,540


291
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,540


292
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,460
Take home, a brand new copy.

293
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,300
And now, the Holy Grail.

294
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,240
Old subgenius classic, Revelations X, The Boblapocryphon.

295
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,460
Not to be confused with the Psychadelopedia of Slack, otherwise known as the Psychopedia

296
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,100
of Slack, The Bobliagrphon.

297
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,780
Yes, The Boblapocryphon.

298
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,280
Where do these names come from?

299
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,860
Who writes them?

300
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,120
From Bob, of course.

301
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,560
Yes, all from Bob.

302
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,320
From that one origin.

303
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,420
Just ask Bob.

304
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,940
police lieutenant Kiefer Hudson.

305
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,800
Officer, where does Bob come from?

306
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,900
In hot pursuit of the infamous Yancey gang,

307
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,860
which had committed a string of jewelry store heists,

308
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,820
but once again proved elusive.

309
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,220
They fought for the motherland.

310
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,420
Women in warfare on the Russian front during the First World War.

311
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,220
They gave me the slip like always, said officer.

312
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
The definition of the Church of the Subgenius

313
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,600
is eternal salvation on this planet, or hell,

314
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,200
eternal salvation on this planet.

315
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Either you choose the Church of the Subgenius

316
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,380
or you choose eternal damnation.

317
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,340
Amen, amen, amen.

318
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,580
Sing it over.

319
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:17,220
Amen, amen, amen, amen.

320
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
See the little baby.

321
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
This is Carly, a musician and the high priestess

322
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,360
of the Church of the Subgenius.

323
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,160
A bizarre new cult infiltrating into the UK.

324
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,260
Carly is on her way to meet two of the most important

325
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,840
members of her religion to rehearse for a sermon

326
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680
later that evening.

327
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,700
I do believe that the whole of London

328
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,620
is feeling the Bob vibe.

329
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,460
Bob is with us.

330
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,860
Bob is God.

331
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,600
Quite simply, Bob is God.

332
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,080
I love it, I love it, I love it.

333
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,460
And when he goes I follow.

334
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,120
I follow, I follow.

335
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the high part of the Church of the Subgenius.

336
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,320
He's the great master salesman who was made enlightened

337
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,540
by a space alien.

338
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,980
Jehovah One in 1953 after working on a television set

339
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,800
of his own design.

340
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,780
And the Jehovah One came down and he snatched Bob up

341
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,300
into the ether of space.

342
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,860
And gave him enlightenment and showed him that he was

343
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,120
the true prophet of the Church of the Subgenius.

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,980
And that he should create a church in his name

345
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,020
and bring total slack to all potential subgeniuses

346
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,660
that live on this planet.

347
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,540
The ideology behind the church is slack.

348
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,200
Every subgenius minister wants to obtain the highest level

349
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,060
of slack he can or she can.

350
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,740
And live a totally slack life.

351
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,280
And that's what we're doing.

352
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,100
This means that you probably do not work.

353
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,460
As the Reverend Ivan Stang would say,

354
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,640
you live a life of creative sloth.

355
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,480
The Church of the Subgenius has changed many members' lives.

356
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,540
I've met people who came to me and said,

357
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,420
Pope Black, tell me more about Bob.

358
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,340
Tell me how to join the Church of the Subgenius.

359
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,500
I have a horrible life.

360
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,540
I work.

361
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,460
I have a job.

362
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,180
I have a dead end job I hate.

363
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,140
I hate my boss.

364
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,900
I'm very unhappy.

365
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
And the Church of the Subgenius shows them the way.

366
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,960
They quit their job.

367
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,320
They quit their job for Bob.

368
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,880
And then they go and do something that they enjoy

369
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,700
that makes their lives rich.

370
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
And that's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

371
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,500
It's not about being lazy.

372
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,920
It's about doing what you want to do that makes you happy.

373
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,500
Praise Bob!

374
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,620
Praise Bob!

375
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,360
Praise Bob!

376
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,860
Hallelujah!

377
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,840
Praise Bob!

378
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,680
Amen!

379
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,900
Praise Bob!

380
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,340
Praise Bob!

381
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,620
Praise Bob!

382
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:57,640
Praise Bob!

383
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:57,640


384
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,260
After I joined the church, I found that I was drawn

385
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,300
to do more creative things for Bob.

386
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,800
To help recruit souls for a massive exodus from this planet,

387
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,800
which as you know will be any day now, on July 5th.

388
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,900
So, for instance, I've been writing books and recording sermons.

389
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,140
I've been writing songs.

390
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,480
All this for Bob, because the more we can create slack in the world,

391
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,440
the sooner we get to go off into bliss in the stars.

392
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,080
The Church of the Subgenius believed the world as we know it

393
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,580
would come to an end on July 5th, 2007.

394
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,120
We were invited to join them in a ceremony to worship Bob

395
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,500
in preparation for this mass exodus.

396
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,880
A few weeks later, we called on Reverend Adam,

397
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,980
and he agreed to talk to us from his home

398
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,340
about his life within the Church of the Subgenius.

399
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,540
When people first find out that I'm in the Church of the Subgenius,

400
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,320
they're usually full of questions,

401
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,620
and by about the third answer,

402
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,700
they all look at me a bit strange and think I'm strange.

403
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,380
I can tell by the look in their eyes that they think I'm a bit mad,

404
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,460
but then I look at their eyes,

405
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,920
and I can see that they have an invisible friend who lives in the sky,

406
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,680
so, you know, who's mad?

407
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,500
When the Christians have their revivals all over the country,

408
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,780
we can see the slack sinking into the ground,

409
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,780
disappearing from the entire country,

410
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,800
and so we have to undo their revival work

411
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,940
by putting on devivals, fighting against the conspiracy.

412
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,440
We'll have some bands, we'll have some preaching,

413
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,160
we'll have some jokes and some laughter,

414
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,180
and most of all, we'll have slack.

415
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,000
We attended our first Subgenius revival,

416
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,100
an event including bands,

417
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,760
dance,

418
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,480
dancing and prayer,

419
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,220
the highlight being a sermon by Pope Black,

420
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,740
preaching about the conspiracy that supposedly controls us.

421
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,340
Then they arrived,

422
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,840
and invented money and work.

423
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,800
They cut down the forest paradise and forced us to wear clothes,

424
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,140
and replaced the cornucopia with shops and hamburger restaurants.

425
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,300
They have made so many...

426
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,180
Some people think that the conspiracy is a dark, smoky room

427
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,540
with lots of high-up businessmen in suits,

428
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,380
making little deals here and little deals there,

429
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,760
and controlling people's lives through their tendricles of power.

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,320
But really, the conspiracy is you,

431
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,280
and it's every single damn normal person on this planet.

432
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,120
Every ordinary worm who lives on this planet is part of the conspiracy,

433
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,600
just by the code of normality that they produce.

434
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,860
You might have noticed that the conspiracy tells us 1998 has already passed.

435
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,740
Conspiracy has been fixing the calendar throughout the entire age of mankind's existence on this planet.

436
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,780
They've been fixing it here and fixing it there.

437
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,020
I think it's probably 1998 now,

438
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,560
and that this July the world will end.

439
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,620
Aliens are going to come and free the world of the conspiracy,

440
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,360
and take up the subgenies off into the stars,

441
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,700
to live with their love goddesses on their very own UFO.

442
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,400
Subgenius Revival

443
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,520
Subgenius Revival

444
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:52,520


445
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,260
He's gone to London to show us more about the world of Bob Dobbs.

446
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,840
He informed us that Bob had become a famous clip art icon,

447
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,420
and very popular in underground pop culture.

448
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,660
He devolved into this figure, this clip art figure.

449
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,180
Bob is the perfect marketing scam,

450
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,640
and anybody's allowed to use it.

451
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,820
This is where the magic happens!

452
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,500
Subgenius Revival

453
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,000
the evening at a subgenius squat where the Pope claimed his duty was to recruit more

454
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,420
members.

455
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,060
And I know about Bob and the rule of slack, whatever it is.

456
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,120
All I know is I'm fucking enjoying it and I might join it.

457
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,280
Where's Bob?

458
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,040
Two years ago, Priestess Carly had a vision of Bob who told her to form a band and spread

459
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,580
his word.

460
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,820
She immediately left her husband and a highly paid job to tour the world promoting the Church

461
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,620
of the Subgenius.

462
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:05,020
Bob said, go to the Tate, go to Channel 5, go to Mitsubishi, go to Sony, go to the government,

463
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,980
go to the Arts Council of every goddamn nation and spread the word of Bob.

464
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,260
You can be anything you want.

465
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,140
You can be a Pope.

466
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,160
You can be a Bishop.

467
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,300
You can be an Emperor.

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,420
I'm a high priestess.

469
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,420
What else could I be?

470
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,780
After spending so much time with Reverend Adam, Priestess Carly and Pope Black, we wanted

471
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,540
to end our journey with them by finding out how Bob had changed their lives.

472
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,980
Before I joined the church, I was going nowhere with my life.

473
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,760
I would probably have ended up in some dead-end job with a shotgun in my mouth and my toe on

474
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,220
the trigger.

475
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,420
It was probably the most miserable time in my life.

476
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:02,800
There was nothing for me except working, cooking, eating, fucking, sleeping, drinking.

477
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,180
There was nothing that really made sense to me.

478
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,660
Since I found Bob, it has opened up an entire new world for me.

479
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm a Christian.

480
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:15,960


481
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,920
I'm a Christian.

482
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:35,320
I've gone to so many� crossing paths in life.

483
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,880
I'm a Christian.

484
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:35,880


485
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:35,920
I'm a Christian.

486
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,820
Thank God that I'm obligated to see God when I'm dead and feel unclean.

487
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,280
I'm someone who loves you.

488
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,680
I love to get this man.

489
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,780
I need this man.

490
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,420
There's only one way to salvation.

491
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,760
All you have to do is pay $30 to the Church of the Subgenius by July 5th, 2007,

492
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,200
or else you'll fry in hell with the rest of them.

493
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,240
And I know you don't want that, friends.

494
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,780
And what we just heard is the soundtrack of a film by Natalie Ellis called The Cult of Bob,

495
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,060
which you can see on YouTube.

496
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,640
If you type in Cult of Bob and do a search on that,

497
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:22,920
this radio show, however, is Hour of Slack number 1123 from the Church of the Subgenius USA HQ.

498
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:32,780
Although most of this particular episode, except for the collages, which are by Leemur and also norlpref.com,

499
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,940
which bracket everything, is tonight, this show,

500
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:43,120
from an episode of the Puzzling Evidence More Than an Hour, Less Than a Show,

501
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,620
show.

502
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,020
Show, from January 2007,

503
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,640
with Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrumon, and our dance instructor, Puzzling Evidence.

504
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,040
Woo!

505
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,160
Okay, now, I'm doing a little dance, and we'll drop your mind back in your brain pan.

506
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:03,680
Jerry! Jerry!

507
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,020
No, it's all right.

508
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,820
All right, Jerry.

509
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,660
There we go.

510
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:18,740
All right.

511
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,420
And this is really a historical week.

512
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,440
There are a lot of things that happened back in history during this week.

513
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,240
Are you sure this is a good idea?

514
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,580
No.

515
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,440
This world is not a good idea.

516
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:31,640
No.

517
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,840
I think we should delete and start again.

518
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,240
No, I think we should take this and just overlay it with the one that we know is good.

519
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,820
I think we should save it for later.

520
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,520
Okay.

521
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,040
Did you hear about...

522
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,780
I think history is repeating itself again.

523
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,380
Dick Cheney found the Holy Grail.

524
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,860
The world's great again.

525
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,340
Yeah, again.

526
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,880
That guy's just...

527
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
How could he...

528
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,280
How does this man do this?

529
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,820
He just does so many amazing things in one week.

530
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,580
It's amazing.

531
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,140
I just hit save it for later.

532
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,220
What happened, little caller?

533
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,280
What happened, little caller?

534
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,260
What happened, little caller?

535
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,080
Well, I think we're...

536
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,320
Oh, yeah.

537
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,260
That's a little bit...

538
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,380
You're continuing this war?

539
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,680
Call her extreme.

540
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,240
We're gonna win.

541
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,300
We're gonna...

542
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Oh, that's great.

543
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,660
You mean with Jerry Ford?

544
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,460
I remember those...

545
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,180
We can't win.

546
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,760
You can't win in America.

547
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,880
We don't win wars.

548
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,600
We sweat wars.

549
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,720
You just can't win.

550
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,360
You can't fight City Hall.

551
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,780
We don't like the stardom, and when we do, we can't win them.

552
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,040
Because we know we can't win them.

553
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,600
That's why we don't like the stardom.

554
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,060
You're screwed, bloated, tattooed.

555
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,040
Plus, people get hurt and things get broken.

556
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,620
We should just talk about it.

557
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:43,620


558
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,260
Stuff happens.

559
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,560
We would just talk things out.

560
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,260
It would be a lot better.

561
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,760
You know, just sit down and talk.

562
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,520
It's gonna take us thinking about being good with each other and being nice to each other for a while.

563
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,520
Have a nice day.

564
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,300
You know?

565
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,260
We gotta get off of this hate trip, man.

566
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,280
Hate.

567
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,580
We gotta get back on the love wagon.

568
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,180
Hate.

569
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,260
You know what I'm saying?

570
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,200
You know what I'm saying?

571
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
Make me hate crime.

572
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,540
Don't you...

573
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,020
Now, when I say, know what I'm saying, you're supposed to say, know what you're saying.

574
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,820
Know what you're saying.

575
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,860
Yeah.

576
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,640
Just a beautiful show.

577
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,120
Okay, car, do you remember that now?

578
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,600
I crashed the old bad show.

579
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,120
Don't say it.

580
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,360
And made a beautiful show happen.

581
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,240
I said it, car.

582
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,240
I heard I was staying with him.

583
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,580
Don't you say it.

584
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:23,960
Is that true?

585
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,640
Yeah, he was here last week.

586
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,660
Wow, okay.

587
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,960
He just came and left.

588
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,980
I just came in for a haircut.

589
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,620
Yes.

590
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,800
The unconquerable will.

591
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
And a sponge job.

592
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,340
Immortal hate.

593
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,100
Hey, whoa.

594
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,140
Encouraged never to submit to a deal.

595
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
You have to change the music for that.

596
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,980
Hey, did you know that phrase, are we not man, came from...

597
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,300
H.G. Wells?

598
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
It came from the island of Dr. Moreau.

599
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,500
Sure did.

600
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,560
The speech of the savior of the mall.

601
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,580
That noise you just heard was Buzz McGavin slapping his forehead.

602
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,760
I guess I called too late.

603
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,080
Not to slap his forehead.

604
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,500
No, that's okay.

605
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,500
Yeah, yeah.

606
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,680
The island of Dr. Moreau, that's true.

607
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,200
Are we not men?

608
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,020
That's an excellent film.

609
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
Which I would say had a huge impact on the sub-gum-dini's, right?

610
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,860
Yeah, sure did.

611
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,980
I could tell that right away.

612
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,180
That and Little Big Man.

613
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,560
Yeah.

614
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,320
What are the movies?

615
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,140
Well, certainly any science fiction movie you guys saw and we saw.

616
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,060
I know Justin from What He Was.

617
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,600
Well, one of the first things I got from Sting was the tape where he's doing...

618
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,560
I know Bob Dobbs from What He Was.

619
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,020
And we know some huge sports they was.

620
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,340
That's a great rant.

621
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,940
The whole rant.

622
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,080
Bob Dobbs.

623
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,620
Because Sting was always an old guy from the beginning.

624
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,100
He's always been the old guy.

625
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
Bob Dobbs.

626
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,940
Because we were feeding...

627
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,300
His signal earlier in the show, and you were listening to him talk about...

628
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,840
He was so distant from that early character that he was so long ago.

629
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,320
But I know the feeling.

630
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,400
I actually have tapes of myself in early teens.

631
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,440
First screams for listening.

632
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,140
Huh.

633
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,580
Everything I know is wrong.

634
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,980
Peter Pan changed his name to Peter Pan Handel.

635
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,120
And he's standing out.

636
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,460
He's living out in front of the BART station now.

637
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,980
Captain Hook bought Neverland from Michael Jackson.

638
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,360
Man, this week's amazing.

639
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,640
He's turning it into a casino.

640
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,140
Welcome to Dobbsville.

641
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,860
It's not funny.

642
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,660
Where you, the customer, are our finest product.

643
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,640
Okay, I have to evacuate the void.

644
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,060
Oh, for heaven's sake.

645
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,900
You know, what we're interested in is the software of battle as opposed to the hardware.

646
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,200
And hardware in this context means what it sounds like.

647
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,680
Arms and armor.

648
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,200
Battle formation.

649
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
He couldn't handle the show.

650
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,180
So he went to the bathroom and got sick, as you can see in this tape.

651
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,640
The organization of armies.

652
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,580
He evacuated from both ends right now.

653
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,000
But can you speak in a military context?

654
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,440
And the interesting thing is, right now, you can see on the camera here,

655
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,900
Zoff Filo's entering the airlock.

656
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,180
That, by contrast, covers nearly everything else.

657
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,580
What I was saying three minutes ago.

658
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,360
Behavior.

659
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,520
Strategy.

660
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,140
And the truth is, folks, he's only hearing it now, days later, when he downloads it on the web.

661
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,320
And indeed, the whole gamut that Klaus Witz knew so well.

662
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,920
That's FiloWare.

663
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,340
And if you have FiloWare, it will bring you the version of the show that only has Filo's voice.

664
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,240
Confrontations and hardware factors.

665
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,440
Because ambushes or unexpected flanking movements and maneuvers can overcome enemies.

666
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,100
Do some hammering.

667
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,120
Do some hammering.

668
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,420
Do some hammering.

669
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,760
And a battle field.

670
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,040
Larry Harvey likes to dive into the heaps of money and swim through it.

671
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,100
So John Law is now a jader.

672
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,920
And Larry Harvey is on his way.

673
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,600
In the subgenius universe.

674
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,860
That is almost true.

675
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,420
Caller, what happened?

676
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,160
Caller.

677
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,140
What?

678
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,800
The caller in this case is represented by a wolf.

679
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,160
A wolf.

680
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,080
Balanced by doubt and shame.

681
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,720
So you read this in the paper?

682
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,740
In the examiner.

683
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,860
The examiner.

684
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,780
Of this past day.

685
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,380
Of this past day?

686
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Yes, not the future day.

687
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,880
Or the present day.

688
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,620
Thursday?

689
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,060
Boy, am I ever.

690
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,080
I'd like to drink some of this.

691
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,320
So Miles had a drink.

692
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,160
Could I drink some of this?

693
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,020
It's got acid in it.

694
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,860
Acid?

695
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, LSD and pot and speed.

696
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,720
And copper sulfate.

697
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
And copper sulfate.

698
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,120
There is a little extra cup here.

699
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,180
And I would like to drink some because I'm so thirsty.

700
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,060
Yeah, I just.

701
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
Sure, yeah.

702
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,600
You're a roundabout child.

703
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,080
Don't be scared, caller.

704
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,360
That's a scary caller.

705
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,600
There are no such things.

706
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,560
I think my brother's going to call today.

707
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,280
Brother, go find your brother.

708
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,700
Brother?

709
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,340
Brother, that's silly.

710
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,440
Oh, boy.

711
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,180
Whoa.

712
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,580
Calm down, caller.

713
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,360
That was just an experiment.

714
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,060
Like if you guys had a laugh track.

715
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,740
Okay.

716
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,600
You can provide that.

717
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,300
You're more like a huff.

718
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,820
You're scary.

719
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,660
You're not funny.

720
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,520
What happened to that?

721
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,460
Can't you go ha, ha, ha?

722
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,800
Life-loving laughter.

723
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,780
What happened to that?

724
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,920
How about T-Harr, har, T-Harr, har?

725
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,460
How about giggle, twitter, twitter, giggle?

726
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,140
Okay, let's sync up here on the show.

727
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,740
I'm not tracking here.

728
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,700
I've got my equipment.

729
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,600
I've got a bokeh.

730
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,080
Oh, maybe it was just in my headphones.

731
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,460
This is where they make the show.

732
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,780
A giant factory, a former airplane manufacturing shed.

733
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,840
The show is cobbled together here with a little bit of Yankee ingenuity.

734
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,660
American.

735
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,580
American know-how, chewing gum and bailing wire.

736
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:24,460
They pull themselves up by their bootstraps and hang onto the seats of their trousers as they fly blind here at the giant show factory.

737
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,380
And somehow, gosh darn it, at the end they have a show.

738
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,180
This is the archive where thousands of shows are stored in digital form.

739
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,320
Look at them down there.

740
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,200
Each one can be fully recreated.

741
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,640
Why are some of those shows skinnier than the other ones?

742
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,540
Some are low-calorie shows.

743
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,040
Are they low on humor and listening value?

744
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,220
Others are full of fats and butter.

745
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,080
I like the Alexa.

746
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,180
Trans fats.

747
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,660
The what?

748
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:05,160
Do you know which of those shows are just fluff shows filled out with air and whipped sugar?

749
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,180
Oh, Saturday Night Live.

750
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
That's the right answer.

751
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,500
I'm going to give you a haircut now.

752
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,200
Yeah, here.

753
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,640
Yeah, hold still while we cut your hair.

754
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,660
Hold still.

755
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,640
Oh, I got his ear.

756
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,140
What's wrong?

757
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,380
Oh, no, man.

758
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,620
I'm sorry.

759
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,160
Now you've got it.

760
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,740
He's over there.

761
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,480
You can find the spot and reattach.

762
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:29,660
Yeah.

763
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,940
Ah, that was good.

764
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,880
Oh, sorry.

765
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,540
Man, my nose is just completely swamped.

766
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,380
It's like a swamp up there.

767
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,100
Oh, when you put it on the nose, it blows.

768
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,540
Yeah.

769
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,200
Oh, my God.

770
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,480
Oh, my God.

771
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


772
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


773
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


774
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


775
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


776
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


777
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


778
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


779
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


780
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


781
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:41,840
Oh, my God.

782
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,220
Can you push the snore button when that happens?

783
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,440
I wonder if it is.

784
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,540
One of the trolls rampant snoring.

785
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,540
There is snoring.

786
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,860
Dr. Howell.

787
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,400
Yeah.

788
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,680
How can he do that?

789
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,000
This is all happening in a two-minute time.

790
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,260
He sleeps and talks at the same time.

791
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,380
Yeah, it's sleep talking, which Subgenius is an excel at.

792
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,580
As you can see right now.

793
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,260
Okay, now we'll go to Channel X and see what the audience thinks of it.

794
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,260
Stinks.

795
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,560
But what do they think out there in radio and radio?

796
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,480
Do you know how Nosferm works?

797
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,740
Nosferatu got his name.

798
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,180
Okay, what do you think of the color?

799
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,920
From climbing a tree and . . .

800
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,940
That's our test.

801
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,940
His nose was big enough for two people.

802
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,440
Thanks, thanks.

803
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,680
You know, he only weighed 170 pounds, but he was six feet tall.

804
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,940
Characteristics and behavior, Nosferatu was originally a wealthy 19th-century Hungarian.

805
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,340
He plucked a rare . . .

806
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,320
Rare.

807
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,460
. . . Rhenuitis flower, because he was a young man.

808
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


809
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


810
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


811
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


812
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


813
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


814
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


815
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,460


816
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,820
He lost to a band of gypsies, infuriated the odor and the sinus clearing, and Blossom

817
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,440
cursed the nobleman with eternal life as a vampiric odor eater.

818
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,360
Over the years, Nosferatu terrorized villagers by sucking the odors from baked goods, perfumes,

819
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,820
and flowers.

820
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,960
After luring him into a castle filled with the overwhelmingly enticing aroma of 200 mugs

821
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,840
of chamomile tea, Matthew Damon kept Nosferatu distracted until dawn.

822
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,980
Then, pulling aside the garbage bags he had earlier taped over the windows, Damon watched

823
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:21,240
with satisfaction as the sinister sniffer burst into flames and was quickly reduced to

824
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,520
ashes.

825
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,520
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

826
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,860
Where's the weatherman?

827
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,740
They call him Nosferatu now.

828
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,500
He's out in the hall.

829
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,820
I don't know whether you'll get weatherman or not.

830
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,260
Did you want to talk to him?

831
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,580
Hold still.

832
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,580
If you hold still, I'll go get him.

833
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,340
Hold still!

834
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,640
Yeah, stop jerking around, are we?

835
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
You have to stand still.

836
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,200
What do you have?

837
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,120
You don't have control over your muscles or something?

838
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,660
Well, that needle stings when they...

839
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,200
I'm sorry.

840
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:54,040
The report of points at Louis Spoonley was not available at offshore Boone 59...

841
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,760
Not available in any stiller.

842
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,480
...to the wild west of Point Reyes with North 19...

843
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,460
Thank you, weatherman.

844
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,040
...water temperature 55, pressure 1...

845
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,200
...20.2...

846
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
...to 11 feet...

847
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,040
...to 11...

848
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,300
...point less...

849
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:14,480
...to 1.

850
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:24,700
... bölежка gives us a bridge footage of the

851
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:40,020
end of the stage scale.

852
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,020


853
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,020


854
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,120
for the dictator.

855
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,040
Well, I'm sure it would hate to be mentioned

856
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,660
as the plaintiff in a lawsuit

857
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,780
or as one who had not yet paid for a pair of shoes

858
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,600
now being left behind.

859
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,360
Actually, a gift I would not wish to destroy.

860
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,180
Me.

861
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,360
Me.

862
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,420
Well, tell us, what's the trick this time?

863
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,460
It's called the Whispering Queen.

864
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,740
You and I both know that this is just a trick.

865
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,860
Yes, you're right.

866
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,780
It's a trick.

867
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,980
My assistant is in the basket that I have pierced with salt.

868
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,300
Now, put the lid on.

869
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,800
Oh, watch.

870
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,300
Hi, Rhoda.

871
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,740
She's a cripple, you know.

872
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,660
Stays in her room.

873
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,840
But first, you must shuffle this pack of cards.

874
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,060
Oh, I see.

875
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,540
Well, here goes.

876
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,140
All shuffled.

877
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:28,480
Good.

878
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,080
Now I lay the pack face down and divide it into three heaps.

879
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,740
One here and one here on the other side.

880
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,320
This is giving me the creeps.

881
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,760
And now this one and the next.

882
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,680
And this one and now this and this.

883
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,700
All right, Don, open the lid.

884
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,920
Five of clubs.

885
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,560
Well, that's quite a trick, Blackstone.

886
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,500
It is puzzling, isn't it?

887
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:51,820
Yeah.

888
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,320
I don't get it.

889
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,080
Simple, but did it fool us?

890
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,020
I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen.

891
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,220
And until next time, goodbye.

892
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm wearing a diaper.

893
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,040
Amnesty International accuses the town of Finley, Ohio,

894
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:15,040
of violating an arms embargo and continuing to supply militias with PR News in Washington.

895
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,720
I'd like for you to turn your Bible to the Book of Lust, Lust, Lust, Lust.

896
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,480
I'd like for you to turn to Chapter 3 here in the Book of Lust, Lust, Lust, Lust.

897
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,520
Be hot, hot, hot.

898
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,700
I will know young people.

899
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,980
My hot mouth.

900
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
To do young people.

901
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,000
Half of the world I'm pushing, pushing within a year, year, year, year.

902
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,920
We'll reach that climax.

903
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,220
To do sex.

904
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,020
I know sex.

905
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,780
I know desires.

906
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,680
I want to be a, want to be a nerd.

907
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm going to be an airline stewardess.

908
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,700
No, no desires.

909
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:47,860
Bone, bone.

910
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,140
Give them a little thrill.

911
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,020
Sightment.

912
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,420
Young man, what's your plans?

913
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

914
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,920
I know work.

915
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,680
No spitball.

916
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,920
And I know hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

917
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,260
My mouth.

918
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,280
Slack, slack.

919
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,680
Word.

920
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,900
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

921
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,280
Slack.

922
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,000
One day without.

923
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,120
Slack makes me weak.

924
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,840
We want to cum.

925
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,440
We want to cum.

926
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,020
We want to cum.

927
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,760
We want to cum.

928
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,480
We want to cum.

929
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,120
We want to cum.

930
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,120


931
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,320
But oh, listen to me.

932
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,600
Slack, slack, slack.

933
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,600
Play with a neighbor.

934
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,180
I don't think, I don't think.

935
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,440
Word.

936
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:16,880
Word.

937
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,660
Word.

938
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Let them have their dope.

939
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,680
Let them have their dope.

940
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,580
Let them have their sex.

941
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,520
Let them have their sex.

942
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:21,940
Spit.

943
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,960
That's right.

944
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,720
That's right.

945
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,860
My bone.

946
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,780
You got a hold of it?

947
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,580
Have you ever played it?

948
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,440
Now, let's break it.

949
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,360
Bone is broke.

950
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:28,920
Bone.

951
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,240
Right?

952
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,140
Feel that.

953
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:30,560
Feel that.

954
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,080
Hold it up.

955
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,620
Hold it up straight.

956
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,020
That's it.

957
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,960
You're holding that straight.

958
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,280
Now, if you hold it up straight, it stands straight, right?

959
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,800
It all depends on which way you hold it.

960
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,240
You hold it this way, it leans that way.

961
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,080
You hold it this way, it leans that way.

962
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,800
You hold it this way, it leans that way.

963
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,020
Right?

964
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,240
Right?

965
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,140
And neighbor, we're going to end up with this.

966
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:44,940
Look at it.

967
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,720
You see what I mean?

968
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,120
Feel it.

969
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,080
Try to hold it up.

970
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,680
Can you hold it up?

971
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,400
Look, it fell over.

972
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,480
Try to hold it sideways.

973
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:49,860
You can.

974
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,840
Try to hold it down.

975
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,080
Oh, it fell on the floor.

976
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,780
Bone.

977
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,040
Bone.

978
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,920
Man alive, a lot of you haven't made it.

979
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,200
And the thing curbed.

980
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,400
Woo.

981
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,700
And when that thing curbed, it hit the teacher smack dab in the head.

982
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,140
Work my clock over.

983
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:15,860
Well, nonetheless, we'll conduct our survey next week with our special guest, Godfrey Shagnasty.

984
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:31,220
And he'll teach us how to build our own personal gallows that we can use in our backyard to take care of those old and trusted pets of ours that have just outlived their usefulness.

985
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,180
And yet we love them.

986
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,920
And so we want to make sure that.

987
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,020
And we're not going to allow anybody to take any cell phone movies of them at the gallows.

988
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,520
That's right.

989
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,600
Only clockwork mechanism, eight millimeter.

990
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,280
Gallows are horrible.

991
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,240
Throughout the extensive days, ceremonies.

992
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:48,960
And film.

993
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,700
Fish, new film.

994
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,120
We will be deeply committed.

995
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:51,400
They still make it.

996
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,400
To the principle of painless death.

997
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:54,940
Yes.

998
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,680
Going forward, we'll try to remove the criminalities associated with this.

999
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1000
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1001
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1002
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1003
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1004
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1005
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1006
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1007
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1008
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:01,680


1009
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:09,700
activity so that you in the future can relieve your tiny tiny little

1010
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,700
ah feel good ancient and extended misery yes

1011
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:20,520
will be a crucial six weeks after the assassination takes place all in Marion

1012
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:30,900
did you say what'd you say about redneck me I didn't think about redneck one way

1013
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,700
or the other no I didn't say the word redneck or search did you say anything

1014
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,220
about the color of my neck

1015
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,660
the color of my duffel bag or the color of my socks

1016
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,500
what's your decision this is a California which is worse the socks or

1017
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:00,180
the or the deck which would you consider to be worse take a look here and I will

1018
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,880
reveal the

1019
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,300
96 untapped stashes

1020
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:10,160
number one over there behind

1021
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,580
that shell

1022
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
but

1023
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:21,700
underneath the Vista Express at North Star at Tahoe

1024
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,040
goodbye and good business

1025
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,020
some kind of Texan thing

1026
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,880
stream of bubbles coming out of there. You have to be careful. You have to be careful. You have to be careful. You have to be careful. You have to be careful.

1027
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,800
You can park your pipe at Moonshine Park.

1028
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,000
Park your pipe.

1029
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,640
What kind of silliness is this, caller?

1030
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,040
Hey, man, how's your day going?

1031
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,220
Hey, you guys said you were looking for a guy that needs to go to the hospital.

1032
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,440
Why can't it be a girl?

1033
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,960
It can be a girl.

1034
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,420
We were actually referring to some history, but it's just as wonderful to have her story.

1035
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,860
You need to go to the hospital?

1036
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,960
So, of course, we'd all rush to take you to the hospital.

1037
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
So, yeah, we'll come over.

1038
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,220
Do you want us to come over and take you to the hospital?

1039
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,620
There's going to be the doctor there.

1040
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,680
Okay, we'll have to go to the girl's home.

1041
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,760
There'll be a doctor, yeah.

1042
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,180
I need a doctor.

1043
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,060
We'll serve your doctorly needs in the car on the way to the hospital.

1044
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,640
What's wrong?

1045
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,480
Do you need a nurse?

1046
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,080
Do you need some boys in boots?

1047
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,340
What do you got?

1048
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,500
You might need a nurse.

1049
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,120
Tell us your symptoms, please.

1050
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:27,740
Um.

1051
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,140
I'm a little dizzy.

1052
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,160
Dizziness?

1053
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,500
Check.

1054
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,040
Yeah, I've seen, like, a lot of colors.

1055
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,300
Colors?

1056
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:35,640
Check.

1057
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,600
Colors?

1058
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,320
Yeah, just, like, rainbow colors.

1059
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,740
Rainbow colors, huh?

1060
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,620
Yeah, and I keep on seeing everything.

1061
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,160
And you're dizzy, and you're hearing music, you're hearing voices?

1062
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,200
Yes.

1063
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,520
Have you exerted yourself unusually lately in any way?

1064
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,760
Outside your regular routine?

1065
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
I feel like you're going crazy because nothing stops.

1066
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,680
No, I was just hearing.

1067
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,520
You guys need to go to the hospital.

1068
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,060
I hear you.

1069
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,300
It's me.

1070
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,100
Yeah, well, you know, you should go to the hospital.

1071
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,280
If you're, what about your fingers?

1072
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,180
Do they feel okay?

1073
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,640
Fine, I'll stop that.

1074
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,780
Your fingers, you know, you touch your fingers.

1075
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:12,960
Those are not her fingers.

1076
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,640
Do they feel all right?

1077
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,860
Are those your fingers?

1078
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,400
No, those are my fingers.

1079
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:16,940
Those are not my fingers.

1080
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,280
Oh.

1081
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,720
That's not how you better start using their fingers.

1082
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,180
Okay, no.

1083
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,300
Let's just start over.

1084
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,000
Somebody's finger.

1085
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,140
Let's just start with the 60s.

1086
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,400
All right.

1087
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,640
All right.

1088
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,920
Everything mellow, and then we'll move up to 2007.

1089
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,060
Okay, you ready?

1090
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,520
Oh, wow.

1091
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,160
Everything just seems to be melting.

1092
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,760
Like, oh, my God.

1093
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
I'm just, it's not really, really bad.

1094
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,180
You're tripping.

1095
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,660
Okay, now we know.

1096
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,560
Okay, we're going to lie on top of you, all three of us.

1097
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:41,840
Yeah.

1098
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,520
And hold you down.

1099
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,320
And it's going to be.

1100
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,920
Make room.

1101
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,820
So the train of fate goes over us.

1102
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,500
Hug therapy.

1103
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,760
Yes, I'm going to start here.

1104
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,300
You start how?

1105
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,420
What do you think I should do?

1106
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,480
Just.

1107
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,120
Well, we'll be there in just a minute.

1108
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,240
Just lie still now.

1109
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,520
And enjoy the rain.

1110
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:57,900
Rainbow.

1111
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:58,840
Wow.

1112
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,440
Isn't it beautiful?

1113
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,880
Are you guys going to tie me down?

1114
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,180
I don't want to be tied down.

1115
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,420
No, we won't tie you down.

1116
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:03,800
We're not that kind of doctor.

1117
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,300
We're just going to lie on top of you.

1118
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,360
We're good doctors.

1119
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,340
We've washed your little brain and put it back in your brain pan, and you'll be fine.

1120
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,520
Right, because it's your brain.

1121
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:12,860
Wow.

1122
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,940
We don't want to.

1123
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,820
And we use warm water.

1124
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,420
We just want.

1125
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
I can get a new heart.

1126
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,420
And courage.

1127
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,380
Yeah.

1128
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,740
You know, this is your brain on dust.

1129
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,660
Or rather.

1130
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,840
And what's the third thing we mix in?

1131
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,640
I forget, because I do this so much.

1132
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,040
Heart, courage.

1133
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,720
I just scooped it out of the can here.

1134
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,500
And the brain.

1135
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,940
Snakes and snails.

1136
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,760
Puppiedog.

1137
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,060
A living brain.

1138
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
A human brain.

1139
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,380
Sugar.

1140
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:34,740
Here we go.

1141
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,840
Starting the operation.

1142
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,240
Then you might just want to get back to Kansas.

1143
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:38,880
I think my arm aches a little bit.

1144
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,380
Really?

1145
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,440
Okay, we'll fix that too.

1146
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,920
Yeah, thank you.

1147
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,320
There you go.

1148
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,120
Okay, now we're dusting off the exterior of the brain pan.

1149
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,540
Okay, yeah, you keep doing that.

1150
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,580
It feels great.

1151
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,680
I'm awake, are you?

1152
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,340
I mean, I.

1153
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,440
No, we're both awake.

1154
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,080
I'm doing it right now.

1155
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,520
We're all awake.

1156
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,180
You're sleeping right now, right?

1157
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:54,860
Right.

1158
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,580
And I'm doing this right now.

1159
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,360
Somebody is, but I.

1160
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,760
I don't think it's me.

1161
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,020


1162
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,580
I think you do.

1163
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,680
I'm going to play 2001 for you.

1164
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,480
Well, a patient should sit there patiently.

1165
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,900
Yeah, and you'll be able to.

1166
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,260
You're listening to the soundtrack of 2001.

1167
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,100
And we'll just work on your brain.

1168
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,600
Okay, now we'll be right there.

1169
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:12,880
Hold on.

1170
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,440
Take a deep breath.

1171
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,320
All right, just relax.

1172
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,400
Don't laugh when you see my moon boots.

1173
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,680
Yeah.

1174
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,300
They are just really warm this time of year.

1175
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,440
She's going into trance now.

1176
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,020
That's right.

1177
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,320
That's very good.

1178
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,160
Are you going to take over, Doctor?

1179
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,560
Yes, I'll take over.

1180
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,680
Oh, I didn't mean to laugh.

1181
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,940
I was just looking down here.

1182
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,160
Now, remember, she is not in rapport with you, but I will cause her to respond only

1183
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,580
to the sound of your voice.

1184
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,680
All right.

1185
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,140
The next voice you hear will be Dr. Philo Drummond.

1186
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,420
I want you to respond only to this voice.

1187
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,000
Here is the backseat.

1188
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
My head's stiff.

1189
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,420
Next.

1190
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,560
Not so.

1191
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:08,880
Out.

1192
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:10,800
Down.

1193
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:10,800


1194
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,340
Mm-hmm, down.

1195
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1196
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1197
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1198
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1199
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1200
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1201
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1202
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1203
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1204
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1205
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1206
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1207
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


1208
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


1209
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


1210
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


1211
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,380


1212
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,420


1213
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,420


1214
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,420


1215
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,420


1216
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,420


1217
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,420


1218
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,480


1219
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,480


1220
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,720
There you go.

1221
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,860
And she has.

1222
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,140
She has to go.

1223
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,940
the phone, those little holes on the phone

1224
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,880
receiver will be pressed against your face.

1225
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,860
Those are from the great guidance Romain

1226
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,960
himself, those little holes.

1227
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,560
That's part of the regulation

1228
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,900
of uniform for a Romain

1229
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,520
from the planet Romain.

1230
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,680
Since she was young enough, we'll have to play some

1231
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,420
you know, some

1232
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,580
true enlightenment.

1233
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,460
Yes.

1234
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,820
Look into the center

1235
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,160
of your navel.

1236
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,720
There you will find the lint

1237
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,440
which is the essence

1238
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
of all being.

1239
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,820
You, the clouds,

1240
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,900
the sky, the little

1241
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,700
tortoise by the side of the road,

1242
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,920
the ugly factory chimney,

1243
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,580
belching smoke

1244
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,820
are all one

1245
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,160
with the universe.

1246
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,380
Take a deep breath.

1247
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,140
Now

1248
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,740
hold it in.

1249
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,280
This is prana.

1250
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,540
Prana

1251
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,140
is

1252
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,140


1253
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,680
means

1254
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,460
breath.

1255
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,860
To control your breath

1256
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,780
is

1257
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,480
to become

1258
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,920
a philosopher.

1259
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,060
Here, this cayenne pepper

1260
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,100
will control your breath.

1261
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,300
Yeah, have a little bit of

1262
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,820
pity for your

1263
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,560
fellow man.

1264
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:35,900
Yeah, right.

1265
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,320
I mean, hip hop

1266
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,220
a mental something.

1267
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,200
Jeez, come on.

1268
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,260
Come on, man.

1269
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,480
You get in the room with you

1270
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,780
and all of a sudden it smells like

1271
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,920
fried beef.

1272
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,760
If

1273
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,840
worse things than sliced beef

1274
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,080
Yeah, okay.

1275
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,700
Oh, I have to put my security

1276
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,020
Yeah, everybody's got their orders

1277
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,500
in the empty

1278
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,640
I can't get through the door.

1279
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,040
I'll be right there.

1280
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,220
I've just got to slide this

1281
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,560
security card in again.

1282
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,280
Let me scan Imaging for access.

1283
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,600
Okay, just give me a chance.

1284
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,340
Let me try it again.

1285
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,680
It worked here.

1286
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:02,980
I'll

1287
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,100
RSR system

1288
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,200
Damn, I need to turn it around.

1289
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,100
Yeah, it's

1290
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,100


1291
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,000
Yeah,

1292
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:08,620
I'll say that.

1293
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,280
Look, Philo, they're scanning it.

1294
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:11,740
That's who?

1295
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,180
That's the Imaging Scan Lady.

1296
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,720
Who, what lady?

1297
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,000
Imaging Scan.

1298
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,920
That's what you're looking at while you're doing it.

1299
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,340
What is this?

1300
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,660
Yeah, I was a joke, man.

1301
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,340
Don't worry about it.

1302
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,740
That lady, she's in a skin tight red suit of some kind.

1303
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,720
Are we done yet?

1304
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,380
Imaging Scan Lady.

1305
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,620
See what you're talking about.

1306
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:28,880


1307
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,740
Ah, but they granted my access.

1308
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,620
There she said, access granted, main title.

1309
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,680
Your Honor, may I have a moment, please?

1310
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,320
Go ahead.

1311
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,720
I would now like to call Mrs. Martha Norris.

1312
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,760
Yes, please.

1313
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,500
Chief Glass, you stated that Moe Riggs Donald Brown can truck a Pixar retail room.

1314
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,180
That's right.

1315
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,160
Then why Martha Longville Furrow and Julie Adams?

1316
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,180
Well, because.

1317
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,120
But is it that being drivers tell someone that's full to pass not truck?

1318
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,880
Well, no, that being drive them so exquisitely, I put that I.

1319
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,320
Thank you, that's all.

1320
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,760
My God, look at you.

1321
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,920
In other words, one with a badass must train be a half to Nazis.

1322
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,600
Oh.

1323
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,280
No, they wouldn't.

1324
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:16,980
I see.

1325
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,260
I believe you stated were unequal and your ankle frames you were killed and was for your husband.

1326
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,100
They would have been during the to walk.

1327
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,260
Yes, that's track, but not all I'd ride.

1328
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,840
Just look.

1329
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,500
Mr. Mason, I have no further questions of this witness.

1330
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,280
Court's adjourned.

1331
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,240
I have no further questions of this witness.

1332
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,300
And now, have you a trick to show us?

1333
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,540
Well, I'm going to show you now, a most unusual one, Don, one that you can do entirely by yourself.

1334
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,680
Oh, wait, Blackstone.

1335
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,620
You mean that we can fool ourselves with it?

1336
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,100
Absolutely.

1337
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,060
All you need's a pack of cobs.

1338
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,820
Now, Rhoda, take this pack, will you?

1339
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,120
And while my back is turned, deal nine cobs.

1340
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:07,540
OK.

1341
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,780
This is mystifying already.

1342
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,440
Have you finished dealing the heap, Rhoda?

1343
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
Have I finished dealing the heap,ottle?

1344
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1345
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1346
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1347
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1348
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1349
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1350
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,700


1351
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,560
All right.

1352
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,320
Let's count them all together.

1353
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,660
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

1354
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,600
You mean I have nine cards in my hand?

1355
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,600
Yes, nine.

1356
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,160
Boy, that's the most baffling trick you ever did.

1357
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,700
You mean that you did, Rhoda?

1358
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,420
Yes, whenever you try that trick exactly as I described it,

1359
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,380
you will always have nine cards.

1360
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,860
Say, I'm going to try that myself.

1361
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,500
I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen.

1362
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,700
And until next time, goodbye.

1363
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,140
Playwright Paul Halperin can't get over the woman who inspired him.

1364
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,720
The woman of his what dreams.

1365
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,080
You got to get back on the horse like I did with your sister.

1366
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,380
What dreams may come.

1367
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,480
Cool people, just people who consider themselves swinging.

1368
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,220
And if you consider yourself swinging, well, you just have to go to the

1369
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:03,680
house.

1370
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,040
It's the place to be and the place to be seen.

1371
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,720
It's a middle class image or an intellectual,

1372
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,620
totally intellectual.

1373
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,540
High intellectual.

1374
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,160
It grew naturally.

1375
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,040
And then for the adults, a desire on my part.

1376
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,940
And then high school girls.

1377
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,220
We'd like to do high school girls.

1378
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,800
It's a very beautiful thing.

1379
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,060
Time after time.

1380
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,160
When I first came, I realized that it was going to be real good.

1381
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,920
Kind of strange, but it's really worked out very well.

1382
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,440
Now you're ready.

1383
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,180
Seatelana bana

1384
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,180


1385
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,180


1386
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,420
of the

1387
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:45,660
plane.

1388
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,540
Place a small drop

1389
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,420
of cement

1390
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,180
on

1391
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,020
the collar's

1392
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:51,860
lobosity

1393
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,260
As another equally small drop

1394
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,740
on the airplane seat.

1395
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,460
Now with your tweezers lower and lower down

1396
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,060
Into the seat.

1397
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,500
Make sure the

1398
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,280
Hand L

1399
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,220
N attaches to flight stick LN1

1400
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,380
LN1

1401
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:11,680
IRAD be a man

1402
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:17,880
Now you are ready to cement the canopy on the top of the fuselage, DL.

1403
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:29,500
Place tab 32 and tab 33 in holes 33A and B.

1404
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,540
Now you are ready to apply the decals that came with your model.

1405
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,480
In a small bowl of water, soak the sheet containing the decal.

1406
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:49,400
You may wish to separate them using a pair of scissors for more easy application to your model.

1407
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,200
Now I have 20 wet decals and I have to put them all somewhere.

1408
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,360
Well, here, put them on this.

1409
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:02,000
And the really fun ones with the long, long, long white stripes or something that run along the top of a fuselage of an aircraft.

1410
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,080
And they would take forever to get aligned because you didn't know the trick about wetting the model first.

1411
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,180
You see, in World War II, they sought the transformation of global politics.

1412
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,520
Yeah.

1413
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,860
That was the hard part.

1414
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,300
You didn't know about that part.

1415
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,640
You didn't know all the little tricks.

1416
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:21,700
And so you wind up with a model smudged and fingerprints on the windows and the bad stripes.

1417
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,960
I think by the time I made my last model, I was starting to figure that stuff out.

1418
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,920
But by then, we burned so many models and pulled so many models up.

1419
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,400
I'd rather intend it to support justice and humanity.

1420
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,200
You want to leave?

1421
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,460
The United Nations.

1422
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,560
Out of here, man.

1423
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,580
The World Bank, the International Court of Justice, even Military Alliance.

1424
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,580
Well, Baldy with his 1,200-foot shoes divides South and Snowbird.

1425
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,260
It can be reached from Snowbird's Tramp via the high Baldy Traverse.

1426
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,020
Hey, Baldy, get off of there.

1427
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm almost finished.

1428
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,040
You just told your horse.

1429
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,260
I wasn't talking to you.

1430
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:09,440
Even during the worst years of the old war, that's the old war, too, and the global anarchy that followed,

1431
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,540
the process of international institution building has continued to develop and flourish.

1432
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,440
And they're going to build one near my house, an institution, that is.

1433
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,240
Actually, they're going to build it where my house used to be.

1434
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:33,380
They're going to tear down my house and put up a screwball institution, a happy farm, a wacky world.

1435
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,520
Ski the gee.

1436
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,180
They're going to set up the cuckoo bin.

1437
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,280
That's where my house used to be.

1438
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:40,720
Yeah.

1439
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,040
For a bunch of out-there widgets and wonkies.

1440
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,860
Well, I just don't know what the world's coming to.

1441
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,200
Oh, I'll get it.

1442
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,860
What is it, King?

1443
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,760
Say there's some bad men outside.

1444
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:06,260
Men who want to steal away the vitals of American democracy and erect in its place an obscene and purposeful entry.

1445
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,240
Hey, how long does, uh, forget all this.

1446
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,600
How long is it, uh...

1447
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,500
Can you imagine doing this show for three years?

1448
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,500
No.

1449
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,120
God.

1450
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,380
I can't imagine it.

1451
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,080
Me neither.

1452
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,300
Who would do that?

1453
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:29,860
Start with ten repetitions, working up to twelve, and then fifteen in weeks three and four.

1454
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:38,320
Roll forward, belly down, on the show until the show is under your shins and you are in the plank position.

1455
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,780
Keep your core tight.

1456
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:45,060
Do one push-up, and then initiate from the core.

1457
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,220
Pull the show with your feet until your knees touch your chest.

1458
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,020
Then roll the show out and repeat.

1459
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,980
Sounds like snap.

1460
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,800
But, is there a complication in the machinery to buy it?

1461
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,420
Sounds like snap.

1462
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,140
No, no, it's all, uh, like isometrics.

1463
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,580
You don't need anything but yourself.

1464
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,320
You just...

1465
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:09,020
You and the doorway, the squat thrust, the vertigo pogo stick.

1466
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,420
You just... You and the doorway, the squat thrust, the vertigo pogo stick.

1467
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,100
The extreme training.

1468
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:17,640
And with luck, you can be a champion.

1469
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,260
We don't know what kind of champion. That's up to you.

1470
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,740
You have to be a real spark plug off the old...

1471
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,540
Hey look, here they come down that side of the hill.

1472
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,120
Stay still. They won't see us.

1473
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,040
So long as we don't move.

1474
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,280
They're gonna walk by.

1475
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,380
He didn't want us to.

1476
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,180
Take the stick.

1477
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,400
That stick's got a scorpion on it.

1478
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,000
end of it.

1479
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,920
Shake the off.

1480
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,900
Push him in front of the car.

1481
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,000
Too late.

1482
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,940
All right, now we're beginning

1483
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,520
our approach back to Earth.

1484
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,680
Oh, yeah, it's that time.

1485
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,660
Yeah, we've got to start zooming back.

1486
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,040
Yeah, zooming onto the field that we're going to land in

1487
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,920
and then we have to push the building back into

1488
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,100
a position before anybody can see

1489
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,380
that we've been flying it around all night.

1490
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,140
Yeah, we have to make sure that they know

1491
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:06,800
that we...

1492
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,720
They don't know.

1493
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:09,700
Yeah.

1494
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,140
It's amazing the way they

1495
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,320
got along. They don't know

1496
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,480
about that special

1497
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,040
function.

1498
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,800
In the fullness of time, they'll catch up.

1499
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,800
Then they'll be sorry

1500
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,580
after me and my theories

1501
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,780
and I shall have remained

1502
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,620
sweet.

1503
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,840
As far as the kneeling

1504
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,540
figures, those

1505
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,540
are more dark than they can see.

1506
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,520
That's what I'm saying.

1507
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,920
Yeah, so, yeah, we're taxing in

1508
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,980
the building into position here.

1509
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,080
Okay, I'm

1510
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,760
recovering.

1511
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,720
Good. Good, good, good.

1512
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,580
The man, the myth, the legend

1513
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,280
and the show.

1514
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,700
Thank you for being with us tonight.

1515
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,360
All you grateful callers.

1516
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,000
Get out!

1517
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,480
Get out!

1518
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,600
Whoa, you spilled over a little bit.

1519
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,800
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1520
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,640
He just dropped all the listeners.

1521
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,480
Let me throw you a lightsaber,

1522
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,480
a Mars bar and a couple of mentos.

1523
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,660
All right.

1524
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,040
He's coming into shore, ladies and gentlemen.

1525
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,140
Don't forget, you can't fool Bob.

1526
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,540
He tried to swim the English Channel.

1527
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,520
Now we must add his name to that.

1528
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,520
That long list of losers

1529
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,640
will never make it.

1530
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,560
Don't forget your new copy

1531
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:43,600
of Revelation X.

1532
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,580
Oh, yeah. They're supposed to send me one

1533
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,860
in the mail. It hasn't come.

1534
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,200
What's the story there?

1535
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:50,840
Stang.

1536
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,040
Well, it's a long, long complicated story.

1537
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,440
Yeah, Stang. Where's my copy, Stang?

1538
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,920
I don't have a copy.

1539
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,640
Give me a...

1540
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,520
Bring me my horse.

1541
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,920
Morigard, come here, boy.

1542
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:03,740
I want you.

1543
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,380
Uh...

1544
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:05,600
Ugh.

1545
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,700
Get out from under that car.

1546
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,680
Ugh.

1547
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,660
Now, drop trowel.

1548
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,120
Whoa.

1549
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:19,660
And

1550
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,060
King Kong, of course,

1551
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,660
we have to see once a week because of how

1552
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,920
it just makes me drink

1553
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,740
because I have to watch this thing again and again.

1554
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,060
Good luck.

1555
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,480
Drink.

1556
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:34,800
Well, if you drink like that,

1557
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,460
you're going to rot your...

1558
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,720
You're going to rot your liver out in no time.

1559
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,860
You'll have to have an extreme makeover.

1560
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:41,860
Whoa.

1561
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,560
Whoa.

1562
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,120
Man.

1563
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,020
There's no end.

1564
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,080
OnlineKPFA.org.

1565
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,900
And the show is leaking.

1566
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:50,100
And it's leaking into the next show.

1567
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,120
It's puzzling evidence.

1568
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,400
More than an hour, less than a show.

1569
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,420
We're reviewing movies now.

1570
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,260
Sometimes we talk about Bob.

1571
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:56,980
Some of our favorite movies.

1572
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,100
Yeah, sometimes we talk about Bob.

1573
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,660
But most of the time,

1574
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,680
because people are driving to work right now,

1575
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:06,040
and they're thinking about...

1576
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,260
They're thinking about their cell phones.

1577
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,820
They're thinking about Slack.

1578
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,740
They're thinking about all the things that they have

1579
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,540
and wish they had, don't have.

1580
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,960
And they just wish the show would go away.

1581
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:21,140
And we hope to provide that right now.

1582
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,520
So...

1583
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:38,380
Woo!

1584
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,860
A puzzling evidence show, friends.

1585
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,880
Got all wet.

1586
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,680
You know, like this show,

1587
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,020
you can download that show, too,

1588
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,920
from KPFA and Berkeley

1589
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,900

You can reach us on the web at www.devo.org.

1600
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,740
Keep your eyes on your head and close your eyes.

1601
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,060
Joy must decrease, and you must increase.

1602
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,140
Supernatural power.

1603
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:27,600
Klingon.

1604
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:27,980
Klingon.

1605
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,400
Painful.

1606
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:28,720
Rod.

1607
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:31,200
A-G-I-I-N-G-L-E-N-G-S.

1608
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,120
Pink's commentary on the subject.

1609
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:33,660
Nimrod.

1610
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,320
Through Nimrod.

1611
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:34,920
Nimrod.

1612
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,100
Nimrod.

1613
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,500
Choose to come.

1614
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:36,060
Choose to come.

1615
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,520
Nimrod.

1616
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:36,520


1617
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:36,680
Nimrod.

1618
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,000
Nimrod.

1619
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,300
Word.

1620
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,360
Yep, yep.

1621
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,720
We don't have the prayer.

1622
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,180
Word prays you for being so big, so good.

1623
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,200
Lay your hand on us.
