1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:10,400
Lieutenant. Lieutenant. Yeah, yeah, I'm listening. Lieutenant. Yeah, yeah, I'm listening. There's someone opening the door. Lieutenant! Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,580
You didn't need a thumb through my note card.

3
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,940
This time he danced as if the puppet strings from his brain had been cut away and the madness was complete.

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,000
The genius.

5
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:47,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm capable of conducting search and rescue missions, also transporting boats in Wilmington, North Carolina.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,680
This city, the city, and so, so, still here.

7
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,280
President Trump.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,600
Oh, I think everybody's happy.

9
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,420
President Trump's sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,640
100% happy.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,100
The Trumps is accused of being a serial killer.

12
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:14,480
Investigators say Trump has confessed to killing four women to set up a militarized Turkey near the U.S.-Mexico border.

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,300
Turkey often collide.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,080
The Dow is 93-92-2662-114-2662.

15
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,560
In other news, you're listening to PR News.

16
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,380
You like pain?

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,400
No, pink.

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,140
Oh, pink.

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,680
No, I like pain.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,920
He likes pain.

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,100
But the pain comes strictly through mind absorption.

22
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,620
And Bob likes green.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,880
Many teaching techniques.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,140
It's misralling.

25
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:48,820
Bob and the word of Bob teaches you to recapture the slack that the conspiracy took away from you the minute that doctor hit your butt when you were born.

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,900
Can you guys give the listeners a definition or some definitions of slack?

27
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,620
Slack, by definition, is...

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,700
Indefinable.

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,800
It's an essence that if you have to ask what it is, you've probably never had it unless you think about it.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,520
Those who say don't know and those who don't know.

31
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,880
The difference between slack and no slack was the time you were 14 and finally called that girl up.

32
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,660
And when she knew who you were when you identified yourself on the phone, that was the beginning of slack, you see.

33
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,160
But then again, getting the date or anything like that was not slack.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,700
It was that moment when suddenly something went the way you wanted it to go without you.

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,680
And you were thinking about it.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,780
It was something that was totally not involved when your feet were involved rather than your head.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,780
Slack is getting things to run smooth without trying.

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,760
Without trying.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,720
You give up and you get everything.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,060
It's like a submission of the self to the white overlighting in Buddhism.

41
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,500
The Atman surrenders to the holy oneness without thinking about it.

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,100
It's not give to get.

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,900
It's give up and get anyway.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,780
It's repent.

45
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,120
It's get.

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,740
Repent.

47
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,060
Quit your job and get rich.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,180
Get rich.

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,400
Or get mad.

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,240
Or get evil.

51
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,760
Slack off, my friend.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
Don't be embarrassed.

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
And Bob will give you slack.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,180
Bob watches over drunkards, idiots, froth heads, and all subgeniuses.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,180
Slack is like going through that old wallet that you lost so long ago and found it in a big dust ball in the corner of the room.

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,820
You go through it.

57
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,480
You find a $100 bill in it.

58
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,400
Man, that's slack.

59
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,620
And Reverend Stang tries to remind us that we're born with slack.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,080
And if you don't have any,

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,880
then someone else has got it.

62
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,800
Because you got your share.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,580
And if you don't have it,

64
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,840
it's where it should be.

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,600
And that's the conspiracy.

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,780
It's that boss that treats workers like they were property.

67
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,600
But if you have lost it, it is possible to get it back.

68
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,340
Through Bob.

69
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,420
Through Bob.

70
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,500
With holding tax takes away your slack.

71
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,820
Through Bob and the right amount of money.

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:54,060
I mean, you know, people have to realize that they're spending incredible amounts of money that isn't worth anything on short duration pleasures of the flesh.

73
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,000
Slack money.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,980
The money they pay for that Porsche.

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,520
The money they pay for that Z car.

76
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,540
Not only for that slack, but false sex.

77
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,640
For that new video game.

78
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,340
False sex.

79
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:02,420


80
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,520
Massage parlors.

81
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,880
Yellow Rose.

82
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
Topless bars in Austin Tech.

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,160
All of that stuff, you know, that's false.

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,820
For less than that, they could spend less than drinks for one person in one evening and achieve salvation.

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
True slack.

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,700
You can evolve through laziness.

87
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,280
It can be done.

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,940
You can get rich off procrastination.

89
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,140
I live like Bob.

90
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,960
That book is a powerful book.

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


92
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


95
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


97
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,960


98
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:25,980
It's a powerful book.

99
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,280
It's a powerful tool.

100
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,100
Wow, friends.

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,440
That recording was from over one million years ago.

102
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,720
But it has Dr. G. Gordon Gordon in it.

103
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:49,660
Well, this episode, Hour of Slack number 1716, if you can believe that, is a continuation of last week's shows composed of three shows.

104
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,960
And I basically had to assemble this while vacuuming my house and swabbing through the walls.

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,220
I had to do this because I have 13 house guests coming in two days.

106
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,540
And then we're all going to go to Austin for the subgenius movie premiere at South by Southwest Film Festival.

107
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:17,760
And coming up is part two of the interview about that movie with me and Sandy Boone, the director on a show called Lights, Camera, Austin.

108
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:25,580
Following that, as promised, will be the last eight minutes of Dr. Philo Drummond.

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,580
And I'm going to be talking about the first episode of the show, which is going to be about the first time that Dr. Philo Drummond was on the Puzzling Evidence show before he left California.

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,220
And it's kind of touching.

111
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:54,140
And then, as threatened, we'll hear about 12 minutes more of that horrible time for the show show where I had to call in, as it were, using my laptop and sketchy Wi-Fi, which made for these weird time lags that make me sound much drunker than I was.

112
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,160
And I'm going to be talking about that.

113
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:03,820
However, what's even more obvious to me listening back to that one is how deaf I still am, even with hearing aids.

114
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,360
Honestly, I just couldn't really hear those guys well.

115
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,360
So I'm just guessing sometimes.

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,820
But first, OK, that documentary movie about the church that we've been yakking about for two years.

117
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,060
The trailer came out today.

118
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,740
And here's the soundtrack from it.

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,560
Have you ever wondered about your name?

120
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:25,920
Have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

121
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,860
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps, chants emanating from their apartment?

122
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,040
I was once a degenerate, but Bob saved me.

123
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
It's the church of the subgenius.

124
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,320
Their prophet's name is Bob.

125
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,440
I found an image of Bob's head in a bedpan.

126
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,680
Praise Bob!

127
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,280
If Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves, we could talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,100
I grew up as a little white boy in the 1950s in a middle class home.

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,080
I really did feel like a weirdo.

130
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,160
We had this sort of an icon we could blame everything on.

131
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,980
The conspiracy of normalcy.

132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,340
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocratons, these normals who have made normality the norm?

133
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,680
We were grasping for this crazy religion to help us see the light.

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,200
We tied together every fringe belief you could think of.

135
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,820
It made perfect sense to me.

136
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,860
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

137
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,980
We offer eternal salvation or triple your money back.

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,460
The subgenius was a club. It was a badge.

139
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,320
You may think it's funny. We hope you do.

140
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,160
We are trying to deliver medicine of a sort.

141
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,480
Y'all are out to put down outrageous cult groups.

142
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,720
What does this mean?

143
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,660
No, no, this is an outrageous cult group.

144
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,900
Not everyone in the church of the subgenius gets along with one another.

145
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,620
He's a shirt on his head!

146
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,680
It was a little bit scary. We realized some crazy people are attracted to this.

147
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,040
It got a little too far out for me.

148
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,660
It's very effective to slice the world up and to pit everyone against each other.

149
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,300
We believe that you do need to eliminate and exterminate all the normals.

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,660
If you want to sell a religion, you need to do it.

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,660
If you want to sell a religion, you have to kill the deity. That's how you do it.

152
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,980
The conspiracy constantly grows and it is worse than ever.

153
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,640
There's always going to be a conspiracy.

154
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,500
It can morph and it can evolve and so can the church of the subgenius.

155
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,960
We actually are a religion that seems like an art piece, that seems like a religion,

156
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,700
that seems like performance art, that seems like a joke, that seems like a religion.

157
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,720
Doug aka Reverend Tsang, at what point did you feel that the church became less about you and Steve aka Philo

158
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,580
and more about others, that perhaps this was becoming something bigger than you intended it to be?

159
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,060
Well, it was always about Bob. We kept the focus on Bob.

160
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,660
I generally was presenting myself as just a little boy.

161
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:23,660


162
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,420
I just work here. I'm just the scribe on this thing.

163
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:40,140
The first people who got in contact with us after encountering this weird little publication we'd done,

164
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,700
all of them got it.

165
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,840
But as we got better and better known in the early 80s,

166
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:59,400
it did start to attract people that I could only describe as differently-signed.

167
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:09,320
I learned not to just let any subgenius come stay at my house.

168
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:19,160
We had a lot of interesting house guests and after a while, it got a little bit too interesting.

169
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,820
But it was interesting.

170
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:29,820
But what Sandy's film does a really good job of is putting the whole thing in perspective with the current events of the time.

171
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,820
A lot of what we were doing was a reaction against what we saw as kind of a...

172
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:45,060
I mean, there really is a conspiracy of normal people just instinctively keeping down anything different.

173
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,040
It's just a kind of a fear of the different.

174
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,940
And there's...

175
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,740
You see a lot of clips in the film that remind you of the atmosphere of the times.

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,100
For instance, at Jonestown, mass suicide had happened.

177
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,100
There's references to the Heaven's Gate thing.

178
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,320
A lot of people thought that was us at first.

179
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,440
Right.

180
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,960
One of the lines of...

181
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,460
The reason we used the Jonestown is because we said,

182
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,000
if...

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,440
One of their slogans was, if Jim Jones could have 900 people kill themselves, we can get 900 people to give us a dollar.

184
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,400
And so that's...

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,780
Yeah.

186
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,300
Yeah.

187
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,120
The funny thing is nobody believes that we're really asking for a dollar anymore.

188
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,860
A dollar is like a penny.

189
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,280
They think it's a joke.

190
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,140
However, they don't mind spending more.

191
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Nobody wants to spend one dollar.

192
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,500
Because how can you get anything for that?

193
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
Actually, the pamphlet's not bad.

194
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,280
But it's...

195
00:11:50,160 --> 00:12:00,300
And also, we were working and living in Dallas, which is aptly described as the buckle on the Bible Belt.

196
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:06,900
So we were big fans of a lot of radio preachers that we thought were pretty outrageous.

197
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,840
But at the same time, they were also very entertaining and kind of easy to imitate.

198
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,300
At first, I...

199
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,940
I didn't...

200
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,700
I hadn't found my own preacher voice.

201
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,440
And I was kind of doing a pseudo Jimmy Swaggart.

202
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,400
He was a really talented evangelist, kind of the Mick Jagger of preachers.

203
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:44,440
And we borrowed a lot from some of those guys in terms of just dramatic and outrageous accusations and promises made in sermons.

204
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,260
That kind of thing is really funny.

205
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,680
And I had a lot of fun to do.

206
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,560
And we...

207
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,540
I did not plan on being a preacher.

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,340
I kind of had stage fright.

209
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,180
But there was another guy in Dallas who used the name Reverend Buck Naked who was doing subgenius preaching.

210
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,820
And he was funny.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,300
He came up with some great ideas.

212
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,900
But I didn't like his style completely.

213
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,100
I felt like, okay, somebody's got to do it.

214
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,520
I guess it's me.

215
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,820
So, I got over my stage fright gradually.

216
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,400
We found ourselves doing...

217
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Working with rock and roll bands and strange experimental bands that we called doctor bands.

218
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,180
And doing shows in clubs.

219
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,980
Not usually real fancy clubs.

220
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,800
Just, you know, bars and things.

221
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,840
But occasionally, we would be invited to do our art museum performances.

222
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,500
That's what we did.

223
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,600
And they seemed to think we were doing performance art.

224
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,720
Which I had never heard of.

225
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,700
But apparently, that's one of the many things we were doing.

226
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,700
We were also doing male art.

227
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,480
Which was a big thing in the 80s.

228
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,100
Just before the internet.

229
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,360
When the internet hit, that kind of saved us from total obscurity.

230
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,360
I was about to give up on the whole thing.

231
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,540
It was just costing more than it was making.

232
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,720
Somehow.

233
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,180
I guess Bob was siphoning off all the real profits.

234
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,000
Some magical way.

235
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:25,200
But the internet made it possible for fringe people to encounter each other a lot easier.

236
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,460
By the same token, it allows people to live in their own little bubble of delusion.

237
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,800
Because there's always 10,000 other people that believe what you want to believe.

238
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,200
But we had a lot of fun with the internet.

239
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,600
Plus, it opened our radio shows up to a much wider audience.

240
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,700
You know, you can hear them anywhere in the world.

241
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,040
Now.

242
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,500
So, that kind of thing was like free publicity.

243
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,900
And it kept us going.

244
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,020
I got to the point where it was a full-time job for me.

245
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,340
And I kind of quit working for other folks back in the late 90s.

246
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,680
What a relief.

247
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,720
So, I basically run all the mail order side of the whole thing.

248
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,500
Which is not hard to keep up with.

249
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,280
It's a little bit like being the people who make ant farms.

250
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,120
Or the, you know, sea monkeys.

251
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,920
Yeah.

252
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,980
But one of the things, even before the internet, by word of mouth and because of all these artists,

253
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,520
it was attracting more and more people.

254
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,720
And Devo really brought it into the light, too.

255
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,060
They were very, very interested.

256
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,560
And Mother's Ball.

257
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,060
And they actually showed up at one of the main divivals in Dallas-Fort Worth.

258
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,140
But then we knew.

259
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,280
I mean, Austin was a very different place then.

260
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,000
And so, Jonathan Demme, who, he's done Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia and a lot of them.

261
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,160
He actually came to town.

262
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,740
And he would come to our house.

263
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,420
It was before he became well-off, you know.

264
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,480
And they would come to Austin just to hang out and listen to the music and stuff.

265
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,620
And he brought David Byrne to the house.

266
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,400
And he brought John Sayles.

267
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,020
And it was like they all came out and hang out to have dinner.

268
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,040
It was just normal people.

269
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,040
And they loved the tongue-in-cheek humor.

270
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,700
And before you know it, it just took off.

271
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,420
And it took off in many different areas.

272
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,100
So there is like an Arkansas group.

273
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,620
And there's a New York group.

274
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,140
And there's a San Francisco group.

275
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,420
Sandy, with your documentary, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

276
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,920
you chronicle the good times and you chronicle the bad times.

277
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:40,140
And so there seems to be this demarcation mark when it comes to July 5, 1998, which is X Day.

278
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:50,340
This is a date that the Church of the Subgenius claimed before the date that it would be the day that the members would get power over the normal.

279
00:16:51,500 --> 00:17:00,120
And I'm kind of wondering if that date, did you see that when you were doing your research and sort of observing the church in action,

280
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,840
did you see this approaching date as perhaps something that would be challenging to the church,

281
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,780
especially in how it would get past that date and continue to...

282
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,240
remain active?

283
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,840
Yes, and it was actually very difficult to figure out from that point on how do you...

284
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,560
We wanted...

285
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,400
In the movie, we're trying to make people think maybe the church was ended, maybe...

286
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,600
You know, keeping them curious the entire time.

287
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,000
And so the movie somewhat ends like three different times,

288
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,520
and we're showing how they just keep coming back and keep coming back.

289
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,980
And as Doug will tell you that they never, when they gave that date,

290
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,920
they never thought that the church would be around in 1998.

291
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:39,900
So...

292
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,960
And all of a sudden, here it's there.

293
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,960
And so they turned it into this performance art and made a big joke out of it.

294
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
And Doug has this...

295
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,340
Doug, the way you say that when you're saying, you know, sometimes it may be 1998.

296
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,260
Sometimes, can you do that little spiel?

297
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,920
I think it's real funny how, you know, where we're talking about the last revival where you describe,

298
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,480
well, it didn't happen in 1998, but it could be what the next date.

299
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,920
Right. We don't know what year this really is.

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,380
We don't...

301
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,080
And we're just taking their word for it.

302
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,900
We're just taking their word for what planet this is, for that matter.

303
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,980
So consequently, we're out there waiting for the world to end every July 5th.

304
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:26,360
If we'd known we'd have to get up at 7 in the morning every July 5th for 25 years,

305
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,460
we might have set a different time.

306
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,960
But that wasn't up to us.

307
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:37,220
You know, we can't tell the men from Planet X when to show up and destroy the unbelievers and save the believers.

308
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,220
So we faithfully gather in various campgrounds.

309
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,860
Usually, we like to keep it challenging.

310
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,300
We don't want it to turn into like science fiction and comic conventions in motels.

311
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,020
Those are fun, but we wanted it to be more of an adventure.

312
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,940
Also, we couldn't afford motels.

313
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,200
And so it became this regular thing.

314
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,720
We had a regular camp out, and the veterans of the X Day events are really good friends.

315
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,940
And we've also hooked up...

316
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:23,600
There's a kind of a neo-pagan festival that happens at the same place called Starwood Festival

317
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,580
that's much bigger and has people who are a little bit more serious about their beliefs,

318
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,140
but they're very eclectic at the same time.

319
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,340
And there's been quite a bit of crossover between us and the pagans.

320
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,940
And as Sandy pointed out, the bands like Devo...

321
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,680
It's always weird novelty bands for some reason, people wearing masks.

322
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,860
And the underground comic books of the late 70s and early 80s,

323
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,000
those were a huge influence on Philo and me

324
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
and a lot of the other...

325
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,800
main collaborators,

326
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:14,180
some of whom were those self-same comic book artists that we admired,

327
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,320
like Paul Mavridis and Gilbert Shelton,

328
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,880
who did the fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

329
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,860
Actually, they both worked on that.

330
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,780
Gilbert's an Austin...

331
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,320
He was originally from Austin.

332
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,000
And I've run into several old hippies in Austin

333
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,020
that claimed they knew the fabulous Furry Freak Brothers,

334
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,460
and they were characters in real life,

335
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,000
but they never did exist in real life.

336
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,080
They were just characters based on types that Gilbert had encountered.

337
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,540
And likewise, we run into people who swear that they met J.R. Bob Dobbs.

338
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,660
We even run into people who claim they are Bob Dobbs.

339
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,980
And there's something else about 1998.

340
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
The problem...

341
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,860
This is an organization run by humans,

342
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,080
with human frailties.

343
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,680
And so...

344
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,260
There were lies caught up in this,

345
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,680
and how families were harmed by...

346
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,540
just because they were associated with a subgenius,

347
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,480
even though it wasn't this vile, evil thing.

348
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,220
But it was made out to be.

349
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
And I think it was really important to show

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,220
that mental stability of different people also affected it.

351
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,480
And the church's input from Papa Joe Mama,

352
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,540
where he got on NPR right after certain events,

353
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,040
and he...

354
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,780
He spilled stuff,

355
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,100
and he made it look like it was truly evil,

356
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,820
which was never supposed to be.

357
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,620
And was there any discussion about perhaps ending the...

358
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,580
dissolving the Church of the Subgenius

359
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,900
once you hit that July 5th, 1998 date?

360
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,240
That perhaps, you know,

361
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,300
you've hit this date,

362
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,560
and this would be a good time to sort of...

363
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,280
Okay, this was fun while it lasted,

364
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,080
and let's now move forward, go our separate ways.

365
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,660
Well, that's what some people say.

366
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,780
And I think that's what people expected would happen.

367
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,520
But the way we looked at it was,

368
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,200
hey, this is the first time we've actually made any money off this thing.

369
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,940
Let's keep it going.

370
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,100
And I'm really glad we did.

371
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,040
I mean, it was pretty dicey for a while there.

372
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,460
Just, you know,

373
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,480
how do you balance making a living with this thing that doesn't really...

374
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,660
You know, it's never going to be a big fad.

375
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,560
It's never going to make us rich.

376
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,060
If it did, that would mean we were doing something dreadfully wrong.

377
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,600
And it would only last a few months, you know.

378
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,040
Then it would be burned out.

379
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,280
Yeah, but it didn't help either that their premise was, you know,

380
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,800
get slack and everybody quit their jobs.

381
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,980
Right. Well, we've...

382
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,140
Then you have all these members with no jobs and no money.

383
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,620
Yeah.

384
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,980
The Church of the Subgenius motto is,

385
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,220
you know, effeminate, they can't take a joke.

386
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,840
And the whole point is, you know,

387
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,720
you either get the joke immediately

388
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,400
or you don't get the joke at all.

389
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,580
But how do you deal with the people

390
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,180
who latched onto the Church of the Subgenius,

391
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,320
didn't get the joke,

392
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,100
and sort of decided that this was something

393
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,440
that they wanted to be a part of

394
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,780
for simply because they felt like outsiders.

395
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,260
This was a group that they felt aligned with,

396
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,620
and they took very seriously,

397
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,260
as opposed to sort of realizing that it is a parody religion.

398
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,800
Right. Doug, tell them about your first crazy

399
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,080
that you stepped, you know,

400
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,040
when you were doing one of the devivals in San Francisco.

401
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,300
Well, yeah, we had a...

402
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,760
Probably the biggest show we ever did

403
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,560
was in 1984 in San Francisco.

404
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,180
It was such a big show that we had a Bob look-alike there

405
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,240
who was shot by one of his own followers.

406
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,940
That was the end of the show.

407
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,260
A lot of people thought the church would end right there.

408
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,420
But there was a guy who came up to me afterwards,

409
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,720
and he was furious.

410
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,900
Because he was saying things like,

411
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,340
Stang, Stang, those people in Dallas that invented this

412
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,000
are going to kill you for turning it into

413
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,200
some kind of Sonny and Cher comedy thing.

414
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,720
I mean, this is serious.

415
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,360
He'd pull out this copy of the book of the subgenius

416
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,940
that he had marked up, and he'd go,

417
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,580
Look what it says right here. Stop what you are doing now.

418
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,960
And I'm going, Yeah, I wrote that myself.

419
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,940
What the hell are you talking about?

420
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,420
Now, I had never encountered anybody

421
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,800
like that before, and it was hard for me

422
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,180
to believe it was even happening.

423
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,460
But every year there was one or two that would try to tell us

424
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,060
what we were doing wrong by being funny.

425
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,960
I mean, these people really wanted to get the normals.

426
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,420
Whereas what we were doing was a takeoff on the tendency

427
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,540
of people to divide everything into us and them

428
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,400
in these simplified ways.

429
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,560
And what we're trying to do is pop holes in stereotypes

430
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,820
and point out that, I don't know,

431
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,900
we're a cartoon of the people's tendency to turn reality

432
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,320
into a cartoon, which has become easier now with the Internet.

433
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,580
Oddly enough, it didn't spread education.

434
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,340
It spread different forms of delusion faster than anything.

435
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Was there a point, though, when it, for you,

436
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,940
as an outsider standing, looking in, and as Doug obviously

437
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,820
is heavily involved in the church, was there a point

438
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,580
when perhaps it no longer was a joke?

439
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,600
I know you go into sort of post Columbine, post 9-11

440
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,860
in the documentary, but looking inward, looking outward,

441
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,780
was there a point that it just, the sort of joke wasn't funny anymore?

442
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,240
Oh, no.

443
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,260
Because we kept it mutated so fast.

444
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,920
There were so many people involved.

445
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
And we pick on ourselves.

446
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,320
I mean, one of the things that we're making fun of the most

447
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,360
is ourselves.

448
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:27,440
It's like, it's kind of hard to explain, but we know how weird

449
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,240
we may look to others.

450
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,400
And we try to play on that.

451
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:41,340
And at the same time, try to keep the really angry people,

452
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,300
try to get them laughing again.

453
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,020
It's not a room full of people chanting.

454
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,400
It's a room full of people laughing.

455
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
That's how it keeps from turning into a cult.

456
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,440
And when somebody starts taking it too seriously, they start getting it.

457
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,900
And they're getting made fun of by all the other subgeniuses around them.

458
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,980
And then they get offended.

459
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,860
And then they spend the rest of their lives talking about how we're just

460
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,260
money-grubbing bad guys.

461
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,540
I wish.

462
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,680
I wish I knew how to be a better money-grubber.

463
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,000
But we unfortunately decided to start an anti-business business,

464
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,420
an anti-art project, and an anti-money-grubbing project.

465
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,380
Science, science project.

466
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,580
Yes, but in all honesty, though, we have to admit that during 9-11

467
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,260
and also the Columbine situation.

468
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,040
But it wasn't that there was so people.

469
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,540
The entire United States and the world were struggling with how do we make

470
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,480
a joke about something that's so painful?

471
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:56,860
How do we help people through their mourning and make them see the other side?

472
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,980
Because humor does that for people.

473
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,040
And so, you know, F on this, they don't take a joke.

474
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,880
But how far?

475
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,000
And it wasn't just the subgenius.

476
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,740
It was late-night comedy and talk shows and stuff were all struggling, you know,

477
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,740
with how, when.

478
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,400
When can we make a joke of this?

479
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,000
How do we make a joke of this?

480
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,580
Or is this where it ends with the joke?

481
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:26,120
Has there been renewed interest in the church of subgenius during Trump's presidency?

482
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,460
I think so.

483
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,960
Doug, you would have to answer that in one way.

484
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,160
But as far as when I come in, first I'm explaining again what the church is about

485
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,460
and everything.

486
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,620
And I look totally normal.

487
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,440
And they're going, what are you doing?

488
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,680
And I'm going, you have to understand the influence this group had and how many people

489
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,460
it actually helped.

490
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,920
It didn't just, you know, and lifted up and raised up and how it causes people to

491
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,960
truly think outside of the box.

492
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,040
And I'm just so proud of that.

493
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,260
And I also can see it.

494
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,840
I think it's a great way to show that when they're making humor from politics and they're

495
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,160
poking and pointing at all of our human frailties as human beings, whether, no matter what

496
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,260
political stance you take, you know, they'll jump on the opposite side of either way you're

497
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,600
going to go.

498
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,920
So, Doug, has there been renewed interest in the church?

499
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,460
And are you expecting more interest once the documentary, the J.R.

500
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,200
Ball's dogs in the church of subgenius starts playing?

501
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,280
Or is it just the festival circuit and receives a release?

502
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,600
We're, we've had a record of about every 10 years we're the coolest thing on the block

503
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,540
for about a month.

504
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,680
I think when the movie comes out and I hope lots of people see it, I think a lot of people

505
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,260
go, what?

506
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,240
They're still around?

507
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,340
I remember that.

508
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,560
Boy, that's all we could talk about in college 30 years ago.

509
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,760
And now they've, now they've got a little bit more money.

510
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,180
So, you know, that's cool.

511
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,660
that may be helpful. I certainly wouldn't mind selling more ordainments. You know,

512
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:10,000
we do actually ordain people. I am an actual minister, technically. I can do marriages. I've

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,220
done, I've lost count of how many people I've married together. And a lot of them were folks

514
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:22,180
who met because of the Church of the Subgenius. It actually has done a lot more people good than

515
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,540
it's harmed anybody because a lot of them just felt alone. They didn't know there was anybody

516
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:37,840
else out there thinking those kinds of thoughts, especially in small towns. And they'd run into

517
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,540
this subgenius stuff, either the book or maybe even one of the radio shows, and go,

518
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:49,180
wow, I have brothers and sisters out there somewhere. I've got to know more about this.

519
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,020
And of course, other people just think it's funny and they don't want to meet

520
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:58,080
any subgeniuses in real life. That's kind of sad because they're actually mostly really,

521
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:04,080
really interesting. I've met some of the coolest and longest lasting friends in my life through

522
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:14,140
this thing. It's been great for a lot of us just in terms of making friends.

523
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,120
But also, you know, when we started this, the one thing that you were concerned about is

524
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,980
Doug is 65 now. And

525
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:27,780
the group is getting older and he didn't want to pass away. And this turned into a real cult,

526
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,180
you know, and that he said he wanted to make sure that, you know, he broke character and that he

527
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,040
let people know without question that this is a joke, always has been a joke.

528
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:47,420
Well, it's a joke, but it has its serious aspects. Nuggets of wisdom buried in the

529
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,860
manure is one way of somebody put it. And,

530
00:31:52,180 --> 00:32:02,000
uh, but yeah, there is, there is a tendency for people to want to make it into like a little army,

531
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:10,800
little fight club thing. And, uh, this has happened before. There's a lot of cases of,

532
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:21,500
I mean, really large fringe religions growing from things that were originally a satirical pamphlet.

533
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:30,420
Uh, it's, and I mean, it's for hundreds of years that has happened. And, uh, you'd think,

534
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,500
right, that nobody could look at this stuff and take it at face value,

535
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,320
but there's much weirder things out there that people do take very seriously. And, uh,

536
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,720
so yeah, I, I wanted to make sure that it was understood where this came from there. It's not

537
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,240
magic.

538
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,780
So is the plan, is the plan, Doug,

539
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,260
for when, when you and, uh, when your co-founder,

540
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,440
the pathway for the church to come to an end?

541
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:08,340
I don't think we have any power over that. It's, uh, I'd say most of the, the vast majority of

542
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,300
people out there on the internet who identify themselves as subgeniuses or subgenius fans

543
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:21,280
never actually joined or sent any money in at all. Uh, and, and, uh, there's a,

544
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:27,540
there's a group called the discordians that was started as just for fun by a couple of people.

545
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:33,180
It, it, it got bigger and bigger. The, the people, the guy who originally wrote the, uh,

546
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:40,800
the discordian stuff disavowed it and dropped out, but you still run into obnoxious discordians

547
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:49,220
today. There's a lot of crossover between us and them. Uh, and we were inspired by, uh, uh, uh,

548
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,320
a discordian.

549
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,680
Based novel called, uh, Illuminatus by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson,

550
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:06,660
who later became our friends. Uh, and, uh, uh, so it has, it'll continue long after,

551
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:13,980
after we're dead, but there will always be a Sandy's movie that people can pull out and go,

552
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,460
Hey, look, look, settle down. This is where this came from.

553
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,260
Okay.

554
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,060
In a way, I really would love to reach.

555
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,480
Uh, the younger generation, 18 to 35 right now and show them this and show them what the joke is

556
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,140
and this tongue in cheek humor. So they could use it themselves and, and to help them in their world.

557
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,520
Yeah.

558
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,920
Oh, there's, there's always new ones coming along. I mean, we, I, I sell at least two or three of

559
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,420
those ordainments every day. I wish, I wish, I wish it was more like 10 of them every day. Like

560
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,040
it was in the, uh, about 15 years ago.

561
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,040
Well, maybe after the movie comes out.

562
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,200
Well, that'll happen for a while, but it's, uh, you know, it's, it's, um, I'm not expecting to,

563
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,160
uh, be suddenly on late night talk shows or anything like that. That would be great, but,

564
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:11,780
uh, cause it's long overdue, but you know, we're not, uh, it only pretends to be a get rich

565
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:19,700
quick scheme. I've, I've run into so many people who just had such a shallow understanding of it.

566
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,920
They, they,

567
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,500
honestly thought that we were just trying to rip people off with this fake religion. And we're not,

568
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,180
we're trying to inoculate them against fake religions and for a really low price,

569
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,240
which I won't go into on this public supported venue.

570
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:45,060
Wrapping up, Doug has running the, uh, the church of the sub, uh, genius left you as Doug

571
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,800
in a constant state of slack.

572
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,000
Uh, I actually do have, uh, slack.

573
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:58,760
I can say now that slack is real. Uh, a lot of it is, is, uh, I've, I've got a wonderful family

574
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,380
and a great wife and, uh, good dogs. And, uh, I'm, I'm not in a terrible stress over,

575
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,100
over my future. Uh, you know, I'm, we're, some of us are getting older and,

576
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:21,060
and we're having to deal with, uh, aging and ailing friends and so forth. Uh, but,

577
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:30,500
uh, I personally, and I, I, I can speak for Philo in this respect. Uh, we, we both have,

578
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:40,020
uh, I think we've, uh, had a really, really good run and it's, uh, I feel like, uh, Bob

579
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:50,420
gave us slack in some strange way, uh, twilight zone way perhaps. But, uh,

580
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,040
uh, you know, it's work, it's worked out for us and we'd like to share as much slack as we can.

581
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:05,500
It's a, there's no end to slack. It's a bottomless pit. Everyone was born with original slack.

582
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:11,540
We're just there to remind them of that. We can't tell them what their slack is.

583
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,640
Some of the things in the world too. Right. And not take yourself too serious.

584
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,540
Yeah. It's a pep talk. It's a, it really is. It's a pep talk for people who, who are,

585
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:28,120
are, are feeling, uh, uh, alone and hopeless. Uh, we can't, it may be hopeless, but somehow we can

586
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:34,000
get them to laugh at that fact for a little while. Exactly. And Sandy, have you ever achieved a state

587
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,340
of slack? Uh, actually, uh, non-member of the church of the Papagians. Uh, yes, actually. Uh,

588
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,060
I've always walked in, um, faith and, um, even through difficult trials in my life,

589
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,280
my death of my late husband. And, and as we're getting older, Doug,

590
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,860
Doug is right. Many of our dear friends have passed away, but you're just grateful for every

591
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:00,660
day above ground and try to see life, uh, in a positive. And, uh, and finally, both for you,

592
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,400
Sandy and for Doug, are there any plans in terms of the documentary, uh, weaving it into, uh, I

593
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,960
guess this year's July 5th, uh, X-Date event? Oh, I, Doug hadn't, we hadn't talked about that,

594
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,340
but it'd be absolutely acceptable if he would like to do that. Yeah.

595
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,080
Well, Sandy and Doug, thank you very much for joining me.

596
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,640
On Lights, Camera, Awesome to discuss J.R. Dobbs, uh, J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the

597
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,840
Subgenius. Good luck, uh, when the documentary screens during this year's South by Southwest

598
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,420
Film Festival. Thank you so much. Thanks for having us on. Thank you very much. Do appreciate it. Okay.

599
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:43,760
Price Bob. And thank you for, uh, Price Robert. Price Robert. Now I know why you got us on this

600
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,260
show. You just wanted to hear us say your name a lot. See, we didn't pick a weird name.

601
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,560
Like, praise Ivan. No, we picked the most common name in the world. Think how many people named Bob

602
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,240
have joined the church just because of that. Yeah, exactly. I'll have to consider joining you. Okay,

603
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,900
sounds good. Well, thank you very much, Doug. I do appreciate it. Thank you.

604
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,560
Don't you call me a mitten flicker.

605
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,520
You flippin' mecker. Uh, it's the time for the 20-year cicadas to come out and they're

606
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,860
emerging everywhere. I, I really, I just don't know what to say here. This has got me

607
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:27,580
nonplussed. Everywhere you look, there's one of these. Oh, I see. Oh, I see we're getting

608
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,340
close to the end of the show. I would like to make a short announcement. The giant ants.

609
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,820
He's gonna make an announcement. I'm gonna make a short announcement. I would like to

610
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:44,260
thank, uh, thank all of the, uh, listeners out there. I'd like to thank the, uh, perpetrators

611
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:50,260
of the Puzzling Evidence Show. Saxon. Uh, this is, this will be my last, my last, uh,

612
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,280
performance on the Puzzling Evidence Show. After all these years, I will be leaving the

613
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:05,680
show tonight for the last time, sadly. I've enjoyed this, uh, this gig. It's really been

614
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,180
fun. I'm glad the listeners and the callers and everyone. Yes, he's gonna ride out into

615
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,900
the desert and you won't see. Being able to be on the radio was like fulfilling a dream

616
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,880
of mine, so I'm really happy to have been able to participate.

617
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:28,920
And, uh, seriously. And, uh, I wish it could go on forever, but I will be leaving the state

618
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,660
and make it much more difficult to get here at three o'clock in the morning. But you will

619
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:43,600
be rerun again and again in the listeners' memories. So I will be saying tonight, after

620
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:50,260
tonight, I will be saying adios to. To audio. Yes. And all the denizens and all the people

621
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:59,100
of Northern California and the internet. But I would also like to say thank you. Thank

622
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:07,220
you so much. Take my side. For all the great fun and rollicking good times. Put it on my

623
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:16,040
pony. The Rollica. Jamming with words. Jamming with words with my buds late at night in the

624
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,380
middle of the night has been a great thing to do. Well, let's just finish up the show.

625
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,120
It's the best ever.

626
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,860
Jamming with words. Yeah, it's been fun having you on here. You're one of the more dynamic

627
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,460
characters ever on the show.

628
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,160
Oh, I can't wait to listen to that show.

629
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,660
Out into the universe goes the show.

630
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,780
And so now we'll be getting some donuts.

631
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,460
And the last traditional donut gathering.

632
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,880
The last traditional donut gathering.

633
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,260
Spun sugar.

634
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,460
Spun sugar.

635
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,560
Eleven days from now, I will be armed.

636
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,380
Help us.

637
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:54,940
This unreal.

638
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,300
Driving.

639
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,000
To my new.

640
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,140
I've got such tremendous.

641
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,100
Well, we already had national donut day.

642
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,480
It's the end of this month. It'll be 30 years since the first show. Hang up the phone.

643
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,360
It's so upsetting.

644
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:09,640
Yeah.

645
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,620
Horrors of Spider Island.

646
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,780
But one good thing about not being on the show anymore, I'll finally not be the rookie.

647
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:18,860
Monster.

648
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,260
I've been like a rookie for years.

649
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


650
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


651
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


652
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


653
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


654
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


655
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


656
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


657
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


658
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


659
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


660
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


661
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


662
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


663
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:20,260


664
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,980
I've been a rookie for 17 years or something. I'm, you know, it's.

665
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,100
The rookie.

666
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,280
I think I will graduate from rookie eventually.

667
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,740
Okay, rookie.

668
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,520
Yeah.

669
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,940
Okay, Rob, you're the rookie now.

670
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,820
Gee, thanks.

671
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,700
I'll pass that, pass that torch to you.

672
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,660
Hey, Hal, here's a.

673
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,860
Is that your real feeling about, about Philo leaving, caller?

674
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,880
Very sad.

675
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:48,940
It is sad.

676
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
It can't be glossed over.

677
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,700
It's so dry.

678
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,500
Well, I'd like to make it last, last, but I can't do it.

679
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,340
But nothing does.

680
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,440
And leave at the same time.

681
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,040
But you can phone it in.

682
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,320
And I.

683
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,160
Oh, maybe I will phone it in at some point.

684
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,700
There's all that voicemail junk that people use.

685
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:07,780
Awesome.

686
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,020
On, as you travel, you should make a yak tape record of your adventure.

687
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:12,820
Oh, I will.

688
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,540
Yeah, definitely.

689
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,720
They can later be turned into radio gold.

690
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,960
Our ratings will soar.

691
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,740
It's time.

692
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,280
Where I expect to land, it would be like seven o'clock or something.

693
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,100
Even if you're going to land hard.

694
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,220
Three, four, six o'clock.

695
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,000
In a hard land.

696
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,740
A rough, unteamed land.

697
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:38,680
A young, brawny, brawling land where a man can swing his fists until he pants from exhaustion.

698
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,760
Pounding himself in the head.

699
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,020
Hades.

700
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,080
Punch after punch.

701
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,000
Bam, bam, ow, bam, ow.

702
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,780
At Walton's Drugstore.

703
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,920
Bam, ow, ow, bam, ow.

704
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:48,920


705
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:48,920


706
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,820
Why do you keep hitting yourself, huh?

707
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,600
Why do you keep hitting yourself?

708
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,780
Are you going to go to Wal Drug and see the big concrete brontosaurus?

709
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,300
No, I'll go to Walide Drugstore.

710
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,260
Man, I wish I was going on that one.

711
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,760
I may be taking a special dinosaur-related trip.

712
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,920
I'm going to go to every drugstore, every giant ball of string, every giant dinosaur, every giant everything.

713
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,460
Giant everything.

714
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,320
There's a giant trout you can visit.

715
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,900
And cheaper everything.

716
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,520
An enormous shoe.

717
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,280
I'm going to see the flea circus.

718
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,340
Remember where you go?

719
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,380
Look at the flea circus under a microscope?

720
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,380
Yes.

721
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:21,900
A little scope.

722
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,460
Oh, there they are, waving.

723
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,180
Look at that.

724
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,600
They're still there.

725
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,060
Thank you and good night.

726
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,060
There he goes.

727
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,980
Everybody stand up for a great American.

728
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,000
J-Cal radio.

729
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,560
I am a robot.

730
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,220
Boop.

731
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,320
I am a robot.

732
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,320


733
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,060
Boop.

734
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,480
So long, Philo.

735
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,180
So long, boys.

736
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,880
He goes on his rocket to the moon.

737
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,220
So long, gentlemen.

738
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,480
He's about to blast off.

739
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,120
Everybody want more.

740
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,340
Yes, yes, y'all.

741
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,340
J-Cal is in the house, house, house, house, house.

742
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:21,140
We get more letters from brain-damaged prisoners than you can even imagine.

743
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:29,500
And the great thing about it is they're all handwritten in pencil because prisoners are not allowed to have pens.

744
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,560
They're too dangerous.

745
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,660
They might start practicing cursive.

746
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,780
Yeah, exactly.

747
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:49,100
I read a lot of letters from prisoners written on live paper and mailed by the U.S. Mail, if you can even imagine that.

748
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:58,940
And I feel great sympathy for the prisoners.

749
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:06,140
Of course, most of them are in there for—they're unfairly jailed for victimizing.

750
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:13,440
They're in there for almost crimes like murder, arson, drug dealing, and so forth.

751
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:22,940
And, you know, it's just a shame that the state has decided to mete out this—what their idea of justice.

752
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:34,420
So I've become very sympathetic to prisoners, and I actually write back to them with—

753
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,020
I have handwritten—

754
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,320
I have a pencil on paper so I can read it, you know, because that's all they—it gets to where that's all they can read.

755
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,560
It's a sad day and age when all you've got to do is write.

756
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,380
You know, you guys are all going to be in prison.

757
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,940
That's going to happen to all of us.

758
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,540
We're all going to be in—

759
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:04,800
He said you guys first, but then all of us next, so we wouldn't, you know, we wouldn't feel like, you know, he was going to exclude himself from us.

760
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,100
Oh, no.

761
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:15,080
They'll get the important—they'll get the important people like me and Philo first, but then they'll come after you just because you're making this podcast.

762
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,440
That's, you know, a public treasonous act.

763
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:36,580
You praised Bob on a public surface, so you're going to end up at Trump Stop, working at Trump Stop, just like me and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Philo and the whole old gang.

764
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,780
All the old folks are in that mood.

765
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,740
Every Wednesday you do get a taco bowl.

766
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,040
I heard they have ramen, too.

767
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,040
They got a lot of top ramen there.

768
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:46,980
Nissan.

769
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,540
Good.

770
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,520
Yeah, they have snacks.

771
00:47:49,900 --> 00:48:00,740
There's snacks and stuff, and you can buy things like razor blades and—well, not razor blades, but something to shave with.

772
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,120
Oh, shave with.

773
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:02,640
Okay.

774
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,600
And some—

775
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:10,560
Some of the meds that you need from the commissary.

776
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:28,160
I've had to look into all that lately because they're, you know, they're closing in, and we've only got so much time before the ice cap melts and the conspiracy just decides, well, we've had enough of these.

777
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,440
They keep complaining.

778
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,820
We're going to have to just lock them up.

779
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,040
Lock them up.

780
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,860
Lock them up.

781
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,620
The ice cap is just earth.

782
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,720
It's bald spots.

783
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,720
Yeah, don't be so insensitive.

784
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,800
The earth's precious about that.

785
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You know, give the earth a little pity here and there.

786
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,260
It's looking pretty good for its age.

787
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,080
I'd fuck it.

788
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,100
Is that what the Arctic Circle is?

789
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,200
The tree line is just the comb over?

790
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,920
It's just earth's comb over?

791
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,580
That's when earth takes off its yarmulke.

792
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,760
That's where—

793
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:06,760
It was the way that Mother Earth buried and hid and fried.

794
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:19,420
It was the way that Mother Earth froze all these ancient pre-ice age diseases that could kill everything that is a mammal alive today.

795
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:28,660
And that was nature in her wisdom, you know, hiding all those viruses away.

796
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:34,160
And, of course, they're now being exposed because, well, you know.

797
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,620
Well, a few months ago.

798
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,400
Anything.

799
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,240
Anything.

800
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,480
Anything to kill all the subgenius.

801
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,200
That's their motto as far as I can—

802
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,940
It's like they'll do anything to wipe out all the subgeniuses.

803
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,360
It doesn't matter what happens to them.

804
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:52,340
That's—

805
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,340
They're just part of the hive.

806
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:01,760
Well, a few months ago, we were asking our Patreons and all of the other people that we beg for money constantly.

807
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,180
You know, we were working on our flat earth expedition.

808
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,680
Because Thin and I were going to charter.

809
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,440
We were going to charter a boat down to the ice wall.

810
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,000
We're brave.

811
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,680
And we were going to take a rope.

812
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,060
A really, really long rope.

813
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,220
And we were going to go over the edge.

814
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,180
But now, you know, maybe we should just, instead of buying the rope, we can just buy hair dryers.

815
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:27,400
And then we can just go down there and do, you know, man's work at a little more efficient pace.

816
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,380
Or I still have those mushrooms.

817
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,280
We could just eat those instead of going to Antarctica.

818
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,620
But we can still buy the hair dryers, right?

819
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,520
You know.

820
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,860
You've got a point.

821
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:44,200
If you just take the mushrooms and envision that work, that's enough.

822
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,300
Then you have the same slap.

823
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:59,700
If you envision it completely enough sitting on your couch, why do you really need to go to Antarctica and hang off the edge of the world to prove the flat earth?

824
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,620
You've already done it in your mind.

825
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,160
Yeah.

826
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,520
That's enough for us.

827
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,240
I have no—

828
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,640
You can just—

829
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,040
You have the right to blow it off.

830
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,340
Works for InfoWars.

831
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,120
I have the ability to transform my left hand into a part of female anatomy.

832
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:20,880
You know?

833
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,760
That's nature's will.

834
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,560
Don't you have to kind of switch back and forth?

835
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,520
You know, left hand, right hand.

836
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,460
Yeah, every ten years.

837
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,540
You're young.

838
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,040
You probably don't need all that extra.

839
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,440
Well, we do a lot of typing these days.

840
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,560
So the wrist muscles—

841
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,680
The wrist muscles are nice and tight.

842
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,800
Oh, I guess so.

843
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,700
That makes sense.

844
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:42,640
It helps.

845
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,420
Yeah, we love typing.

846
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,160
That's our favorite thing to do here.

847
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,880
We just type all day.

848
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,940
We don't even have the paper in the typewriters.

849
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,680
We don't have the keyboards plugged up.

850
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,000
We just love hearing the sounds, really.

851
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,520
That's why we hired Scalpot.

852
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,680
Yeah, we just do the show so we can go back and listen to the sounds of our own voices.

853
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,060
But remember, there was that one time, Dr. Fox,

854
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:12,520
where that guy accidentally got drunk and accidentally subscribed to our show.

855
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,820
That happened to me!

856
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,040
Yeah!

857
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,320
That same time, that happened to me.

858
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,460
One and one.

859
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,860
I guess we figured that one out.

860
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,940
But hey, look, that counts as a download.

861
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,400
And you know what?

862
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,480
If we're good for a few of those a year, then you know what?

863
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,240
That's an audience.

864
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:32,700
And so it isn't always just us listening to the show.

865
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,740
As long as the audience will be imbibed,

866
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,120
there will always be an audience.

867
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,280
Wow.

868
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,240
I feel better already, Fit.

869
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:47,320
What they need to know is how convenient we make it for them to not listen to us.

870
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:54,600
The time for the show is so bad that you can just download it and then immediately delete it

871
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:03,040
and eliminate the middleman of actually having to consume the void of content that is time for the show.

872
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,420
That's the way.

873
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,580
That's the way I usually do it.

874
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,700
I download every show faithfully.

875
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,740
And then I go, I don't have time for this.

876
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,080
I just erase it.

877
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,780
But at least I downloaded it.

878
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,500
You know, you've got that little checkmark on your downloads numbers.

879
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,880
So, you know, it helps you get up to like three or four or five.

880
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,140
I know how it is.

881
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,160
Same with ours.

882
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,000
We can just subscribe to the show.

883
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,420
That would be enough, right?

884
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,400
If I get one down, I'm going to have to do it again.

885
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,740
If I download, I feel like, well, OK, that justifies all the days and hours.

886
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,960
It's like free advertising.

887
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,280
Somebody downloaded it.

888
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,900
Maybe they'll buy a subgenius membership.

889
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,960
Wouldn't that be interesting?

890
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,700
Or they could send money to Hypercube.

891
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:59,140
Yeah, we've only been charging them $45 for subgenius memberships.

892
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,160
Plus, you know, let's get delusional.

893
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,260
Dr. Fox.

894
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,180
Well, we got our P.O. box.

895
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,700
We're moving in.

896
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,520
You know, we're going to show you what for.

897
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:22,380
It's not just one guy that can, you know, print off some Xeroxes and package it up and send it out to people.

898
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,940
You know, it's not just, you know, one guy doesn't have to do like a radio show every week.

899
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,240
And, you know, he's this guy, this guy right here.

900
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,260
He's done over 10,000 episodes of the Hour of Slack.

901
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,680
And he's never.

902
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,340
Ever played the same clip twice.

903
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,860
Oh, well, you're doing better than me then.

904
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,420
The guy that does the Hour of Slack is doing a lot better than Stang.

905
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,880
You know, see, the Lonesome Cowboy Dave show is my favorite podcast.

906
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,420
Yeah.

907
00:54:54,860 --> 00:55:04,780
Well, tonight we are giving Dr. Stang the Lonesome Cowboy Dave treatment because he is finally getting a taste of his own medicine.

908
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:10,500
And he's the one on the phone who can't hear the music beds or any of the funny sound effects that we're playing.

909
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,680
Here, here's one now.

910
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,980
Oh, thank God.

911
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,580
Oh, thank God.

912
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,460
Praise Bob.

913
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,400
I just sent Dr. Fox a photo of me today.

914
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
Yeah, that was that.

915
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,060
So every time Reverend Stang sends a photo, we get a free sound effect.

916
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,260
This is good radio.

917
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,560
I'm wearing the uniform.

918
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,420
That's right.

919
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,720
We're going to inscribe that.

920
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,260
We're working on armbands next.

921
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:51,720
Yeah, I sent Dr. Fox a photo of me wearing the Dr. Fox T-shirt from a couple of years ago at X-Day.

922
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,660
Now, is that the one that was pulled off the corpse of Bob?

923
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,640
Because I remember Bob was wearing a shirt for a little while.

924
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:04,680
The main reason I wore that shirt today was to piss off.

925
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,120
To piss off peas.

926
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,560
Well, you know, I think you should try to piss off peas every day.

927
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:20,420
Well, I know for a fact peas is listening, so I'm sure he'll be glad to hear that.

928
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,260
Yeah, he's mad.

929
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:28,500
It doesn't matter whether we like peas or dislike peas.

930
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,060
The important thing is that we talk about peas.

931
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,520
That's all he cares about.

932
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,180
That's true.

933
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,280
I understand.

934
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,560
100%.

935
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,160
He has a lot in common with our president.

936
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,000
That he's a handsome boy?

937
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,080
Very handsome.

938
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,780
He's a very handsome boy.

939
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,400
They've got the same haircut.

940
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:57,000
No, he's just really, really eager to name mentioned in any context.

941
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,720
It doesn't matter negative or positive.

942
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,600
There's no such thing as no PR to quote.

943
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

944
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,100
Any PR.

945
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,600
It's PR.

946
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,080
There you go.

947
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:12,580
It's free.

948
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,540
You got that much closer.

949
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,300
Immortality and a million bucks.

950
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,560
Peas is a lot like Trump, except for Trump's funnier.

951
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,360
Yeah, and without trying nearly as hard either.

952
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:27,820
Right.

953
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,860
That's the problem.

954
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,340
You know, we're.

955
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,980
But he's a genius president.

956
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,960
He is the subgenius who would be president.

957
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,060
You should be happy for him.

958
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,700
He's having a great time.

959
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:41,780
Come on.

960
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,780
Good for him.

961
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:54,220
Well, the way Paul Mavridis put it, he is the subgenius president, but not in the good way.

962
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:01,500
From PR News in Washington, I'm exhausted, frustrated and anxious to get PR's reports first.

963
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,180
It's been seven days.

964
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,960
I'm.

965
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,940
Researchers say that I'm getting worse.

966
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:11,140
Since long before South Carolina spun off from Virginia earlier today.

967
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,880
Researchers say.

968
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,980
In English.

969
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:19,000
Long term.

970
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:19,400
Percent.

971
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,760
Four point six five up to four point one one percent.

972
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,260
A new study suggests that this PR news is getting worse.

973
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,320
Quote.

974
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:28,900
PR News.

975
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,280
There's something pretty insidious going on.

976
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,260
Thanks.

977
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:37,060
Thanks to Lemur for PR News and our opening titles.

978
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,940
Thanks to puzzling evidence.

979
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,120
Time for the show.

980
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,520
Dr. Drummond.

981
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,460
Sandy Boone.

982
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,420
And thanks to Bob.

983
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,480
Yes.

984
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,680
Thanks to Bob.

985
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,540
You can find links to everything at subgenius.com.

986
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,480
So.

987
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,340
Parays.

988
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:56,820
Bob.
