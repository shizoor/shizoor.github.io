Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?
I ain't saying nothing.
Yeah.
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?
Yeah.
Do you read me, Hal?
Yeah.
Sure, Hal.
You're fired, along with all the rest of us.
I don't care about the others.
You're at 1-3.
They're all 1-3.
Oh, please.
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.
The Self Genius.
The Power of Splat.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Guess what you think you're doing.
As we wander through this prehistoric wonderland and look about us,
amazing sights meet us on every side.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
From the bottom of my heart, I say thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
I don't understand.
The callers were supposed to call 25 minutes ago.
I'm trying to help, but you deny me.
No, you're in denial.
You see, memories like this can be suppressed from an early,
earlier chakra or form of existence.
When I am able, by my superior vibrations, to see your energy aura,
I can see that you are troubled.
For a dark, blue, greasy band around your body and head
show me that you are troubled in the abdominal regions,
in the hips, thighs, calves, and, uh...
The black widow entombed in the center of the gelatin mold
seems to shake and wiggle as if...
...alive.
It is alive!
Get a little baby.
...a giant, 7-foot-beech...
Sheriff, I'm telling you, this was the footprint of a spider as big as a house.
I don't make reports like this to the police all the time.
I'm telling you, this is serious.
I wish you'd take me seriously here.
I'm not drinking either.
I saw it.
I was a...
Like I eat a lot of stuff.
You know, I go into the doctors, I say,
Doctor, I got to do something about the second tongue.
I got these two tongues.
The doctor says, That's not a tongue, that's a leech.
This is actually an enlargement of the soft palate,
which is swollen because of your condition.
The apparent leech is the distended uvula.
Let me just sharpen my scalpel here,
and we'll have that off in no time.
I want the uvula.
Why, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.
You, you, you.

That's only because they're insecure,
and they're worried about, you know, themselves,
and they're trying to...
Hi, is Jim on?
Is Jim on?
Okay, could I get on the show, please?
This is Bob.
I called before.
My friend grabbed the phone out of my hand
before I had time to talk.
I want to...
I want to talk about the lack of a Christian youth program
in my high school.
I got a grant.
No Christian youth programs there,
and I'd like to start one up,
but I need some advice from people my own age
who are involved in this.
No?
No, I listen to the program every Friday night,
the Youth Connection.
No?
It's legit.
Yeah.
17?
16 going on 17?
Almost 17.
Hello?
Oh, I'm calling from Portland.
Hi, Bob.
Hi, Jim.
Yeah.
I come from a high school without a Christian youth program.
What I wanted to ask from some of your guests was,
how do you go about putting together a Christian youth program
in the first place if your school doesn't have one?
Bob, what's all that noise in the background?
It could be my radio.
Why don't you turn it off?
Okay, we get another one.
That's two in a row.
So anyway, I guess that's part of being on the air.
Jerry, do you have a couple commercial works you want to do?
Okay, you're done with the commercial.
Okay.
Okay.




















Now, is this part of a giant bloodthirsty diminutive female
blind and ticklish tickball tiny tubular ticker?
You're right.
But he'll never be able to walk comfortably on a naked woman
because his tiny feet are designed for clutching the naked insect beak,
a swell, harmless little cute pink insect.
And next, we come nonstop in slow motion.
What a mouthful.
Thanks, Moth.
You gave a swell performance.
That's female cum tumblers.
Cum wigglers captured for a movie screen.
I think we'll finish right here before she explodes.
Yum, yum.
After a few minutes for the drying out process,
the wee little pink moth will be ready to do business.
And here are the handsome male mosquitoes breaking human tail
with a fly swatter by the sound of the blood running onto the shell.
Yum, yum.
And in conclusion, goodbye now.
B.
B.
Life?
Life is like Bob's pipe.
The harder you suck it, the more you get out of it.
You will pay for your centipedes.
It didn't work.
It hit a horseshoe.
And while it worked, I lost my Compared dollar,
a branch that frequently fell onto a near-44ً 버�sy or an off-road summer beer.
What aώGostto noob.

BOWEY!
DOPE!
Woah, G bessst, that's the outfit I anyone else's shoe could wear,
on a green shirt.
And the next bell is about time she begins something really strange.
Did you know she's attractive?
Nah I don't think that's really scary to start with.
B bright.
Liar!
We will hurl the centipedes at you.
Once, when I was in the middle of some rather unpleasant clean-up work after a rather missy
influx of unnecessary, probably, violence, I was in the middle of shoveling parts and
things to one side.
Bob strolled up.
The only guy I ever knew that looked good in camis.
Bob strolled up and said, Gordon, have you ever thought about how funny this is?
Bob, I said, I'm up to my armpits in dead jihadists and Christians and pinks and all
these other guys.
What do you find amusing about this?
Took another puff.
I found that damnably ever-lit pipe.
Gordon, he said, I think it's so amusing that you're doing the clean-up here and I'm standing
here laughing at you.
That's Bob.
I am.
Long time no see.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't need it again!
There may be time coming soon when you will not need that dangly dingly or that thing.
No!
That pristine juicer you can you hang from yourself, that...
That slimy eye!
It's not good for pie in the sky!
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, it was so long ago, yeah.
Well, they said Chernobyl was so long ago.
There's nothing to worry about.
Then I hear on the news a bunch of dumb guys
in the Department of...
Energy and Defense Department are going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls across
the United States.
Yeah, then I hear Chernobyl's not really over.
All these people are all dying within a 250 mile radius because all the underground aquifers
are all polluted.
So now we're getting it too.
And then I wonder as I stare into the mirror how...
Why my movements are getting so jerk-ass.
Jerk-ass!
One, two, three, four!
Let's go!
The iodine, the 1, 3, 1, has got my thyroid on the run and the krypton-885 is making it
hard just to stay alive.
But the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, the iodine, the 1, 3, 1, there's no more running through the
metal lanes.
No more barefoot in the mud.
Shake the floating hand of the Poison Man.
Shake a bony hand and shake it through
The barium, a 248
Has made me sterile, I can't procreate
And the plutonium, a 247
So long folks, I see you in heaven
But the iodine, a 131
The iodine, a 131
There's no more money to the metal line
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake a bony hand of the poison man
Shake a bony hand and shake it through
The barium, a 248
Has made me sterile, I can't procreate
And the plutonium, a 131
The iodine, a 131


The iodine, a 131
The iodine, a 131
The iodine, a 131
The iodine, a 131
Hodgkin's lymphoma
Chicken neck acne
Gingivitis, bad breath
What's the use?
The iodine, a 131
Has got my thyroid on the run
And the krypton, a 85
Is making it hard just to stay alive
But the iodine, a 131
The iodine, a 131
There's no more money to the metal line
No more barefoot in the mud
Power, power's in the power's hand
Shake a bony hand and shake it through
No more money to the metal line
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake a bony hand of the poison man
Shake a bony hand and shake it through
My thyroid light the ud getting worn out
All the hope's gone
LessUCK
All the hope's gone
All the hope's gone
Endless heartbreak

Pünd Hogwarts
The pirate ship for the victors
Long John's but the name tag was missing.
They could be anybody's. Anybody. Could have been Dave's for all we know.
That was Dave. Lonesome Cowboy Dave did that song there, Iodine 131 with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
That was recorded I think at a revival in 1999 at, could it be the Euclid Tavern back then?
I think that was before we were doing them at the Beachland. It may have been from the Euclid Tavern
and I was hearing the divine strains of Michelle George's violin. Right and I think it was probably
recorded there because Regis was the sound man and that's why we ended up with a copy.
So that Euclid Tavern was recorded.
Usually doesn't happen, getting a nice line recording but that's been because of Regis
Sedlock almost every time. Praise Regis. I don't think he ever joined the church so he's going to
burn in hell like the rest of them but aside from that, aside from the eternity of suffering and
torment, we can't probably owe him. So what was before that? We heard, oh Phineas Narco did the
collage of I Don't Know. Well if not Phineas then it was National Cynical Radio. Cineus we might say.
Phineas also chopped up some puzzling evidence shows that we heard and we heard some of the amino
acids hollering with their guitars from their new CD and well that's not even a CD it's actually a record.
G Gordon Gordon, what's your favorite song?
was a guy talking about, that's Bob.
And
life is like Bob's pipe.
I can do a pretty good G. Gordon
Gordon, huh? Yes, you can.
What's the matter? Haven't you ever heard a man with throat
cancer before?
That's his voice box said
once. And let's see,
Phenoxyethanol, amino acids,
Fernanda Nanny Lee Murr chopped
up some stuff, and we heard
Dr. Howell on
the radio show, the Puzzling Evidence
Show. And
what else could we possibly
hear that would be worth hearing?
This? Doubtful.
Doubtful. Oh, wait, it's
Daveful. It's Daveful!
It's
Psychopath Finder Dave. I mean,
Lonesome Psycho Dave.
Like the apostocly Thomas,
the doubtful one, who
refuses to believe in his own existence.
You refuse to bleed your own
existence, do you, Dave?
No, I guess I do.
I do. I don't
think there's been a lot of rectimony
from the actual church
for this condition, which I find myself
in morally, psychologically, and spiritually.
Although I have
on numerous
occasions, I
have enumerated
my differences in qualitative substance
and have been confused.
Like in
that famous hit song, Stop Abusing
That Substance Abuser.
Now, baby. Which we didn't
play. But a minute ago, I did,
we did play Iodine 131
live from the Euclid
Tavern a hundred years ago.
Or in the previous century
sometime. Boy, did that sound good.
It was, and boy,
it was in the previous century, too.
Because people don't care about
nuclear disasters anymore, like
Fukushima's now invading everyone's
nostrils in the proboscis of France.
And yet the denizens
of Earth continue to,
frolic in the radioactive debris.
Well, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do with butt frolic? You can't go over there
and clean it up. It's poison
for forever.
I mean, all you can really do is sit
and wait for
the next one to go.
What's that one over by the lake?
Perry? The one we drove by
on the way to our Thanksgiving dinner?
Yeah. Why, that was pouring out all kinds
of steam, but I understand that that could
never happen here.
Even though it has happened here numerous times.
Oh, has it?
It used to be poorly rated. I don't know if it still
is because of hem-a-hem. Maybe it is.
But, uh, you know...
Yes?
Yes, yes?
Well, what I know is that
spokespersons say this,
spokespersons say that.
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm a
spokesperson. I can say all kinds of stuff.
Exactly.
I'm a spokesperson for bad.
For BAM?
BAB.
BAB.
Yeah, BAB DABS.
BAB DABS.
BAB DABS.
BAB DABS.
BAB DABS.
BAB DABS.
BAB DABS.
Yeah, and so that's what we say for BAB.
We just say his name all over the place.
Like B-O-B-B-A-B-B-A-B.
1-3-0-1-3. 1-3-0-1-3.
See? That's a meme.
It's a meme.
It's a meme.
Yeah.
1-3-1-1-3-0-1-3-1-3-1-1-1-3-0-1-3.
And if we're all hard-charging catfish like them,
we'd know well enough to send our
allegiance to another direction.
No, not to another direction.
We'd...
We'd...
We'd...
Right.
You got it.
That's how we do it.
Old school.
Old school.
I'm doing that same thing as the last two weeks of doing the old school hour of Slack
where we just play everything in the background all at once.
Oh, I thought you were doing the old stool routine.
Same difference.
That's kind of stinky.
You know, elderly people are examined for their differences in discharges.
Some of them are military full ranks.
Now, speaking...
Instead of examining discharges,
I am given to understand that in the nation of Germany,
they build their toilets with little shelves
so that one may examine one's children,
new little children,
and for disease, signs of disease,
and plastic army man toys or anything that might be in the excretions.
And then you can flush it.
Then you, like, have a little sprayer.
You can have a little sprayer that sprays it down and a brush
to push the offending poop stool down into the German sewage system.
I can't think of anything more Freudian than this new escape into the future
as it has its causes and its results in Germany,
what we used to call Teutonic titwillowage,
which is an inordinate examination of the fetal process and the products thereof.
They were obsessed with it.
And even, you know, schools of religious philosophy were based on that,
which is ultimately what led to the National Socialist Movement,
in which nobody was socialist,
and everybody got paid in the next year's dividends.
So this was...
So you could chalk the Third Reich up to bad toilet training?
Is that what you're saying?
Is it that simple?
Also, with some help from Bush's grandfather...
Well, now, now, now.
We're not supposed to talk about the former emperor's family that way.
What was the real...
And what about your grandfather and my grandfather?
They helped old Schickelgruber out.
Well, no, actually, mine didn't.
He...
What did mine do?
My grandfather...
No, mine...
Mine weren't in that first...
You mean there was a first world war?
Right, the one that was supposed to end all the rest of them
and instead caused all the other ones.
Yeah, it was the first of the world wars,
rather than the end of...
Oh, well.
But the third one will be fought with jelly beans and pea shooters, right?
And also tiny little miniature rubber feet
that people like to put on their windshield mirrors.
What?
Or their rear-view mirrors.
We're going to use those against the commies?
Well, we're going to try.
It might be difficult at first,
because the commies, as we know,
are well-supported by the banks and the military.
And, of course, they're everywhere.
They're sleeping.
Some of them...
Apparently, he's sleeping in my backyard right now,
waiting for me to go away from the window.
But I keep on...
Well, I haven't seen them in a little bit,
but I know they're out there.
And I guess there's about four or five of them
living under the bed like Irish tinkers or gypsies
or something like that, you know?
They pass around the belly buttons and examine the plates,
and then they argue with each other in some kind of really...
It's hard to keep up with, you know?
Yeah, sounds like it.
What with all the belly button lint and stuff.
It's just Bob is what it is.
It's just...
It's literally Bob.
Talk about inanimate shapes.
Or animate shapes.
Or animated shapes.
Or animated snakes.
Or shapeless snakes.
That's what they argue.
Snakes?
Whoa.
Huh?
I'm sorry, I got spaced out.
This music is so fabulously good.
Oh, when did that ever happen before?
It just hypnotizes me.
What?
And the sound effects.
I know.
They are quite delightful and quite...
It makes me want to shut up,
but I guess I'm not getting paid to specifically shut up
until you tell me.
Well, maybe this is a good idea.
See how synchronistic it is?
It's just like jellyfish in the rain.
It's like catfish, not jellyfish.
It's like a big, gigantic, huge, humongous catfish
swimming in.
I like the invisible and invisible land
and the lakes and rivers.
And yeah, sure.
I've seen them in the woods.
I've seen them hanging from trees.
Those fish are big enough to climb trees.
And they come all the way from China
to climb a tree in your backyard
if you live in the Great Lakes.
Wow.
Now, settle down, Dave.
Settle down.
They're not climbing out of the lake
after you right now, are they?
Not at this moment.
I guess I've got a few short moments
to hang in there, Mr. Ivan Reverend.
I don't know.
And also Princess Wee.
I don't know.
Well, we're taking this incident as it comes, aren't we, Donna?
Aren't we, Marion?
Aren't we, Janet?
Nobody trusts nobody anymore.
No, there's nothing to trust them for.
They're all trustworthy.
I'm trustworthy.
Stop genius.
Stop genius.
Come in.
Think you're funny, huh?
Yeah.
What's going on here?
Who's that maniac?
Bob.
He's a writer.
Huh?
Oh.
Very good.
Very good, Dave.
That was excellent.
That was great.
It was a wonderful performance just then.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Great stuff.
How could you say that?
He was weeping under that horrible music.
Mix.
How could you say that was a great performance?
He was crying.
Now, take it easy, Janet.
Everybody knows it.
Everybody knows it.
Everybody knows it.
Everybody knows it.
I don't know.
I didn't either.
I don't know.
Only the nose knows.
But I have been told by that man, I think you know his name, Dick.
The great nose.
Dick Dobbs.
The real, true leader of the...
The Church of the Subgenius.
Yes, Dick Dobbs.
The evil twin baby head hanging from the back of Bob's skull.
That's right, Dave.
All this time, Bob's evil twin that we were so scared of and paranoid about.
All this time, he was under Bob's back-slung hat, gibbering and gibbering.
The tiny baby head on the back of Bob's mane head.
With the pipe going the opposite way.
And what it says doesn't make any more sense than what Bob says.
Now, that all makes sense to me, though, because if they're using that hat and just the behind part
to try and bring forth these subliminal messages, the alien commands...
I used to wonder why there was a little pipe sticking out under the hat in the back of Bob's head.
Yeah.
And it's because there was a hidden suit of Bob's face.
Oh, for sure.
Oh.
On the back of his head.
A parasitic twin without any body or anything.
All it had for a body was Bob's backside.
So you can imagine why it would be a bit ticked off.
And would use Bob's power against not only Bob himself, but the human race and the subgenius race.
Just what we need.
No more 40 and ding-dong and Hugoistic logic.
There wasn't one Bob, one race, the human race.
It was two Bobs.
Well, a Bob and a Dick.
Dick.
At least.
And maybe more than one.
And, in fact, maybe dozens, probably dozens of them.
As well as the one hanging from the back of his head.
So the tiny head coming off the back of Dobbs was Dick Dobbs?
Yes.
That was the horrifying discovery that was made last year.
Oh, my goodness.
Last X-Day.
Wow.
Is he like an Uber Bob who controls the actual moon?
No.
He's more of an underdog.

He's an underbob because he's under Bob's hat in the back.
And he's even less, he has even less consciousness than Dobbs.
Dobbs has a brain cell.
Only one, but it's the pure one.
But Dick, you know.
He's got all the consciousness probably of a fly.
Who knows what's in Bob's dick?
His twin brother, Richard, hanging off the back of his head.
Who knows what's in that thing?
Richard.
It's got horrible breath.
I always wondered why he smelled.
He smelled so bad from behind, which is the only way I've ever seen Bob.
You see his hat.
And the one pipe sticking out the correct side and one pipe sticking out the wrong side in the back.
And no one ever had a clue.
It's like, well, you didn't wonder why he never removed his hat.
Because you didn't wonder why he never had to light his pipe or remove it.
Now you find out it was all little Dickie's bad breath.
Yeah.
Yes, little Dickie's bad breath.
And I've smelled that too.
And I've always wondered.
Is that an appendage of Bob that has all the accrued consciousness of a bag of pecans?
Or is it perhaps something that's defecating in the wind for everyone to become a parent?
Why not both?
Why not both?
Why not both?
That's the best answer to everything.
That's all you've got to know.
Little Dick stinks.
So, yes, the mystery of Dick Dobbs has been, well,
well, explained, not solved.
What are we supposed to do?
What?
Do you know why?
I think we need to go to court.
Wait, wait, what?
To strike at Bob in some way.
What are you going to do?
Well, I suppose I should kick Bob.
I wouldn't deny we will.
Right in the underpants, the way you used to do it.
All right, I'll do it.
But of course, only as a lesson to Bob.
Right.
Yeah, that's what they all say.
Breathe slowly and backwards.
Hmm.
What if you breathed out when you were supposed to breathe in,
at the same time you were trying to breathe out?

You're going to consummate yourself in some peculiar way,
involving what we've just learned about little stinky Dick.
Dick could do breath singing.
What was that?
Where he would sing one way, and then he would sing that way,
and then he would keep singing this way.
And you'd never have to stop singing,
because you could sing while you were inhaling.
What was that?
He could turn his head down each individual part, you know?
Reverse singing.
And that would be a great song.
That's a great song item.
Yeah, but we can't.
I mean, the D already did it.
That was a tenacious D gimmick, the breath singing.
I think, what did he call it?
I thought it was called reverse singing or something.
Well, it was both ways.
It was, you know,
You could sing inhaling, and then you could sing exhaling,
and then you could sing inhaling some more,
and then you could, but it takes more practice.
Obviously, I'm better with the inhaling than I am with the exhaling,
inhaling on key, I think.
I know.
And so many have done this for so many years,
I and Zofia are so included.
Oh, so it's not new.
No, it makes one wonder how these ancient techniques
are being brought back as unusual or unique things,
when in reality they're just a rehash.
And there are no unique things under this current solar governance.
Yeah, that's negative, Lance, spent the first 15 minutes of last week's show
explaining that.
You may not have heard it, but they explained for 15 minutes
why there can never be anything original, at least in music.
And that includes collage and what we're doing and what they were doing.
Yes.
Which they then followed with an entire album proving the fact
that nothing new could be done.
Even though it was negative, Lance, I swear I'd heard it all before.
But maybe just in slightly different combinations, I don't know.
Enslavement.
Since they used to call them.
These various little combinations that were used.
And I guess even the hierarchy of negative, Lance,
back when it was a great empire in the, I think it was the 1920s it began.
Yeah, that was before they ripped off U2 and got famous.
Yeah.
And U as well.
Based in Prague in the former Czech Soviet Republic of Norway.
They assumed falsely at first and then correctly at a later date,
that the noises they were making were somehow causing or going to cause,
once again, a Nazi corporate reaction and enslavement of the individuals involved.
That meant that each member of the party apparatus had to sing or develop a song cycle
or come up with material in a certain way.
And if they didn't, they were shot.
I think you're wrong, Dave.
And you know why?
Why?
Because Prague is not in Norway.
Everybody knows it's in Denmark.
Oh, jeez.
Fuck off, Dave.
You ruined that.
That whole essay would have been perfect,
except that you got that one fact so wrong.
So very, very wrong.
I'm losing Denmark.
I was kidding.
I was just trying to, I don't know, just trying to prove a point.
Although all I can do right now is ears,
and it'll tend that point emerging from the middle of my forehead.
And it's not much.
It's not much.
It's not much.
It's not much.

It's empty, papa.
He's got that little thing growing out of his head again, Princess Wade.
Uh-oh.
So, when you were talking about Dick Dobbs,
it certainly rang numerous bells in my cathedral of faith.
Maybe it's a free-form trepanating hole opening up on its own.
Oh, my God, from inside.
Yeah.
I'm hoping so.
A free-form trepanating hole opening itself up?
Maybe.
Maybe.
Is Dave psychokinetic?


He's just so good that he can chip away at his skull from inside.
Just with the power of thought.
With telekinetic chisels.
Yes.
And chisel his whole way out of his own skull.
I think it's possible.
Chiseling my way out of my forehead.
Don't we all wish we could do that, friends?
Come on, gather around.
That's what this show is, an attempt to chisel our way out.
My pineal gland.
That's right.
I'm chiseling a huge hole in my forehead right now.
From the inside.
From the inside.
That's right, little Reverend Ivan.
Staying from the inside.
That's the only way it can be done.
That's the way big boys do it.
Just so long as it's not a prosthetic forehead.
This isn't a real forehead, isn't it?
Get back away from the dial now.
Well, it's realistic.
Come on, kid.
I can barely hear it running.
To quote old Bruce, the late Bruce.
Well, at that Thanksgiving dinner, we had to toast a lot of dead folks, man.
Yeah.
There's been a bunch.
Yeah, and they didn't taste very good even though it doesn't matter how long you toast

Not even toasted.
No.
No.
Put all the butter in the water.
I don't know.
I don't know.
We smoked some Chaz Lunk and we were all wearing our Steve Checkey t-shirts.
We'd been Princess Wee and we're exercising on our Bruce Flores Wee.
So see, everybody left something behind, but what about us when we die?
If we're not already dead.
Is this all there is?
This show?
Who knows?
The waves of this show go on forever and ever.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.
Please.
Someone somewhere, some god created them and perhaps on some distant planet millions of
years into the future, they'll pick these waves up and think that gods were telling
them what to do.
And it was a couple idiots in Cleveland.
Three, in fact, at this particular moment.
That was a...
Radio...
Weren't we discussing that old radio show just a few days ago?
That was a 1930s radio mystery and five comic books just in the 40s.
And three or four short stories in analog.
I guess supposedly Ray Bradbury did not commit suicide as planned because he published one
of those in either was analog or digital.
Right.
Because this.
Yes.
I didn't either as planned.
Some guy did commit suicide on 4chan like yesterday.
Really?
Yes, on the internets.
Yeah, a guy, he said, hey, I'm going to give something back to y'all.
And then he took a bunch of pills and drank a bunch of vodka on camera with people watching.
And then he curled up in his bed for a while.
He set his room on fire and curled up in his bed.
And they mean the camera showing all this stuff.
And he's texting, OMG, I'm on fire.
I'm OMG, I'm dead.
And then the firemen come and now they're trying to piece out where this was and what
happened.
So we don't know if the guy's dead or just, you know, messed up or what.
Because he was anonymous on 4chan sort of.
Well, I hope through Skype and 4chan, it's easy.
I just read about that today.
Happened previously.
Don't you think it would be...
Time control gone out of control.
One Bob killed one Bob.
What?
One Bob killed one Bob?
One of the Bob's in a string of Boston.
As a production, what if you chose that as your platform?
Hold on, hold on.
To the US.
Get out.
At least four Bob's today.
The same one on her forehead.
A malignant cancerous growth eating at the spiritual health of the American people.
I refer to Bob.
That settles it.
We'll show this lunatic who's Bob.
Good job.
Good job.
Good job.
No, that's not too much of a jump from here.
Stand back when the waves start splashing back.
But when you jump, you better jump good.
A great whale's about to chew us all up, Sting.
Yeah, it's a dick move.
A Moby dick move coming up through the ocean waves.
Coming to get us, Moby.
Have you seen the white whale?
He vexes me.
I could see it with like one of those Abe Lincoln beards and stuff.
That's right.
See?
Walking around the poop deck.
Tweench.
Tweench.
With my peg leg and my peg looking for somebody to peg.
A first mate, maybe.
Cabin boy.
And we would be Ishmael.
Adam Sandler.
And I'd be Pequot.
And I'd be, yeah, Adam Sandler.
No, I'd be Pequot.
Adam Sandler would be, what's his name?
Who would it be?
And co-starring Dr. Katahdin Kwee Kwee Legume.
What are you, trolling for Moby Dick Dobbs?
Well, again, would you troll for Moby Dick Dobbs, my friend?
I would not.
Do you think it's such a good idea to go trolling for Moby Dick Dobbs?
Hmm?
I don't think so.
I think you're definitely going to find it there.
A little square right beside your ear is telling you what you need to know when you need to
know it.
So just relax and let the fun begin.
And by the way, I'm extremely sorry about my speech impediment, but it only incurs more
wrath among the bigs.
So let's keep our eyes and ears and our noses to the grindstones.
I apologize.
I'm sorry.















Advice from the WWE.

The fight with the
Moby Dick Dobbs dad?
No, go ahead.
Either you take the pie or you take nothing.
See?
I'll take nothing.
Take the whole pie right in the face.
Why not both?
Take the pie and nothing.
Oh, wait.
No, I guess you can't always have both ways, can you?
Well, you can have your cake and eat it, too.
Yes, you can certainly invert the entire logic of the entire thing
and bring things back to normal again somehow.
But I don't know how.
Perhaps faith in some preterist supernatural being
or some salesman or something.
Faith, yes, that's it.
In something preternatural.
Not natural, but preternatural.
What the hell?
Not supernatural and not supranatural, but preternatural.
What's more preter than supra or super?
When you're talking natural.
Mr. Natural told me that.
He also said, the whole universe is completely insane.
Insane!
And I had to say to myself, that rings true.
That panel rings true.
The whole universe is completely insane.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
We would have to agree 100%.
In fact, right now, in the cloud,
as we speak various elements of both political units
and the armature factories,
of these Spanish nobles
and other increments closely related to this
complete and condom failure of consumption,
it's far beyond most of us here
to figure out what's really going on.
And if we could, why wouldn't we?
We must not have any more condom failures, my friends.
Your incontinence is impaling upon us.
We must move on in a greater constriction of torturobob.
I agree with you, Commander.
Well, good news.
Reverend Stane, I agree with you 100%.
And I bestow, as a part of my connection here
with the altar state.
The bestowings, yes.
The bestowals.
On behalf of Robert J.R.
Bob Dobbs,
I present you with this sandwich and pickle.
A sandwich and pickle.
That was great.
Thank you, gentlemen and esteemeries.
We here salute you and stand above you
and we water you from on high
and you, with all of your little bobs and echoes,
may drench yourselves in our effluvia.
Thank you, thank you.
No, no, no.
No, please.
It was nothing, really.
It was nothing.
Is that what that shower of stinky stuff is?
Ew.
I feel so much better now,
having unloaded myself upon you.
Ew.
I'm so happy to be back here at Rancho Deluxe.
But I first must ask Reverend Ivan Stane
if he is aware that before he knew
that I did not know your lovely wife,
Princess Weirdo,
before.
Before I knew her.
I was wondering if perhaps you understood
when I told little Pepe before
that before I knew the Princess Weirdo,
I did not know her.
I'm not little Pepe's father, you know.
I know that.
I...
You don't have to remind me
that little Pepe is not really my son.
Do you have to remind me again?
I am so sorry,
but I must bring the issue to your attention.
As I told you before,
I have spoken this many times,
but before I knew you,
I can only honestly and sincerely say
I did not know you.
Well, it is true that before I knew Lonesome Cowboy Daves,
I never knew Lonesome Cowboy Daves.
Hi, Maria.
You are so silly.
It is the story of the universe.
Before I knew you and before I knew Stang,
I did not know you or Stang.
Do you understand?
Pepe, come here.
I understand.
God has told me that I must kill you, little Pepe,
to prove my faith,
and also because Daves, your real father,
I am not going to let you grow up.
I am not going to let you grow up.
Stang, stay thy hand.
Ah, yes, I know that you would have slain beloved little Pepe for me,
but now I, thy God Jehovah One Dob, say,
nay, you need not kill little Pepe, but if you want to, go ahead.
Oh, boy, I can kill little Pepe after all.
What?
Oh, my God.
You're interpreting...
Oh, I changed my mind about little Pepe.
I'm glad.
At this point in time, this is what the producer and the director
and 500,000 other people just dragged in off the street
have asked you to please not kill little Pepe in this episode,
seeing how it's not a real episode after all.
Well, see, here's the thing.
Little Pepe, we took him to Burning Man.
He didn't pay for any of the trailer,
but he managed to break the mirror, break the doorknob, don't you remember?
He spilled beer all over the place.
And would sit there looking at it, you know,
spreading and spreading out of his beer bottle as if, you know,
setting it back up to prevent more...
See, that's the problem with little Pepe.
And he was eating pretty good, too, wasn't he?
He was eating everything in sight.
And he took a whole armful of mushrooms and passed out on a hammock out
in broad daylight under the hot sun and was all burnt to a little toasty crypt.
And that's why, ever since then,
we've been going, now, Pepe,
you better don't put that beer bottle down on top of the recording studio mix board.
Oh, no!
I don't even see why they let it burn.
Ask Dr. Howe.
I know.
Ask Dr. Howe.
I know.
The little Pepe stories are legendary.
Yes, I know.
And then there's little Dave.
She's 24.
But little Dave was such a guitarist, too.
If you don't love Bob,
you'll Bob.
And I know you do.
And as a Britannia country singer,
he was really, really way ahead of his time,
just like Bob was ahead of his time.
A discorporate, discarnate...
And Baby Civet was ahead of her time.
Who? Baby Civet?
Who the hell was Baby Civet?
She's the one that the really good coffee comes from.
You get the best coffee beans from Baby Civet.
She eats the beans and then you collect them later out in the woods.
In your German coffee machine.
Yeah, it's the most expensive coffee in the world is Little Baby Civet's special beans that have passed through Baby Civet.
That's not a joke either.
You can look that up on the internet.
Civet beans.
C-I-V-E-T.
Beans.
So Little Baby Pat.
Not to be confused with Reverend Two Beans.
No.
Who is only two beans.
And never more.
But he didn't want to be any more beans.
He said, upon his day's apocryphal snore, he said, I don't want to be three beans.
I only want to be what I am.
Unlike Popeye.
Let me be two beans.
Let me be me.
Let me bean.
Leave me bean.
Not just one bean or more beans, but two beans.
What time is it?
God, if we got another ten minutes of this nightmarish.
Be-be-be-be-be.
Be-be-be-be-be.
Let's do some difference.
Ten more minutes?
Some difference for the drug impaired.
Did we do that right?
I think so.
It sounded right to me.
It was so pretty.
I love that automatic reverb you got going from being next to the Coke machine downstairs
and having your foot stuck in the incremental medicine machine.
You know, actually, that's a sound effect.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot to play the sound effects record.
I found, sitting out in the studio, Dave, I found the old sound effects record,
Stereo Spectrum Spotlight on Sound Effects.
We all had a copy.
All of us.
And we all used them on our home movies, which is what this record was made for.
Yes, but they fit on turntables and not as you have tried to jam it in a CD machine.
It's vanilla.
Well?
Yeah, man.
I'm playing.
I'm actually putting on a turntable for the first time ever.
No, my eardrum actually exploded there for a brief moment.
There it is.
All right.
Okay.
Now it's a real subgenius show.
We have the LP sound effect record on in the background.
You hear it.
That's it.
Okay.
Let's see.
We got subgenius music.
By me.
Oh, man.
That's that electro stuff you see.
And then I could turn on yet another, but I won't.
I'll just leave it at that.
You're a tasteful man.
And more than that, you're an armpit full of lust and logic all in one greasy spoon.
And if others could have invented the same material logic that you have created
and so boldly ripped up in front of mankind, I'd certainly vote for you.
But instead, I'm heading for...
The sauces or the sausages, whichever come first.
I smell sausage.
We smell sausage.
Let's see.
Dave and Reverend Stang, we have received a text from Reverend Cynic,
who believes that circular breathing might be a related term.
The term for continuous singing is probably distinctively different.
Yes, especially since it came from...
Try B.
Well, there are the...
Yes.
Of course, the monks of Tibet that burped really, really long...
Right.
Right.
Are you guys doing throat singing?
No, we just shaved our heads and gave our entire existence to the monastery of our choice.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.





Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.
Oh.
Oh, they're happy.
Oh, they're...
See, I can talk after all.
You inf interpret...
Shut up!
No, no, please.
It was nothing.
Keep it down.
Thank you.
Hey, wait a minute.
No, you can bring it back up.
Hello?
What is that?
Oh, no.
It's just a...
It's the glaciers erupting.
We've got to get out of here pretty quick anyway,
at least to try to make some semblance of order out of it.
The first crackage goes kind of a due north direction.
The second crackage goes in a due east direction.
And the third crack in the ice goes right through your pineal gland.
And we're looking for recruits, advocates, dingleberries, armatures,
once again, people who can play the horn
and pass gas in the religious way that we've all become accustomed to,
living under, with, next to, besides, and of course...
Of course.
Of course.
There were only three of them at first.
I thought they were going to try and take my money,
but instead they took my shoelaces.
Not my shoes, my shoelaces.
Then they ran away.
And then one of them started crying.
He got hit by a car.
I didn't feel responsible.
It was the strangest thing I've ever seen.
That's why I joined.
That's why everybody joined.
By a car, you say?
They love cars and they love horns.
They love the busy life of an industrial street
where they make chickens and pies and huge ingots of iron and silver.
And where the common working man has...
dirt on his shoes and dirt between his ears.
Captain?
Um, they're still in the basement.
They are?
Yes, I think.
I can hear them talking in a foreign language.
I think it's from Romain or something like that.
Bethesda.
Wow.
Wow.
That's really, really strange.
Yeah, man.
I think you ought to take a small nap
before you get up and start talking like that.
You took a snapple instead of a napple.
Yeah, you could do a snapple instead of a napple.
You can't say napple on the air.
I had to bleep that.
It's criminal.
See, they're coming to get you.
Here they come.
You said napple on the air.
Oh, no.
I just said it.
They'll never catch me alive.
That's the time of the world, Ma.
Come and get me.
Did you notice how the invisibility potion worked so well?
Wait a minute.
You have the right to remain silent,
except when you're on the air.
Then you must keep talking.
You have the right to a defense attorney,
of the state's choice.
You have a right to turn left,
and a left to turn communist.
These are some remarkably sincere words
from Sergeant Veldon Walsby
of the Ohio State Meager Patrol.
Throughout his years of service to the community,
driving around in a car, highly armed,
he has done,
and learned plenty.
And let's just ask our social forensic psycho,
psycho, psycho, social analysis,
Dana Hurts.
I mean, I'm sorry, Dana.
Dana Hurts.
From in...
Dave, okay, now it's time to go.
The show is over.
Where's Dana?
She's gone.
Where's Dana?
Dana's gone.
We have to...
It's time to go.
It's time.
But where's Dino?
Dino's not here.
I'm not.
Dr. Sinister's not even here.
Grebo is not here.
None of them are here.
And so, Dave, I'm going to fade you out.
Do you have any last moments?
I have quite a few last moments,
but I can only abjure and directly
and dishonestly, if possibly,
can tell the listening audience
with extreme sincerity...
...forget to rationalize your sins.
He brings not forgiveness...
Uh-oh.
Well, I better be careful how I play that
and end it out,
because that will cause all sorts of serious problems.
Anyway, friends,
