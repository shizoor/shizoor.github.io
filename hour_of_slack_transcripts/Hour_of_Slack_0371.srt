1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
That's right. There's no respect in the subgenius world.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,300
Anything you say goes into the ether, and it gets captured by whatever medium is available.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,400
Most of what you say goes on the magnetic tape, unfortunately.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,660
Copyrights are null and void.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,340
All copyrights null and void, the judge is a subgenius.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,360
I don't recall.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,500
The worst stereotypes about subgeniuses have come out of these hearings.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,520
The information revealed in these hearings has tended to reinforce all the negative stereotypes that people have about subgenius.

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,800
This is just a high-tech listen for subgenius, brother.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,120
For nobody's subgenius.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,720
Yes, dear friends, the Sully and Love Corpses and I will get it together somehow or another.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,840
It is going to be one of those shows, lots of music you haven't heard,

13
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,000
and lots of whatever we come up with at the last minute.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,540
Yes.

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,460
One of those Panicsville shows.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,760
Oh, no.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,060
You say Claus ought to be here by now, Didi.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,780
He's always on time.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,700
Oh, Tim, what will he say and what will he do when he finds the one?

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,280
The subgenius.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,880
Our house.

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:15,800
What?

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,200
Here you go.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,460
Oh, look at that.

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,560
Wow, the caller's been trained. That's wonderful.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,380
That works out for me.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,640
Yes, we have better equipment.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,080
We have...

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,460
A whole radio station.

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,040
And we can do anything we want.

31
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,600
And often do.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,160
But, Dr. Howell, why?

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,940
Why what, my boy?

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Why must you humiliate me in public like this?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,960
I didn't mean to humiliate no one, son.

36
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,180
But, caller, that's his job.

37
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm not even actually present.

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,540
But if I were, I would not humiliate you.

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,760
Dr. Howell is a friend of all humanity.

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,720
His humiliation exists.

41
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,680
The only thing that matters to me is that you're a good person.

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,200
And you know, son, modern electronics can reliably count small numbers of electrons down to a single particle.

43
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:16,260
So if one electron is ripped from the outer shell of each atom, then the electrons are counted, the number of atoms will be known.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,880
And then lasers can be used as versatile and efficient guns for knocking electrons out of atoms.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,660
Only the method is not in the least bit selective.

46
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,100
Heh heh.

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,520
Heh heh.

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,520


49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,080
Yes, it is.

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,300
Select gun now.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,240
If one climbs the food chain and loses all threats to existence, does he wither?

52
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:45,580
Cooperation may also be an evolutionary strategy, perhaps of our genes, to increase their concentration in the gene pool of humans.

53
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,780
And are we not the constructs used by those at Galactic Center to learn of the universe and bring back a recording in 2012?

54
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,980
I'll be your host here.

55
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:57,920
As you sit in traffic.

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,580
Hey, wait a minute.

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,100
I haven't given control of this thing, no.

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,640
Oh, wait a minute.

59
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,000
No, listen.

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,380
No, I'm scheduled to go on at this time.

61
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,100
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm your regular disc jockey.

63
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,600
Who are you?

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:06,940
Who are you?

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:06,940


67
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,420
Who's this guy?

68
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,900
I'm taking over the station.

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,920
Is there any doubt?

70
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,680
No, I'm Mr. Troy.

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:10,700
No, I'm Mr. Troy.

72
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,740
Callers, is there any doubt?

73
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,060
No, I'm Mr. Troy.

74
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,600
Hey, we've got a problem.

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm telling you guys, I was taking over about an hour.

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,440
No, no, no.

77
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,440


78
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,240
If it is a good recording, i.e. makes sense, works, is efficient.

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,260
It'll be a miracle.

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,560
Such as a gene for sacrificing oneself to let live two or more fertile phenotypes carrying that same gene.

81
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:44,360
But we constantly, and in best human action typically, diverge, converge, merge, emerge, as new under the sun, but not new under the sun.

82
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,740
Yeah, that's right, dear friends.

83
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,220
Nothing new.

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,260
Nothing new under the sun.

85
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,580
Except that this is the all new subgenius hour of slack.

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,540
Unmatched.

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,260
Which means it's almost as good as the competition.

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,980
With incredible design simplicity.

89
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,400
Costs cut to the very bone.

90
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,280
Foolproof operations.

91
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,620
Satisfaction guaranteed.

92
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,060
Micro-processors controlled.

93
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,220
However, the church of the subgenius and KNON are not responsible for fractures of interdimensional energy.

94
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:34,800
They are responsible for the lack of conventional consciousness, cellular, oral incontinence, nor personal violence resulting from close contact with the macroverse of pain and retribution, which is this show and this church.

95
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,320
Remember, always sit at least 25 feet away from your receiver for maximum subliminal penetration.

96
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:51,720
We remind you that recording the subgenius radio ministry is a federal crime punishable by a fine of not less than $10,000 and a minimum prison sentence of not less than 15 years.

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:05:02,140
Reproduction by digital, cassette, wire, video, heliograph, xerox, or interocitor recorder is forbidden by law.

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,000
Right?

99
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,560
Yeah, I know you heard me.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,660
I know you heard me on that one, dear friends.

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Bob Haywood.

102
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,420
Bob?

103
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,760
How?

104
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,320
It was an accident.

105
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,560
Bob kills pigs dead.

106
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Bob kills pigs dead.

107
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,260
Bob kills pigs dead.

108
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,620
Bob kills pigs dead.

109
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,220
Bob kills pigs dead.

110
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,300
Bob kills pigs dead.

111
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,360
Bob kills pigs dead.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,040
Kill him.

113
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,580
Bobミagел

114
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,980
Kill Big Dad, kill him!

115
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,640
Kill Big Dad, Bob!

116
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,920
Kill Big Dad, Bob!

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,640
Bob!

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,560
Friends, Bob does kill pinks dead.

119
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm afraid he really does, and I've got proof of it right here.

120
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,520
In fact, it's the proof that we've been waiting for all this time.

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,140
I'll let the Reverend Gino Saad's music run in the background here

122
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,040
while I read to you this amazing clipping we got

123
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,760
from a member, a subgenius minister in England.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,380
Reverend Annie McGrath sent us her change of address

125
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,540
and also a photocopy of this article,

126
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,880
this completely straight and dead serious article, friends,

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,420
from the...

128
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,260
The Bedford on Sunday Times.

129
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:31,680
All right.

130
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,280
No, I think I ought to do this without music.

131
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,260
From the Bedford on Sunday Times,

132
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,080
and it's got a photograph printed here.

133
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,260
It's a picture of a wall on which is spray-painted Bob's face,

134
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
a nice stencil of J.R. Bob Dobb,

135
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,740
with kind of crossed bones underneath it,

136
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,820
and then hand-sprayed on.

137
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,280
It says, Bob is slack, a standard subgenius graffitis,

138
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,340
that one sees, you know, in most major cities,

139
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,000
and a little caption underneath,

140
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,380
Bob is slack, not the innocent graffiti it originally seemed to be.

141
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,260
The headline is,

142
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,680
Satanic sect shows its face.

143
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,200
And the best part of this is the date is July 6th, 1992,

144
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,600
the day after X-Day.

145
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,200
That was the day that this article appeared,

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,880
just by coincidence, perhaps.

147
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,960
But these...

148
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,860
These folks are serious, I believe,

149
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,720
and they say here,

150
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,020
a secret religious sect,

151
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,540
which claims to have conjured up the Gulf War,

152
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,740
is infiltrating Bedford.

153
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,140
What was thought to be a harmless pavement graffiti of a man's face

154
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,640
is actually a sketch of the sect's founder, Bob Dodds.

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,000
That's Bob Dodds.

156
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,020
Now we know his real name,

157
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,360
who now calls himself a high priest.

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,920
The magician...

159
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,140
The magician's genius is a sect from America,

160
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,940
which is growing in size in Britain.

161
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,840
It is believed the main target is adolescence.

162
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,960
The sect's doctrine and practices are mainly unknown,

163
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,700
but members did claim to have conjured up the Gulf War in February 91,

164
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,220
according to the Independent newspaper.

165
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,780
I'd sure like to get a copy of the Independent.

166
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,820
The word slack, used under some of the stenciled art,

167
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,200
is a description of a power of the human race,

168
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,060
lost thousands of years ago.

169
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,940
Slack is a power...

170
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,700
which maintains the tranquility of the race.

171
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,400
What? They got that part right.

172
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,480
The artist, or artists responsible,

173
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,480
have not been found.

174
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,660
It is a clear sign there is an active unit of the sect

175
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,280
operating in Bedford.

176
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,340
Followers hold believers' meetings in their homes

177
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,720
and during the day,

178
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,780
carry out normal, everyday jobs.

179
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,640
God.

180
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,500
The sect concentrates on supernatural powers and beliefs which

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,840
other Christians,

182
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:56,920


183
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,740
and denominations,

184
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,780
term as satanic and evil.

185
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,160
Bedfordshire on Sunday reported last week how the face of Bob

186
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,720
was peering up from a number of pavements across Bedford.

187
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,560
The design is used to publicise the image of the sect.

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,760
In other adult comic magazines,

189
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,140
the symbol is printed in the small advertisement section,

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,660
asking people to send one pound for more information.

191
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,900
A man who said his identity as a follower of the sect must be kept secret.

192
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,160
He said,

193
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,140
quote,

194
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,060
This graffiti is intended to grab people's attention.

195
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,960
The design slips into your subconscious

196
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,900
and will emerge when people learn more about the sect.

197
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh dear friends,

198
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,120
I have been waiting for 12 years to get a clipping like that.

199
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,180
And of course we've run a thousand copies of it.

200
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,460
It'll be a part and parcel of all membership packs from now on.

201
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,960
It's proof, dear friends.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,680
It's as good as the time the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Macintosh virus

203
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,920
was a result of this evil sect started by this J.R. Bob Dobbs,

204
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,240
who was unfortunately assassinated and killed.

205
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,180
See, it's in news, it's in print now,

206
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,520
that Bob Dobbs was a man who was killed in January of 1984.

207
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,640
What they never bothered to print is that he was resurrected about six months later.

208
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,320
But well, we, that's,

209
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,400
another part of the story, friends.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,520
What on earth?

211
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,700
Someone left the radio station on.

212
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,100
I'll just sit down and broadcast for Jesus.

213
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,380
Now you know that Yehob in the old greasy book

214
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,260
was turned into a pillar of coal by Jehovah One

215
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,360
because he pisseth against the wall.

216
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,260
And when they were done,

217
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,820
it so happened that came unto them

218
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,740
the fishers of Three Wallets,

219
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,300
who were the Abhog Eye.

220
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,780
And they moved into the land of Grunthor,

221
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,400
where there is Bdilium and the Onyx Stone.

222
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,800
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.

223
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,820
If you would like a free picture of me in compromising positions,

224
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,360
write to Aunt Bertha,

225
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,020
dial a picture,

226
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,560
Box 1, Grand Rapids, Michigan,

227
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
848-445.

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,440
And if you want to know more,

229
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,440


230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,440


231
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,940
Goodbye, now.

232
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Goodbye.

233
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,900
Hey, what?

234
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
That flash, that light.

235
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:33,900
It disappeared.

236
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,620
What was that?

237
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,500
Well, it was somebody in here.

238
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
It kind of looked like just a flash of light

239
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
shaped like an old lady,

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,900
but that organ music.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,940
Hey, is this ever corny.

242
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,940
What the heck's going on around here?

243
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,440
Yeah.

244
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,180
Now get that organ music off.

245
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,680
You know, it's almost that.

246
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,360
That's KPFA.

247
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,600
Hey, you smell that old lady like perfume?

248
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,720
Where'd that come from?

249
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:11,020
Oh, yeah, a little bit of Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence there from the KPFA Berkeley Subgenius

250
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,260
Show.

251
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,820
It's so nice that they send us tapes of that show, and when the Swingin' Love Corps is cut

252
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,880
off, I can cut them on again because they too send those tapes.

253
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,800
And speaking of tapes, I've got this amazing little piece of tape.

254
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:25,800


255
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:25,800


256
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:25,800


257
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:25,800


258
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,320
I've got a little piece here to play for you that we just got from Hell Pope Huey.

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Hell Pope Huey, who now lives in Arkansas, used to be a Houston radio personality or

260
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,900
anti-personality, and he's done this collage about, well, one of our favorite personalities.

261
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,400
Not too long ago, we got a letter from a listener going, when are you guys going to recognize

262
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,660
the greatness of Rush Limbaugh?

263
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,640
Yes.

264
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,680
A subgenius listener was a big, big fan of Rush Limbaugh.

265
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,660
And I mean, he's a serious fan of Rush.

266
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:10,060
He doesn't just like Rush Limbaugh the way some of us do as a sort of a scary clown figure.

267
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,440
No.

268
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:17,500
No, this guy wanted us to quit pussyfooting around and get on the air and explain just

269
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,860
how truly great, what a great man we felt that Rush was.

270
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,620
And I think that this tape by Pope Huey has a great, great influence on our lives.

271
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:25,620


272
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:25,620


273
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,200
And I think that this tape by Pope Huey has allowed me to let Rush speak for us as to

274
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,480
how that works, dear friend.

275
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,460
So stay tuned here for a lovely, lovely moment of truth.

276
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
This thing is like 15 minutes long, and I haven't heard all of it myself.

277
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,380
Oh, yes.

278
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:54,520
The excitement of the hour of slack and its death throes of living panic.

279
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Oh, yes.

280
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,600


281
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,420
And I think that's what's going to be the most exciting part of this.

282
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,140
I think it's going to be a great, great moment of truth.

283
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:20,240
I think it's going to be a great, great moment of truth.

284
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,100
Here's what I know.

285
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,580
The radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools.

286
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,580


287
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,240
I don't know how this idea has taken hold, but it is damn scary.

288
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,620
Well, it was just a montage about right-wing radio.

289
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,500
Let's make it a full-fledged educational experience.

290
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,360
It's a beautiful thing.

291
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,560
I just want to say that I've been really good to myself, and I'm going to keep doing it.

292
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,560


293
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,560


294
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,560


295
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,320
And I'm really getting high on myself, and I really like what I'm doing.

296
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,380
One, two, three, four.

297
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,200
But pride welled in his breast.

298
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:20,280
I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage called the blood of the exploited working class.

299
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,480
But they've overcome their shyness.

300
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
Now they're calling me your highness.

301
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,880
And he thinks he looks good to you.

302
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,700
He thinks he looks good to you.

303
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,160
I know what's going on. That's really the whole thing.

304
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,400
Hey, what's going on here?

305
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,780
That doesn't sound right.

306
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
It doesn't sound fair.

307
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,480
Desperate, pathetic, tired, worn-out old guy.

308
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,540
If he answers because it's wrong, you know you're on the right track.

309
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
This may be the biggest thing that's ever happened.

310
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,920
It's the biggest thing that's ever happened in our time.

311
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,120
We're facing a new form of life that nobody understands.

312
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,160
When...

313
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,220
When man must be famous.

314
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,360
He thought he was incredible.

315
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:24,580
Incredible!

316
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,940
You poor man got your head screwed on wrong.

317
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,400
No, I'm sure that wasn't done before the accident.

318
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,320
Uh, but don't count on it.

319
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,720
All kinds of terribly distorted, perverted strains of logic.

320
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,060
Swallow it. Swallow it.

321
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Do you think it's safe?

322
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,920
Oh, sure, Dad. Go ahead.

323
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,040
Swallow it.

324
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,760
Okay.

325
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,660
Everyone makes mistakes.

326
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,560
He didn't understand the stupid question.

327
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,580
Many people can't send their kids to college or retire comfortably.

328
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh, yeah, Rush T. That'd be great.

329
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,200
I love it when we screw up the works.

330
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,460
I love it when we screw up the works.

331
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,860
If you think this company's bad, I've now displayed all I get for it.

332
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,100
Witness Rush Slimbaugh's prostate suddenly blow up to the size of an Army surplus weather balloon.

333
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,020
What a riot!

334
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, you're supposed to love me, you vile jelly. Take that.

335
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,560
I can't believe it. Created a monster.

336
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,060
As I like to rush, you're not beautiful.

337
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,520
I am the epitome of family values.

338
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,100
I'm ready.

339
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,480
So much insistence in that family, even the bulldog's got a club foot.

340
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,240
Toothache. Cold sores.

341
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,740
The sex.

342
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,520
Backaches.

343
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,100
Bad breath.

344
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,740
Perspiration.

345
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,400
Smelling.

346
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,180
Palsy.

347
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,720
Gurgles.

348
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,640
Spillover.

349
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,120
Water on the brain.

350
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,340
Sinus congestion.

351
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,220
Epilepsy.

352
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,880
Arthritis.

353
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,420
Fever.

354
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,040
Dandruff.

355
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,300
Dirt.

356
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,700
Pneumosis.

357
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,500
Epidermolytes.

358
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,300
Club feet.

359
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,460
You got it made.

360
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,180
I did.

361
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm sorry. I shot at you.

362
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,060
Deadness pain immediately.

363
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,360
There's some dangers here. Some bad signs.

364
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,120
Not everything we say is always true.

365
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,180
That goes tough on your LV's part.

366
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,280
So we'll have to throw you out the window.

367
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,000
And people like, well, you.

368
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,860
And others who are complaining loudly that what they're seeing they don't think is objective and fair.

369
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,880
Well, I think I should be kicked in the upper lip with a steel tip toe cap. Don't we, girls?

370
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,560
Yeah!

371
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,100
What?

372
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,860
What?

373
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,660
We laughed over it.

374
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,220
The ladies, we laughed over it.

375
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,760
Anyway, punch me in the mouth.

376
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,360
This may be enough to make me lose my cookies.

377
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,240
Nothing.

378
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,920
Who's going to listen to that?

379
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,400
And when they do, how are they going to feel?

380
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,800
Well, I don't have to think about that.

381
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,140
You do.

382
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,100
There's no found but I recall he did it a spanking.

383
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,180
He did it a spanking.

384
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,560
He did it a spanking.

385
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:14,640


386
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,280
Nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh-nyeh.

387
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,760
Some people need to be mashed under a large rock, man. You're probably one of them.

388
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,120
Alright, get snide and snippy about that, huh?

389
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,240
Huh?

390
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:44,660
God bless America. My home.

391
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,240
The meltdown.

392
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,420
The meltdown.

393
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,280
Is all that good Mr. Rory's food.

394
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,100
Whether you're a...

395
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,140
Your favorite is hyena tongue or tail, you'll enjoy it even more at a Mr. Rory's Arizona Bay Hyena Tribe drive-thru.

396
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,020
See your phone book for the one nearest you.

397
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,020
They can get me out of here. Why did I agree to this format?

398
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,880
Becoming victims of very, very high, uh, high profile, very high energy con men. No question about that.

399
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,040
They say he's got a special gift.

400
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,800
But I don't envy him at all.

401
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,740
Golly, folks, can you believe this?

402
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,780
What are we to do?

403
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,520
I'm a sa-kwap-dee, kwap-dew!

404
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,400
You should just carry your soviee pile, pile, right in the girl's pants.

405
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:52,100
From your heart, Adolph, tell me this. If you had it to do all over again, would you have stayed a paperhanger?

406
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,340
If I may be bold, who's bitching about that?

407
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,740
Turn around and kick your neighbor in the crotch.

408
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,720
It's not a...

409
00:21:59,720 --> 00:21:59,720


410
00:21:59,720 --> 00:21:59,720


411
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,060
It says I got the wrong attitude.

412
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,480
I should see the chap and get straight with Jesus.

413
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,480
Never, ever allow yourself to be ridden...

414
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,800
Too much smoke a minute.

415
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,540
Too much smoke a minute for me to be fine.

416
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,200
I learn to hate at every minute.

417
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,480
I'm a little bit of a...

418
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,620
Enough of a potential insult.

419
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,540
Golly, folks, can you believe this?

420
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,580
No, no, no, a little more humanity, please.

421
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,380
Here's the mail today, Bunky.

422
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,140
Looks like your top's again.

423
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,600
You always get a bundle, don't you?

424
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,380
You know, it's surprising how many people write them poison pen letters these days.

425
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,400
It's not just a pleasure to behold.

426
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,180
It also satisfies the soul.

427
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,020
And...

428
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,420
Local residents are wearing a frown.

429
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,360
While the noise they try to track down.

430
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,160
But the mysterious Hummer remains a real bummer.

431
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,960
Till they can miticize Hueytown.

432
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,420
They were idiots.

433
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,160
Butt heads, butt heads, butt heads, butt heads, butt heads, butt heads, butt heads, butt heads.

434
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,060
Oh, I'll never get the vanity.

435
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,760
Sleeping with the enemy, you know.

436
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,940
I just don't know much of anything.

437
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,080
Maybe I ought to be shot point blank in the stamper tonight.

438
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,460
And what is good for this country.

439
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:39,560
And we see the constitutional rights of little people being trampled by a faceless government bureaucracy that's out to promote its own ends and expand its own power.

440
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,800
Hmm, and does that rhetoric sound familiar to anybody?

441
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,440
This makes total sense to me.

442
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,780
I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.

443
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,460
Yes.

444
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,280
Are you suffering from information overload?

445
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Are you suffering from information overload?

446
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,920
Are you suffering from information overload?

447
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Are you suffering from information overload?

448
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,060
Are you suffering from information overload?

449
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,120
Are you suffering from information overload?

450
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,320
Are you suffering from information overload?

451
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,820
Are you suffering from information overload?

452
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,420
I am, I am admittedly frustrated and I don't do this.

453
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,240
Are you suffering from information overload?

454
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,580
How do you rate your embarrassment response?

455
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,040
A, hi.

456
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,080
B, hello.

457
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,440
C, good evening.

458
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,460
If C, you are loosening up and will soon be ready for this.

459
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,160
.

460
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,320
.

461
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,560
.

462
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:20,760
.

463
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,260
.

464
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,660
.

465
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:34,660


466
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,840
.

467
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:47,940
.

468
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:47,940


469
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,180
C mañana bate.

470
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,180


471
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,620
Let's make it a full-fledged educational experience.

472
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,840
And the voice never fails to sweeten the stomach and open the bowels.

473
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Things kept going from bed to voice, but we all put our shoulders to the wheel,

474
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,080
and it wasn't long before I was flat on my back again.

475
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:57,880
Any questions?

476
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,180
It isn't very pretty, what a time to be happy.

477
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,980
But it wasn't a dream.

478
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,680
This was a real, truly live place.

479
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,680
And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice, but most of it was beautiful.

480
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,640
You never know when someone may froth at the mouth.

481
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,240
Whether or not they're right or wrong, it's great to hear someone froth at the mouth, right?

482
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,400
There's a breakthrough, and I think I recommend it to others.

483
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,680
Other parents who are potty-training their children.

484
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,380
Ah, yes, you're starting to get it.

485
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,640
Eh, no.

486
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,680
Oh, good, good.

487
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,800
No.

488
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:49,260
I believe that God can put you in the right place at the right time to hear exactly what you need to hear.

489
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,160
You can take those records and run them backwards, and you hear Satan talking on there.

490
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,600
Right, you know I am right.

491
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:58,940
Hello.

492
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,260
This is God.

493
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:08,120
Now, I don't like these things any more than you do, but you know, frankly, I don't have time to keep track of everything that goes on around me.

494
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,520
I've got a whole universe to deal with.

495
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,740
Imagine that.

496
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,220
I bet that surprises many of you people.

497
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,040
A complete imbecile!

498
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,120
I don't want to be that!

499
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,900
I can weave it all together, and it's always usable.

500
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,580
It's rotten. It's no good.

501
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,320
Boy makeup sets a terrible nail.

502
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,060
Oh.

503
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,060


504
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,720
Oh.

505
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,540
Huey.

506
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:29,640
Huey.

507
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:29,840


508
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,740
Where yesterday's psychopathology becomes today's middle-class youth culture affectation.

509
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:50,580
The prophets of a brave new world, captains of industry, have visions grand and great designs, but none have room for me.

510
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,720
I love it when we screw up the works.

511
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,700
I love it when we screw up the works.

512
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:58,700


513
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:58,700


514
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:58,840
I love it when we screw up the works.

515
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,560
Your proposition may be good, but let's have one thing understood.

516
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,040
Whatever it is, I am against it.

517
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,720
And even when you've changed it or condensed it, I'm against it.

518
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,900
Because this may be enough to make me lose my cookies.

519
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,460
In my way that I use you, do you think I really abused you?

520
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,300
On reflection now, it doesn't matter.

521
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,520
Only to be with you, I've done all these things.

522
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,640
Yeah, with you, the fat one, that's it.

523
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,700
You're a real jerk.

524
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


525
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


526
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


527
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


528
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


529
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


530
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


531
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


532
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


533
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:28,700


534
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,580
You're the fat one, and I wanna be with you.

535
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:30,940
What's this?

536
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,660
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

537
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:43,040
And when this punk kid finished his diatribe, Reagan said, well, you're right.

538
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:43,880
Quit.

539
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,460
Golly, folks, can you believe this?

540
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,560
No, you watch it there, buster.

541
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,020
Come on, Bullwinkle, let's get out of here.

542
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,400
We don't need to take any crap from this clown.

543
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,460
We're done.

544
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,540
I'm not going to make obscene phone calls again tonight, sir.

545
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,140
He's a big s*** boy.

546
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,400
As far as I know, sir.

547
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,460
Thank you for calling, you pathetic, cringing little milksop.

548
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,220
We gotta save this for the TV show.

549
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,420
Slapsticks.

550
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,900
Knee slappin', side splittin', rib splittin', gut bustin'.

551
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,400
Laugh, I thought I'd die.

552
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,420
I think all this is a crock.

553
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,440
I don't think anything's gonna happen.

554
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:28,680
I'm gonna go to bed.

555
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,080
I don't think there's any real differences here.

556
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,340
And I'm fed up with it.

557
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,480
It's piping hot and it tastes real good.

558
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,880
Throw out your hands, pick out your push.

559
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,980
Hands on your hips, get on the push.

560
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,560
You'll be surprised you're doing the French mistake.

561
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,060
Voila!

562
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,800
Bunch of crap.

563
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,700
Amazing piece there on the other side.

564
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:04,080
The Rush Limbaugh Roast Collage by Hell Pope Huey.

565
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,040
And you know that took a lot of time, dear friends.

566
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,040
A long, long time.

567
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,280
And we just had someone call in a little while ago with a pertinent question.

568
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,020
A question which I can answer.

569
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,660
This poor child.

570
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,460
I know this sounds like a line you've heard on a subgenius revival before.

571
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,200
But this poor child actually called up and said,

572
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,600
well, she didn't ask if Bob was dead.

573
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,460
She said, Reverend Stang, is Bob immortal?

574
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,320
And one thing that our new book is going to do is clear up a number of misconceptions.

575
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:42,220
And misconception number one is that Bob is dead.

576
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,080
That is an absolute misconception.

577
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,880
It's a lie.

578
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,900
A black lie.

579
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,880
Of course, they started making accusations that the inner circle had murdered Bob to get power ourselves.

580
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,180
And of course, finally, we had to tell everybody that Bob wasn't real.

581
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,240
So he couldn't be dead.

582
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,120
And since he wasn't real, he was immortal.

583
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,660
And that's a lot better than real.

584
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,800
And even Bob liked that one, friends.

585
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,020
But you want to know just how dead is Bob.

586
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,700
And you'll be glad to learn, if you've had the unquestioning faith before,

587
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,060
that J.R. Bob Dobbs is completely undead and undead for good.

588
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,980
You may already have heard that J.R. Bob Dobbs was allegedly shot and killed on January 21, 1984.

589
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,420
At the Victoria Theater in San Francisco.

590
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,580
You may not know that it happened again in Los Angeles in 1985.

591
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,560
In rural Arkansas in 1986.

592
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,960
In St. Louis in 1988.

593
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,340
And in Atlanta in 1992.

594
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,820
Now according to Dobbs' own account, after each bungled resurrection or assassination,

595
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,640
and or assassination, same thing in his case,

596
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,020
he was immediately dispatched back to hell.

597
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,340
But he repeatedly lucked his way out of hell.

598
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,520
Winning the Hell Gladiator Games, beating the devil at poker,

599
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,560
even digging his way to the surface.

600
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,700
Although he was re-killed and sentenced even deeper into hell after each breakout or reincarnation,

601
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,900
the daring escapes still proved humiliating to Satan.

602
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,260
When finally, Dobbs out-tempted Lucifer and seduced his wife.

603
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,460
Put horns on the devil, you might say.

604
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,660
It was the last straw and Bob Dobbs was banished.

605
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,080
Banished, dear friends, even from hell itself.

606
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,880
And since he was never baptized, of course, Bob has never been able to enter heaven either.

607
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,300
So there is nowhere for Bob to go in death now.

608
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,080
It is because Bob was killed so many times,

609
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,100
and yet is banished from all available afterlives,

610
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,320
that he now cannot die.

611
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:59,560
He can only wait around for X day here on earth with the rest of us.

612
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:05,580
At least, until he is baptized or Satan forgives him.

613
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,420
I hope that answers any questions.

614
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,600
As we like to say, friends,

615
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,700
curiosity killed the cat, but loathsome rituals brought it back.

616
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,600
Alas, dainty Palestasky does not fully understand the story now.

617
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:42,660
So far weeks gone by like fry tuff,

618
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,440
And which таких of fruits is more significant for sweet spoilage?

619
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,160
Or hatred?

620
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,760
Can we get to know the truth?

621
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,460
Let´s do 16 more requests before dounding Mobst powerfs.

622

¶¶

623
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:24,720
Friends, this music you're listening to, instrumental, called Bob.

624
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,240
It's the title of it, Bob.

625
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,560
Done by St. J. Condom, author of the great P-Dog comics

626
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,120
and many, many other fine subgenius pieces.

627
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,880
Co-author, in fact, of the Lee Harvey is a Friend of Mine song

628
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,120
that so many people love.

629
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:49,780
This music is on the Zombo Fropland cassette tape.

630
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,900
You'll have to refer to your subgenius catalog for that.

631
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,720
I'll give information on where you can get that at the end of the broadcast.

632
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,720
Dear friends.

633
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,080
Ah, yes.

634
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,420
Ah, yes.

635
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,860
But I think it's time for some more traditional music.

636
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,880
This is from the Rudy Schwartz Project.

637
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,060
Once again, Reverend Joe Newman, this time doing this lovely short tune,

638
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,200
An Orange is Nothing But a...

639
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,440

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,920
At the World Subcon by Captain Nancy Darnell

713
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,360
Who is an American subgenius

714
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,420
Who's been living in Germany for a long time

715
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,400
And according to the PR she gave me

716
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,460
Uh, The Cloaking Device ist die Tarnung

717
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,840
Der Ultimate Klingons

718
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,860
Kontakt mit Arbeiderischen Humanoiden

719
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,560
Scalar Technology

720
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,760
Braintech Food Waves

721
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,840
And here's a good one

722
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,800
Erklärung der Illuminaten machen Schaffen

723
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,820
So, uh, and get turned off the winds

724
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,120
In the Church of Subgenius

725
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,840
Um, Bob Dobbs

726
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,880
High Epoch of the Church of the Subgenius

727
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,780
Über die See die

728
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,580
Dies Band, says Bob

729
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,600
Müd die während Wartung selbst übernehmen

730
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,040
So, um, Captain Nancy Darnell now is

731
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,820
And, uh, Ultimate Klingons from Cloaking Device

732
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,760
Will sing to you about the conspiracy

733
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,380
Them, they, T-H-E-Y

734
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,300
Huuuh

735
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,960
T-H-E-Y

736
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,320
T-H-E-Y

737
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,320
Are responsible for everything

738
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:37,860
T-H-E-Y

739
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:37,860


740
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:37,860


741
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:37,860


742
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:37,860


743
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,100
Huuuh

744
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,440
Huuuh

745
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,320
Huuuh

746
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,600
Listen and hear

747
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,280
Cookin' your goose

748
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,240
They're registering your life

749
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,440
For future years

750
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,640
Turn on the juice

751
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,560
Registerin' your life

752
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,680
For future use

753
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,020
The conspiracy's got its grips on you

754
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,900
They tell you what to think

755
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,600
And they tell you what to do

756
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,380
They got your gold to work

757
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,200
And mine's shit and stuff

758
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,820
Watch your TV and you never get enough

759
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,260
T-H-E-Y

760
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,800
Write it again

761
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,840
T-H-E-Y

762
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,680
Whoa, amazing!

763
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,340
The Cloaking Device there, dear friends

764
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,320
From, uh, from Germany

765
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,360
Americans from Germany, you might say

766
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,560
I'm gonna give their address real quick

767
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,720
For those typing illegally

768
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,820
That's, um, uh, nancydarnell

769
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,060
At brister

770
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,640
B-R-I-E-S

771
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,380
E-S-T-R

772
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,460
That's all one word

773
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:49,900
Seven

774
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,740
D-1000

775
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,140
Berlin 44

776
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,440
Well, now you know

777
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,680
And, uh, friends

778
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,560
You know, do you realize this religion

779
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,260
Has only been around for ten years?

780
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,720
We're just startin' out

781
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,020
We are literally just beginning

782
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,340
The Mormons have been around for a hundred years

783
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,940
And they only run one minor state

784
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,660
And a bunch of Indian reservations

785
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,420
It took Christianity a thousand years

786
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,480
To conquer the West

787
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,600
But look at what a small band of nerdy intellectuals

788
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,640
Was able to pull off in Russia in 1917

789
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,660
So, with radio, television, and thousands of computer geeks

790
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,140
Slavin' away for Dobbs

791
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,340
It shouldn't be long before the Church of the Subgenius

792
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,480
Is so big that even you would be afraid of it

793
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,240
As well you should be

794
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,260
For just as we can grow faster

795
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,460
We must be even more cautious than the Christians

796
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,620
We must not allow the word of Bob

797
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,580
To be perverted quite so drastically

798
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,680
And get away from us so quickly as that of Jesus

799
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,540
That's the scariest thing about this

800
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,260
You'd better be glad most subgeniuses

801
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,020
Are sloppy no-accounts and slackers

802
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,720
Lousy business people

803
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,100
Far more concerned with personal slack

804
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,420
Than with power or money

805
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,760
If we had it together as much as the Christians

806
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,720
Or even, for that matter, the O.T.O.

807
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,140
We'd be bigger than the Nazis by now

808
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,280
And it's so horrifyingly easy

809
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,800
To start a real cult

810
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,140
And manipulate a bunch of insecure zombies

811
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,740
And you know that knowledge

812
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,260
Has always fallen into the wrong hands

813
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,880
Now Dobbs, on the other hand

814
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,920
May have a better chance than Jesus

815
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,880
In not getting his message twisted

816
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,620
Bob is a salesman and not a lowly carpenter

817
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,680
And he has the advantage

818
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,580
He understands advertising

819
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,720
Now Jesus didn't really understand selling a concept

820
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,120
Bob was a salesman

821
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,180
And was able to start his own marketing strategy

822
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,380
Not leaving it up to the followers

823
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,800
Now whether Bob is selling the same message as Jesus

824
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,640
Well, we'll just have to find that out on X-Day

825
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,820
But who else can you trust

826
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,980
When the rupture comes?

827
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,640
I mean, we'd be the first to admit

828
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,300
That our promises, predictions, dire warnings

829
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,440
And stuff sound insane

830
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,280
But what if they come true?

831
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,340
And that what if part

832
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,440
Of what keeps most religious people in line?

833
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,400
But what if hell is real?

834
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,920
That's the only thought that keeps most folks sitting in the pews

835
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,380
They don't really believe they'll go to heaven or any afterlife

836
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,580
If they were sure

837
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,600
They'd jump off a high bridge

838
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,920
As soon as they got depressed over bills or something

839
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,320
But no, they slug their way on through life

840
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,740
Just in case

841
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,080
Some subgeniuses may not believe

842
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,200
That X-Day is actually gonna happen

843
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,120
But they damn sure have that $20 message

844
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,720
And membership card in their pockets

845
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,860
Just in case, don't they?

846
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,040
But we understand, friends

847
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,200
You may not have the strongest faith

848
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,740
That X-Day will happen

849
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,240
But you're none too sure it won't happen either

850
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,340
You're just being smart

851
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,640
Staying prepared for either outcome

852
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,780
And that's why we say

853
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,380
Don't give away all worldly goods before X-Day

854
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,840
It might not happen

855
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
But leave some

856
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,900
Definitely leave some kind of paper

857
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,760
Legal paper stating that in case of rupture

858
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,880
Your property goes to your desired

859
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,640
Unsaved friends and relatives

860
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,080
And not just any old left behind Christian

861
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,220
Who wants to move into your now empty home

862
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,660
And besides

863
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,980
Will you even want to rupture

864
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,320
When Jehovah One throws the cosmic switch?

865
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,880
Oh, many would rather stay, friends

866
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,820
Since who knows what fate lies in store

867
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,060
Once back aboard that wondrous craft

868
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,600
Oh, you must know

869
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,180
You must know your destiny

870
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,740
So don't die without slack, friend

871
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,420
The end times can mean

872
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,020
Not only life eternal

873
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,440
But also a business bonanza

874
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,060
For those who are prepared

875
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,120
Manufacturers of Dobbshead talismans, for instance

876
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,560
Will find their profits quadrupling

877
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,680
In the upcoming wars

878
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,540
As more and more people, even the pinks

879
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,760
Find their only hope and solace

880
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,700
Amidst the destruction in Bob's face

881
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,580
The very emblem of the world's most powerful weapon

882
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,400
Of militant subgenius speciesism

883
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,040
The race of upwards spiral evolution

884
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,800
Are you ready to pass through the gates of opportunity

885
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,460
Perceiving the unsullied truth with no subjective bias?

886
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,180
Are you ready to do whatever Bob says

887
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,640
To swallow his every statement, hook, line, and sinker?

888
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,140
Even if he someday tells you that you

889
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,580
You must push the button that's on the line

890
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,720
And send billions of mostly innocent pinks

891
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,840
To their unbelievably painful doom?

892
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,580
Hey!

893
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,920
Now some may resist the possibility

894
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,000
That man's purpose may be

895
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,860
To do exactly what he is doing

896
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,600
Blindly pursuing his techno-madness

897
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,320
Until he wipes himself out

898
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,120
And causes a great cataclysmic planetary change

899
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,080
One of those cyclical rearrangements

900
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,640
Which the Earth goes through every few million years

901
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,160
Now mankind,

902
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,220
Through Bob,

903
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,840
Might be meant

904
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,400
To set off a nuclear holocaust

905
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,660
So terrible that even the mighty cockroach

906
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,320
Will be extinct

907
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,060
Leaving nothing alive but blind albino cave snakes

908
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,320
And those mysterious worms

909
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,760
That live where no other life can survive

910
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,220
Clustered, writhing senselessly around volcanic heat vents

911
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:28,280
In the deepest, coldest depths of the ocean

912
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,420
Only for the purpose, though

913
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,060
Of giving that lowly heat vent worm

914
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,620
A chance to evolve into the dominant life form

915
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,140
Maybe it's just the fulfillment of natural order

916
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,020
The dinosaurs got their time

917
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,840
The mammals have had their time

918
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,980
Maybe next time it'll be the arthropods

919
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,120
Who's to say?

920
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,400
Only Bob!

921
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,100
Only Bob can say!

922
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,480
But you can rest assured, my friend

923
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,540
That even if it is Bob's plan

924
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,040
He at least will still be around

925
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,320
Probably down there with his pants around his ankles

926
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,980
Happily humping away at a deep sea volcano

927
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,000
In the volcanic heat vent

928
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,720
Oh, will the pyramid of centuries then be in the end

929
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,460
Only a monument to the vanity of Bob?

930
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,520
Do you have any better ideas?

931
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,200
I'm so

932
00:49:47,200 --> 00:50:00,060
I can see on the dawn of this morning

933
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,240
A new ray of hope for mankind

934
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:13,440
And your dead men they are marching

935
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,060
Allegiance to everything

936
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,680
A road split the highway to be young

937
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,920
And your young people are leaving

938
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,920
The candles like campfires

939
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,360
The darkness to walk in the sun

940
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,620
Your young men will follow your teachings

941
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,100
Now they know how much you've done

942
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,460
And they've heard all your tunes

943
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,740
And you've decided preaches

944
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,960
Now we know just what must be won

945
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,240
And your sweet white light

946
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,080
Flows freely and clearly

947
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,780
Come break the cloud while you can

948
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,440
And from a great circle

949
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,960
It shall not be broken

950
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,480
But playing the freedom of man

951
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,200
I trust your boldness

952
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,200


953
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:21,080
And it shall not set you off

954
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:21,640
In the face of the counselors

955
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:21,640


956
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:21,700
Let things set you free

957
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:21,720
A new Muchas

958
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,880
oh yes dear friends

959
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,740
Quicksilver Messenger service

960
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,000
finally an old timey

961
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:27,620
oh

962
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,700
Old-timey subgeniuses, I reckon they are.

963
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,040
But you know.

964
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:41,840
Every sound, like that cough, is just a new note in the ongoing Doctors for Bob album

965
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,300
that we're all recording right now.

966
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,760
We only sell little tiny sections of it.

967
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,080
Most people don't want to sit through the whole thing.

968
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,880
Unfortunately, we have to.

969
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,220
So give us a worst-case scenario.

970
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,780
I mean, what is your ultimate nightmare of the future of the religion?

971
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,240
I mean, we're open for ideas.

972
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,040
Oh, I don't want to hear about those words.

973
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,100
Actually, the worst possible scenarios that most people were giving were wonderful scenarios.

974
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,120
And I'm looking forward to a good scenario.

975
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:24,220
New Year's is going to be a great subgenius time because my good friends will be in town.

976
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,600
My sister Mary Squared, au contraire.

977
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,820
And Pope Sternodocs with his new band, Band of One.

978
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:41,080
And the heavenly Morphodite will be there with the wire.

979
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,560
Bob is coming, friends.

980
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,340
He's going to be using the wire.

981
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,160
So don't try to resist it.

982
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,800
It's the New Year's.

983
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,940
I don't know.

984
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,080
Because they'll be running.

985
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,160
I think they'll be underwriting some spots.

986
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:58,480
We'll go into that later.

987
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:05,580
It's sort of uncool for me to publicize something that I might make money off of.

988
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,360
So all I can say is it's going to be wonderful.

989
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:15,600
And we'll let you know as soon as we possibly can the whys, whens, and wherefores.

990
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,340
But, oh, yeah.

991
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,420
Yes.

992
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,500
And I should mention that it will be a sex party.

993
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,600
How often do you engage in unorthodox sexual practices?

994
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,760
I don't know.

995
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,820
Any Second Statement is not permissible in touchediemany dollar period,

996
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,720
First purposes are übrig.

997
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,020
Rather, that specifically applies to unorthodox sexual practices.

998
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,980
That's a все.

999
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,120
Se envy?

1000
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,500
Are you in the right place of yourself?

1001
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,500
Yeah.

1002
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,780
I guess we could never see the end of sex thanks.

1003
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:24,780


1004
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,620
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1005
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,460
Club No, friends up near Fair Park.

1006
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,240
No, I can't.

1007
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,800
But I can tell you that you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1008
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:49,820
Oh, actually, what you're listening to, this song in the background, which just was forced to end,

1009
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,460
was from Indian Rope Burn, a wonderful subgenius band in Ohio.

1010
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,540
Ohio, Indian Rope Burn doing Sex Party.

1011
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,840
And Swingin' Love Corps is probably doing the same thing, although we can't tell.

1012
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,180
All the music you've been hearing tonight, with the sole exception of the Quicksilver Messenger service,

1013
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:17,340
was done by your fellow ordained subgenius ministers, ordained in the Church of the Subgenius.

1014
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,940
I'm about to give you the free post office box number to write to for information.

1015
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,280
This is completely free information.

1016
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,260
It would help if you threw in a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1017
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,700
Just address that to Got That Pencil Ready?

1018
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,660
Bob.

1019
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:43,240
At post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1020
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:50,320
Once again, that's box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1021
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,800
And before I leave, I'm going to play you a cover version.

1022
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,160
This is a famous old song.

1023
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,200
This is such an improvement over the original.

1024
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,980
I've been wanting to play this for a while.

1025
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,980
It's Rudy Schwartz Project from his Don't Get Charred, Get Puffy album.

1026
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,680
Oh, you're going to love it.

1027
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,240
The horrible thing is you'll be humming it for days.

1028
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,100
Sorry.

1029
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,100
Sorry.

1030
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,300
Racklin' Rosie, get on board.

1031
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1032
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,160
Yeah.

1033
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:25,920
Yeah.

1034
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,860
Let's go.

1035
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:55,320
Let's go.

1036
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1037
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1038
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1039
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1040
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1041
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1042
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1043
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1044
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1045
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1046
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1047
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1048
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1049
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:55,320


1050
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,620
Oh, I love my Rosie child

1051
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,400
She got the way to make me happy

1052
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,400
You and me, we're going in style

1053
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,120
Franklin, Rosie, you're a store-bought woman

1054
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:16,900
And you make me sing like a kid just running

1055
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,920
Sing on your baby girl, the song keeps running

1056
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:35,320
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

1057
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:42,140
Play it now, play it now, play it now, my baby

1058
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,360
Franklin, Rosie, make me smile

1059
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,440
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, well, that's all right

1060
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,980
We got all night

1061
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,580
To set the world right

1062
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,740
Find us a dream but don't ask no questions

1063
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:07,040
Oh, I love my Rosie child

1064
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,880
You got a way to make me happy

1065
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,880
You and me, we're going in style

1066
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,440
Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman

1067
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:23,260
You make me sing like I'll give Josh Drummond

1068
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:28,000
Hang on to me, girl, the song keeps running

1069
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:28,960
Oh
