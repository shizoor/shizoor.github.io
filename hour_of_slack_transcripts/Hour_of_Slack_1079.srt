1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Ladies and gentlemen, please do not panic, but scream! Scream for your lives!

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,720
Mob?

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,700
This is loose in this theater, and if you don't scream, it may kill you.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:21,480
Scream! Please! Keep screaming! Scream for your lives! It's here! It's over here!

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,320
Mob?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,080
Let a man or woman venture from the well-beaten path of civilization.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,740
Let him cross the threshold of the limited intellect, and he encounters amazing, wondrous things.

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,560
The unknown and terrible.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,600
If he escapes these weird adventures with his life, he will usually find he left his reason behind him.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:52,000
Perhaps that is what happened to these two souls, lost in the great Mexican desert.

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,640
But then, ask yourself.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Why would anyone?

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,060
Trod from the usually well-traveled roads of this modern age.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,380
From the luxury of an air-conditioned automobile.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,740
A prairie squid.

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,580
That's prairie squid dropping.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,260
Oh, look.

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,800
The desert.

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:21,160
They have a poisonous sheath that irritates the skin.

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,180
Well.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,780
Randy.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,300
I sure told him, didn't he?

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,820
Can you imagine the delight on their faces when he pulled his panties down and there was the Ogle Stick that Grandpa had promised.

24
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,680
I talk about an oblique gesture.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,600
Some say he was stumped that way since the day he was born.

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,660
Others say he'd been headed that way all his long, miserable life.

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,360
But as they sat him down into his virtual moment chair for his last virtual moment in this here virtual life,

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,600
all I could think of as the monitors dimmed was,

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,000
Mom's frozen apple pie.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,540
300 pounds of it.

31
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,180
Sitting on his lap.

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
His hair's getting hairier.

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,880
The subgenius hour of slack.

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,220
The class of our house is impossible.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,600
We enter, and the door is sealed behind us.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,860
Captain to passengers.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
Fasten safety belts, please.

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,980
We're preparing to blast.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,500
Five.

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,900
Four.

41
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,560
Three.

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,880
Two.

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,540
One.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,540
Rocket away.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,980
Rocket away.

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,500
Rocket away.

47
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,020
By rocket to the moon.

48
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,240
In just eight minutes, the earth behind us looks like a giant balloon.

49
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,260
Captain, captain, stop the rocket.

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,120
I left my wallet in another suit.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,780
It isn't in my pocket.

52
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,420
You won't need your wallet here.

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,760
A thousand miles from the atmosphere.

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,660
Woo.

55
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,040
It's not a nightmare that's gonna end.

56
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,900
It's just beginning because it's inside me.

57
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,700
I put a gun in my mouth and blew away my vast knowledge.

58
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,540
Some critter's been getting in here,

59
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,040
chowing up the hogs.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,880
Killed one of the mules, too.

61
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,440
Tore her head all up.

62
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,820
And her brain.

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,640
Ladies and gentlemen, Rush Limbaugh.

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,480
Woo.

65
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,840
They say that I'm sleaze and elitist.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,260
You please everybody disagrees with my rap.

67
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,080
It is rap.

68
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm horrendous.

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm appalling.

70
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,900
My ratings now are falling.

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,580
Because I'm so full of bull.

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,540
So full of crap.

73
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,340
Full of crap.

74
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,180
With condescending crimes.

75
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,160
Making money.

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,060
Selling lies.

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,820
You might say everybody hates my guts.

78
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,660
Hates his guts.

79
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm offensive.

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,660
I'm a bigot.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm a fraud.

82
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,440
Can you dick it?

83
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,940
I'm a sexist, racist, homophobic, fat, pathetic, touch.

84
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,040
I'm a Nazi.

85
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,880
He's a Nazi.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,700
That's right.

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,380
I really am.

88
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,620
Because I'm a Nazi.

89
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,520
He's a Nazi.

90
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,420
That's right.

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,340
You're being scammed.

92
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm a Nazi.

93
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,160
He's a Nazi.

94
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,820
I don't care about the middle class.

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,640
Because I'm a fat conservative butt head with the face of a horse's ass.

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,140
He's a fat conservative butt head with the face of a horse's ass.

97
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,060
I have a subhuman figure.

98
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
A huge rear end.

99
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,000
My brain?

100
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,560
That's another story.

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
It's quite another story.

102
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,720
I have a face the size of a wash tub.

103
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,820
And my ass is as big as Missouri.

104
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,760
Yes!

105
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
This bastard is sick.

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,860
He's a fat mom.

107
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,980
It's big and his ass is as big as Missouri.

108
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,820
Yes, sirree Bob.

109
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Manipulating statements exaggerate the truth.

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,420
I can't believe the hate my show inspires.

111
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,640
The hate my show inspires.

112
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,220
It's not just because I'm stupid.

113
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,160
It's not just because I'm scum.

114
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,840
It's just because Republicans are liars.

115
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,040
Those dirty filthy liars.

116
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,740
I am heartless.

117
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,580
I am vain.

118
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,660
Insensitive.

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,440
Insane.

120
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,980
They say that I'm a national disgrace.

121
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,060
Disgrace.

122
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,000
I am nasty.

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,340
Yes.

124
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,080
Insulting.

125
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,280
No.

126
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,740
Basically revolting.

127
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,040
Uh-huh.

128
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,460
I'm a concentrated pile of human waste.

129
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,200
He's human waste.

130
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,220
Because I'm a Nazi.

131
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
He's a Nazi.

132
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,520
Shit.

133
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,860
How?

134
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,700
I really am.

135
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,880
Because I'm a Nazi.

136
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,780
He's a Nazi.

137
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,620
That's right.

138
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,600
You're being scammed.

139
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm a Nazi.

140
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,400
He's a Nazi.

141
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,240
I don't care about the middle classes.

142
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm a sick Republican sleazeball with the face of a horse's ass.

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,540
He's a sick Republican sleazeball with the face of a horse's ass.

144
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,700
They say that you're a Nazi.

145
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,700


146
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,700


147
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,700


148
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,300
But this is not about my vanity.

149
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,200
They doubt my sanity.

150
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,880
They think I'm nuts.

151
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,680
So nuts.

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,500
I am a cyst on the ass of humanity.

153
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,660
Ew.

154
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,100
New Republican slogan, read my tux.

155
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
Read his tux.

156
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:49,100
From the bowels of eight ball tape comes the voice of Rush Limbaugh.

157
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:55,680
In closing, let me say that each and every day, I'm an evil rotten ego slave.

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


159
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


160
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


162
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


165
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


166
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


168
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


170
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


172
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


173
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,680


174
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,360
I'm the coppo.

175
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,200
The coppo.

176
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,980
Joe McCarthy like Gestapo.

177
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,780
The right wing foam of the mouth jack booted slob.

178
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,540
The Democratic Trash-er.

179
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,180
Years of liberal bashing with the equivalent compassion of a grommet.

180
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,460
With the IQ of a fig, I'm a fat obnoxious pig.

181
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,300
And the truth of the matter is, I'm vomit.

182
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,200
He's vomit.

183
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,140
Because I'm a Nazi.

184
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,040
He's a Nazi.

185
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,440
Shit.

186
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,840
How?

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,660
I really am.

188
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Because I'm a Nazi.

189
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,640
He's a Nazi.

190
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,060
Shit.

191
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,480
How?

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,660
I really am.

193
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


194
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


195
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


196
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


197
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


198
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


199
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


200
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


201
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


202
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,660


203
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,080
He's vomit.

204
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,240
He's vomit.

205
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,240


206
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,340


207
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,020
I don't care about the middle class.

208
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Those are fear mongerings come back.

209
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,840
With the face of a horse's ass.

210
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,660
He's a fat conservative butt head.

211
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,560
Hey, Super Republican sweet ball.

212
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,380
Fear mongerings come back.

213
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:39,720
Oh.

214
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,200
Egotistical ass bite.

215
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,540
Yes.

216
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,700
Mean spirited, hum-wallering fat conservative tux.

217
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,680
With the face.

218
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,460
With the face.

219
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,160
Of a horse's ass.

220
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
Make a dildo, Rush.

221
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm a dildo.

222
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


223
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


224
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


225
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


226
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


227
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


228
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,640


229
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,360
Mangus.

230
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,700
Hey buddy.

231
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,760
Very nice to meet you.

232
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,280
Nicest gal you've had in your life.

233
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,420
Nice to meet you.

234
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,780
Time surely came.

235
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,260
We are out of here.

236
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,860
Bend over.

237
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,420
Bend over, human, and let us help.

238
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,200
And get ready for cultural warfare.

239
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,300
We're coming to your town.

240
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,860
Jesus is coming to your town.

241
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,740
We're the colonial firm.

242
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,320
Get there on your knees and cry.

243
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,380
We're just here to help.

244
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,220
Praise God.

245
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,500
Praise God.

246
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,380
And to help you better, we must destroy.

247
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,960
To save the town, we have to destroy it.

248
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,180
To save democracy, we have to destroy it.

249
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,420
To save the world, we must destroy it.

250
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,860
Part two, destroy.

251
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,940
And when you're saving the world, why don't you save me a little piece?

252
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,300
You know, I mean, you can, like, blow up the rest and let me have some fun.

253
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,840
To carve up a world.

254
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,400
To carve a world.

255
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,720
Amen.

256
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,620
Amen.

257
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,380
To carve a world as neatly as one might carve a stick of boulder.

258
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,160
To carve up a world between the corporations.

259
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,160
Which means between my friends.

260
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
And my friends' friends.

261
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,980
And here they are at the Monaco Parlor Ballroom.

262
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,120
This is a very exclusive place.

263
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,720
Inhabited and frequented by only the one percent of the one percent.

264
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,460
There's Mrs.

265
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,040
Mrs. Rocking動画.

266
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,440
There's Mr.

267
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,640
Shay.

268
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Oh look, his skin cane is much better now.

269
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,580
Look, there's Mr.

270
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,080
Morgan.

271
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,680
He's still got that terrible club foot though, but he'll be fine.

272
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,880
He's got more money than I need.

273
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,900
Oh, there's the Anheuser-Busch.

274
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,000
I think we have one of the dissidents underneath the bushes.

275
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,780
There he is.

276
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,620
He's by the curtain.

277
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,860
He's hiding in the Anheuser-Busch.

278
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,140
Sir.

279
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,260
Get him!

280
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,620
Oh, what a fact.

281
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
What a fact.

282
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:24,880


283
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, damn.

284
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,520
Thanks, Chaz.

285
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:31,940
Way to go.

286
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Friends, that Rush Limbaugh song, I don't know who Rush got to help him with that, although

287
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,280
I got it off of alt.binary slack via time control, friends.

288
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,780
Time control.

289
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,000
And that's what this hour number 774 of Slack is about.

290
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
Time congenial.

291
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,120
A whole sty full of Connie types.

292
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,380
Full of time control.

293
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,400
And show collisions will, of course, include KPFA, puzzling evidence, and G. Gordon Gordon

294
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,340
Gary broke friend.

295
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,840
It's a lot like talking to any tape.

296
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,700
I know it's difficult because you haven't ever called up a radio station before and

297
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,060
talked to just a dumb old tape.

298
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,900
And here it is, an eight-track tape answering you.

299
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,420
But you can't believe you're talking to an intelligent machine, I know.

300
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,820
This is your future.

301
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
Your phones will act like us very soon.

302
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,760
Bob will be five years.

303
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:25,440
Yes.

304
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,300
Seven, six, two, four, three, eight.

305
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,040
Okay, Bob.

306
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,580
Is that your Bob?

307
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,260
That's right.

308
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:30,720
Yeah.

309
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,000
That Bob is my guy.

310
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,560
Bob is her guy.

311
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,280
I hear the sigh.

312
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,580
Our love will never die.

313
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,340
Bob is my guy.

314
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,160
Bob.

315
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,960
Bob.

316
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,560
Bob.

317
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,360
Bob.

318
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:56,480
Bob.

319
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,060
Bob is my guy.

320
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,280
Bob.

321
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,480
Bob.

322
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,840
Yes, yes, yes.

323
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,460
Bob is my guy.

324
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,960
Yes, yes, yes.

325
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:09,960


326
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,260
Bob.

327
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,500
Bob.

328
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,000
Bob.

329
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,900
Bob.

330
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,320
Bob.

331
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,680
Bob.

332
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,660
Bob.

333
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,120
Bob.

334
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,400
See, everything's digital here.

335
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,400
We're not live.

336
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,220
That's why we can't take any calls.

337
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,520
This show has been entirely on...

338
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,240
Basically, you have to use the digits of your right or left hand to operate anything on this show.

339
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,860
That includes move the turntable around with your fingertips.

340
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,320
But we don't use turntables.

341
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,360
We only use broken tape decks here on the Hour of Slack.

342
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,600
And friends, praise Bob, a tape deck can be smashed to pieces.

343
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,760
But if it's needed for the Hour of Slack, it will...

344
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,480
And Bob, it's the Haberfront Zip-You-Lops, Doctor.

345
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Oh, yes.

346
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,020
Has this ever happened to you?

347
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,540
Why, it should have been there, Ted.

348
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,380
It was great.

349
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,540
There was free booze, great music.

350
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,500
One of the best parties I ever went to.

351
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,000
Where were you that night?

352
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,160
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

353
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,000
I guess I should have gone, huh?

354
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,560
Didn't you feel stupid?

355
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,360
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

356
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,640
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

357
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,520
Introducing Bob's School of Time.

358
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,720
And Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time.

359
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,600
Slow turn.

360
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,080
Make time run backwards.

361
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,100
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

362
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,320
How, you may ask?

363
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,560
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

364
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

365
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,780
Blango.

366
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,980
My dog was dead.

367
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,800
Was I sad till I met Bob.

368
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,480
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car,

369
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,920
do a slip job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it,

370
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
that truck went off into a ditch.

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,260
It burst into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

372
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,000
Ain't that right, fella?

373
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,460
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow

374
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,400
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

375
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,440
Courses start yesterday, but you can catch up.

376
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,680
Just right.

377
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,960
Bob's School of Time Control.

378
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,620
The universe.

379
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,640
Bob's School of Time Control.

380
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,980
Division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

381
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,520
He stopped to watch for a few seconds.

382
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,340
Oh, hell.

383
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,960
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

384
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,160
It's immortality.

385
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,220
It was a price more costly than death.

386
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,940
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving,

387
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,440
but something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

388
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

389
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,720
you can feel the wear.

390
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:05,760
I know from 342 years of experience that time control can only go awry.

391
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,620
So please, for his own sake, tell the bastard to knock it off.

392
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,540
What if you could turn back the clock even on Earth and start over again?

393
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,400
You know, would the same things happen?

394
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,140
What?

395
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,200
You could go back in time and kill Hitler,

396
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,820
even though he might be the very one who killed the man who would destroy the entire world.

397
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,880
No, the first lizard.

398
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,160
No, say you could go back in time.

399
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,060
Okay, I would go back in time.

400
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,860
Say you could go back in time to when the first lizard evolved.

401
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,380
Kissed Hitler.

402
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,460
Kissed Hitler.

403
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,760
Because we're really evolved from the lizards, right?

404
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,020
Okay, we're still lizards.

405
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,400
So you killed the first lizard, and it's some other form of life that comes out.

406
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,080
Not a lizard.

407
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,760
Not specifically lizard.

408
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,460
Maybe a power.

409
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,420
Perhaps an insect.

410
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,140
An insect-based intelligent life.

411
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,340
Polyps come out sometimes.

412
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,060
A hot queen.

413
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,900
A Friday Jones.

414
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:04,280
Okay, say our polyps were evolving at a rate that was so rapidly fast that we could not control it.

415
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,280
Would you go back in a Hitler suit, like one of those first characters, a one-shot creature,

416
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,220
start your own jail, and kill the polyps?

417
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:19,740
Would you step on that butterfly to make everything be spelled wrong 10, 60 million years later?

418
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:20,900
And you, as Americans.

419
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,360
Would you do it?

420
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,180
Brace yourself.

421
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,800
If you do it.

422
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:24,960
Would you take that risk?

423
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,220
With these mighty hernia braces designed by my cousin Lou and I.

424
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,940
Would you play frisbee with dogs?

425
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,120
Stand firmly and fastly in front of the rest of your renegade crew and laugh like dogs until the cows return.

426
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,480
Everybody has to eat shaving cream once in a while.

427
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,620
That stuff comes right out of the center of the earth.

428
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,040
And straight into our supermarkets.

429
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,900
The yellow sons of bitches.

430
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,160
Yes.

431
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,120
They took their own lives.

432
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,880
Call me bastards.

433
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,740
You cheated me.

434
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:05,720
When I was out among you, I always believed, as you did, that time exists in a sequential pattern.

435
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,480
One day following another.

436
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,680
One year after another.

437
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,120
Each century following the previous one.

438
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,120
But it's not like that at all.

439
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,040
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

440
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,420
It's a time space warp.

441
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,640
I felt a communication.

442
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,440
A series of images.

443
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,380
After which I knew what was happening to us.

444
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,760
And I knew our fear was unnecessary.

445
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,580
Try putting an electrode soaked in saline solution on your head and another one strapped to your leg and then slamming two thousand volts between them.

446
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,180
If it hurts, let me know.

447
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,040
I have never seen anyone so terrified or so unable to release her fear tensions.

448
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,160
He is growing up.

449
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,020
My karma.

450
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,840
He must still be in shock.

451
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,200
All he does is sit around all day babbling about some seven foot monster.

452
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,840
Even fish do it.

453
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,520
But what do they do?

454
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,820
Imagine this modern world.

455
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,680
In the year 2006, fish not only do it, they do it in style at the downtown arena.

456
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,340
For moms and dads and kids alike.

457
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,000
In the water they can breathe.

458
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,140
In the water they can breathe.

459
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,140


460
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,360
In the water they can breathe.

461
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,360


462
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,560
And what else does the share drink?

463
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,000
You're drinking some juice.

464
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,520
So sit back, plop an ice cube, and put those feet on the share's laundry.

465
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,380
It's time for the Sponspatrol.

466
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,040
The fish are doing it, huh?

467
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,600
I don't like to watch this history.

468
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,300
The fish doing it reminds me of B.O.B. because when we counted them, they were a classic day.

469
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,020
Oh I remember Bob and Connie on Valentine's Day.

470
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,800
day. The little bat-winged hearts, you could almost see them, well, psychics could see

471
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,840
them flying between Bob and Connie as they walked on the sidewalk hand in hand, pants

472
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,440
and panties. The boat's going up and down the seine. You can hear the singing of the

473
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,560
boat guys. Bob with his funny little beret cocked on the side of his cock. Look, he's

474
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,560
wearing a funny little shirt with a nipple cut out so he can drink the wine and let it

475
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:28,640
fall where it may. No, you're shopping for butt plugs, a long-mean sacre de mer. Ah,

476
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,360
le sacre de mer. Let's go over to Montparnasse and see if we can find those green butt plugs

477
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,520
with the sequins. They're so hard to find. Yes, and we shall commit some paintings and

478
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,960
some artwork. Ah, we will commit. And we will go to see Jerry Lewis movies. Ah, Jerry Lewis

479
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,200
movies. And we'll listen to Lonesome Cowboy Dave. He also is a genius. Oh, yes, I love

480
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave. Oh. Two American boys.

481
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:57,460
Stupidity. Oh, Olivia and the Americans could be so brilliantly stupid. I listen to the

482
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,900
show all the time and believe me, from my limited English, I can tell you these people

483
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,640
have no idea what they're talking about, which makes them so funny. Oh, la, la, more truffles.

484
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,980
But, hey, let's stop down by the river and have our feet cursed and sing a morality song

485
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:19,400
from the Middle Ages, eh? Oh, la, la. I remember those days well. I remember when the Saracens

486
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,080
attacked the city.

487
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,740
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

488
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:37,780
I'm sorry. I was wool gathering.

489
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,820
The cultural moment is almost expired. I wonder if you want more time.

490
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,460
Yes, please. One thing, waiter. What country is this?

491
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,360
Well, yeah.

492
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,060
The current time with the checkpoint and also...

493
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,960
That's the other thing. What time do you have? And what day, by the way?

494
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:04,960
Well, I'm afraid I have to make a terrible mess here and stop for a brief moment.

495
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,500
I don't recognize those cars. What year car is that new one over there, waiter?

496
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,920
Is...

497
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,660
It's a brand new 1934 Eschaton.

498
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,360
Oh.

499
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,100
They sure must go on even...

500
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,060
Brand new, eh?

501
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:32,580
Oh, man. Time control. It was just like the old man said. Time control must always go awry.

502
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:40,940
I was a fool. I was a fool to follow Bob and his insane plans. He was like a madman.

503
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,860
He was throwing these glass beakers and his Tesla coils back across the laboratory in a rage,

504
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,440
trying to bring life to the...

505
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:50,880
Battery!

506
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,540
Then finally, he got it plugged in.

507
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,360
Then...

508
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,940
Oh, my God, man. I...

509
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,520
I thought he...

510
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,940
I thought that surely he was just a crackpot, a kook, a madman.

511
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,500
A madman.

512
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,960
But yet...

513
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,880
Here I find myself in 1934, some little town in France, I guess it is.

514
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,580
God.

515
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,940
I wish you well, monsieur. I...

516
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,540
I spilled the wine, eh?

517
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,340
Oh, I don't know.

518
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,960
I spilled it all over my lady's lap and all over your forehead. I...

519
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,360
What is that in your forehead?

520
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:24,920
I can't...

521
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,840
Oh, what...

522
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:25,980
What?

523
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,160
Oh, my God.

524
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,520
It's a little clock.

525
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,400
Ah, did you miss?

526
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,900
This is wonderful.

527
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,500
I...

528
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:32,920
I...

529
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,380
I'm...

530
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,480
Let me look at this mirror over here.

531
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,840
Wait a minute.

532
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,620
The clock is...

533
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,040
It looks...

534
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,500
A quarter?

535
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,420
Why does it know?

536
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,800
It looks right in the mirror, which means it must be installed in my head...

537
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,660
Backwards...

538
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,340
So that it will look right in a mirror.

539
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,440
What if they...

540
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,040
What did Bob do to me?

541
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,220
Ah, Bob did nothing to you, my friend.

542
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,360
He put this stupid clock into my forehead!

543
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,880
Just relax, monsieur.

544
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Everyone has this stupid clock in their forehead.

545
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,640
What kind of insurance?

546
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,660
What kind of insurance?

547
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,440
It's supposed to be a show!

548
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,840
It's not a show, monsieur.

549
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,940
It's supposed to be a show!

550
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,540
Miss, I am afraid you have used up your entire virtual moment.

551
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,360
Please get out of...

552
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,880
Yeah, yes, yes, monsieur.

553
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,680
Next!

554
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,960
And I push the button and...

555
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,760
Next, monsieur.

556
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,620
I'm sorry.

557
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,360
Your virtual moment is over.

558
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,900
...

559
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,340
Fact or fiction, Star Wars, Fantasy or Reality, Millions wonder.

560
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,360
Presently, millions of ETs are under the control of a being who is cunning, fearsome, perverted, and enemy number one.

561
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,680
1974...

562
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,420
...is the year that they are now planning to...

563
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:50,860
...for...

564
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,060
...everyth...

565
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,240
...raspbirth on the streets...

566
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,120
...very....

567
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,100
...major city...

568
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,260
...from coast to coast.

569
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,500
You know, I think that we'd be shocked if we walked through some of our schools today.

570
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,340
And get ready for a shock.

571
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,220
The music that they're planning to use to crumble the morals of America

572
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,160
is a rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd, lascivious junk.

573
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,560
Oh, rock and roll.

574
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,180
Indus destructive forces take delight in causing tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and blizzards.

575
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,120
All three called in, some gaudy major city from coast to coast.

576
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,100
Send lights away and get inside the train.

577
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,660
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

578
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,900
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

579
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,740
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

580
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,380
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

581
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,200
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

582
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,500


583
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,520
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

584
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,020
A satanic jamboree by Jupiter Research, friends.

585
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,040
Before that new Monet Clippy Snips of bad film,

586
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,620
ESO Swamp Radio with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Jan Smith,

587
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,080
and yours truly, Falling For Toby,

588
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,320
clips from the film by Idnax Stang.

589
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,880
Bleepo did Bob's School of Time Control,

590
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,320
and it's miraculous, friends.

591
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,100
As was the Tucson subgenius revival called The Oasis of Slack.

592
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,580
Sponsored by Tucson's own Reverend Crawford Smith,

593
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,720
as featured now in this special report.

594
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,940
I'm going to post eternal salvation for 30 bucks, subgenius.com.

595
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,560
Stop that.

596
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,100
I don't see other people in that chat room might be going,

597
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,100
oh no, it's one of those subgenius creeps.

598
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
They're stupid Bob people.

599
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,180
Oh God.

600
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,420
Oh God.

601
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,380
Speaking of stupid Bob people, man,

602
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,940
I just got back from a revival in Tucson

603
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,540
where a very mysterious thing happened.

604
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,600
It's difficult for our modern world of statistics and electronics

605
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,120
to accept miracles,

606
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,160
but you could almost call this a miracle,

607
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,300
a genuine miracle.

608
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,120
Out of hundreds and thousands of square miles of heat

609
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,660
and seared wasteland,

610
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,060
where the vultures wait,

611
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,940
for the other vultures to die.

612
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,640
The desert of death.

613
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,020
And it hurts.

614
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,720
It really, really hurts.

615
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,320
It's a horrible agony that begins and increases.

616
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,320
That's how you can tell it's a scorpion.

617
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,320
Because other venoms are disseminating.

618
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,080
Now, aren't there the tiny little Arizona scorpions

619
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,020
that scamper up your urethra?

620
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,500
Oh, I hope not.

621
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,120
Tail first.

622
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,580
Oh, that's...

623
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,880
As if daring you to, you know,

624
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,300
try to squeeze them out.

625
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,940
This is the oasis of slack.

626
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,800
I got off the plane and here we are.

627
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,660
This is the oasis of slack, but...

628
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,440
I don't see the oasis.

629
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,460
And I don't see the...

630
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,360
I don't feel the slack.

631
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
Maybe the of.

632
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,040
I guess this is the of.

633
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,860
The oasis.

634
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,200
Know, that's there.

635
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,480
You have to look down on it before you can wear out the stallion.

636
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:31,480


637
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:31,480


638
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:31,660
I'm innocent.

639
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:31,660


640
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:31,660


641
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:31,660


642
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,540
Talk to you later.

643
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,060
day.

644
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,720
Yesterday.

645
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,180
Or bro.

646
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,320
Make a cave text about something like a river river.

647
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,320


648
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,320


649
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,100
Oh, a name.

650
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,100


651
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,560
I'm caring for this.

652
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:52,560


653
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,500
supermache, and a blowtorch.

654
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,660
That's the way I like it.

655
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,100
A giant Dobbs head.

656
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,960
Now, they were going to, they really just had to get rid of the damn thing.

657
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,920
They built it, you know, a year ago, and it had been rotting.

658
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,860
Well, the whole barbecue, the whole barbecue average.

659
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,840
What do you do with a giant 80-foot tall Dobbs?

660
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,240
Okay, you take the face, and you take it to Tucson.

661
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,200
And the idea was they were going to trick the Tucson host, Reverend Crawford Smith.

662
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,120
That's our cousin.

663
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,300
So easily tricked he is.

664
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:25,220
Yeah, by leaving the Dobbs head on his doorstep.

665
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,140
This is like a 12-foot tall monster face.

666
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Some Dobbs-like creature had actually pertained itself into his progressive immigration.

667
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,900
And they did.

668
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,800
And they did.

669
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,020
While Crawford and us were at the party.

670
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,640
But when we came back to Crawford's place, the giant Dobbs head, which they claimed they left there, was gone.

671
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,680
Gone somewhere in Tucson.

672
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,280
Tucson or Mayhaps in outer space.

673
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,160
Somebody stole the giant Dobbs.

674
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,520
Someone has a Dobbs head so big that it takes a pickup truck and four people to carry it.

675
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,480
Doesn't that sound like the kind of thing you'd like to happen to do every day of your life?

676
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,040
And where is it?

677
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,740
You wake up early in the morning, and there's an 80-pound, 60-foot-high Dobbs head in your front yard.

678
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:18,600
And as you step out across the mail, the newspapers, and the dead laundry, you notice that Dobbs head's not old.

679
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,180
He's smiling.

680
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,160
He's talking to you.

681
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,240
And he's not only talking, he's talking trash.

682
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,880
Because it's the giant Bob.

683
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,560
But it's the size of that thing.

684
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,140
Huge Bob.

685
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
That's the size of boulders.

686
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,140
No, I've never seen grain like that.

687
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,780
No wonder they make the stinkers.

688
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,160
Look, here are the jewels.

689
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,840
We've got to get up to his forehead and pull one of those out of his eyes and get it back to Dobbs.

690
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,280
But watch out for the brow.

691
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,820
Don't get caught in the brow.

692
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,620
Every tangled mess.

693
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,440
Oh, no.

694
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Wires and cables.

695
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,400
Yes.

696
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,020
Steve gets out on the driving side.

697
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,760
Some kind of cybernetic.

698
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,040
But here are enough cords.

699
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,080
We'll just push all this tape aside here.

700
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,340
Instantly, the gunman fires.

701
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,420
Oh, look out.

702
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,780
Look out.

703
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,860
You're shooting at me.

704
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,060
Oh, no.

705
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,460
Look out.

706
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,040
Glass madness.

707
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,700
They got me.

708
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,880
They're back in the vehicle.

709
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,940
Let's get out of here real fast.

710
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,400
We're going to tire some wide, long, glass files.

711
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,340
Wait a minute.

712
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,660
I'm going back for the glass files.

713
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,240
We're going too fast now.

714
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,560
The tape's all wrapped around my legs.

715
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,020
We left all the drugs over there.

716
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay.

717
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
You don't have to try to carry me down.

718
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,440
I've got to tear these hollow pills down here and alter the presence of my body.

719
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,160
And the giant pills have been brought down from the ground.

720
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
Just remember to send me the stories.

721
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,960
It's getting real confusing.

722
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,160
In fact, we can just hold out until next week.

723
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,040
Okay.

724
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,360
I feel better now.

725
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,000
Maybe if I take some more of that Wu-Tang, then I'll be able to walk out.

726
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,220
Rub a little Gabro-Cran into the sore part there, and you'll be okay.

727
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,840
The legions are growing.

728
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,140
My name is Legion.

729
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,660
And yours is...

730
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,780
Hey.

731
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,500
Yours is...

732
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,800
Is Mr. Legion here?

733
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,760
Sir, you're...

734
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,340
Pagin, Mr. Legion.

735
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:47,920
Just a second.

736
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,880
Did you say your name was Legion, sir?

737
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,820
No, I said my name was...

738
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,460
Repetition is the key to the bandaged head.

739
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,840
Repetition is the key to art.

740
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,200
Repetition is the key to redundancy.

741
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,000
It is the key to learning and to Dobstow.

742
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,700
And as the great gates open up...

743
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:17,800
First...

744
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,580
And the high priestess ushers...

745
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,420
They took down there.

746
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,840
Millie and I, that woman greeted us at the dock.

747
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,400
She was wearing a lei and a sauna dress.

748
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,440
And she said she was related to the great light singer, Ima Sumac, if you could imagine such a thing.

749
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,900
But there she was in a zip-up top, and her head was all zipped up.

750
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,900
Believe me, there wasn't a pot showing.

751
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,640
And there was no sunshine coming through the back door either.

752
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,900
The way old Mammy and Pappy down on the farm...

753
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,760
Used to sprinkle.

754
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,800
She was queen to the mug, 100%.

755
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,760
But they said they were going to still have to do a few things.

756
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,260
So she led us around.

757
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,760
We had a few eggnogs.

758
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,780
We stood and watched the trees burn.

759
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,720
And then we entered the actual inner center center centaurum of Domstown itself.

760
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,820
It was beautiful.

761
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Look at those gigantic sculpted statues carved.

762
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,380
From the native volcanic rock.

763
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,260
They look like famous subgenius radio personalities.

764
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,100
What's that bald-headed one?

765
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,920
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

766
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,460
And look, the one with the giant lips.

767
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,460
That's Dances with Rockets.

768
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,900
And that really handsome one.

769
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,680
Isn't that supposed to be Reverend Stag?

770
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,340
The mountain itself, my God, I just realized.

771
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,360
It's carved into a gigantic dog's head.

772
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,740
Stang, Stang, you must come over here.

773
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,800
The size of ten, Mount Rushmore.

774
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,440
Try this chocolate phosphate drinking foam.

775
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,160
It's free.

776
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,580
Oh, my God.

777
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,340
It's delicious and it's psychoactive, too.

778
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,620
I can feel my...

779
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,320
I can feel everything.

780
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,600
I can feel my knees.

781
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,840
I can feel my sandwiches.

782
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,800
I can feel three sandwiches in my back pocket.

783
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,200
They're speaking to me, Stang.

784
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,580
Learn from the sandwiches.

785
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,300
Feel of your sandwich, Dave.

786
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,140
Feel of it.

787
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,500
Have you ever been kissed by a girl like this?

788
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:46,880
Have you ever been trialled by a girl like this?

789
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,120
No

790
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,120


791
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,120


792
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,120


793
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,120


794
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,120


795
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,900
It turned out you're the only one in their life

796
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:47,900


797
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:47,900


798
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:47,900


799
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:47,900


800
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:47,900


801
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:47,900


802
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,360
numbers him by countless billions.

803
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,760
In the continuing war for survival

804
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,860
between man and the hexapods,

805
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,400
only a nutter fool would bet against the insect.

806
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,100
You have such reptile eyes,

807
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,640
eyes like a lizard that weave their spell.

808
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,800
Stand up to the lizard,

809
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,940
see him running across the floor,

810
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,980
see him skittering out the door.

811
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,100
I couldn't sleep.

812
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,100
Every little sheep that jumped over the fence

813
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,760
landed under a horny ram.

814
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,560
The only time I want to feel somebody tossing and turning in bed

815
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,580
is when I'm helping them.

816
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,160
What is Lilith?

817
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,020
Hey, Popus, Popus, go ahead.

818
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,700
Well, I think we all agree that Popus Lilith

819
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,440
is a beautiful woman, a beautiful man,

820
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,180
a beautiful spiritual entity,

821
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,320
which few of us would dare to disagree with,

822
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,140
I think, in the dark.

823
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,480
And sometimes,

824
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,380
that entity would light up its pipe.

825
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,980
Yeah.

826
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,500
Popus Lilith, are you going to be at the Tucson Divival

827
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,620
on February 10th in Arizona?

828
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,160
I'm going to be here in Seattle

829
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,980
celebrating my 31st birthday

830
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,100
and working on the first ever subgenius C-Vival.

831
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,880
Oh, C-Vival.

832
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,620
Oh, God.

833
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,020
Connie DeVisal has come to be.

834
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,100
So the bitch, will it never end?

835
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,680
Are you a transsexual or a transvestite subgenius?

836
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,120
Relate into the good.

837
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,940
There's an important event coming up for you with you in mind.

838
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,680
I've given my best to boss for the past 15 years.

839
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
I'm willing to give Connie a chance.

840
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,040
And if you would too, I bet you would clean up for a change.

841
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,680
I've been into Connie before.

842
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,460
It wasn't all it's cracked up to be.

843
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,560
Connie's real nice, if you know what I mean.

844
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Oh, yeah.

845
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,840
You gotta get real friendly with Connie.

846
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah, but who hasn't?

847
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,100
She's the whole of Babylon who hasn't.

848
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,740
I find out you're lying, you know this.

849
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,180
There is gonna be hell to pay.

850
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,740
Seriously.

851
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,600
We interrupt our program to bring you this important message.

852
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm actually a deep-voiced woman.

853
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:27,680
Now, watch out.

854
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,280
They are useful for their purpose, but they are no substitute for brains.

855
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,740
You make a very, very good point about the Benjamin standards.

856
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,820
You truly are transsexual.

857
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,560
I'm trying to turn him into...

858
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,240
Wonder Woman!

859
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,440
Wonder Woman!

860
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,440


861
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,440


862
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,440


863
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,420
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.

864
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,760
Perfect for ordinary people.

865
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,260
Hey, Von Colling.

866
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:55,980
If you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a bland-out cinder.

867
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,040
Now, I will kill you.

868
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,280
Max, he's wearing a dress.

869
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,100
I think he's trying to mate.

870
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,040
Oh, dear.

871
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,060
I don't do humans.

872
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,880
No kidding.

873
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,760
It is no concern of ours how you run your own planet.

874
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,520
I think you're just a big bully picking on people smaller than you are.

875
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,440
There's no law against...

876
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,340
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street.

877
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,960
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.

878
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,320
I'm going to go to a doctor and say, hey, I want to be a woman the next day.

879
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,400
We're talking about spraying the wealth of real time.

880
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:35,820
Was that one of those original Martians trying to tune in from afar?

881
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,600
Some people don't think God is a space monster.

882
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,420
I don't know.

883
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,360
Mars needs Connie.

884
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,920
Earth needs...

885
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:44,880
Women.

886
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,180
Women.

887
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,200
I am female.

888
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,960
Earth needs a hell of a lot more women.

889
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,160
I think if Earth would tip the scale the right way for us guys, I think our problems would finally be all over.

890
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,840
What?

891
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,600
I think if there was...

892
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,120
All over the place.

893
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:03,460
Instead of 1.6 women for every man, what if there was like 1.9 women for every man?

894
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,020
That's not a baby.

895
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,620
Come on.

896
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,140
Well, that really makes things easier on me.

897
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,440
There'd be more women for me.

898
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:09,700
Come on, baby.

899
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,200
You would be more woman-like.

900
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,720
Or you would be more womanly from the contrast of so much womanhood around you, too.

901
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,720
You could take it, you know, five or seven ways.

902
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,140
I take it any way I can.

903
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,400
Well, I'm sure you do.

904
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,040
Does the word low life...

905
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,000
Watch five or six or seven men and women doing it.

906
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,840
I'd rather be five or six or seven men and women doing it.

907
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,360
Yeah.

908
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,020
That's fine.

909
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,280
But what would a cacophonous experience like that be?

910
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,340
It would be so confusing.

911
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,340
You would not know your own id from your own tid.

912
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,180
Not only...

913
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,860
Not only would you remove your own head from your own body, but you would actually be forcing

914
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,840
yourself into a situation where you'd be looking at yourself from the inside.

915
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,100
There's no law against wearing such apparel on the street as long as it can be distinguished

916
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,800
that man is man and woman is woman.

917
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,360
I think he's just a big boy.

918
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,880
My significant other is a pre-optimist.

919
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,100
As long as it can be distinguished that man is man and woman is woman.

920
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,040
It's a pleasure, isn't it?

921
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm going to cry.

922
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,040
I'm going to cry.

923
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,180
I'm going to cry.

924
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:13,180


925
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,020
Man is man.

926
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,520
Man is man.

927
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,200
Man is man.

928
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,780
Man is man.

929
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,520
Man is man.

930
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm giving yourself over.

931
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:27,340
Man, Connie Spews there, friends, from Reverend Protectrix, Amazonia.

932
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:34,320
And now we're going to dare delve deep into the folds of the Connie-ites, such as Nikki

933
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,440
Deathchick, who preached at the Oasis of Slack, friends in Tucson.

934
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,960
She already knows you.

935
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,920
If you ordered anything...

936
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,420
I'm a web genius.

937
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,380
...products in the last five years, I have seen your name before passing your order onto

938
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,080
one of the robots or lesser beings.

939
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,720
And of course, there's the constant hassle of having to deal with the attention you get

940
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,240
when you're part of a very small but ever-expanding pool of mutant females in a great big pool

941
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,220
of male mutants.

942
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,540
Additionally, many of the events of the past years would not have been accomplished had

943
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,080
it not been for Connie-ite intervention.

944
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,840
Free recurrence!

945
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,440
Including dock stock in Amsterdam.

946
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,240
Cannot!

947
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,260
Coca-Cola Exhibition?

948
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,260


949
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,640
And it's funny because we really didn't plan it this way.

950
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,340
It simply became necessary.

951
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,320
We had mysterious visions and hang up phone calls while the phone was unplugged, but there

952
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,180
were certain things we just had to do.

953
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,600
And I'm not doing any ass licking today.

954
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,620
I told you that, right?

955
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,360
Yes, yes.

956
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,720
No ass licking.

957
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,960
I'm telling you it's getting so a fella can't

958
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
get away from the goddamn sick.

959
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:43,180
Eww.

960
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,680
no more. I left New York for that same reason. Hell, I love that city. As before, it got crazy,

961
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,020
that is. And all that atomic shit starts falling out of the sky. And wherever a spore touches you,

962
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:05,740
a parasite will grow. A guy broke into the house. Yeah. He raped you. You liked it. He died. They

963
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:12,600
got used to eating human flesh. He feeds those pigs, dead people. And then he eats the pigs.

964
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,020
So what? Everybody's sick. Everybody running away from everything. And what are you? What are

965
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:24,600
you? Troublemaking? Yeah. Terror, horror, death. Filming 11. And I found this little parable about

966
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Kali that perfectly illustrates the position of the Cognites in the church today that I'd like

967
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,460
to share with you. The goddess immediately set out to be battled with the dreaded demon in the

968
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,580
form of Kali. Her eyes were red, her complexion was dark, her features gaunt, her hair was

969
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:50,140
unbound, her teeth sharp like fangs. As she rode onto the battleground on her thine,

970
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:58,380
Raktavija experienced fear for the first time in his demonic heart. Kali ordered the gods to

971
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:06,980
attack him. She then spread her tongue to cover the battlefield, preventing even a single drop

972
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:12,560
of Raktavija's blood from falling on the ground. Drunk on Raktavija's blood, Kali was

973
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,680
rammed across the cosmos, killing anyone who dared cross her path. Now it's obvious that

974
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,120
this ancient myth is just an archaic story about Bob, one of the old Bob's battles against

975
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:35,140
the conspiracy, represented by the demon. So while Bob, or Shiva, was lost in meditation,

976
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:42,560
which is just a diplomatic way of saying to frot, who went out to take care of Bob?

977
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:42,580


978
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:49,340
You can't take care of business. Why, of course, Kali is consulate, who incidentally can do

979
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,540
miraculous things with her tongue, which kind of proves that the story is true.

980
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,900
She was a...

981
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,000
She damn well is metal.

982
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,880
Solid. Solid metal.

983
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,420
Yeah.

984
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,080
Impregnable.

985
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,740
I was so proud of her.

986
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,940
Well, I heard she is impregnable.

987
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,040
I was so proud of her. She got up in...at the D Bible, and she preached her little

988
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,560
heart out, and her mighty, excellent...

989
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:12,560


990
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,920
...excellent lungs were heaving as she preached, and preached on the false Connie's versus

991
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,240
the true Connie type.

992
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,580
She preached her beloved groins right off, and I was not sadder than anybody there, crying

993
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:31,540
as I was, to see that happen. She is a lovely person. I mean, a more lovely personality.

994
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,180
Personality and...

995
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,000
And a playwright as well, who works for the EMS services. Well, I didn't actually see

996
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,600
that part. I think I was just imagining it.

997
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:40,960
She was my daughter, I...

998
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
Well, you wish you were.

999
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,580
You wish you was your daughter, don't you?

1000
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:44,900
No, actually, now she's...

1001
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,560
Is your daughter.

1002
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,460
...several years older than my daughter, and so it's okay, you know?

1003
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:55,380
Ah, I see why I got the dirty old man look. Now I understand. Well, you know, some babes,

1004
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,960
you know, like in their 30s, actually look younger, so she actually is younger.

1005
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,620
Technically, Reverend Nikki Deschick is an employee of the...she's one of my fellow

1006
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,860
coworkers for the...

1007
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,900
I thought you were gonna say she was an imperialist.

1008
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,780
No, so if I were to cite fresh things about her and so forth, that could be construed

1009
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,360
as on-the-job harassment.

1010
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,280
You see?

1011
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,840
Okay. We don't want you to harangue her on your job or any other place you go.

1012
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,540
No, but I sure wouldn't mind it if she harassed me. Oh, yes. Have you ever seen Nikki

1013
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,820
Deschick in her nun outfit with that big old whip, that riding crop, and her...

1014
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,860
I personally would rather spank Nikki than have her spank me. I'm just one of those

1015
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,420
kind of guys.

1016
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,720
Well, she'd probably rather that, too, and she's into guilt on both parties and taking

1017
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,520
turns because the guilt is what makes the forget...makes it all so hard.

1018
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:42,520


1019
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:42,520


1020
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:42,520


1021
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,540
And later...

1022
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,480
But Nikki is always dating with the...

1023
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:47,480


1024
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:47,680
Well, she tend to think that you let more or less them reste.

1025
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1026
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1027
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1028
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1029
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1030
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1031
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,680


1032
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,540
You know, it just proves my point that we are the ones who are supposed to take over all along.

1033
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,820
But just last week, Sister Decadence, the producer of the Paniyat calendar, was lamenting

1034
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,680
that we just don't have enough months in the year to display all of the fine Paniyat

1035
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,060
names.

1036
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:36,160
But as in the story from Hindu mythology, it is important to note that the powers of

1037
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,360
the Paniyats are varied, ranging from pundits to bloodlust and everything in between.

1038
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:49,860
Like the many arms of the goddess Kali, we all represent different aspects of Constance

1039
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,480
Marshdow, which is her full name, each claiming our own unique niche.

1040
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,900
There has been the occasional pink female who tried to infiltrate the church, and one

1041
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,560
can only imagine sin by the conspiracy to take the anti-bloodline.

1042
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,880
These were easily recognizable as pink because they were all the same.

1043
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,520
Their basic atmosphere...

1044
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,200
They were just to be like, hey, I'm a girl.

1045
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,080
That's all I have to offer.

1046
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:16,760
Look, breasts!

1047
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,780
They didn't have that quality that all true subgeniuses share, which is to be completely

1048
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,060
different from every other subgenius.

1049
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,980
And look how far we've come to bringing God's prophecy to life, that there will be many

1050
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,220
Paniyat yetis all in life and next.

1051
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,460
Let us pay homage to all those who aren't with us this evening, who have done so much

1052
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,820
for the sake of your slack.

1053
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,520
Let us pay homage to all those who are with us this evening, who have done so much for

1054
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:42,660
the sake of your slack.

1055
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,940
Like Sister Deconance, Mary Magdalene, Rabbi, Princess Marie, Barbie, Daniel, Angela, Profex,

1056
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:55,400
Lilith, Friday, and of course, Queen of Paniyat who's alive today, Sister Susie, the Blue

1057
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:55,860
Genie.

1058
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,080
And everybody else who's made the text there that I forgot to mention.

1059
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,700
If you want to be happy, keep your legs open and your mouth shut.

1060
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,260
No, no, look, I want to get this straight.

1061
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,220
You showed them your purse.

1062
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,880
and that makes them pass out and thanks again for servicing our daughter you

1063
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,660
try to save my wife screwed an elephant now you know how powerful the devil is

1064
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:29,440
and if you cross him he's gonna be mad as hell let me think I gotta think this

1065
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,820
hole is so ugly she can scare a hungry bulldog off the back of a meat truck I

1066
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,680
suppose digging in cow dung is fun it depends on what you find underneath

1067
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,340
I remember now after a fast out I remember

1068
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,900
a serpent a horrible thing towering above me

1069
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,640
called around a crucifix Fritz get up for God's sake get up they've killed

1070
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:06,480
Fritz they've killed Fritz those lousy stinking yellow fairies those horrible and chocolatey built vermin those despicable animal

1071
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,560
war markets they've killed Fritz

1072
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,560
take that

1073
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,320
take that you creeps

1074
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,180
you black-eyed and short-nosed

1075
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:21,500
because of my interactions with false Connie-ites in my earliest days in involvement with the church

1076
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:28,960
I never wanted to talk about Connie or do things that seemed like I was placing my gender above my gettiness

1077
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,840
but things have changed

1078
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,520
my aspect has always been more of the Collie side of Connie

1079
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,660
to get shit done and pull out my ass

1080
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,360
I've never punished the guilty while providing slack for the true followers of the path of God

1081
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:56,200
my contribution has been and will continue to be giving you what you really want

1082
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,960
which I'm finding out more and more is to be teased and taunted

1083
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,160
while you feel that delicious forbidden guilt

1084
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,120
and in fact, I've been doing that to you

1085
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,560
so for your enjoyment and frustration

1086
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,420
I'm going to talk about blowjobs

1087
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,420
they started a brag of Nikki Death Chick and it's called

1088
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,420
My blowjobs are so good

1089
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,740
and I'm not going to talk about blowjobs

1090
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,020
I'm going to talk about my blowjobs

1091
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,020


1092
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,700
I'm just going to talk about my blowjobs

1093
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,100
and I'm just going to talk about my blowjobs

1094
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,980
Young grudger a pain in the ass

1095
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:40,260
He's just a man, horny like every other guy.

1096
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,460
We're going back to that island, Fairbanks.

1097
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:47,220
Back to find the beasts that chewed up your pals while they were still alive and kicking.

1098
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,680
You want to come along?

1099
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:59,280
We've all heard we've been terrorized by what some people say is a sea monster.

1100
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:10,660
Ha ha ha ha. What I say, it's only a fish. And we're not going to be intimidated by a fish.

1101
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,240
I got big problems. I mean, stuff that dogs don't understand.

1102
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,140
Well, why doesn't somebody reason with it? Can't you control it? It's got to be stopped.

1103
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,920
We're your government. We're the good guys.

1104
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:28,680
A preachment, dear friends, you're about to receive on John Barleycore, nicotine, and the temptations of Eve.

1105
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,120
Pfft!

1106
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,220
Okay, let's hear it. It's so good.

1107
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,640
Once I was happy and had a good wife.

1108
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,300
I had enough money to last me for life.

1109
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,120
I met with a gal and we went on a spree.

1110
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,780
She taught me to smoke and drink whiskey.

1111
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,020
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood.

1112
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,860
And I'll play with you, got you in sync.

1113
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,880
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood.

1114
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,580
And I'll drive you crazy, then drive you insane.

1115
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,000
I, I sing temptation, will ya?

1116
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:14,760
Please.

1117
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,600
Cigarettes is a blot on the whole human face.

1118
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,380
A man is a monkey with one in his face.

1119
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,160
Here's my definition. Believe me, dear brother.

1120
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:34,040
A fire on one end, a fool on the other.

1121
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,040
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood.

1122
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,860
And I'll play with you, got you in sync.

1123
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,940
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood.

1124
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,700
And I'll play with you, got you in sync.

1125
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,400
Cigarettes are a way of, dear friend.

1126
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,900
Somebody get that bum out of here.

1127
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,720
Brother, repent or they'll write on your grave.

1128
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,240
Two women and whiskey, here lies a poor slave.

1129
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,300
Take warning, dear stranger. Take warning, dear friend.

1130
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,700
They'll write in big letters these words that then.

1131
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,940
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood.

1132
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,720
And I'll play with you, got you in sync.

1133
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,860
Cigarettes and whiskey and wild, wild wood.

1134
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,480
And I'll play with you, got you in sync.

1135
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,680
Listen, I want to hear temptation, you hear?

1136
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,520
That's what I want to hear, temptation.

1137
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,100
Hold it, hold it, brother.

1138
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,380
My friend, I'm afraid you're in the wrong place.

1139
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,080
We don't sing that kind of music here.

1140
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,220
Okay. Then show us your muscles.

1141
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,200
Oh no, no, no, no.

1142
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:03,940
Hey!

1143
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,960
Good God! The prediction came true!

1144
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:09,820
Now what's that?

1145
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,340
The bomb pipe.

1146
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:17,580
It's a young hipster teenager girl, with a bomb pipe in her mouth,

1147
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,980
and a broom stick inserted just the way Bob predicted would be the new fad of the...

1148
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,100
Now, speaking of things that come and go.

1149
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,100
Speaking of fags, is that a real broomstick or is that one?

1150
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:29,820
Signs of the end times.

1151
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:42,160
When you see a broomstick where it shouldn't ought to be, whether it be inserted by New York Police Department or Bob Dobbs himself, friends, you know the end times are coming.

1152
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:49,520
And so a lot of gross perverts out there, of which I am not that kind myself.

1153
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,640
Nay, brother.

1154
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,320
And I only look at these things.

1155
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,840
Can I get a witness?

1156
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:59,980
Look at in your eyes, the yellow matter dripping down from the corners of your eyes.

1157
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,660
Praise the Lord, the past the affinition.

1158
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,340
Praise the Lord, the past the affinition.

1159
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,960
Sometimes I wish God gave me a Holy Ghost machine and I'd blow your head off.

1160
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,200
There's some new words that are being described very blatantly.

1161
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,520
Let me give you an example.

1162
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,060
In the lyrics of songs, when you hear...

1163
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:27,660
When you hear them sing about engine, motor, or machine, they're referring to sex.

1164
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,080
When you hear them sing about funky, they're referring to sexual odors.

1165
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,600
When they sing about groovy, they're talking about the position of intercourse.

1166
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,460
When they sing of get off, they're singing about the goal of love making.

1167
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,520
And then you hear them talk about, sing about groupies, they're talking about rock prostitutes.

1168
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,960
I am a groupie.

1169
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:50,360
Be, be, be, be, be, be.

1170
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,980
Do you know what a groupie is?

1171
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,420
I am a groupie.

1172
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,200
You're a groupie.

1173
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:54,940
You're a groupie.

1174
00:54:54,940 --> 00:55:01,680
A rock group freak like me, who digs musicians and follows them night after night to wherever their gig is.

1175
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,740
I am a groupie.

1176
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,340
I'm 16 years old.

1177
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,420
I am a groupie.

1178
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,540
I get where I want to go, any way I can.

1179
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,400
Thumb trips, a van, or daddy's wheel.

1180
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,120
All I want is to be free.

1181
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,120
And all I've got are looks and a few gimmicks.

1182
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,380
I am a groupie.

1183
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,900
I'm a groupie.

1184
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,580
I'm a good expert here at groupies.

1185
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm going into groupies and I want to know what's love now, what's important, what's character be in tone?

1186
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000


1187
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000


1188
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000


1189
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,000


1190
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,700
I'm 16 years old.

1191
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,920
I am a groupie.

1192
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,200
I am a groupie.

1193
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,360
I'm a groupie.

1194
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,960
I am a groupie.

1195
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,620
I am a groupie.

1196
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,560
The beat.

1197
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,100
I would say at this point that it's absolutely incredible

1198
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,800
to hear those primitive drum beats

1199
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,420
and the overt and blatant reference to Satan.

1200
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,500
That is unbelievable.

1201
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,840
Every time I hear it, it gets me,

1202
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,020
I guess the word to describe it would be the creeps.

1203
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,320
Sometimes late at night I have to play this beat

1204
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,280
and it's not fun to play that type of beat after midnight, believe me.

1205
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,060
But if you think that's unbelievable,

1206
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,720
I've got more of this song for you.

1207
00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:18,000
I've got more of this song for you.

1208
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,460
Slap.

1209
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,320
That's what we call slap.

1210
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,800
That's the problem when you unbuckle the seatbelt.

1211
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,080
Just let your forehead cave right in.

1212
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,540
Just deflate, baby.

1213
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,920
What would be better than...

1214
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,280
You've been tight.

1215
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,360
You've been inflated.

1216
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,440
You rose earlier.

1217
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,200
Now it's time to just flop, baby.

1218
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,280
Just let it all out.

1219
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:41,000
Every brain cell, let it melt, melt, melt

1220
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,280
down into a little puddle of gray matter soup.

1221
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,000
Puh, them sips.

1222
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,120
Sip, sip, sip.

1223
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,600
That's soup and sleep, friends.

1224
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:57,060
But not until you've checked out all the words and videotapes of Bob Dobbs

1225
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,200
at www.subgenius.com

1226
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,440
or, got that pencil ready?

1227
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:08,960
Bob at Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1228
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,240
Oh, yes, and that was the bran flakes, friends,

1229
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,540
doing the praise of the Lord groupie, the groupie bit.

1230
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,160
The bran flakes at...

1231
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,600
The bran flakes.

1232
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,980
Branflakes.com.

1233
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,140
And now I want...

1234
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,160
Stay tuned, friends, you internet listeners,

1235
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,160
for Nicky's X-rated rant after Z-Zon.

1236
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,260
Ah.

1237
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,040
Ah.

1238
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:29,980
Ah.

1239
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,300
Ah.

1240
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,260
Ah.

1241
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,560
Ah.

1242
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:34,240


1243
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,260
Ah.

1244
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,060
Ah.

1245
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,300
Ah.

1246
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:36,660
Ah.

1247
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,060
Ah.

1248
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:38,560
Ah.

1249
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,100
Ah.

1250
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:39,220
Ah.

1251
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:39,240
Ah.

1252
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,320
Ah.

1253
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:39,540
Ah.

1254
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:39,760
Ah.

1255
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,100
Ah.

1256
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:40,900
Ah.

1257
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:40,900


1258
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:41,540
Ah.

1259
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:41,840
Ah.

1260
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:41,960
Ah.

1261
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:41,960


1262
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:41,960


1263
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,620
Ah.

1264
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,220
Ah.

1265
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:44,700
Ah.

1266
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:45,980
Ah.

1267
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,220
Ah.

1268
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:48,980


1269
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:49,780
Ah.

1270
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:49,980
Ah.

1271
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,320
Ah.

1272
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:50,820
Ah.

1273
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:50,900
Ah.

1274
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,560
Ah.

1275
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1276
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1277
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1278
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1279
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1280
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1281
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1282
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:51,560


1283
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,880
She's pretty, don't you think?

1284
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,840
And you creeped her out.

1285
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,880
I felt even more uncomfortable

1286
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,060
when my father suddenly began taking his clothes off.

1287
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,960
And before I could say Sigmund Freud,

1288
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,780
my father put on this...

1289
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,520
this...

1290
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,240
this diaper.

1291
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,980
To see my own father in a diaper, uh...

1292
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,620
Whoa!

1293
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,320
What do you think could have done that to him?

1294
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,720
I wish I knew, Lieutenant.

1295
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,140
But look at the way his skin and clothes are torn.

1296
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,000
I...

1297
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,580
It's almost as if, I don't know, it's almost as if he exploded.

1298
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,480
If you're always in this condition, it's quite obvious you couldn't get it up, even if you used a crane.

1299
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:31,560
Robin, must you always smother my cooking in tornadoes before you even taste it?

1300
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:36,440
There is so much to see, and though there is so far for men to go,

1301
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:43,400
it's good to travel wide, and then it's good to come back home again.

1302
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,280
Fasten safety belts, please. Fasten safety belts, please.

1303
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,560
We're coming in for an Earth landing.

1304
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:01,120
Now we're turning. Our tail will point toward the Earth,

1305
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,700
and we will slow down our landing with our tail rockets.

1306
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,500
There's the field below.

1307
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,980
People say in Boston even beans do it.

1308
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:12,600
Beans will do it, friends.

1309
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:24,180
Home again.

1310
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,820
My blowjobs are so good that I will be solely responsible for the second coming.

1311
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,940
My blowjobs are so good that Bob himself offered to pay me for one,

1312
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,780
and I told him he didn't have enough money.

1313
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,920
My blowjobs are so good.

1314
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,220
My blowjobs are so good that they had to rename Deep Throat's shallow indentation.

1315
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,120
My blowjobs are so good that they're a felony in most southern states.

1316
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,100
My blowjobs are so good that I cause rigor mortis in the living.

1317
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:11,220
My blowjobs are so good that I make porno actresses re-evaluate their career paths.

1318
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,620
My blowjobs are so good that Connie herself called me up and asked me for lessons.

1319
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,380
Yeah!

1320
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,500
My blowjobs are so good that the Pope declared them a mortal sin.

1321
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,140
This one's really gross. I'm fond of it.

1322
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,580
My blowjobs are so good that I regularly eat it in my stomach pump.

1323
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,380
My blowjobs are so good that my longest blowjob involved time travel.

1324
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,400
Here's another one along the same lines.

1325
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,780
My blowjobs are so good that my most gravitational pull is in danger of creating a black hole.

1326
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,000
I get Stephen Hawking nightmares.

1327
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:05,660
My blowjobs are so good that if I ever became a lesbian, the suicide rate would triple in my life.

1328
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,960
My blowjobs are so good that last time I hit a popsicle in public,

1329
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,000
I got charged with violating public abstinence laws.

1330
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,780
My tongue can fold in ways only M. C. Escher could understand.

1331
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,120
All right.

1332
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:33,460
I think we've had about enough bad blowjobs for learning to date.

1333
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,720
All right. I've got one more. I didn't write any.

1334
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,940
This Catholic Parish…

1335
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:44,560
The head priest was out for the day.

1336
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,140
listening deep in punks'!!

1337
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:47,880
to make her a confession.

1338
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,920
My girl confesses that she just gave someone a blowjob.

1339
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,280
There's a sheet on the wall of the confessional

1340
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,860
so the priest can refer to it

1341
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,940
to give penances for standard sins.

1342
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,020
But he can't find blowjobs on there.

1343
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,860
So he goes out and asks an altar boy,

1344
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,820
what does a pastor usually give for blowjobs?

1345
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,580
The altar boy says, oh, about five bucks.

1346
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,020
All right, that's enough.

1347
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,200
That's enough.

1348
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,420
Reverend Amy Gubchin, please order some shins

1349
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,480
so I can keep my job.
