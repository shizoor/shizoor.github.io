1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,420
It's getting late for the great planet Earth.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,640
A storm of hail and fire mingled with blood is cast upon the Earth and a third of the world is burned.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,160
A fiery mountain is hurled into the sea and a third of the sea and its creatures have perished.

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,560
A great star has fallen from heaven upon a third of the Earth's rivers and springs.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,940
Their waters have become polluted and bitter.

6
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,300
The sun, the moon and the stars are struck. A third of the world is in darkness.

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,500
Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the Earth because of the risk of the trumpet blasts which the angels are about to sound.

8
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,140
The great storm of hail and fire mingled with blood is cast upon the Earth and a third of the world is burned.

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,140


10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,840
It is done! The final trumpet has sounded! The mighty cities of the nations fall!

11
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,820
Islands disappear! Mountains crumble! As God's final wrath pours upon mankind!

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,660
As lightning flashes from the east to the west, so he comes.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,480
The Son of Man, anointed in power, returns with majesty and glory to take his kingdom.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,940
Uh, Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one, alright?

15
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,380
Alright, let's go.

16
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,000
Time is running out for the human race.

17
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,500
Get ready for the judgment day.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,480
The sun is shining, come on, get happy.

19
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,280
The Lord is waiting to take your hand.

20
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,160
Shout hallelujah, come on, get happy.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,960
We're going to the promised land.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:46,120
And if she wants to get some white underwear, it might be best she get them in asbestos, alright?

23
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,280
Might better get them in asbestos. And I'm teasing now, of course.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,740
Don't let her put on asbestos breeches, alright?

25
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,960
It might get, uh, might be harmful to your breathing.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,760
First I want to remind you that in the last days there will be some scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of and laugh at the truth.

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,100
If you are scoffing right now, in your heart, if you are not believing...

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,240
Bob!

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,520
...coming back, you are one of the signs of his coming.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,860
If you're going to continue to scoff, will you do me a favor?

31
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,800
Prepare for the end!

32
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,180
Oh, wow!

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,980
Well, there's a day soon coming when the judgment of the world will begin.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,140
When the sky will be darkened and the mountains dance like drunken men.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,440
When the people of the earth will fall like fruit from the tree.

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,060
Oh, I wish you'd all believe me.

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,640
I wish you all could see.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,120
I wish you'd all believe me.

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,440
I wish you'd all believe.

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,620
The truth will not hurt you, only the lie.

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,560
I wish you'd all believe me.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,800
Yay!

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,700
You don't really believe that, do you?

44
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,640
I don't know.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,160
Impossible, fantastic, ridiculous, absurd, really?

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,380
The ambush is set, and it's working.

47
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,220
1998, the year of fear. Jack, explain it way, please.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,840
Now, these are not my dates. We don't set dates.

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,500
This is one of the best intelligence sources in the world, along with Jane's defense out of England.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,340
But let me tell you this, friend.

51
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,160
We believe things are going to come and happen sooner than we think.

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,520
The world must have seen it coming, right?

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,420
I'm afraid not.

54
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,140
Even though the technology had been around for years, nobody really paid too much attention to it.

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,900
Almost no one saw it coming.

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,480
Almost no one?

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,860
Yeah, almost.

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Those of us who did express our concern were just branded as paranoid, as people who hated technology.

59
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,940
People who just weren't ready to be part of a new, united world.

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,860
Don't listen not to this child of Satan.

61
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,200
Reverend, I gotta admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated.

62
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,540
Oh, now be calm, Ned.

63
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,040
But be afraid also, tremendously afraid, for the day of reckoning is upon us.

64
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,660
The reckoning sounds!

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,260
We're heading across the river, wash your sins away in the tide.

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,880
It's all so peaceful on the other side.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,840
Forget the troubles come and go.

68
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,820
Come on, get happy.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,380
You better chase all your cares away.

70
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,580
Shout hallelujah, come on, get happy.

71
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,380
Get ready for the judgment day.

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,380
What about tomorrow?

73
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,820
Yes, four lives ahead.

74
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
Will there be a brighter future?

75
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,080
For just how the world's gonna be?

76
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,900
Let us finish things, little brothers, a little more than dirty and Alfie spent were able to finish.

77
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,500
Isn't it better than this soon?

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
artifacts

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
vital

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
victims

81
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:43,860
Minotaur

82
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh, what a horrible dream.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,640
Oh, man.

84
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Boy, that bitch was right.

85
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,780
I have fallen down on the job, ear seekers.

86
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,080
I've been pussyfooting and fiddle-farting around at the most crucial juncture here of mutant existence ever.

87
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,820
Because this is a damn ministry.

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,540
So from now until X-Day, it's no more Mr. Nice Girl.

89
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,940
Oh, I've got to be more than just the mere Reverend Susie the Floozy to get this job done.

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,260
I've got to be the whore of Babylon on a three-headed pea dog, too.

91
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,840
Because it's time to sound the mutant survival call.

92
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,200
Too much is hanging in the balance here.

93
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,460
Because there are still unsaved subgenius souls out there.

94
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,800
I can whiff-read your stench from here, baby.

95
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh, yes.

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,660
It's the twilight of the elder gods for the Yeti Uber race.

97
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,500
And praise be the holy name of J.R. Bob-Dogs.

98
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:08,780
Because thanks to him, we're scraping the crappy dirt off this planet off of our shoes, baby.

99
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,280
The doomsday clock is ticking down the final moments.

100
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,620
We're on a drunken chicken run with the end times.

101
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,900
And it's zooming up on us a lot sooner than they think.

102
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,980
Yes, X-Day is coming up July 5th.

103
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,040
This very year, Seekers.

104
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,120
It's 7 a.m.

105
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,380
Think, if you haven't thought already.

106
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,340
Have you decided how you're going to spend eternity?

107
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,880
As a human pork rind screaming,

108
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
in the stinking wreckage of a dying planet?

109
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,580
Or as a satisfied member of the fastest growing apocalypse cult,

110
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,820
snugly ensconced aboard the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

111
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:06,360
en route through space and time to an idyllic future of sated lusts and mind-reaming pleasures?

112
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,440
Ha ha ha.

113
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,580
Duh.

114
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,180
Tough choice, huh?

115
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:11,880
Oh.

116
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,120
But there are...

117
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,300
There are some among us who aren't sure yet.

118
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,060
Maybe they can't quite tell if they're pink.

119
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,680
Or if they're truly a mutated son of Dobbs.

120
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,480
Hell, just send in that membership fee.

121
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,400
And whether you're pink or not, chances are everything will be fine.

122
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,800
Hell, those saucers come with airlocks and torpedo tubes.

123
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm sure we'll be able to do a little weeding out once we're airborne.

124
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,300
Oh, but that can come later.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,100
And hopefully there won't be a lot of weeding.

126
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm sure there will be a lot of weeding to do.

127
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,380
Because weeding's hard on a girl's knees.

128
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,020
But I don't expect a lot of the wrong kind of people to be on board if you catch my drift.

129
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,420
Because they're going to be misreading the flaming signs in the heavens

130
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:03,400
and trying their brand-X apocalyptic solutions until it's too late to turn to Bob.

131
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,600
Oh, but they never have been able to figure out how to get it right anyway.

132
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh, they screw me.

133
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,100


134
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,920
They screw it all up.

135
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,620
They can't tell a 999 from a 666.

136
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:28,060
And I can see how they could mistake our triumphant subgenius Ragnarok for their cheesy bargain basement Armageddon.

137
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,580
Oh, but hey, you putzes.

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,960
Armageddon tired of waiting for you to get around to it.

139
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,720
Your god can't get it up to destroy the Sodom and Gomorrah that it has created for itself.

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,260
Oh, but Bob's going to clean house on this cat box, but good.

141
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,940
And the mighty wrath of Jehovah One and Negi and the Elder Gods and the Sex Goddesses are just for the overkill.

142
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,800
Oh, Bob, great is thy power.

143
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,580
Cream rinse us all in your sweet load and rupture us up into the heavens.

144
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,080
Yay, we strip naked and light the sacred froth and implore your mercy upon your beloved.

145
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,440
Oh, believers.

146
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,460
Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

147
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,140
In the days of the end, there shall come from among the race of men a new ruler.

148
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,800
From the chaos of the nations, he will forge peace and security.

149
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,640
As one risen from the dead, he will entrench the world with his sorcery.

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,000
And at the time appointed, he will take his place in the very temple of the Lord of Hosts.

151
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,860
Scattering the true children of the Father over the face of the whole earth.

152
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,060
He is Bob.

153
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,460
Oh, yeah.

154
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,620
My name is Chaz.

155
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,980
And I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

156
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
All quarantined.

157
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,740
All strapped in my suit.

158
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,320
Pressure suit's all pressured up.

159
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,420
Yeah.

160
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,520
It's here.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,800
The ship is waiting.

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,000
Hissing away.

163
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,740
Spewing out its little steam.

164
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,580
Waiting for the moment.

165
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,580
The final countdown.

166
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,200
And that's where we're at.

167
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,120
Just hours away from the final hour.

168
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,400
The final minute.

169
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,180
The final second.

170
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,100
Ex-Daddy.

171
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,180
Thought it'd never get here.

172
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
It's kinda late now.

173
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,980
We're there.

174
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,920
There's nothing else to do.

175
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,620
Just sit.

176
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,320
Look out the window.

177
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,800
And wait for the light.

178
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,700
Is your pleasure ship hovering above?

179
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,700
Waiting for the final hours to pass?

180
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:50,060
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia Blue?

181
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,840
Mine is.

182
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,260
We'll see you.

183
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,920
One, two.

184
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,920
Hey, Bleepo.

185
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,240
Yeah?

186
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,280
Um, Chaz and I have been planning our, which reruns we're gonna, we're gonna run as since

187
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,680
there's only another, uh, one or two.

188
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,680


189
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,680


190
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,680


191
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,680


192
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,680


193
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:06,680


194
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,340
Like, week of broadcasting left on the planet.

195
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,100
Oh, God.

196
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,700
You know, I've, I've done 638 hours of sweat.

197
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,060
Down to a few hours now.

198
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,360
And we're gonna start rerunning number one.

199
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,540
I mean, for what radio stations are left.

200
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,280
Right.

201
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,640
And, uh, what were you plan, thinking of doing, Chaz?

202
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,060
I don't understand how a lot of this is gonna, you know, take place.

203
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
I don't understand how a lot of this happens.

204
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,200
I just know that it won't fail because of me.

205
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,660
We all are in this together as a family.

206
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


207
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


208
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


209
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


210
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


211
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


212
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:36,660


213
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,520
We're gonna make it work.

214
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,680
And I don't know how to make it work.

215
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,440
I don't know how to do most of this mission.

216
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,920
But I do know that I can assure you that my piece of it is gonna work.

217
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,640
And it won't fail because of me.

218
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,980
No, on, on X-Day, Negi will return to us all the greatest tapes that we ever recorded.

219
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,460
Praise the Negi.

220
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,620
Which he has been keeping.

221
00:13:59,720 --> 00:13:59,940
Right.

222
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,340
Praise the Negi.

223
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:01,480
Oh, God.

224
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,560
That's so good.

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,640
Negi has been keeping all of our lost tapes.

226
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


227
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


228
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


229
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


230
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


231
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


232
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640


233
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,580
And he's recording in a special vault.

234
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,100
That's where everybody wonders where they're going.

235
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,180
Oh, you hear that, brother?

236
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,220
And those will all be returned to us on X-Day.

237
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,580
Oh, that's so glorious.

238
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,300
Jane-er will get his, his eight millimeter films back.

239
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,040
Oh.

240
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,860
Oh, the stone.

241
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,100
You know, your first show will come back.

242
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,480
I'll, uh, actually, I never did lose anything.

243
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,520
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?

244
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
As long as you saw them.

245
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,200
You mean everything I've ever seen?

246
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,960
You know, that you never got around to looking at.

247
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,540
Uh-huh.

248
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,320
Even if I've only seen it once?

249
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:36,620
What about a couple of times?

250
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,620


251
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,620


252
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,620


253
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,620


254
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,960
I've seen it for a fraction of a second.

255
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,700
The events that I've next taped have never were taped.

256
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,120
There's a thing called the new program.

257
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,700
The things that you thought, that you imagined very vividly doing.

258
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:43,960
This is too damn confusing.

259
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,420
I'm getting out of here.

260
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,260
Will then be done.

261
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,260
They will have been done.

262
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,560
When you want to do a wonderful new show, that show will materialize in your hand as

263
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:52,760
a tape.

264
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,380
Yeah, the new program.

265
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,820
But as soon as we're gone, you folks who are here unsaved, you folks listening by radio,

266
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,560
you folks listening by record, once the church is gone, there is going to be a cataclysmic

267
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:02,780
judgment.

268
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,540
And millions will die in those next few years.

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm not going to be a cataclysmic judge.

270
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,600


271
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,400
And they'll be glued to their sets, watching rockets and jets, blowing up schools and

272
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,740
factories, putting an end to the birds and bees.

273
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:20,400
It's worth every penny to tune and then see who wins the Emmy at the Rune of the Academy.

274
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,420
Watch World War 3 on pay TV before your television melts away.

275
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,160
It's the end of the world as we know it.

276
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,820
It's the end of the world as we know it.

277
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,580
It's the end of the world as we know it.

278
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,580


279
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,460
It's the end of the world as we know it.

280
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,600
I feel fine.

281
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,220
Hey, oh, let's go.

282
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,980
You see them in the back now.

283
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,580
What they want, I don't know.

284
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,260
They're all ripped up and ready to go.

285
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,040
Turn around, go back down, back the way you came.

286
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,780
Can't you see that flash of fire?

287
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,560
Ten times brighter than the day.

288
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,900
And behold, a mighty city broken in the dust again.

289
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,460
Oh, God, proud man, broken in the dust again.

290
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,360
It's gonna be me and it's gonna be you.

291
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,440
We're gonna do everything we want to.

292
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,160
It's gotta be now.

293
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,760
And I can't wait.

294
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,960
To think about a beer and all that pain at hand.

295
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,300
Oh, like a flaming baton that's burning us warm.

296
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,180
Like George Bush on acid, singing in the duper.

297
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,580
Gonna be a new world.

298
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,180
Gonna be a new world.

299
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,480
Gonna be a new world.

300
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,400
Gonna be a new world.

301
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,400


302
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,460
Gonna have to say it to anyone's last words.

303
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,680
There's nothing left for you to say.

304
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,200
Soon you'll pretend anyway.

305
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,580
Well, no one here is getting out of line.

306
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,060
There's something really lost in my mind that I don't get.

307
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,920
So close your eyes and give yourself goodbye.

308
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,960
And think about the times we've been and what they've been

309
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,500
To me it's nothing, to me it's nothing

310
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
To me it's nothing, to me it's nothing

311
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,640
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance

312
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,680
That's why we might as well take our time

313
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,680
So stop the traffic, stop the clock, stop the clock

314
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,420
I wanna get off, I wanna get off with you

315
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:24,080
I wanna get off, I wanna get off with you

316
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,620
One more job in the supermarket

317
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,060
One more kick to get me started

318
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,120
Everyone get on board, this ship is sinking

319
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,240
Looking for a way in, searching for the way out

320
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,060
Angels ride free in your mind

321
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,620
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try

322
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,020
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild

323
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,540
Hey man, get hip, climb aboard our pleasure ship

324
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,780
Speed boy, we know

325
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,160
We're all king of the freedom, yeah, come and go

326
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,580
We're all king of the freedom, yeah, come and go

327
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:06,580


328
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,440
We're all king of the freedom, yeah, come and go

329
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,660
Go Apollo 69

330
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,580
Rock it baby, walk the line

331
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,100
We feed the fire, now's the time

332
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,980
Fly Apollo 69, yeah, yeah

333
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,480
The beginning was the end

334
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,840
Of everything now

335
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,420
The ape regards his tail

336
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,580
He's stuck on everything now

337
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,640
He sits there and eavesdropping

338
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,220
How long keepin' on the teachin'

339
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,100
He could

340
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,200
Take a seat

341
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:58,720
Трейд рейт кейм Κοι 101

342
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,120
He's just within thatē

343
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:00,700
risin'

344
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:00,700


345
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,820
Like me, he's an Oscar winner

346
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
octogen ties

347
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,260
today

348
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,480
Burned like a red

349
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,920
cold carpet

350
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,540
Mad bull has lost

351
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,440
its way

352
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,100
Born a

353
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,680
children

354
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,080
It's just a shot away

355
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,200
It's just a shot away

356
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
Born a

357
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,020
children

358
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,360
It's just a shot away

359
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,320
Shot away, shot away

360
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,260
When we were born

361
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,840
into this life

362
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,520
We were destined

363
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,260
to make it right

364
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,140
And it's predetermined

365
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,720
And this is our fate

366
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,460
We're singing this song

367
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,860
So you can relate

368
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,500
We are going to save the universe

369
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,180
We are going to save the universe

370
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,420
We are going

371
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:03,800
to save the universe

372
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,880
We are going to save the universe

373
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,080
Goodbye

374
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,860
Goodbye

375
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,160
Goodbye

376
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,480
Goodbye

377
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,960
Goodbye

378
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,720
Goodbye

379
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,200
Goodbye

380
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,260
Goodbye

381
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


382
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


383
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


384
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


385
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


386
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


387
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,260


388
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,780
No future for you

389
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,740
No future, no future for you

390
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,080
The universe is not a frame

391
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:20,240
What of the limitless sex and violence

392
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,640
In the wake of Ragnarok

393
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,760
Welcome to the slaughter

394
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,080
What are you going to do?

395
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,740
What will be your epitaph?

396
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,880
When we get done with you

397
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,480
Are you gonna cry for your mama?

398
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,860
Or are you gonna have a good time?

399
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,360
Are you gonna be a bohab?

400
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,540
When it's your turn to die

401
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,440
Don't get crazy

402
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,460
Redlam all around

403
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,200
Anarchy here

404
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,340
Rural streets in Ragnarok

405
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,160
Haunted town

406
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,180
Three- frank ball

407
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,200
personal

408
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,260
Student Eagles

409
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,700
Uام

410
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,320
You've forgotten

411
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,700
Already

412
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,800
Penguins

413
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,780
pole

414
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:24,800
QUESTION

415
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:24,800


416
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,160
Daaang

417
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,800
You got to throw some wood

418
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,300
Just put some bleachers out in the sun

419
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,140
And have it out on Highway 61

420
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Oh yeah

421
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,560
It's the end of the world as we know it

422
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,200
It's the end of the world as we know it

423
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
And I feel fine

424
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,720
With ease down

425
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,260
I know what's coming

426
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,320
And I've got to beat you to make you understand

427
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,520
It's the

428
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,260
Genius Power of

429
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,860
Satellite

430
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,140
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history

431
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,700
That much I know

432
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,300
And it's a

433
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,540
It's a

434
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:56,540


435
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:56,780
The very

436
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,540
The very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand

437
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,340
And that if you plan to be saved

438
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,640
You'd better do it now

439
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,020
In this temple lodge of the church of the subgenius of the rock

440
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,340
And before we begin the sacred spouting

441
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,720
I think that we should all bow our heads

442
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,680
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments about mine ears

443
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,520
And sometimes voices

444
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,680
Voices?

445
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,340
Yes, voices, you see

446
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,860
Well

447
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,640
I've been usurped

448
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,560
Maybe another time

449
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,000
The quill knobs and the knobs

450
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,340
Don't be nubbled

451
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,120
But there you go

452
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,540
Thank you for helping us get here today

453
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:56,900
And I hope you'll get going

454
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,720
We need to start running west

455
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,620
As fast as we can

456
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,900
Testing, testing

457
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,540
And something I noticed is that the chaos

458
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
Testing, testing, ah

459
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,740
Ah yes, there's no contesting this

460
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,460
This testing

461
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,520
Ah, yes

462
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,840
Well we'll take out that

463
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,140
Ancient media barrage

464
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,720
That we've been running here

465
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,960
But aren't they fun?

466
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
There's a third mic, by the way

467
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,840
Yeah, you want to, uh

468
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,260
No, I'm fine, thank you

469
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,540
Ah, well, I'm fine, thank you

470
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,240
I thought, uh

471
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,560
I think he wanted, uh, Bo wanted to sit down

472
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,120
Yeah, well he could if he could bring a chair

473
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,640
I was trying to get Susie the floozy up here

474
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,260
I know, she said she was tired of hearing the sound of her own voice

475
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,640
Oh, darn it

476
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,440
I see I was afraid of that

477
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,440
Ivan, would you like some absinthe here?

478
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,340
Oh, no thanks, I better not start that game

479
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,700
Alright, well we are going to have some

480
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,240
I have a story of absinthe for my friend

481
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,520
And we also ate all sorts of psychedelics

482
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:56,520


483
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,580
Like, uh, uh, cookies and stuff like that

484
00:26:59,580 --> 00:26:59,720
What?

485
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,060
Uh, yeah

486
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,160
Well, maybe you're the one who laid this egg, Dr. Howell

487
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,180
I found this under your chair this morning

488
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,320
That was here yesterday

489
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,600
I take no responsibility for it

490
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,160
Listeners, it's a, uh, I thought it was a coprolite

491
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,500
I thought it was a fossilized piece of dung

492
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,260
It is not

493
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,920
Yeah, I know

494
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,700
But it looks sort of like one

495
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,680
And that was the idea

496
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,640
It's egg shaped

497
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,820
Like a dinosaur sour egg

498
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,140
I want a dinosaur egg, I want a dinosaur egg

499
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,520
Well, no, it's not an egg

500
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,800
It's not

501
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,880
I know, it's just a

502
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,200
My, that absinthe has a heady aroma

503
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,500
Oh, I can smell it

504
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,880
Yes, friends, this isn't WCSB

505
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,940
It's actually warming

506
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,440
This is Tarzan's radio station

507
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,740
On a picnic table

508
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,020
Outdoors, although it's sheltered

509
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,520
And beautiful caffinas

510
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,980
Yes, in beautiful wisteria

511
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,580
Former strip mine

512
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,440
Now a nature preserve

513
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,340
Nature's natural

514
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,660
And an event center

515
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,860
And we're having an event

516
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,340
It's that little party called X Day

517
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,880
Where we wait for the flying saucers to come

518
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,160
And take us off to our own heavenly perfect world

519
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,700
Where we can live forever and do anything we want to

520
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,680
And all the non-believers die horribly and slowly

521
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,660
As far as we know

522
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,960
As far as, yeah, some are more interested in the

523
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,800
Horror and revenge part

524
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,500
I'm more a nature boy

525
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
I just want to get away from this

526
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,660
Sad, tired world of chores and work

527
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,100
Vile tasks

528
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,480
And have slack

529
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,300
And in my case it'll involve beautiful replicas

530
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,800
Of all my favorite landscapes on Earth

531
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,040
Plus monsters

532
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,280
Cool monsters

533
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,560
And 별

534
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,540
and some of them stuck, explaining what Earth life looks like today.

535
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,920
But this also indicates that on other worlds,

536
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,440
there are forms of life that resemble our own.

537
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Well, and moam can cook up just about any kind of workable organism.

538
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,160
It might take a little while.

539
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,700
It's necessary to make changes for different extremes of climate

540
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,320
and gravitation and radiation.

541
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,900
If you want a unicorn, you can probably get one.

542
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,920
It may not function exactly the way you were expecting, though.

543
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,160
Well, you just have to shift until you get the right unicorn.

544
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,380
The unicorn that lived on Earth

545
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,720
was not quite like the one that is depicted in medieval tapestries.

546
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,080
Or was it?

547
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
We don't know because that form seems to be extinct.

548
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,200
And yet...

549
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,140
You see, Baron Cuvier said that the unicorn as popularly conceived

550
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,740
was impossible because the frontal bone of the horse is divided,

551
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,480
so a horn could never be there.

552
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,320
Yes, that's quite true if you think of the unicorn as one does popularly,

553
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,800
as a horn glued onto a horse.

554
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,000
But that is not the way the classical unicorn looked.

555
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,640
For one thing, our unicorn had cloven hooves, right?

556
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,600
Didn't it?

557
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,780
Like the mono-hoof of a horse.

558
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,620
Maybe they were carnivorous.

559
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,580
Maybe they had sharp fangs.

560
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,240
They had a little beard on the chin.

561
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,380
What does that suggest?

562
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,820
Well, that they would pee on their own beard

563
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,120
in order to smell funky for the ladies.

564
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,280
Oh, they smelled great.

565
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,100
Males or whatever.

566
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,940
You see...

567
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,580
The billy unicorns.

568
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,320
A woman could tame a unicorn,

569
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,700
but they would kill men.

570
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,440
They would run the men right through.

571
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,560
Oh, I didn't know that.

572
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,100
No wonder...

573
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,440
Unicorns are so popular.

574
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,260
Don't you know that how they caught unicorns,

575
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,400
a virgin would come and sit in the glade and sing,

576
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,180
and the unicorn would come and rest its head in her lap.

577
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,800
I get it.

578
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,160
She would catch hold of the horn

579
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,580
and call to the hunters who would come out in spirit.

580
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,620
No, I didn't know that.

581
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,620
That is the classical way of catching unicorns.

582
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,340
They didn't teach me that in science class.

583
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,660
Well, you need to read Mallory.

584
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,980
So then, or rather long before, on the tundra,

585
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,120
of Siberia, the gigantic Elasmotherium lived.

586
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,040
A huge beast with a single horn.

587
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,660
Over the years, this form became more gracile.

588
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,900
And although they resembled equines, horses,

589
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,420
that's simply convergent evolution.

590
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,620
So there were Elasmotheres that looked quite unicorn-like,

591
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,200
that had the single horn,

592
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,820
and looked horse-like.

593
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
But they had cloven hooves.

594
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,760
Now, it takes a small leap,

595
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,380
of faith or imagination,

596
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,360
to imagine that just as the gingo tree

597
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,860
was preserved by monks,

598
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,460
or otherwise would have died out,

599
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,260
that perhaps in aristocratic enclaves,

600
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,840
they kept cuddly, bread-white forms of these

601
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
for the...

602
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,460
For the...

603
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,820
The emperor's grandkids.

604
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,700
Yeah, for the aristos to hang them.

605
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,940
Now, you know, a few years ago,

606
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,340
or a few by our age and standards,

607
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
there was that hippie couple, and I met them,

608
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,180
who ran around from Renaissance Faire to Renaissance Faire

609
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,240
with their pet, Lancelot the Living Unicorn.

610
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,640
You're talking about Morning Glory and Oberon.

611
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,280
That's right.

612
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,560
Morning Glory and Oberon, right, exactly.

613
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,000
I met them, I saw them, I saw their unicorn,

614
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,900
which they got by causing the horn buds of a goat

615
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,820
to grow around each other and produce the spiral horn.

616
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,320
It had the beard, it was white, it had cloven hooves,

617
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,040
they groomed it, they grew its mane,

618
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,980
it looked very unicorn-like.

619
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,460
Unfortunately, it acted unicorn-like.

620
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,980
It's one thing to be butted by a goat,

621
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,140
it's another thing to be stuck by something

622
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,420
with a long, rigid thing coming out of its...

623
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,620
I quit my job so this wouldn't happen anymore.

624
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,560
Yeah, well...

625
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,780
You know, Dr. Howell, I didn't just know Oberon and Morning Glory,

626
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,260
I see Oberon.

627
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,680
I hang out with Oberon every year at Starwood.

628
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,540
Yes, he's coming this year, right?

629
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah.

630
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,000
Please say hello for me, he may remember me.

631
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,220
Oh, I'm sure he would.

632
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,260
Morning Glory, unfortunately, died about five years ago.

633
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,620
But Oberon is one of the few people

634
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,480
who has a similar career job description to me.

635
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:17,520
He runs a sex cult, only it really is a sex cult,

636
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,900
the Church of All Worlds,

637
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,240
which was a...

638
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,620
It was a polygamy-based thing,

639
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,160
loosely based on Robert Heinlein's sci-fi religion

640
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,380
in Stranger in a Strange Land.

641
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,700
And they used to have the...

642
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:39,500
Well, they had a lot of those aged, out-of-shape polygamists

643
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,380
in the swimming pool at Brushwood

644
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,460
doing the water-sharing ceremony.

645
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,740
Oh, yes, water-sharing, important on Mars.

646
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,620
It was very difficult for me and my subgenius friends

647
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,720
who were watching this not to laugh out loud

648
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,560
because it was very, very, very serious,

649
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,660
sharing the water and so forth.

650
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,020
The water was grayish-brown, though,

651
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,100
with that many old hippies in it.

652
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,400
Not like me.

653
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,880
I don't fall into that category or anything.

654
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,140
But, yeah, it's interesting.

655
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,600
When I go to Starwood, I hang out with a lot of rifle cults,

656
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:20,600


657
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,620
some of whom I initially made fun of

658
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,700
in that old High Weirdness by Mail book,

659
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,580
and now we're friends.

660
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,580
Gavin Frost and his wife

661
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,200
helped invent Wicca.

662
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,060
And you put them in touch with everyone

663
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,560
in the pre-internet days,

664
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,380
in the pages of High Weirdness.

665
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:43,880
Right.

666
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,060
But we were mocking our rifle cults.

667
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,200
I didn't see any of this whole idea

668
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,540
of Wicca and so on really got started in the 1920s,

669
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,680
as far as I can tell.

670
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,520
Gardnerian.

671
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,020
Yes.

672
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,080
Wicca.

673
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,560
When Margaret Murray published her book

674
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,180
Witchcraft in England, that was very influential.

675
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,660
And a lot of people...

676
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,080
You know, a lot of stuff that absolutely drives

677
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,020
our pop culture today

678
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,460
was made up out of whole cloth in the 1920s.

679
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:17,720
No!

680
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Why, yeah.

681
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,000
No.

682
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,040
Sure.

683
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,380
What, you mean people believe things that aren't true?

684
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,320
That's fake news!

685
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,160
Nonsense.

686
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,060
Fake news, I tell you!

687
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,440
I'm talking about the legitimacy of invention itself.

688
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,820
For example,

689
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,520
Charlie Chan, Zorro, The Lone Ranger, Tarzan,

690
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,320
all fictional characters,

691
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,500
all coming from the 1920s.

692
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,680
They had a lot to do with forming people's attitudes.

693
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,420
Zorro is set in a historical period,

694
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,120
but it's utterly from...

695
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:50,900
the 20s.

696
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,080
Charlie Chan and his large family,

697
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,800
based on one Hawaiian policeman,

698
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,960
still did not actually exist.

699
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,060
And the others have an even more dubious provenance.

700
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,820
J.R. Bob Dobbs was dreamed up in the 20s.

701
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm not at liberty to say exactly when.

702
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,800
You mean just a little squirt in his father's eye,

703
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,920
or something like that?

704
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,380
That's right.

705
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,160
Hmm.

706
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,200
That wandering milkman.

707
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,100
They say the Fuller Brush Man...

708
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,880
was born in the, uh...

709
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,780
in those comics that were popular during the 20s, too.

710
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,960
The, uh, eight-pagers.

711
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,560
Ah, history.

712
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,580
History.

713
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,500
That's all fake.

714
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,600
That's all fake news.

715
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,440
There's no such thing as truth anymore.

716
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,620
We don't just write the news.

717
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,300
We make it.

718
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,420
Yes.

719
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,160
If you don't want it heard on subgenius news,

720
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,720
don't let it happen.

721
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,660
Oh, thank you.

722
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,900
Hey, are we gonna hear that?

723
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,180
That's fine.

724
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,180


725
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,180


726
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,180


727
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,180


728
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,420
That song again that you were singing

729
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,560
during my sound test yesterday?

730
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:55,580
Ock, Sput.

731
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,560
I left it back up at the ranch house.

732
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,140
Well, I mean, at some point...

733
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,700
Oh, yeah, sure.

734
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,480
And I have written other songs.

735
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,560
I'd be happy to record each and every one for you

736
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,060
in excruciating detail.

737
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,480
Yeah, I've got some songs.

738
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,460
Well, they may work better

739
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,060
when there's not guitar players

740
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,320
accompanying you who don't know the song.

741
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,740
They may, although it would be nice

742
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,200
to have a voice come in on the chorus

743
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,160
when there's a chorus.

744
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,700
But we shall see.

745
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,800
Well, you've got Princess Wee.

746
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,460
She's a good backup singer.

747
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:26,740
That's right.

748
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,400
She's a professional.

749
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,980
Right, Reverend Dr. Mother Miller

750
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,740
is quite capable of coming in on the chorus.

751
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,940
We've got a heavenly choir right there.

752
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,340
Just so.

753
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,200
Such is my hope.

754
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
So, we've got that.

755
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,420
So, that's a promise.

756
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,460
Yeah, we're gonna hold you to it, Dr. Howell.

757
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,880
We're gonna hold Bob's nose to the fire.

758
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,320
Sure.

759
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,920
I think there's gonna be

760
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,660
a burning tonight.

761
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,540
Of Bob?

762
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,680
No, of an icon.

763
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:54,920
Okay.

764
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,660
Who put that together?

765
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,580
Who had the energy?

766
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,500
Dr. Fox and Cosmack.

767
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,860
Oh, good for you.

768
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,240
My God, those guys.

769
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,820
Young, energetic fellows.

770
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,280
Right.

771
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,220
They seem to think it'll last forever.

772
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,700
No, they're out buying lumber right now.

773
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,400
They drew up plans.

774
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,360
Can you believe it?

775
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,820
They must be emergentiles.

776
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,440
They actually drew, measured a diagram

777
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,280
of the boards they were gonna need.

778
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:19,740
I thought,

779
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,040
what?

780
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,800
Perhaps they didn't see the weather report

781
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,220
that it's gonna get hotter and hotter and hotter

782
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,140
with intermittent rains and so forth.

783
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,340
Well, eventually it's gonna get hotter and hotter

784
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,060
and hotter until fire and lava are raining from the sky.

785
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,100
That was what the Lord said long time ago.

786
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,980
People are always saying,

787
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,260
well, you see, he put his rainbow in the sky

788
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,200
to show that there'll never be another flood.

789
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,380
Sure, there'll never be another flood,

790
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,740
but he didn't say nothing about the fire that's coming,

791
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,520
which is, which actually did,

792
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,440
he did mention it.

793
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,680
He did say that there would be intense heat.

794
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,480
The fire age, which we're rocketing toward.

795
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,140
Yeah, that's a forecast for 7-10, July 5th.

796
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,100
You know, at the end of the Permian era,

797
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,460
the great dying was produced by a rise in heat planet-wide

798
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,860
by just a few degrees.

799
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,340
Hey!

800
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,740
99% of all life died at that time.

801
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,100
Yeah.

802
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:19,820
But...

803
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,160
Yeah, there were no trilobites after that, were there?

804
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,700
Trailer bikes, chiggerbites, and mosquitoes

805
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,800
collided aimlessly in the dense gas.

806
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,160
Right, that's what I care.

807
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,360
Then came the sponges that sucked up 90% of all life.

808
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,920
No, the world was also desertified.

809
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,740
The plant forms were dying out.

810
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,040
And if it was just unbearably hot,

811
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,280
because heat generates more,

812
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,020
there are conditions that generate heat.

813
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,860
So this temperature gradient has to be watered.

814
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,840
Yeah, but in the 70s, this liberal guy,

815
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,040
they wrote this book, he said,

816
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,720
the whole world was going to just be frozen.

817
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,980
It was going to be global cooling.

818
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,200
That's what he said in the 70s.

819
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,360
That proves that the scientists don't know nothing.

820
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,200
Well, it should be.

821
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,180
You probably fall for that millions of years old thing.

822
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,460
It should be, because we were due for another ice age,

823
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,700
but we circumvented that plan.

824
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,540
We're wiping out this science crap.

825
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,540
We're just going to put an end to it.

826
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,660
It's just, it's inconvenient.

827
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,440
And it's slowing us down.

828
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,460
We got money to make.

829
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,760
It's just pointless.

830
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,680
Here in the Church of the Subgenius,

831
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
this science stuff is going to be outlawed.

832
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,980
With the forbidden sciences,

833
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,880
and since all science is forbidden,

834
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,640
now we deal with all science.

835
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,640
All science high.

836
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,660
Yes, all hail, all science high.

837
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,860
Yeah, now that we're not supposed to do it,

838
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,880
we're going to do it 10 times harder.

839
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,840
I was doing it anyway.

840
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,380
I had decided that I'd return to my childhood religion

841
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:49,680
as a junior scientist.

842
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,640
Yeah, weren't you a little scientist?

843
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,120
Me too.

844
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,360
A junior scientist.

845
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,720
We all had our laboratories and experiments.

846
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,740
I'm still just a junior scientist,

847
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,060
and I'm a clown junior scientist.

848
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,240
A clown scientist.

849
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,140
My cousin had to have hazardous materials people come

850
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,040
with his laboratory.

851
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,760
And after my brother died,

852
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,240
I had to call them to have him

853
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,260
haul some of the stuff away from his lab.

854
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,320
But it was, you know,

855
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,300
they won't turn you into the authorities.

856
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,280
They just want to get it.

857
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,060
And they thank you.

858
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,100
And so there's, that's that.

859
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,940
Well, here at X-Day,

860
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,800
we don't care about these worldly things.

861
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,800
Well, we could make infernal devices right here.

862
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,880
If we had the ingredients, I could, I remember.

863
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,340
You could make what?

864
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,380
Bad things that people don't like.

865
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,100
But I could make them in my lab, and I still could.

866
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,920
All I need is the ingredients.

867
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,560
Oh.

868
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,260
Well, what kind of bad things?

869
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
Oh, like amusing.

870
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,080
Dynamite?

871
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,700
No, amusing smoke bombs that create dense walls of smoke

872
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,020
when you throw them and things like that.

873
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,520
Stink bombs?

874
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,400
Yeah, you just add sulfur for that.

875
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,340
Wasp attractant?

876
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,020
No, you have that.

877
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,540
I don't know where it is, Dr. L.

878
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,580
It might be punctured.

879
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,460
Oh, that, maybe that's what happened to me.

880
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:18,240
One year, I remember he had, saying he had a...

881
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,240


882
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,620
a package of yellow jacket attractant,

883
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,360
and he was saying,

884
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,240
well, whatever we do, we're not going to bring this to X-Day.

885
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,040
You know, because pranksters just couldn't keep from using it.

886
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,600
And lo and behold, the next time I saw it, it was at X-Day.

887
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,260
Yep.

888
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,740
That's before...

889
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,380
Tell us a genius not to do so.

890
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,640
I got stung in the face by a wasp

891
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,440
that just seemed to bumble into my face and sting me as an afterthought.

892
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,300
Well, like I was telling you yesterday,

893
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,780
the insects are my friends,

894
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:55,120
and I've ended up with my face like two inches from crawling red hornet nests.

895
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,300
And a bee of beards.

896
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,980
I mean, a beard of bees.

897
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,380
My camera does super slow motion close-ups.

898
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,820
And they love it.

899
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,360
It's like, you slowly move in and don't go at them fast.

900
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,180
You can end up just buzzing right by your face.

901
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,680
They don't...

902
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,400
I don't smell as sweet as Dr. Howell, though.

903
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,560
Unfortunately.

904
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,700
That's one reason he's here.

905
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,060
He keeps the bugs off my arms.

906
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,640
The wisteria chigger and so forth.

907
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,640
Mm.

908
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,820
I got a tick in Arkansas without ever being in nature.

909
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:35,460
I was only in airports, cars, a hotel, and Sterno's house.

910
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,380
And when I got home, Princess Wee found a tick on my ear hiding up in here.

911
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,360
There was a tick crawling on me in the pond last year.

912
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,360
I just flicked it off.

913
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:54,220
But it's similar to the mysterious bed bug that Pete Goldie was bitten by in our studio at Radio Valencia back home.

914
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,940
Because it created quite a panic, you imagine.

915
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,680
And everything had to be fumigated.

916
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:06,380
But the odd thing is he came in and there was a bed bug on him which then bit him as he watched it.

917
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,420
As you know, bed bugs just don't do that.

918
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,680
That is...

919
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,820
They didn't used to.

920
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,260
But they've been emboldened by the Trump administration.

921
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:15,340
Ah.

922
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,960
That must be it.

923
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,400
Yes.

924
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:17,940
That's right.

925
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,480
The bullies are back.

926
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:34,660
See, they're supposed to creep on you at night and delicately scrape away some skin until the blood wells up and then sip delicately instead of marching around in the daylight where you're seen and killed, you know, and biting so you can feel it.

927
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,060
But nonetheless, that's what this crazy mixed up bed bug did.

928
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,600
Oh, they were encouraged to just walk up and grab you by the pussy.

929
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,800
Well, uh...

930
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,520
It's okay to say that now.

931
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,280
Yes, anyway.

932
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,060
But a year ago, God, you'd go to jail for saying that.

933
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,240
Now you have to say it.

934
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,620
Now it's part of American political discourse.

935
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,060
Right.

936
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,100
And that's not all that's out there.

937
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,320
Who was it?

938
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,760
Reverend Carter LeBlanc wrote me...

939
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,340
Shooting blanks again.

940
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:13,720
...said in a little message to me, he goes, I really appreciate how the Church of the Subgenius helped prepare me for the society we have now where political discourse is basically...

941
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,240
...flame wars. Internet flame wars.

942
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,040
Screams of abusive invective.

943
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:31,380
Yeah, we all....slack was full of...it was completely uncensorable. And of course, it was full of just absolute jerks being mean all the time.

944
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,620
And that prepared us.

945
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,280
And that's why scrubgenius was created.

946
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,220
Yeah, it was. And it's much, much nicer.

947
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,880
I keep having people...

948
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,700
There's that contingent that thinks that we're somehow in control.

949
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:43,700


950
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:52,800
...of encouraging sexism by allowing stupid jock dorks to post stuff occasionally on an uncontrolled Facebook page.

951
00:46:53,160 --> 00:47:00,800
And it's not uncontrolled. And actually, Reverend Eggplant or Dow Jones or even me, somebody comes along and usually takes down anything that's really stupid and shocking.

952
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,440
By the time I get there, it's already been taken down.

953
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:03,760
Right.

954
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:13,680
So I say, oop, surely nobody put that up. And I go there. And by the time my computer focuses its bleary screen on it, this post has been removed or could not be removed.

955
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:13,680


956
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:13,960
And so, on the next day, it's been gone.

957
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:13,960


958
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,020
Goddarn, I missed it. It must've been another bear picture...

959
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,740
Probably something like that...

960
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,200
A cute bear picture.

961
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:19,620
Yeah.

962
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,520
Which now somehow symbolizes the ultimate evil of all patriarchal white men.

963
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:32,960
Apparently it does. I didn't realize it was that detested or I would've stopped it down somewhat. But I never meant...it was never my joke anyway. It was somebody else's joke.

964
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,100
It wasn't a joke. It was a parable.

965
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,160
Do you need a third pair of headphones?

966
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,120
Yeah, we do need another headset. Oh, great. That would be really good.

967
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,620
Good. You got it.

968
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,680
I don't know what happened to my third one.

969
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,720
Your third nostril, your third pineal eye.

970
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,060
My third fist.

971
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,160
Up my third butt.

972
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,340
My third bun.

973
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:59,480
Speaking of third, did you know that whereas most of us are lucky just to be able to do number one and number two,

974
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,400
J.R. Bob Dobbs can do number three.

975
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,480
Oh, that's very disturbing.

976
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,820
It's beyond our understanding.

977
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:06,320
Yeah.

978
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:13,580
We know that he groans when he does it, and he has to have a special standing up ceramic thing in front of him.

979
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,880
A standing ovulation.

980
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:23,740
But yeah, Teeters Laverge actually was the one who brought us that information.

981
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,060
Is he here this year?

982
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,360
He should be showing up any minute.

983
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,100
A lot of people are going to come in tonight, I think.

984
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:30,920
Well, that's good.

985
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,580
We'll have a quorum, a consensus.

986
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,120
Dr. Legume is here.

987
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,220
Merry revelry.

988
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,120
But he's hiding.

989
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:38,260
Oh, yeah?

990
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:38,920
I guess.

991
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,680
You think he did come?

992
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,520
Is he here like Philo?

993
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,200
That is, he's here and then he's gone?

994
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:51,120
Maybe if he hears me say, I've got a bathtub full of pills and a big bag of froth for Dr. Legume,

995
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,740
maybe he'd come out of that trailer.

996
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,700
I can't guarantee.

997
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,480
A trailer, eh?

998
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,880
I'm just trying to lure him.

999
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,500
Yeah, he got the trailer.

1000
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,960
He's a heart patient like me.

1001
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,400
So we get special consideration.

1002
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,300
Is that full of...

1003
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,080
Chocolatels?

1004
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,900
Oh, Sharpies.

1005
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,700
I don't know which mail or thing I have, but you got them both.

1006
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,260
Yeah, all the old subgeniuses have stents.

1007
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,200
That's how you...

1008
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,700
Splendid.

1009
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,720
Yeah, you plug them in.

1010
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,200
All right.

1011
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,580
All right.

1012
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,140
Oh, look at that.

1013
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,640
Now we got even the right size adapter here.

1014
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,600
We're cooking with gas.

1015
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,300
You keep that.

1016
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:25,720
Thank you.

1017
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,260
And...

1018
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,500
Now we're going to be more techno capable than ever.

1019
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,920
This way, Reverend Mother Miller can hear the Esquivel.

1020
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,300
Oh, yeah.

1021
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:36,300


1022
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,360
Yes.

1023
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,040
Yes.

1024
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,360
Which will add immeasurably to the experience.

1025
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,920
But what about the...

1026
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,940
Well, it's not monster movie music this time.

1027
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,440
That's all right.

1028
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,620
It's a light...

1029
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,120
It's warm.

1030
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:48,720
It's a warm day.

1031
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,040
It's fine, yes.

1032
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,580
So we...

1033
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,680
I was trying to figure out how to turn that on.

1034
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,300
I started it warming up, I thought, and then I walked away and forgot.

1035
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,120
How about the...

1036
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,300
There's a disc in that little...

1037
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,460
There's a little machine that...

1038
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,500
I guess if you push play, it might...

1039
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,780
The few audience members, are they able to hear Esquivel's, Dalset musical signature?

1040
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,180
If I can hear it, anybody can hear it.

1041
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,220
That's true, Professor Calculus.

1042
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,140
It's definitely a thing.

1043
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,540
I can nose it up a little.

1044
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,820
Let us see.

1045
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,100
This is so much fun.

1046
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,120
Glad you thought of it.

1047
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,740
Art?

1048
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,280
The great subgenius of art.

1049
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,280


1050
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,280


1051
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:36,280


1052
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,840
The genius brother, Cleve Duncan...

1053
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,820
Yes?

1054
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,920
...composed music with the Esquivel in his final years, in Esquivel's final years.

1055
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:52,700
He was bound and he was in a bed, I think, but he was still...

1056
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,580
He was still composing.

1057
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,700
Yeah, he and brother Cleve actually did some stuff together.

1058
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,840
At one point, Dr. Howell, I got to see a stack of hand-labeled reel-to-reel tapes in boxes.

1059
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,060
It was Esquivel's old tapes.

1060
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,720
He let Cleve have them to copy and remaster and stuff like that.

1061
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:25,740
So, if subgenius gets obsessed enough with their mentors or their heroes, you never know,

1062
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,180
they might end up working with them.

1063
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,900
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is working with the surviving Firesign Theater.

1064
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,500
That's good.

1065
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,080
That's...

1066
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,620
That's...

1067
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,700
You never know.

1068
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,860
Maybe someday Ray Harryhausen won't be mad at me anymore.

1069
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,500
Oh, wait, he's dead.

1070
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,020
Well, he was really not mad at you for a long time.

1071
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,280
He probably doesn't remember, but you know the weird thing about Ray Harryhausen,

1072
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,240
the great special effects artist, he could know, he knew just by looking at a picture of Bob

1073
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,380
that it was a cult.

1074
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,020
I had a Bob t-shirt on.

1075
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:00,660
Well, that is interesting.

1076
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,600
Well, the word subgenius foundation in small letters, un-bubble.

1077
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:04,600


1078
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:04,720
Yeah.

1079
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,820
So, it was under Bob's head with copyright information.

1080
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,440
Harryhausen put two and two together and said, so is this a cult?

1081
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,860
I was trying to get him to say, this is Ray Harryhausen and you're listening to the Hour

1082
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,540
of Slak.

1083
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,220
That was all I wanted, but he said, I just don't do, I don't know what it is.

1084
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,660
I don't do endorsements for things I don't know.

1085
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,140
Well, that's fair enough.

1086
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,700
In your bathroom.

1087
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:29,960
But I bothered him.

1088
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,740
I came back and tried to get him.

1089
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,340
I tried to convince him again.

1090
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,360
And what happened?

1091
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,580
He didn't answer.

1092
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,000
What happened then?

1093
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,600
Then he got kind of fed up.

1094
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:36,920
Oh.

1095
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,040
And his handler, the guy helping him out at this fantasy fair.

1096
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,480
Yeah.

1097
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,400
Said, I'll explain later, Ray.

1098
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,920
You've got to watch out for these trolls.

1099
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,440
They're such genius guys.

1100
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:54,820
There's ones in the Acre mansion to keep you from going too far into Flory's shrines.

1101
00:52:54,860 --> 00:53:00,420
But in your bathroom, you have that plastic Tyrannosaurus Rex behind the toilet.

1102
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,820
You know what I'm talking about?

1103
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,500
Yeah, sure do.

1104
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,400
That was sculpted by Arthur Hayward.

1105
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:04,560
Yeah.

1106
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,620
He was the director for the British Museum.

1107
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,580
The whole Invicta dinosaur series was.

1108
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,040
Arthur Hayward worked with Harryhausen.

1109
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:20,880
He sculpted some of the mysterious island things, the one million years BC dinosaurs.

1110
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,060
He and Harryhausen together worked on them.

1111
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:25,640
Wow.

1112
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,400
Hayward kept Harryhausen paleontologically correct.

1113
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,420
So there was a...

1114
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,560
Then Hayward published a book of his.

1115
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Of his own about prehistoric animals where he showed some modified Harryhausen-esque creatures.

1116
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,520
And Harryhausen himself felt like it was a betrayal, a personal betrayal.

1117
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,800
So they were estranged for a time.

1118
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,940
But they eventually made up because you see, Harryhausen never was mad at anyone for long.

1119
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,160
They did make up and they were happy to make up and be friends again.

1120
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:01,940
Okay.

1121
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:11,320
As for not caring for cults, when Ray and Diana Harryhausen were house hunting, they

1122
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,840
were shown a really nice place with a tower, a sort of medieval, pleasant looking.

1123
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,380
They could get it for a song.

1124
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,260
But they felt very uncomfortable and at ease there and didn't even want to sleep in the

1125
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:24,520
place.

1126
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:30,840
And finally, they got the real estate agent to admit that this was owned by Aleister Crowley.

1127
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,880
And...

1128
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,420
Nobody really wanted to stay in it for some reason.

1129
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,280
Oh, give me a break.

1130
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,220
Rock stars would pay extra for that.

1131
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,660
They had trouble getting anybody to...

1132
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,700
Didn't Jimmy Page live in Aleister Crowley's house?

1133
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,980
Maybe he did get it instead of Ray and Diana Harryhausen, possibly.

1134
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,200
Well, Ray was obviously interested in UFOs early on.

1135
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,640
He was interested in...

1136
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,860
The first flying saucer maybe, pretty much.

1137
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,100
Fate, destiny, predestination, things like that.

1138
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,740
Oh, see, he was in a cult himself.

1139
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,260
Yes.

1140
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,200
Some kind of crazy new age freethinker guy.

1141
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:13,460
The idea that every movement was preordained from the beginning of time.

1142
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,080
Okay.

1143
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,480
Well, prove it's not.

1144
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,240
Prove it's not.

1145
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,320
See, that was ordained too.

1146
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,140
That's proof.

1147
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:23,940
The Persian mystics thought so.

1148
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,860
The Sufis thought so.

1149
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,000
Omar Khayyam, the astronomer poet of ancient Persia.

1150
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,700
The Sufis thought so.

1151
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1152
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,000
But then there's no wiggle room.

1153
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,020
He was telling us that the world is going to end any minute.

1154
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:43,360
If you believe that, you can't escape your fate, you see.

1155
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,000
Wouldn't it be better if there was some escape clause?

1156
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,680
Some way you could get out of it?

1157
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,980
That's the problem with all such rigid system.

1158
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,780
And what if our universe is rigidly determined?

1159
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:01,840
It's not the only universe around.

1160
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,960
Well, so they say.

1161
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,000
That's what they say.

1162
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,400
I'm supposed to take some egghead's word for it.

1163
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,600
Well, they also...

1164
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,320
Why don't you spray me with some quantum foam, and if I go back in time or turn into a giant monster, then I'll believe it.

1165
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,200
They're trying to wriggle out of it too.

1166
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,120
You see, you've got to give them credit.

1167
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,140
They're trying to escape this plan.

1168
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,560
Oh, yes, thank you very much.

1169
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,220
Certainly.

1170
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:26,820
Ah.

1171
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,700
Reverend Dr. Mother Miller.

1172
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,020
Reverend Dr. Mother Miller is bringing me some revivifying ice.

1173
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,320
Little does she know, she'll have to pay 25 cents for a cup.

1174
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:47,300
Yes, at the subgenius rockathon, young people are dancing up a storm here.

1175
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,840
Oh, look at them frug.

1176
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,200
It's been years since I've seen people doing the frug.

1177
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:53,720
The Madison...

1178
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,320
Oh, and there's some other ones doing the frog.

1179
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,080
They're frugging and frugging.

1180
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,140
That is amazing.

1181
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,560
It's like we've crossed many boundaries.

1182
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,280
It's like X-Day is like a time machine.

1183
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,240
Just so.

1184
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,420
Speaking of time machines, there's something I...

1185
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:14,060
I've only read one sci-fi book that pointed out this particular problem of time travel.

1186
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,800
And that is?

1187
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,480
Our...

1188
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,020
That you get left in the middle of space?

1189
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,160
The minute you shift in time, yeah, you end up in your...

1190
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,040
As soon as you stop traveling through time, you will be in the middle of outer space.

1191
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:25,860
Clark Ashton...

1192
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,260
Smith also wrote stories in that vein.

1193
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,120
But...

1194
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,000
He did, good.

1195
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,720
Because H.G. Wells just kind of glossed over it.

1196
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,420
I know he thought about it.

1197
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,540
I think H.G. Wells is correct.

1198
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,860
Well, that would wreck the story.

1199
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:47,440
I think it's a matter of relativity that you do stay in an approximation of the locus.

1200
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,720
Because otherwise...

1201
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,300
So gravity affects you throughout time traveling?

1202
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,480
Time travel is...

1203
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,760
It would be an epiphenomenon of gravity.

1204
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:04,080
Even the time machines that they figured out how to build now couldn't be built on planet

1205
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,180
Earth and require massive gravitational objects and so forth.

1206
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:16,600
You've read about those, the huge rotating gravity heavy structures that's supposed to...

1207
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,440
How do you think I got here, past man?

1208
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,360
Oh, you just...

1209
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:24,460
I'm sorry.

1210
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,460


1211
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,460


1212
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,620
I'm sorry.

1213
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,200
You're not gonna slow down, are you?

1214
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,220
Let the future speed up and fizz around you?

1215
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:37,520
Well, I read one sci-fi book that they managed to send a man back in time in as much as his

1216
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:44,120
mind was encoded and sent back in time, using titanic energies.

1217
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,460
They were fairly...

1218
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,720
And it was gonna be implanted in the head of an Aztec king, because they knew that this

1219
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,160
Aztec king was gonna be at a certain place at a certain time, but they had to figure

1220
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:03,460
out where the planet had been astronomically in order to beam this consciousness there.

1221
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,040
And of course, unfortunately, it misses the king and hits the medicine man, the guy who's

1222
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,760
about to be sacrificed and thrown down the pyramid stairs.

1223
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,740
And hilarity ensues.

1224
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:19,480
Naturally.
