1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,780
Time for Pastor David Epley, your Good Shepherd prayer partner and your personal friend.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,660
In the next 13 or 14 minutes, something good, good, good is coming your way.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,580
So don't leave this radio station. Let's have a good time together.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,680
He is all I need.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,140
He's all I need.

6
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,660
Ah, yes.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,680
Ah, yes.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,760
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAT.

9
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:58,140
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ and since I've been listening to it.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,120
End of subgenius.

11
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,140
The very, the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,140
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

13
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,040
In this temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock.

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:21,820
And before we begin this sacred spouting, I think that we should all bow our heads and let's all have a minute of noise.

15
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,600
Ah!

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,260
Ah!

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,720
Ah!

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,340
Ah!

19
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:25,840


20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,360
Ah!

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,840
Ah!

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,160
Ah!

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,180
Ah!

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,260
Ah!

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:27,280
Ah!

26
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,600
Ah!

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:27,620
Ah!

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,680
Ah!

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:27,900
Ah!

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,280


31
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,380
Ah!

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,880
Ah!

33
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


39
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,100


43
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,760
Ah!

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,600


45
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,180
Ah!

46
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:42,460


47
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,580


48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,300
Ah!

49
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,740
Ah!

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,340
Ah!

51
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,640
Ah!

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,740
Ah!

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,280
Ah!

54
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,500

oh wait you're not a man at all you're a now let's just see you drop them pains

65

66
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:11,980
thank you it's all right i said i one time seen a sissy tortured by the cheyenne he never screamed

67
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:19,760

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:19,820
screened out for his own good and he was a sissy but he was a sissy but he never cried out he was a

69
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,700
strong man that sissy was he had taken the sun dance he had had done the sundance ritual and he

70
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,280
had had his breast impaled with the tusk of a dog and in the after hours he enjoyed a martini

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,920
and perhaps whipping up some lettuce and throwing at its children little big sissy

72
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,560
ah big little sissy good evening i'm adela arakawa i'm jim benjamin

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,780
nine news reporter ginger delgado has meth labs like that fellow yes jim

74
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,180
It's a job that is so dangerous, it could eventually explode, cause fires, or worse, cause life.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,660
And because of that, he has decided to share his cancer.

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,780
He will not reveal Bob since he was 12, since 17.

77
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,660
I'd like to have an impression first introduced to me.

78
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,120
Really, but...

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,120
Why?

80
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,700
Because I'm brown, no more.

81
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,900
Today, Bob is dying of his teeth.

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,960
In short, an explosion has ruined his life.

83
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,960
He now says the quick high he got was worth it.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
You know, it's fun for a minute.

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,460
No one should see.

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,720
He wants to keep making the same fatal mistake.

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,520
And his meth lab's growing at an alarming rate.

88
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,360
Authorities in 31 drug labs.

89
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,760
The next year, this year.

90
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,220
Authorities say this year.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,660
Then last year, here in Colorado.

92
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,680
Uh, yes, dear friends.

93
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,040
News of Bob's cancer, cut up by Fernanda Nandeli-Murr.

94
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,880
Preceded by some of the new remastering of our old collage album,

95
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Meetings.

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,760
Media Barrage No. 5.

97
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,680
The old school sub-tape.

98
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,460
By puzzling evidence.

99
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Byron Werner.

100
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,300
Yours truly.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:58,980
Lies.

102
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,900
Glass Madness.

103
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,980
Doctors for Bob.

104
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,920
Dr. Philodrummon.

105
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,520
And G. Gordon Gordon.

106
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,620
With more coming up.

107
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,100
Friends, I've finished recutting Media Barrage 5.

108
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,720
And this show, this hour of slack number 849,

109
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,800
will be a mix-up of the last third of that show.

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,640
With miscellaneous new or newish stuff that has also accumulated.

111
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:32,360
We'll even be hearing from subgeni who foreswore Bob and forsook the church.

112
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,280
Such as the subgenius-hating Reverend Buck Naked.

113
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,740
And even the original pre-non-fame Saint Janer Hyperclete.

114
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560
The prototypical subgenius saint.

115
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,220
We're pretty sure he's a psychopath.

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,180
Now, how do we spot him?

117
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,540
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

118
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,120
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

119
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,140
From 11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men.

120
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,980
Yeah, they all look perfectly normal.

121
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,100
I keep telling y'all, this is a sick and perverted nation.

122
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,640
All tired.

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,920
Nobody wants to listen to me.

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,660
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

125
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,380
Nobody.

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,620
I try to tell everybody what's going on, they won't listen to me.

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,820
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

128
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,360
Bob.

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,160
Bob.

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,920
Bob.

131
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,360
Bob.

132
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,280
Bob.

133
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,040
Bob, take care of me.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,540
Bob.

135
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,760
Just do away with it.

136
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,400
Especially after all, I don't want them anymore.

137
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,500
They hold a Ronald and Lucien in my mind after all.

138
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,880
They don't love you, Bob.

139
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,320
They don't love you like I do.

140
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,020
Do the run.

141
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,340
Maybe a kid's mother or maybe a little Elia.

142
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Do you want a job?

143
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,500
If we couldn't bring you down to the dead end,

144
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,900
maybe at least three of us could make the world fearless over all these things.

145
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,460
Yeah, I guess.

146
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,220
just the dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture that expires all around you in pools

147
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:33,500
of its own wastes. It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu. It's not just the child zombies

148
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,540
that murder their mediocrity parents and then cruise the streets with bloody feet. It's

149
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,260
not just those starry old vics on the park benches with looks on their faces like those

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:52,400
who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz. It's not just the anesthesiologist

151
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,440
for Negi. It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

152
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,920
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan. It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,720
and human excrement on your car hood. It's not just that the old ways were best.

154
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,980
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression. It's

155
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,920
not just the killer shit ganja from the dark side of the bush. It's not just the pinoid

156
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:36,040
snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop. It's not just the widescreen technicolor

157
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,440
corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet. It's not just Mongo in the

158
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,240
Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of bastards. It's not just the coming of age culture that

159
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,240


160
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,240


161
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,240


162
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,300
basketballs. It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness. It's not

163
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,200
just the indignity of having to work for some bland nun entity son of a bitch who thinks

164
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,280
workers are property. It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil. It's not just

165
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,440
the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is

166
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,920
an open-ditch latrine in midsummer. It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a shit-eating

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,600
I-know-more-than-you-do dog grin all over his homogenized face. It's not just the horrible

168
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,200
feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

169
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,600
It's not just the doorway to doom. It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really

170
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,360
going on. It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta.

171
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,380
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that. Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum-show.

172
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,820
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition. He's the

173
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,700
grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it. Shout salvation and fightin' Jesus, you'll

174
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,920
need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob. No,

175
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,120
he's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

176
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,060
In his back pocket.

177
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
Just you try it.

178
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,840
Bob is a clump of mud.

179
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,920
Bob is a tape recorder.

180
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,720
Bob is things that don't always run.

181
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,620
Bob is masking tape.

182
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,460
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

183
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,280
Bob is a rooster.

184
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,060
And Bob is a hen.

185
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,520
Two by one.

186
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,000
.

187
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,140
.

188
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,520
.

189
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,520


190
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,600
.

191
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,600


192
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,600


193
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:50,600


194
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .…

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,660
It's overactive like it's supposed to be.

196
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,580
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.

197
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,480
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.

198
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,160
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability.

199
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,980
Men of vision, men such as you, Doctor, gathered here, exchanging information daily,

200
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,500
putting aside all thoughts of personal success.

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,400
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.

202
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,620
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.

203
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,500
Well, there you have it.

204
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,060
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

205
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,000
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women,

206
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,220
and as such, we can accomplish wonders.

207
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Back any other church! Back any other church!

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
The Church of the Subgenius! The Church of the Subgenius!

209
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,900
The Church of the Subgenius!

210
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,800
Divine rules! Divine orders!

211
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,760
First rule of the Subgenius!

212
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,180
First rule of the Subgenius!

213
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,600
Too much!

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,120
Too much!

215
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,880
It's always better than not enough!

216
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,440
It's always better than not enough!

217
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,920
Can I get her too much?

218
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,260
Can I get her too much?

219
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,760
Why is it always better than?

220
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,220
Why is it always better than?

221
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,520
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

222
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:43,440
Bob? Bob? Bob?

223
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:43,960
Bob?

224
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,380
Why is it always better than not enough?

225
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,600
Bob.

226
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,060
But let's leave things of this world behind,

227
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,160
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,680
Bob.

229
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,220
Bob.

230
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,480
Bob.

231
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,780
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart.

232
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,160
But what the devil uses to do it with is 9 to 5 jobs!

233
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,760
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations where mommy and daddy get up in the morning and go to work,

234
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,220
and they kiss the kids goodbye.

235
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,900
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye.

236
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,740
Kind of a simultaneous goodbye and hello.

237
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Then they get home about 7 o'clock, ticked off to use the polite term,

238
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
after a long drive back out to the suburbs.

239
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,400
They get home, they kiss their kids hello, and goodnight.

240
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
And they go to bed.

241
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,620
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family is cause the kids see a little tittering stupid sexy gags on television.

242
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,720
Or cause the new permissiveness where men are allowed to do things with other men.

243
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,820
That's a bunch of holy hooey I say, my friend.

244
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,880
I say, why not legalize pornography and ban work?

245
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,180
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

246
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,040
Most of these kids these days grow up, they don't have parents, they got some kind of robot scarecrows.

247
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,780
And uh...

248
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,780
Oh friend, let there be slack.

249
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,560
Great unwashed!

250
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,680
The hoi polloi!

251
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,640
Venom!

252
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,800
The conspiracy!

253
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,640
The mediocretans!

254
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,020
The bootlifts!

255
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,660
The sames!

256
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,540
The conformers!

257
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,860
Mall people!

258
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,100
Bankers, wankers, and blankers!

259
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
Hireers and smilers!

260
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,760
Credit heads!

261
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,900
And the slackless ones!

262
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,680
In short, the remnants of man.

263
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,060
The witless principals who are the false prophets.

264
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,060
I'll get us a contract we'll never forget.

265
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,840
One thing, one thing, guys.

266
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,720
I know that Bob, I know that Bob is a good cause.

267
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,400
Bob took me inside his heart.

268
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,380
And I know that Bob is a good cause.

269
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,320
And I accepted him into my life.

270
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,400
And I'm here to testify, friends, what that man has done for me.

271
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,500
If you can really call him a man.

272
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,380
Many people say he's almost like a god.

273
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,460
I don't think so.

274
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,100
Of course I don't know Bob, but I do know Bob in certain ways.

275
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,720
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

276
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,600
Yes, Bob.

277
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,200
He filled me with the sort of the spirit I never knew I had.

278
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,780
I knew it wasn't coming from him.

279
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,840
It was coming from inside me.

280
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,620
Bob was giving it to me.

281
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,180
He was laying hands on me from afar.

282
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,260
He might have been up in that great big jet plane.

283
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,540
Or he might have been down on Skid Row giving some bum a haircut.

284
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,780
But all I know is...

285
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,560
It was Bob.

286
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,900
It was Bob.

287
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,460
Bob.

288
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,280
Yeah, he's smiling.

289
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,500
You never see Bob frown.

290
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,220
You know that behind that amazing smile there lies a mind like a steel trap.

291
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,340
I'm sure he makes mistakes like what he did with those young women that time.

292
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,420
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

293
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,300
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

294
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,160
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

295
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,140
In our lives.

296
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,540
In 1981.

297
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,700
And in 1984.

298
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,720
Hi little brother.

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,100
And in 1991.

300
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,100
And in 1995.

301
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,540
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

302
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:12,360
And in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.

303
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,460
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.

304
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:22,800
And we'll go and join the exes from God only knows what strange planet they come from.

305
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,080
If they really even come from a planet at all.

306
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,080


307
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,080


308
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,700
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.

309
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:39,560
Lighting our lives with the technology and the spirituality and the mentality of Planet X.

310
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,000
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,680
And see that there's a place for us in the world.

312
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,200
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob or the left hand of Bob.

313
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,060
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.

314
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,160
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

315
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,200
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

316
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,040
And it's Bob.

317
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,280
Bob.

318
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,720
Bob.

319
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,420
Yeah I can hear him.

320
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,680
I can hear him talking off there in the distance.

321
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,100
Doug's right Virgil.

322
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,780
We are different.

323
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,260
Soon everyone will be a superior bio species.

324
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,120
Even Doug Smith.

325
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,500
It's the good news son.

326
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,040
I'm not going to lie.

327
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,260
I'm going to tell you something.

328
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,400
Now I ask dear friends those are the things I want to tell you about today.

329
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,300
The very many things.

330
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,880
The things that Bob knows.

331
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,580
The things that you know and when you know.

332
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,300
That you know it.

333
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,640
Because everybody does have that gland.

334
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
That mystical Bob gland in their feet.

335
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,080
That one that tells them what to do if they don't even think with it.

336
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,400
But somewhere along in the past.

337
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,140
Man got confused.

338
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,080
And decided to start thinking with his brain.

339
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,060
And when that happened.

340
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,960
Oh, dear friends, that was a very sad time in the history of man.

341
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,620
Because when man stands on his brain and thinks with his feet,

342
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,180
then he'll know exactly which way to go and how to find Bob.

343
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,500
You've got to massage that foot gland.

344
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,680
And the only way to massage it is to walk on it.

345
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,520
Yes, sir.

346
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,760
Ha, ha, dear friends.

347
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,340
You've got to walk on the foot glands for Bob.

348
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,920
Because when you're walking and Bob's talking,

349
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,840
then you'll know all you need to know about what to do after the Holocaust.

350
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,560
After the aliens come and take us and give us all them giant pills

351
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,300
and all them fantastic machines that are supposed to run our lives

352
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,640
and that big white stone that everybody's going to know personally in their very own home.

353
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,720
Ah, yes, dear friends, that stone, that's the stone.

354
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,260
That's the stone that you think you might know

355
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,900
and you think you might know.

356
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:50,900


357
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,740
And you think it might help you.

358
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,140
But by God's dear friends, that's the stone that's going to ruin your very life.

359
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,980
That's the stone that's going to make you think that Niggy is on your side this time.

360
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,860
Because that stone is going to rule all things.

361
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,560
You think you know who Big Brother is?

362
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

363
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,680
Dear friends, I want to tell you tonight, you don't know.

364
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,520
You don't know nothing.

365
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,800
I know.

366
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,340
And...

367
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,840
Among other things, Bog,

368
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm doing pretty well with those pills you sent.

369
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,920
Pretty well.

370
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,200
But...

371
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,600
But I can always use more.

372
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:45,140
And it's because of Ohio and red trucks and they're all gone, Bog.

373
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,720
But that's okay.

374
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,000
I know.

375
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,400
I know.

376
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,460
Because, ah, it has nothing to do with us.

377
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:53,460


378
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,420
And I want to

379
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,460
Thank you.

380
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,860
I want to thank theies in this community and our family and our community is not talking

396
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,940
System just exactly 180 degrees opposite from God's system. God says

397
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,020
Believing is seeing

415
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,380
For you

416
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,620
So

Don't kill me

422
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,420
Who are those human rights throughout the track area?

423
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:03,280
Those that's the team from Dallas Doug. There's big guys there in the jerseys. Yes. Yeah, you acts on me. Oh, I see. Yes

424
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,440
They seem to be getting cream because they say

425
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,260
There's a funeral. There's the church bells singling the toll of the dead for this portion

426
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,180
of today's feature entertainment game. Oh, I see and who is this young man scenes awful songs

427
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:35,220
Looking around this town for Bob Dobbs looking around the sky

428
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,680
Been so out of luck and money

429
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,560
I've been waiting to die

430
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:51,880
Looking around this town for Bob Dobbs hoping he'll help me out

431
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:59,940
I've been down in confused. So long now I just wanna shout

432
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,300
Bob Dobbs

433
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,700
Bob Dobbs

434
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,660
Bob Dobbs

435
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


436
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


437
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


438
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


439
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


440
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


441
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


442
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


443
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


444
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


445
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


446
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:10,660


447
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,840
Bob! Where are you Bob-Dog?

448
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:24,640
We were at the Hall High School library today and we put lots of subgenius literature in all of the books.

449
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,440
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

450
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,080
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya.

451
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,720
Bob can save me, but will he?

452
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,640
Well, don't count on it, Buck.

453
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,460
It's Bob.

454
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,380
But, right, you know, we can sit here and talk about it.

455
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,500
You know, it's here, it's Bob.

456
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,980
That's why you need to send us money.

457
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,300
Here at the 17th Church.

458
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,900
Bob, he can work miracles in your life, he can bring us in the running.

459
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,580
He can make a mission. Love, Pete.

460
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,560
Hi.

461
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,620
I've been crying and singing and praying for Bob-Dogs, hoping he'll lend me a hand.

462
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,540
I've been down, confused and broke for so long I can barely stand.

463
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,420
I'm screaming, Bob-Dogs!

464
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,600
I'm screaming, Bob-Dogs!

465
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
Help me out, old Bob-Dog!

466
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,180
Hear me shout out, Bob-Dogs!

467
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,300
Help me out, old Bob-Dog!

468
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,600
Bob-Dogs!

469
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,040
There were like long lines of people like weeping and glistening in the rain.

470
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,560
That's because they were carving onions!

471
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
That's because their sores were opening!

472
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,380
That's the way we want our third nostrils to open.

473
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,480
We want everyone's pores and their nervous glands to open simultaneously.

474
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,580
Yes, I know.

475
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,200
Okay, can you get with it, baby?

476
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,980
I'm getting with it now.

477
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,140
Okay, it's like a rhythmic thing. It's not a melodic thing. It's not a tonal thing.

478
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,540
Okay, I'm sinking up right now.

479
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,300
Okay, sink in because it's gonna flatten your cracky, woman.

480
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,900
And it's gonna make you dance like you've never, well, I don't know if you've never danced before.

481
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,960
But you're gonna dance all over Stang's tail.

482
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,820
You're gonna pull his neck off.

483
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,740
You're gonna... I forgot what you were gonna do after that.

484
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,980
Well, I'll just wing it. How's that?

485
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,640
Yeah.

486
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,340
Um...

487
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,720
I feel that it's, uh...

488
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
People like me are not represented. I'm very disturbed by...

489
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
You are very disturbed and I'm gonna recommend that you get some help for your problem.

490
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,420
You are very disturbed.

491
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,920
Like that, you bitch!

492
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,400
You're very disturbed.

493
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,420
You're disturbed too, you bitch!

494
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,260
How dare you trick me like that!

495
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,200
All right. Now go ahead and say what you want to say about drugs.

496
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,980
What are you gonna do, everyone? I say you're gonna play these cheap little tricks.

497
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,520
Well, ma'am, it's not a cheap trick. Everyone listening to you knows you're very disturbed.

498
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,100
How do you know? You ain't the one who's about me. You're very disturbed.

499
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,480
Well, ma'am, all I know about you is that you sit here and you scream all these epithets and you're...

500
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,420
You get way out. You must be on something yourself.

501
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:26,500
I started to talk and you said talk and the minute I said I'm disturbed about something...

502
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,160
Well, ma'am, go ahead and tell me what you want to say about drugs.

503
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Drugs.

504
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,640
What did you want to say about drugs?

505
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,820
You're not gonna write me.

506
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,360
Ma'am, you've called me every name under the book and you're still on the air.

507
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,840
I didn't call you every name.

508
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,020
Well, just about.

509
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,760
Well, you've been doing the same to me.

510
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,620
I have not at all, ma'am. Go right ahead and say what you want to say about drugs.

511
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,860
I'm disturbed about...

512
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,480
You certainly are.

513
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,200
Me.

514
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,320
Can I say anything? You're gonna... Every time I say I'm disturbed, you're gonna say you certainly are.

515
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,020
Well, go right ahead and tell me what you want to say about drugs.

516
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,100
How can I? There's tremendous resistance up against...

517
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,860
No, ma'am. Go right ahead. I haven't resisted anything you've said thus far. You're still on the air.

518
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
You're playing games. Yeah, I'm on the air and I...

519
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,460
Well, that's true. And so go right ahead and tell me what you want to say about drugs.

520
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,740
I have to keep fighting with you and you're not giving me an instant to say what I want to plan to say.

521
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,320
Well, ma'am, if what you've said is not something that you plan to say, then I feel sorry for you. You really need help.

522
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,980
You need help too, you son of a bitch. You want to be kicked off the air.

523
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,760
All right, fine. Now that you've gotten that out of your system, tell me what you want to say about drugs.

524
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,600
I mean...

525
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,340
All right, what do you want to say about drugs?

526
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,560
I'm very disturbed.

527
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,360
Mm-hmm.

528
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:56,220
Oh, thank God. I'm very disturbed by the fact that people like me are not included in all the statistics.

529
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,080
And who's a person like you?

530
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,500
Someone who gets on and calls people names and cusses at them? Is that the kind of person you are?

531
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,380
I've done it. You've cut me off many times. This is the first time.

532
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,360
Well, is... What do you mean? Is that the type of person you are? Is that...

533
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,860
I don't have control.

534
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,860
Well, you're damn right you don't have control. You don't have control of your faculties. You don't have control of your senses.

535
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,600
Nor do you.

536
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,940
And ma'am, what you need to do is go out and get some help.

537
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,640
But at least I gave you an opportunity and all you did was cuss and swear and carry on.

538
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,420
I feel sorry for you.

539
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,420
But go out and get some help. Call Carla Perez. Perhaps Carla is expert enough to give you some help.

540
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,780
What?

541
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,720
Serpent fruit trees garden fruit tree mist guarding serpent woman dated eyes

542
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,260
God good evil woman tree food eyes tree fruit husband eyes pig leaves aprons

543
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,180
Hey Carl, yeah Graver look at Barry back there

544
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,960
He's playing those drums like a crazy man tonight

545
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,380
Yeah

546
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,640
Yeah for that he will surely burn in hell

547
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,200
Hey Graver that guitar sure sounds great

548
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,360
Yeah thanks Carl I carved it from our old back door

549
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,760
Those knobs are kind of shiny though

550
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,320
Yeah don't tell the person

551
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,040
Okay

552
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,400
Out in the field for 40 days

553
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,460
Plowing and planting and raking the hay

554
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,180
My mule Ezra is pulling the plow

555
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,060
I got him from Carl for some eggs and a cow

556
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,600
I work all day out in the sun

557
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,240
But after the meal we start to have some fun I say

558
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,300
Come on Greta and light the lamps

559
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,160
We're making lots of noise but we don't got no amp

560
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,040
We are an Amish band

561
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,360
We are an Amish band

562
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:58,360


563
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,740
We are an Amish band

564
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,620
They help you build a barn

565
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,420
Features don't give a darn

566
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,240
We are an Amish band

567
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:18,360
You know it's cause I'm too lazy to get out of bed and actually go to the living room

568
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,960
and use my regular phone

569
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh okay you're on the cell phone huh

570
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,300
Yeah cause I'm too lazy

571
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,180
Wow that's cool

572
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,220
All America is on a cell phone because it's too lazy

573
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,340
That laziness I think is a problem

574
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,800
is very, very...

575
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,680
Cell phones have changed everything.

576
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,400
It's kind of provocative.

577
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,840
You know, slackers are attracted

578
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,320
to that level of laziness.

579
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,860
Something weird happened.

580
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,300
Not that I'm a slacker.

581
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,340
Beyond the show.

582
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,340
I actually...

583
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,320
I'm flossing just for you.

584
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,300
What's that?

585
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,300
I'm flossing just for you.

586
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,940
She's flossing just for you.

587
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,480
Well, I'm really just a slack abuser.

588
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,360
It's really nice.

589
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,440
I'm not a slacker per se.

590
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,960
It's just that when I find slack,

591
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,840
I try to use it to its fullest extent.

592
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,560
I just want to tell her

593
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,200
when she turns her suit toward the...

594
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,060
When you turn your suit

595
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,160
toward the command center,

596
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,820
the signal comes in better.

597
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,600
Yeah.

598
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,280
That's what it is.

599
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,720
You're lying on your back.

600
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,940
You should be on your side.

601
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,100
Then you can look out

602
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,780
over the top of the cockpit

603
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,080
and see the Earth below us.

604
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,100
How do you guys know these things?

605
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,100
Because we're right up above you.

606
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,980
High above Berkeley.

607
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Because we're on the Internet, you know,

608
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,920
and you can find anybody on the Internet.

609
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,640
And folks, remember,

610
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,540
we are going to find the end of the Internet

611
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,260
on this show.

612
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,720
I looked for like four hours.

613
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,480
Yeah.

614
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,500
To try to find the show?

615
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,900
She was looking for the end of the Internet

616
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,960
for four hours.

617
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,740
Imagine that.

618
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,120
She used up four hours of her life.

619
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,940
She'll never get back.

620
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,880
Oh, you were looking for the website

621
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,780
that you can download the show from?

622
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,280
Yeah.

623
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,400
Oh, that was...

624
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,200
Okay, you ready again?

625
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,000
Mm-hmm.

626
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,700
All right.

627
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,100
It's matrix.csustan.

628
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,500
dot edu

629
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,380
forward slash

630
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,120

00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,340
n-e-g-a-t-i-v

632
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,340
without the e.

633
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,900
If you go there,

634
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,280
you should be able to find

635
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,780
quite a few of the

636
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,440
more recent shows.

637
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,480
And Don's shows are there, too.

638
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,380
Over the Edge.

639
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,000
Much to his chagrin,

640
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,840
but don't tell him

641
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,820
because he doesn't like that.

642
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,720
Well, when you tell him,

643
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,600
just say comma

644
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,980
and their mp3 file.

645
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,300
Don't tell Don.

646
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:27,700
Remember...

647
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,320
Sometimes you're not

648
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,060
in the best of shape.

649
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,460
Yeah.

650
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,600
You know, so he's kind of

651
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,120
a perfectionist and stuff.

652
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,440
Does it have a www

653
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,960
in front of matrix?

654
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,840
No.

655
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,160
It's just http

656
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,020
colon

657
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,100
forward slash

658
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,800

661
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,660

664
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,900

n-e-g-a-t-i-v

667
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,480
I wonder when they're going to make

668
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
this flash, hopefully.

669
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,620
Well, I mean,

670
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,060
they already have

671
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,260
aliases that you can,

672
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,340
you know,

673
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,520
obtain through various

674
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,960
commercial

675
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,080
methodologies.

676
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,200
Puzzling evidence,

677
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,360
Dr. Philo Drummond,

678
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,060
who's also heard in the background here.

679
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,040
The Swingin' Love Corpses

680
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,880
did this music

681
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,160
and the music heard earlier

682
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,040
in the background.

683
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,540
And Dr.

684
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,820
Albert from KPFA

685
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,580
Berkeley.

686
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,280
We heard a bunch of clips

687
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,960
for movies that were posted

688
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,580
by New Monet

689
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,440
and Tesla Coil

690
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,060
and probably other members

691
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,960
of alt.binaries.slack

692
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,900
that I can't remember.

693
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,860
That drugs,

694
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,940
the cut-up drugs thing

695
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,720
was from the National Cynical Network,

696
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,960
nationalcynical.com

697
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,640
and the Amish band thing

698
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,600
was from the Electric Amish.

699
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,620
That's a good thing.

700
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,040
That's a good thing.

701
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,040


702
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,040


703
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,040
That's electricamish.com.

704
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,400
I don't know who did

705
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,100
the peanut butter and jelly thing.

706
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,340
Hello, Paul.

707
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,180
Welcome to the End Times.

708
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,180
In today's End Time essay,

709
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,100
we will be covering the difference

710
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,940
between the boyfriend

711
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,760
and the bloody head

712
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,040
block of society itself.

713
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,420
As seen here in our first slide, the Bloodyhead Monka Society goes on forever.

714
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,620
There is no end, and there's no use resisting.

715
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,900
Look at those heads fall in slow motion. Just beautiful.

716
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,500
Bouncing down the celestial stairs.

717
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,180
Inside of my house.

718
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,940
The only way to get it there, by God, is with Bob Dobbs.

719
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,660
They tell you in the first paragraph.

720
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:07,680
And Arnold Palmer's head shall materialize in the space above your sleeping parlor, and it shall indeed be bloody.

721
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:17,460
It shall be dripping with the residual blood formed earlier in the day when he was without the word of Bob.

722
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,220
What are we going to do about the Bloodyhead of Arnold Palmer?

723
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,920
What the hell are we going to do about the Bloodyhead?

724
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,980
The Bloodyhead of Arnold Palmer, that's what I want to know.

725
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,780
His crimson head.

726
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,700
I've seen it in my nightmares.

727
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,320
I've been seeing omens and signs.

728
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,740
We've got to do something about the Bloodyhead of Arnold Palmer.

729
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,240
These guys are talking bad on Bob.

730
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,440
Neither them nor the Christians we've got to start with.

731
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,980
We've got to do something bad.

732
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,520
We've got to do something.

733
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Paul, stand still.

734
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

735
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:57,540
Shit.

736
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,680
That they can keep awake and be under your bed and inside the water and shooting the waves and rays up at you all the time.

737
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,140
That's right.

738
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,600
But those UFOs, they're flying all over your house.

739
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,560
That's right.

740
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,120
Then they know about Bomba.

741
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,440
And they're going to be dropping the...

742
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,760
...

743
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,500
...doctor...

744
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,180
...expressor...

745
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,100
...for Bob.

746
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,460
...for Bob.

747
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,240
How well do you play your game?

748
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,920
How well could you play?

749
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,920
Chances are you'll never know unless you're fitted with a proper device.

750
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,340
Proper equipment.

751
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,780
Proper equipment now provided by Lemur in the form of this lever.

752
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,900
Finally, I did what I should have done in the first place.

753
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,900
I got acne.

754
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,160
Lever.

755
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,760
Starring Barbara Beaumont.

756
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,960
Hugh Billingsley.

757
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,540
Tony Billingsley.

758
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,740
And Jerry the Beaver.

759
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,880
Dear?

760
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,860
I, uh...

761
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,320
What?

762
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,440
Honestly.

763
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,920
Hey Wally, guess what?

764
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,720
Your heart's getting there, you and I just tick tick tick tick.

765
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,500
Beaver, you got dropping again?

766
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,200
I didn't say you had to.

767
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,020
It's just that he should do something to repay it.

768
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,080
There's no rule against my scoop.

769
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,440
Yes Wally, gee Wally, yes yes gee gee.

770
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,500
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye.

771
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,200
Okay, I...

772
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,120
Hey Dave, what's the number?

773
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,080
32532595238.

774
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,680
Hello?

775
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,420
234.

776
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,580
Um...

777
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,040
5-8.

778
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,360
Hello Julie?

779
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,860
Yeah...

780
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,440
This is Wally.

781
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,260
Yeah, well um, you know Julie, uh, Wally Cleaver.

782
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,500
Well, um, we'll uh...

783
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,780
Yeah, well um, we'll uh, do something.

784
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,260
Oh, man, what?

785
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,880
What?

786
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:46,900
I mean...

787
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,780
Oh, yeah.

788
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,760
This is cool.

789
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,880
No girl in the world is gonna settle for a liquid diet.

790
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,460
That's a gentlemanly thing.

791
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,240
Yeah.

792
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:57,560
Okay.

793
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,680
Okay.

794
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,340
Yeah.

795
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,680
Hello?

796
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,200
Hello?

797
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,180
Hello?

798
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:04,860
Hello?

799
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,380


800
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,380


801
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:06,700
Hello?

802
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:06,820
Hello?

803
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:06,900
Hello?

804
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,140
Hello?

805
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,300
Hello?

806
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,620
Hello?

807
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,080
Hello?

808
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,580
Hello?

809
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:40,580
Hey, this motherfucker.

810
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,180
Hey, good morning.

811
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,280
He clearly stated that he was a Libra, as often found quite earnestly inquiring about it with a last shake from another planet.

812
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,100
A billion light-years from that very location, in a place called Holy Virtue, is the Joint Trench, a spot for active meditation.

813
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,180
Here, full-blown best-dance-mokey-pie-folios are discussing the finer merits of the most recent batch of Saint Seiya episodes.

814
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,300
As an Ascordian non-Freudian, he made their house in the Trench again, and mocked at the French again.

815
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,800
A retrograded, not-so-human jellyfish was four inches deep in his small dish, which was plumped in cafeteria bacteria.

816
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,040
Selected, collected, and piled high in a petri dish.

817
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,500
Five minutes from now, nowhere near the Trench.

818
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,700
A cat and a priest in a fridge.

819
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,920
A confessional food with a doubtless mind and a whole lot of truth.

820
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,440
He suddenly said his obelisks and went through it, yelling through his toots and pears like a freak in the arts.

821
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,360
While the jellyfish man does what he can to get you off his pews.

822
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,460
A cross-faced, another and completely underrated ape savages the willing aim of a poor, but not-so-positive cucumber-wrapped inductee.

823
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,920
Meanwhile, in his oiled Frisco, he bought sausage.

824
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,540
Tears ruined the perfectly good mascara of a drag queen named Fania, whose friends used to call him Fred.

825
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,740
Back in ROTC.

826
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,740
As the cylindrical midget made him class two, who was often seen to stand in some kind of stealing,

827
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,540
screaming at the top of his little midget lungs as the rock band had done and the disaster's yet to come.

828
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,100
Just that second in Washington, the beat and life of the next getting,

829
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,660
a horribly boring speech to a group of teens, one of whom was well-to-do,

830
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,160
was a certain group of women on the online, like Ricky Bushmere's,

831
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,520
who was too hung to steer, unable to pull the tongue of a Sunday.

832
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,820
Around the corner on the dark side of the moon in an off-block room,

833
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,680
a moodie was clearly a Tuesday-tuned and joyfully-exceptly-dressed slice of pizza with an amazingly well-to-do,

834
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:12,780
and a little bit of a dance.

835
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,820
Oh, I got it, good eye.

836
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,980
Yeah, yeah.

837
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,240
Ah, my good friends.

838
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,980
Well, that was the El Queso All-Stars.

839
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:57,500
You can find out more about the El Queso All-Stars at mp3.com,

840
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,400
www.mp3.com slash interbulator.

841
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,860
That's spelled E-N-T-U-R-bulator.

842
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,080
And I heard my mama.

843
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,780
I heard my mama say.

844
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,780
What's she saying?

845
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,640
I heard my, I heard my mama say.

846
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,180
I heard my mama.

847
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,280
I heard my mama.

848
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,780
She said,

849
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,540
Cash, get off of the bathroom.

850
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,560
That's the tens.

851
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,640
It's time today.

852
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,580
And I heard my mama say,

853
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,000
Cash, get off of the bathroom.

854
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,520
And I heard my mama say,

855
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,080
Cash, get off of the bathroom.

856
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:05,800
And I heard my mama say,

857
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,120
Cash, get off of the bathroom.

858
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,700
Cash, get off of the bathroom.

859
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,560
Say my soul, yeah

860
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,340
If you go outside

861
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,820
If you go outside

862
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,520
If you go outside

863
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,760
If you go outside

864
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,340
We'll make it, make you lie down

865
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,720
We'll make it, make you lie down

866
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,800
I'm not gonna lie

867
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,980
I'm not gonna lie

868
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,500
The lightning and thunder

869
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,680
It makes the world go round

870
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,880
You're gonna wonder

871
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,680
Wow!

872
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:40,820
You're afraid

873
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,920
You're afraid of us

874
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,900
You're afraid of change

875
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,800
I don't know the future

876
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,940
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end

877
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,240
I came here

878
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
To tell you how it's going to begin

879
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,580
I'm going to hang up this phone

880
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,580
And then I'm going to show these people

881
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,720
What you don't want them to see

882
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,900
I'm going to show them a world

883
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,380
Without you

884
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,520
A world without rules and controls

885
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,940
Without borders or boundaries

886
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,160
A world

887
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,680
Where anything can happen

888
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,680


889
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,680


890
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,680


891
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,680


892
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,480
Anything is possible.

893
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,820
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

894
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:08,560
To be continued...

895
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,760
To be continued...

896
00:50:53,180 --> 00:51:10,500
To be continued...

897
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:40,660
To be continued...

898
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,740
To be continued...

899
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,460
To be continued...

900
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,660
Uncle Burgess Parks did that poem.

901
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,820
I guess he's Reverend Bob Diddley's uncle,

902
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,180
and Bob Diddley recorded that.

903
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,860
And now, The Electric Amish.

904
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,320
For your mule, I'd give three chickens

905
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,600
And my best black son, baby

906
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,200
Pants.

907
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:14,180
For your mule, I'd let you do-si-do

908
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,540
My wife at her square dance.

909
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,320
For your mule, I'd give you eggs and cheese

910
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,280
I would get down on my knees

911
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,000
I would do all of these

912
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,720
Come on, Mr. Pretty, please!

913
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:29,980
For your mule

914
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,720
For your mule

915
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,160
For your mule

916
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,160


917
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,160


918
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,540
For your mule

919
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:40,540


920
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:40,540


921
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:40,660
For your mule

922
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,340
For your mule

923
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,560
I could talk about Bob.

924
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,580
Bob can do anything for you!

925
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,640
He can do anything for anybody!

926
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,320
There's only one problem basically,

927
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:54,900
if you're having a problem

928
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,780
with your cash flow.

929
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,600
If you're having a problem

930
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,620
with your spiritual life.

931
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,120
If you're having a problem with your car!

932
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,900
How about sex,

933
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,720
if you're having a problem with sex?!

934
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,240
If you're having a problem in your car!

935
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,920
If you're having a problem like,

936
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,660
like we had today

937
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,860
where the tire went flat!

938
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,760
And there's a problem...

939
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,420
There's a death

940
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,380
You have the whole and easy to be filled with in your life.

941
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,000
There's only one thing that you can do.

942
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,440
That's reach for your wallet, reach for your checkbook,

943
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:20,240
and send the money to P.O. Box 140306.

944
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,080
Dallas 306.

945
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,040
140306.

946
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,020
140306.

947
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,900
Dallas, Texas 75214.

948
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,700
75214.

949
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,760
This will all come to you if you send a dollar

950
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:45,220
to the church of the subgenius P.O. Box 140306.

951
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,540
Dallas, Texas 75214.

952
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:56,420
This will enable us to continue with the marvelous operations

953
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:00,900
which we've known about and we've tried to spread throughout

954
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:06,200
the Western Hemisphere and change this CFR,

955
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,740
our tribe,

956
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:06,940
and the entire world.

957
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,620
We have the most trilateralist-oriented goal-reachers

958
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,040
of the beyond-noids getting here in this.

959
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:18,040
Send, you will get sex.

960
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,900
This is a subliminal message brought to you in care

961
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,600
of the Subliminal Message Corporation.

962
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,320
Sex, money, Bob.

963
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,860
These three concepts will always be linked in your mind.

964
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,760
Sex, money, Bob.

965
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,800
Sex, money, Bob.

966
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,120
Sex, money, Bob.

967
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:46,300
Yes, this is a continuation of the flow spew that the doctors

968
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,860
of feel-good-ice now got for us here.

969
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:56,040
You would have been told which Bob to tune to in your area.

970
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,100
And this is not a burned-out, radiance-oriented cult,

971
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,160
ladies and gentlemen.

972
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:01,920
I don't know.

973
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:02,780
I don't know.

974
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,040
This is a spouting spew and pumping of great images.

975
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,940
Spew night.

976
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,860
Blimey out.

977
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,860
Nor can you see me.

978
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,780
War.

979
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,620
