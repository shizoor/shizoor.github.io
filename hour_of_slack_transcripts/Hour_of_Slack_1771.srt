1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
What time is it, Tevis?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,420
It's Bob time! Time for the hour of slack!

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,020
Tevis, you know that you're not supposed to be watching the hour of slack because it's too weird for you.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,880
Uh-uh!

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh yeah, I'll prove it. Right, Daddy?

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,500
Huh? What?

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,820
Right, she's not supposed to see the hour of slack.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,820
Uh-uh!

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,700
Oh, Tevis is just as weird as the hour of slack, aren't you, Tev?

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,480
Yeah!

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,640
Mr. Smith is a good white man.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,140
Mr. Smith is our friend and father.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,100
Mr. Smith.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,620
Mr. Smith.

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,080
Mr. Smith.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,400
Mr. Smith.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,440
Mr. Smith.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,380
Mr. Smith is a good white man.

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,760
He's a good white man.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,160
Mr. Smith is a good white man. I don't know what that is from.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,260
What time is it now, Tevi?

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,520
Five o'clock!

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,980
Where did you get that rubbish from?

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,720
I don't know.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,580
Well, you're not supposed to get it from our mother.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,720
What's up, buddy?

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,520
What's your problem over there, bud?

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,480
Friends, this one's not a re-run.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,440
We really are here in Stang Ranch, Texas, in the home studio.

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:48,480
And I've got a lot of tracks and things done by other hermits in home studios.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,940
Oh, poor buddy.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,700
He's already got cabin fever because he doesn't want to be socially disturbed.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,380
He's already distanced.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,240
So, uh, yes, yes.

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,820
Buddy?

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,060
I think he wants his chew.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,460
We hoarded plenty of chews.

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,000
Hold on. I'll be back.

39
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,100
Oh, sorry, friends.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,460
We didn't used to have those problems at WCSB radio station.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,700
Nor this sagging microphone.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,680
Damn.

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,680
I know.

44
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,100
Although, they're all having to work from home right now, too.

45
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,840
It's all auto remote control.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm probably one of the few people able to send them fresh shows.

47
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,780
Quickly.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,920
Anyway, friends, what have we been listening to?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,440
I don't know.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:53,440


51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
I don't know if memory serves correctly.

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,260
The intro to the show was my son and daughter in 1987 or so.

53
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:19,720
And then I believe, oh, oh, oh, this time we're going to be playing Onan Canobite reading rants by me and later me reading rants by him.

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,580
Which the answer is, yeah, he might be racing each season now for the show.

55
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,580


56
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,200
Ernie asked me one day if I could remember if he reveals the story of the earth minлекс.

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,200


58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Oh, I see.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,200


60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,200


61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,200


62
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,500
Hum, it's those these fantastic зачем- shift planets, and they're dumping gas into planets.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:48,500


64
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,420
But you're sending all these different lay redefIDE questions at my startup factory, and so will I.

65
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:50,420


66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,320
And recently, whenever we go to any place, the망 will start re-stringing with us all together, and we will probably re- Campus swings.

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,660
Something big, yes, big, is on the way.

68
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,860
It may or may not be the end of the world, but it will be the end of something.

69
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,460
Something that was so near and dear to us that we've all taken it for granted for so long

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,780
that when it goes, we won't notice.

71
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:25,740
The word human will take on a whole new meaning, and most yo-yos will never be the wiser.

72
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:34,380
The end will come and go, and if it isn't cataclysmic, nobody will pay attention.

73
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,400
And if it is, people will, but they'll have the wrong explanation for it.

74
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,440
No explanation will be the right one.

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,760
And we'll be bemoaned.

76
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,680
We'll be bemoaning the loss of things that didn't make any difference,

77
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,800
while we'll never notice what we really lost,

78
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:01,580
because we won't be human enough afterwards to remember ever having had it.

79
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,140
Yes, all you deaf ears down there, heads up, look out below.

80
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,760
There will be plenty of distractions to take our minds off the road.

81
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,180
There will be plenty of things you can do to help, but you won't be able to do it.

82
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,580
For instance, beware.

83
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,380
The fake God Junior will come before 1998.

84
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,520
Bullets won't even slow him down.

85
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,600
He's a deceptively human-looking, supersonic, Nazi Hell creature from below the hollow Earth.

86
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,100
But a lot of people will think he's the Second Coming,

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,740
and his alien hyenae will be kissed by a giant.

88
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:45,740


89
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:45,760
and his alien hyenae will be kissed by a giant.

90
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,180
All the way to world dictatorship and beyond.

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,200
And when the real Messiah shows up again,

92
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,920
most people, even the Christian race,

93
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,680
will know in the bottom of their core programming that he's the Antichrist.

94
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,080
They'll know, alright, because he'll cuss and spit and take the Lord's name in vain,

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:22,900
and hang out with whores and bull-daggers and drug addicts and policemen and other down-home sorts.

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,040
And when he's dead, and the real Antichrist has been unmasked as a fake,

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,080
they'll weep and gnash and all that, and still never admit what they did.

98
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,960
This is a warning. Danger.

99
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,660
Danger, you poor devils.

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,080
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed.

101
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,220
What was up is down.

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,440
The priorities are all screwy.

103
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:05,020
You're fretting if your hair looks okay while bladder cancer is busting out the front of your jeans.

104
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,420
Yes, this is bad talk.

105
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,240
Nobody will listen to anything else.

106
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,060
Nobody will listen to anything else.

107
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,140
You won't watch TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it.

108
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,540
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

109
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,500
You haven't used your other senses since you were five.

110
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,540
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing

111
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:42,960
unless someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more self-assured

112
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,920
makes you stop.

113
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,160
And you'll thank him for it.

114
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,200
And then, just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight,

115
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,060
you'll realize he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,460
Good God.

117
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,940
What in the name of sweet, screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

118
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,160
People bitch. People gripe.

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,180
This is a sign of the end times.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,420
That's a sign of the end times.

121
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,460
When you should all be hollering,

122
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,940
it's all a sign of the end times.

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,860
So, don't surrender to the conspiracy.

124
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,980
Join up with the sub-subculture,

125
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,240
the most understood minority.

126
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,780
Donate the tithe that binds.

127
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,480
Dole out that we may ever pump out the word.

128
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,680
Enter into our covenant with the space deities.

129
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,700
Indulge in mental Darwinism.

130
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,580
Help discover the perfect money-making formula.

131
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,640
Go scouring. Get slack.

132
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,260
Keep meditating our way.

133
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,720
And don't waver from the Bob path.

134
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
Give us your children.

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,060
Bob won't promise you he'll prevent the end of the world.

136
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,820
But he'll sure as hell see that you get front row tickets.

137
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,980
And the schools are 들ring at everyone.

138
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,260
They'll Klar chareld lobby you.

139
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,680
All that doesn't work at all is just never giving a damn.

140
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,720


141
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,040
It affects at it's most.

142
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,040


143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,040


144
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,380
Baybel, I've got to get to my real house.

145
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,020
I can't even type when I'm making a deal.

146
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Imagine there's no people

147
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,240
Imagine there's no people

148
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,840
Imagine there's no people

149
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,420
Imagine there's no people

150
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,920
Imagine there's no people

151
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,000
We've been living

152
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,220
We've been living

153
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,060
We've been living

154
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,220
We've been living

155
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,580
We've been living

156
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:16,640
We've been living

157
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,420
We've been living

158
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,800
We've been living

159
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,220
We've been living

160
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:36,220
We've been living

161
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,220
We've been living

162
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,220
We've been living

163
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,220
We've been living

164
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,220
We've been living

165
00:17:36,240 --> 00:18:05,840
We've been living

166
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,220
We've been living

167
00:18:46,380 --> 00:19:06,220
We've been living

168
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,280
We've been living

169
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,340
We've been living

170
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,680
We've been living

171
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,240
We've been living

172

We've been living

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,180
We've been living

174
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,160
We're all living

175
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,480
We've been living

176
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,080
We're all living

177
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,500
We've been living

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,740
We've been living

179
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,680
We've been living

180
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,380
We're all living

181
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,860
Jack grabbed his humpback, give it a blow

182
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,000
Jack meets up with a natural born hoe

183
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,740
Ho find a way to make the Klugman meat grow

184
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,660
Jack find a way to make the Klugman meat grow

185
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,540
Ho scratch Jack in the twilight zone

186
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,480
Ho scratch Jack on the Klugman bone

187
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,200
Ho scratch Jack, Jack Klugman meat grow

188
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,840
Ho squat down on the Klugman bone

189
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,800
Ho start pumping like a Model T4

190
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,600
Ho grab his own and give it a blow

191
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,500
Ho find a way to make the Klugman meat so

192
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,580
Got the clap Jack, got it from the hoe

193
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,240
Got the clap Jack, now the Klugman meat so

194
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,200
Ho gave Jack clap, Jack Klugman meat so

195
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,840
Ho gave Jack clap, Jack Klugman meat so

196
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:03,840


197
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,860
Jack clap, Jack Klugman meat grow

198
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,680
Jack Klugman meat so

199
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,740
Jack Klugman meat grow

200
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,660
Ha ha ha ha ha

201
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:34,660


202
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:45,760
Ha ha haa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

203
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

204
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:46,700
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

205
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:53,360
Ha ha ha ha ha a ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha He's still running

206
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:02,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

207
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

208
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

209
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:14,840
Episcopalian private school that was all male. And yeah, the math teachers really hated this speech

210
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:23,100
and said that I had always been a little piece of bleep. The English teachers came up and clapped

211
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:29,100
me on the back, loved it. Of course, they all had beards. Oh, I should mention here, the audio

212
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:37,480
quality on this is kind of bad. I guess I've recorded over a used tape and you can hear,

213
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,840
faintly hear the background chatter, which I think is probably me talking to some friend.

214
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,560
So try to ignore the background. Good idea though.

215
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,120
Help me on somebody. Yes. What do you know?

216
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,860
Boy, this place really looks different. Everyone used to be facing this way and

217
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:28,900
all the windows are still there. This was a for real chapel at one time, as I'm sure

218
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,080
many of you know. It was a chapel that was built in the early 90s. It was built in the

219
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:37,580
early 90s, as most of y'all know, complete with a preacher. We got a legit Episcopal sermon every

220
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:47,720
morning by an authentic ordained minister. I'm sure, yeah, yeah, still here. But it was an entirely

221
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:56,960
different situation in that everybody, whether you were Christian or Jewish or what, we all prayed.

222
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:06,760
We had to pray. We all at least had to look like we were. We'd hang our heads very solemnly.

223
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,460
And we were praying all right, but we weren't always praying for what we were supposed to be

224
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:24,860
praying for. So in honor of those bygone days when test scores were higher, I will preach a sermon

225
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:32,280
and I was there. The last time I was here, it was probably two or three years ago, but the last time

226
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,480
I was here, I told the truth. So instead, this time I got that out of the way. I go ahead and

227
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,880
preach a subgenius sermon, which actually the way we should do that, it'd be more akin to pro wrestling.

228
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:53,220
But I don't think the world's quite ready for that complete, you know, joining of the two mediums

229
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,840
there. So some of you may be in the middle of the room. I'm sure you're all ready for that. I'm sure you're

230
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,820
ready for that. But I'm sure you're all ready for that. So some of you may be going, now, wait a minute,

231
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:03,360
who is this guy? There was never any Ivan Stang that went to St. Mark's. And that's true. There's

232
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,600
been a terrible mistake and I shouldn't even be here, but it's too late now. They let me start.

233
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:16,880
I thought this guy was known for making movies or something, but I kind of let that slide to a

234
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,820
certain extent because of my anonymous work for the Church of the Subgenius, which if you don't

235
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:35,660
already know about that, many people consider it probably the evil mind control cult to end all mind

236
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:45,020
control cults. But for us subgeni, it's really nothing more than our simple faith in this man, J.R.

237
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:54,800
Bob Dobbs, known for many things, a man of many faces, a salesman and a mystic at the same time.

238
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,340
Sort of combining the two. It's a very successful combination these days. He's many things, Bob is.

239
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,620
He's, among other things, a symbol. Not for the oppressed, but for the different, which sometimes is the

240
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:20,240
same thing. Not always, though. Bob is like simultaneously the ultimate rebel and at the same time the

241
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,100
ultimate money-grubbing, power-hungry authoritarian.

242
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:24,780
Yeah.

243
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:24,780


244
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:32,440
Which is what the successful rebel inevitably becomes, you know, if he really gets successful.

245
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:41,980
Now, when I went to school here, of course, in the early 70s, it was still sort of cool to be the ultimate rebel.

246
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:51,860
And I tried, but in those days, hair was probably the biggest issue. It may still be. In fact, I was told that I

247
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,560
wouldn't be allowed to graduate if I didn't cut my hair.

248
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,820
I was told that I wouldn't be allowed to graduate if I didn't cut my hair. Which was almost as long as it is now.

249
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,400
The last time I was here, I had short hair, I think, but a blue jean jacket, you know, to complete the image.

250
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:13,480
You have to manipulate these images if you want to make any money at them and also to be successful in terms of

251
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:22,900
programming young minds. I almost didn't graduate, but I did. At the last minute, they decided, oh, let's not make a big stink out of it.

252
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,540
My parents were embarrassed.

253
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:32,540
They were embarrassed and so forth. But the thing was, I was really into hating St. Mark's at the time.

254
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:44,200
It was like my senior project might as well have been just the hatred of St. Mark's. But looking back on it, I really was into

255
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:53,280
hating it for all the wrong reasons. I still badmouth St. Mark's, don't get me wrong. But it's for a completely different, you know,

256
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
it's like I've got to go to school. I've got to go to school. I've got to go to school. I've got to go to school. I've got to go to school.

257
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:04,120
And that's how I got it a little more focused. In those days, this was very idiotic but I used to think, well, this school is just too

258
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:16,200
elitist. It was to snobbish and intellectual and ivory castle for rich kids. Out of touch with the common pop culture that

259
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:24,500
was actually shaping everyone's lives, including ours. But, after awhile, I got kind of convinced and at least to the extent that I had

260
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,500


261
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,500


262
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:24,500


263
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,220
I got out and went to UT, actually, big public school,

264
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,560
and discovered that all men are actually not created equal,

265
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,480
certainly in terms of rights.

266
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,900
And many of you are going to be in for a profound shock.

267
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,180
I hate to say it.

268
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,500
If you get into one of those giant public schools,

269
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,620
you will find that in the country of the blind,

270
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,700
the one-eyed man can be king, but only if he plays his cards right.

271
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,080
Hence, one of Bob's wise sayings,

272
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,940
act like a dumbass and they'll treat you like an equal.

273
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,600
Sorry to be so cynical, but that's in a way, you know.

274
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,200
But I did, I realized that, you know,

275
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
there should be a refuge,

276
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,560
for the neurotic pampered offspring of the rich,

277
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,600
such as myself, probably included.

278
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,740
I did get a good academic training here,

279
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,400
despite all my efforts to the contrary.

280
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,260
But the proper reason to hate St. Mark's

281
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:48,720
is much, much more fundamental than any of those.

282
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,480
That was intellectual garbage.

283
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,840
In fact, you couldn't get more fundamental.

284
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,280
And the proper reason to hate St. Mark's

285
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,780
is that there are no girls in this entire,

286
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,700
well, let's see, are there?

287
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,700
In the entire, praise Bob.

288
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,220
E-I-I-I.

289
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,100
And I, oh, focus for many forces, friends.

290
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,460
See, I'm not saying that I'm going to say,

291
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,980
girls, now wait a minute.

292
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,300
Reverend Stang, are you talking about those mutated things

293
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,040
over there at Hockaday?

294
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,620
I thought those were just for dating,

295
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,080
or well, sex, hopefully.

296
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,920
But they don't go to school, do they?

297
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,620
They don't, I mean, what would be the point?

298
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,680
They're just walking flesh things, pleasure machines, right?

299
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,000
And I don't know, I don't know.

300
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,740
It may not bother a lot of y'all.

301
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,420
And in some of my classes,

302
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,440
I've had a lot of people say,

303
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,660
well, they're classmates, it never got to them.

304
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,560
They managed to have a perfectly,

305
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,960
well, relatively normal social life, I guess.

306
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,120
But it drove me crazy.

307
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,480
And in fact, at one point, I actually,

308
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,500
in one of the study rooms in the library,

309
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,360
just the frustration of it all caused me to scream out loud

310
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,400
for no other reason.

311
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,520
And I never was able to successfully explain

312
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,600
my way out of that.

313
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,140
The strangest coincidence got me off the hook.

314
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,340
Actually, the very day I was going in to go in

315
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,720
and see Mr. Connolly,

316
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,620
and I mean, I couldn't explain it.

317
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,020
But this film catalog came out

318
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
that had one of my little animated films in it.

319
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,720
And the librarian was so impressed

320
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,020
that she told him to blow it off.

321
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,840
Saved in the nick of time.

322
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,800
But I used to hang around the drama club

323
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:47,700
despite the common filmmaker's revulsion towards theater,

324
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,180
which is like one shot, you know,

325
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,080
it's just not the same.

326
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,700
Because that was where the gals were.

327
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,920
And I actually ended up marrying one of those.

328
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,780
But in those days, St. Mark's was a liberal,

329
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,440
liberal place.

330
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,700
I mean, it was, compared to nowadays,

331
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,780
from what I understand, I could be wrong,

332
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,600
for a little while, this place was like a hippie love inn.

333
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,540
I mean, it was, it really was a very, very different thing.

334
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,600
Although it kind of didn't last very long.

335
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,340
But still, but still, there was that one problem.

336
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,440
There were no female entities.

337
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,780
No non-tool using primates.

338
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,740
Of course, in those days, it was a different thing

339
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,260
because, you know, about the worst thing,

340
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,540
you could get somebody pregnant,

341
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,100
you could have to go get penicillin for something,

342
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,340
but you wouldn't die.

343
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,180
You wouldn't die.

344
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,880
Sex was not a dangerous, quite so dangerous in those days.

345
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,180
So nowadays, you know, it's still,

346
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,940
we still have the problem of missing out just a bit

347
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,860
on the basics.

348
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,960
You know, they're improving your brains here,

349
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,720
but frankly, dear friends, brains,

350
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,360
you know, to make a good living on the kind of jobs

351
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,000
that are available to you now in the 80s,

352
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,680
frankly, brains are not good.

353
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,360
They are a detriment to success.

354
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,820
If you have to actually think about most of the jobs

355
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,300
that you'll fall into if you let yourself accidentally

356
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,560
fall into one, you're not going to need the brains part.

357
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,940
You're going to need those basics.

358
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,840
So I don't know.

359
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
This is just my personal opinion of a possible change

360
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,900
of priorities somewhere down the line.

361
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,500
In the early 70s, I mean, look,

362
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,920
in a way, things haven't changed that much.

363
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,240
In the early 70s, we used to go to see concerts

364
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,360
of Alice Cooper, drunk transvestite.

365
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,760
Now, you know, it's Boy George, junkie transvestite.

366
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,660
You know, how much have things changed?

367
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,020
Isn't it time for Bob?

368
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,460
So, let's see, what time?

369
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,800
I guess it's time to let you all go.

370
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,020
I should make one final sort of warning.

371
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,800
I love to act like an old man.

372
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,580
I'm 33 and I have two kids, so it's my prerogative.

373
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,100
But if there's one thing that you all take from here,

374
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,160
besides a couple of gag lines,

375
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,880
and please take this very seriously,

376
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:45,600
as horrible as it sounds, it isn't what you know,

377
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,780
it's what you have.

378
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,740
It really is who you know.

379
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,260
You hear a pin drop.

380
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,740
It sounds corny as hell.

381
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,820
But, you know, after a while,

382
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,320
when I found out all my success was coming from who I knew,

383
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,620
ugh, it can be depressing, dear friends.

384
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,380
So, on that note, good note to let, you know,

385
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,120
start the week off on.

386
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,100
And I'm sure you'll find it true in the high school situation, too.

387
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,460
It certainly was when I was around.

388
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,960
Oh, the one thing I might mention,

389
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,500
I might throw in about the teen,

390
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,620
I had originally thought about doing a whole rant

391
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,200
about teen rebels through the years,

392
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,440
you know, culminating, of course, in the pitch for Bob.

393
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,320
But the one way in which I was a teen rebel

394
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,100
is that I was one of the first kids

395
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,080
to have a few people in my senior class at that time

396
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,040
that wasn't doing drugs.

397
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,620
And strangely enough,

398
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,300
and the funny thing was,

399
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,620
the school administration was convinced

400
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,800
that I was one of the few that was.

401
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:05,140
So, in a way, I guess I was taking heat off of the guilty parties.

402
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,060
Um, yeah.

403
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,100
So you never know, dear friends.

404
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,920
You never know what's behind the special effects.

405
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,740
Um, the appearances are not always the same.

406
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,700
So I don't know who the teen hero for the modern age is, dear friends,

407
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,780
but it should be this man, Bob!

408
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,820
Praise Bob!

409
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,960
Oh, help me, somebody!

410
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,600
Thank you.

411
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,060
Nice. Short one.

412
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,300
Whoo!

413
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,300


414
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,080
The St. Mark's School of Texas rant

415
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,140
that got the kid who invited me

416
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,400
almost expelled from school

417
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,220
because I dared to talk about the elephant

418
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,900
that wasn't in the room.

419
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,040
You know, the cute one that wears skirts.

420
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,080
I guess I'm not supposed to say that.

421
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,020
And now, let's listen to what seems to be

422
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,920
a very old show.

423
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,400
Some puzzling evidence, some Hour of Slack.

424
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,480
This is from around the time of Hour of Slack 69.

425
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,020
It may be from Hour of Slack number 70.

426
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,320
Uh, it's from the same source.

427
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,380
And so this would be from real early, 1986.

428
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,300
Early 87, something like that.

429
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,300
It's still slack, dear friends.

430
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,400
It's the mighty, mighty slack.

431
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,200
You know what I mean?

432
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,340
They used these bloody chunks of flesh

433
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,560
in the healing ceremonies.

434
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,980
They're good for feeding your pet Pekingese and poodle, too.

435
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,200
Remember to write, Dear Dr. Animal,

436
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,600
Radio KPFA, 2207 Shattuck Avenue,

437
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,040
Berkeley, California, 94704.

438
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,500
Okay.

439
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,480
Yeah, that's all well and good, man, but, you know, I'm gonna...

440
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,440
No, it's well, man.

441
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,160
I'll cut this out before I dismiss all of you from the scale.

442
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,820
Well, you will.

443
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,860
Well, I'm gonna sue because my dog is suffering a case of Bob possession.

444
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,300
After I caught my dog listening last week to your show, man,

445
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,340
I could swear I heard him say, Bob.

446
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,600
Did the dog ask you to take a gun and, well, do anything unusual?

447
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,620
No, but just after he said Bob, and I wasn't sure I heard it, man,

448
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,320
I know I swear I heard him say,

449
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,280
Well, you might have had a slight case of canine indigestion.

450
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,280
Make sure your rover gets plenty of that.

451
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,880
And plenty of milk of magnesia.

452
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,060
Well, you gotta tell Ivan Stang, man, to come do an exorcism on this dog.

453
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,720
Tell him yourself, he's right here.

454
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,180
He's right here.

455
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,800
Demon!

456
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,100
Demon, I command you in the name of Bob, I have dominance over you.

457
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Demon, come out!

458
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,540
Come out, demon!

459
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,060
Oh, look at...

460
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,960
Oh, there it is.

461
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,060
The false slack pours out of the beast's mouth.

462
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,740
You ruined the carpet.

463
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,200
Hey, Bob!

464
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:00,600
Oh!

465
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,160
Curse you, Stang!

466
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,980
Our name is Luger!

467
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,700
Yes, it was a miracle, Ivan.

468
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,800
But you've ruined the carpet.

469
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,160
And I'm afraid your church is gonna have to pay to get our church repaired.

470
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Money is no object, dear friends.

471
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,500
As long as it's burned and the smoke reaches the excess.

472
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,100
If you calculate 999, which are Bob's numbers, at 999 and 999...

473
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,240
Dial 9 to get out of here.

474
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,360
That is exactly right.

475
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,240
And it's the same as three times 666.

476
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,920
Can you imagine how I felt when Bucknacket and I discovered...

477
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,540
You're right.

478
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,600
...that 666 was one-third of 1998?

479
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,440
Hmm?

480
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:39,800
No way.

481
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
All it does...

482
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,180
But we don't question the wisdom of Bob.

483
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,720
I mean, we don't need to.

484
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,240
No.

485
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,840
We put our trust, our total faith, total faith in that man Bob.

486
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,160
We may never have seen him.

487
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220
We've never talked to him on the phone.

488
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,940
We don't know him personally, necessarily, except deep, deep in our hearts and in our

489
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,800
pockets, in our hands.

490
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,360
We are Bob participating in himself.

491
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,780
Does...

492
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,520
He incarnates in himself.

493
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,500
The apoptotudic incarnation.

494
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:06,840
Thank you.

495
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,460
You know, I searched for all these...

496
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:10,800
Thank you.

497
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,420
...through all the religions of the earth.

498
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
But you have the book of the subgenius.

499
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:14,820
That's right.

500
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,480
This is the only religion that will change your spinal fluid.

501
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,460
Ooh, that was a laid-back show.

502
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,660
Whoa, it's not laid-back anymore!

503
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,960
Look out!

504
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:27,960
Whoa!

505
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,640
You are about to hear Bob's story.

506
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,600
It's a story about a man who was a man, and he was a man, and he was a man, and he was

507
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:31,600


508
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,540
a man, and he was a man, and he was a man, and he was a man.

509
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,100
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

510
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:43,080
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

511
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,060
The subgenius.

512
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,980
Our subgenius.

513
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,480
Watch!

514
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,080
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

515
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Oh, it's the power of the soul.

516
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,580
Oh, it's the power of the soul.

517
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:01,580


518
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:01,580


519
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:01,580


520
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:12,020
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of

521
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,620

And only in the city of...

526
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:29,800

528
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,360
We're the subgenius.

529
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,300
We're the subgenius.

530
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,840
We're the subgenius.

531
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:46,660
We're the subgenius.

532
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,460
Welcome dear friends, to the subgenius Hour of Slack.

533
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,160
I walked back up to the grassy knoll again, and started heading back down.

534
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,000
I left that group of...

535
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,260
I left that group of...

536
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,640
wacky Zenos and the Gazebo and the Sodbusters

537
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,520
Museum and that wing-ding nut-flanger

538
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,900
on the accordion. Well, I just didn't know what to think,

539
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,460
you know. Coming up here, hanging around with the grass

540
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,600
and the trees, it's just natural. But these people were

541
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,080
talking different, and I don't know.

542
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,500
I'm just interested in sitting around and

543
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,220
picking my nose and spitting and stuff like that.

544
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,580
Well, it just made me think an awful lot.

545
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,100
Golly, my head got big and

546
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,440
well, I never knew I had so many ideas.

547
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,480
I began to think about writing them down or taking some pictures

548
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,520
or getting a tape recorder or something and them things, but

549
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,120
I know I didn't want to mess with them.

550
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,640
I just wanted to be natural, you know, sitting out here with the

551
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,840
old rocks and watching the clouds roll by.

552
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,640
But that old stranger with the accordion,

553
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,840
why, he made me feel a little

554
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,280
different. I kind of got excited

555
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,640
and, well, I liked it a little

556
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,820
bit. It never happened like that before. Suddenly, I began

557
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,480
to reflect on my whole...

558
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:36,220
life. Why, it was like a rock or a polka.

559
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,880
No, my life wasn't like a polka, but here it was again, and

560
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,660
God almighty, hiya, mister!

561
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,080
How are you, little fella?

562
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,100
Where is the rock?

563
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,760
Huh, huh.

564
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:51,580
Ah!

565
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,700
, this Car donut!

566
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:10,700


567
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:10,700


568
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:10,700


569
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:10,700


570
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,260
wine!

571
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:15,940
Are you hungry?

572
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,120
I'm not.

573
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,120


574
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,120


575
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,580
Though coffee doesn't feel that sort of cool.

576
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:18,960
Isn't that cool?

577
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,360
No, that's a Shiva thing.

578
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,880
Well, it's a komma still.

579
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:23,960
The Bora baby, though, she turns it the other way.

580
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,220
Thank you.

581
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,200
Thank you.

582
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,400
Thank you.

583
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,440
Thank you.

584
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,380
Thank you.

585
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,640
Thank you.

586
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,640
Thank you.

587
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,140
Thank you.

588
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,420
Thank you.

589
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,120
Thank you.

590
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,720
Thank you.

591
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,120
Thank you.

592
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:48,860
Now, news from the local Cervasovirus front, as Dave called it.

593
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,860
Dave is sick, by the way.

594
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,100
Not with that.

595
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,720
He got...

596
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,780
I need to do a GoFundMe for him.

597
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,580
Well, there is one.

598
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,440
Subgenius.com.

599
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:02,880
Take a look.

600
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,380
Nobody in town here in Glen Rose has the Covfef-19 that we know of.

601
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,560
But then there aren't any testing kits in this town, so nobody actually knows at all.

602
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,700
For me and my family, immediate family,

603
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,820
staying ranch is probably the safest place for three old folks

604
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:22,180
to be.

605
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,380
No neighbors.

606
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,520
And we've been self-quarantining for years now, especially me.

607
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,120
So for us, it's essentially no change,

608
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,660
except that I haven't touched anything in town,

609
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,600
except through an alcohol-soaked handkerchief.

610
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,800
And we've been living on disinfectant-wiped sandwiches

611
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,680
and goat-faced soup.

612
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,500
I, uh...

613
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,080
I hoarded early,

614
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,480
and I bought up all 96 bottles of hard liquor in town,

615
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:51,800
but...

616
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,160
I'm kind of worried about next week.

617
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,140
Uh, but seriously, friends,

618
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,380
I can't get over how fast that fundraiser worked.

619
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,120
I just about cried, uh,

620
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,920
when the $1,000 goal was met within four hours.

621
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,480
And then overnight, we got the whole lawyer bill covered,

622
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,520
which is a huge load off my shoulders.

623
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,420
You can't imagine.

624
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,820
Or can you?

625
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,080
I get the impression that some of you actually can.

626
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,420
So thank...

627
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,800
I want to thank everybody.

628
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,600
I want to thank everybody individually.

629
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,820
My heart soars like a turkey buzzard.

630
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,400
And, uh, everything may be going to hell in a handbasket,

631
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,660
who was a great singer, by the way,

632
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,940
but the way that individuals help each other

633
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,100
puts it all in a bigger and better perspective, friends.

634
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,200
Uh, we gotta stick together.

635
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,900
And evidently, we do.

636
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,120
So thank you all so much,

637
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,380
and including the ones who wanted to help but couldn't

638
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,680
because they needed help.

639
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,460
I hope, like hell,

640
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,200
I can help you when you need it.

641
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,640
Or even before.

642
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,320
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

643
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,360
The good news is,

644
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,620
there's been a couple of weeks now

645
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,880
during which the dumbest pinks

646
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,140
have been deliberately packing themselves

647
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,680
into pinkster habitats

648
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,900
to give each other disease.

649
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,320
To own the smarty pants people.

650
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,660
Well, that's just brilliant.

651
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,560
They win.

652
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,080
I'm owned.

653
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,440
Consider me a winner.

654
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:21,840
Me owned.

655
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,680
Praise Bob.

656
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,780
Every day, I check a Facebook page

657
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,260
that's centered on just this small rural Texas town.

658
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,360
Um, it's mostly about lost dogs.

659
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,340
And, uh, Zuck aside,

660
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,020
it's actually the best source of immediate local news,

661
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,420
as long as one attends only to the posts

662
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,180
offering complete sentences and standard English spelling.

663
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,020
Of course, then there's the angry redneck posts.

664
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,720
Mm-hmm.

665
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:51,660
And, uh, it happens.

666
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,800
Certain rednecks get angry instantly

667
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,560
upon the act of turning on Facebook,

668
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,020
which to many of them is the entire internet

669
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,780
as well as their whole computer.

670
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,360
Now, up until two days ago, they were all like,

671
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,520
y'all must be stooped.

672
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,320
What are you gonna do with toilet paper?

673
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,280
It's just a demon crab hoax, you i-do-its.

674
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,340
I went to the parade with my kids and then the bar,

675
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,900
and we partied.

676
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,560
Screw Obama.

677
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:20,880
Bummer.

678
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,760
Fake media.

679
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,280
Duh.

680
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:22,980
MAGA.

681
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:26,720
Well, two days later, all of a sudden,

682
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,280
different story indeed.

683
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,620
The very same obese, wheezing senior and junior rednecks

684
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,240
have razed the store aisles for everything perishable,

685
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,080
since there's not much else left.

686
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,940
Uh, thanks to me.

687
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,440
They were the first ones to empty out

688
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,940
the Little Debbie's cookies.

689
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,120
Uh, but then they heard about

690
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,240
the fights over taters over to Burleson's at the Hebes,

691
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,380
so they scooped up all the taters here and the maters.

692
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,260
I hope they know how to can that stuff.

693
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,080
Uh, I hoarded way early, of course.

694
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,180
Uh, the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

695
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,340
We've been saying that for decades,

696
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,560
and I practiced what I preached.

697
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,260
What really surprises me, though,

698
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,960
is that the coffee and beer shelves look pretty much normal.

699
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,120
What are these people thinking?

700
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,200
They need to wipe their massive, fat butts more often

701
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,240
than they're gonna want a cup of java or a shiner's?

702
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,760
Are they that math impaired?

703
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,760
You know, I'm one of those people

704
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,060
that lives so much longer than I expected to

705
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,380
that now I covet life and would like to keep going with it

706
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,180
at least long enough to see the next few

707
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,360
Marvel superhero movies

708
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,500
and see my three grandsons get rich and famous.

709
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,980
Now, many of us subgeniuses have been practicing social distance,

710
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:49,100
and I'm not sure if that's true.

711
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,240
I mean, I've been practicing our whole lives,

712
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,600
although maybe involuntarily,

713
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,640
because nobody would go to bed with us

714
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,060
back when we wanted them to,

715
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,120
and everybody else sucked anyway.

716
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,540
Now, I'm, uh, probably fairly gregarious and huggy,

717
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,920
as subgeniuses go.

718
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,220
My first and second wives really worked on that.

719
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,700
And I had to work real jobs with the others most of my life,

720
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,960
but these days I'm really fine with living in the woods

721
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,460
a half mile from any road,

722
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,620
and 30 miles from any real box store-type civilization.

723
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,780
And yes, it is indeed darned heavenly,

724
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,240
and I deserve it even if I just lucked into it.

725
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,380
But nonetheless, the anxiety creeps in.

726
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,500
I'm a bit of a news hog.

727
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,420
I only read the news.

728
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,880
No radio or TV news for me,

729
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,200
because I read fast,

730
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,120
and I can cover all the main versions

731
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,220
of any given story that way.

732
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,780
Right wing, left wing, mainstream.

733
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,420
But at my own speed, which is pretty fast.

734
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,840
So, uh, but even without the shrill doomsaying

735
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,580
and the, uh, after this message of the radio TV crap,

736
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,180
the unpleasant true facts can build up and get to you.

737
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,620
I was thinking, I've got four houses full of my relatives

738
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:14,240
in this little tiny city-state that I call Stang Ranch.

739
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,200
That's not what they call it.

740
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,540
They call it the compound.

741
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,740
Um, I was thinking maybe my brother and I

742
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,580
should call a Klan-wide meeting,

743
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,240
but it would have to be by teleconference.

744
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,600
It's crazy.

745
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,120
Uh, uh...

746
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,360
Why would we teleconference when we all know perfectly well

747
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,720
we're all gonna die anyway when the town folks decide to storm

748
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,440
that big ranch just outside of town with the goats

749
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,720
and, uh, and slay us all for wearing glasses

750
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,000
and using big words

751
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,920
and just looking like we think we're smarter than them?

752
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,600
But, hey, it happened in Russia, China, and Cambodia

753
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,340
and other places.

754
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,820
60 million readers, intellectuals, and bilinguals

755
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,760
killed each in the first of those two cultural revolutions,

756
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,840
and it was even worse in Cambodia.

757
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,440
And that doesn't even count the reeducating in the work camps.

758
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,020
And it happened in Germany.

759
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,620
Probably what one might have thought

760
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,300
just about the most advanced country around that time.

761
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,720
Oh, I'm telling you, baby, that it can't happen here.

762
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,960
But my ear to the pavement tells me that the pinks' Internet talk

763
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,220
about civil war and taking the country back from the libtards

764
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,400
and the Jews and the Mexicans and the libtards,

765
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,280
you think they're so smart, and those Jews and those Mexicans,

766
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,020
they've been saying all that since I was a little kid

767
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,720
over a hundred years ago,

768
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,820
and I don't think they're any more likely this time

769
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,760
than last time that they're gonna be saying that.

770
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,980
And I think that's the only time to actually get off their asses,

771
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,920
especially now that they have the Internet to bluster on,

772
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,120
just like their infant man-child god-king.

773
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,180
Man, this is some fucked-up shit.

774
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,400
And yet I'm proceeding about my goofy business

775
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,140
pretty much as usual every day.

776
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,640
You know, wouldn't it be great if us smarty pants

777
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,780
were just overreacting to this?

778
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,780
That would kick ass.

779
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,280
Oh, the music in the background is Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

780
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,100
led by the late Chaz Smith,

781
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,880
Lonesome Cowboy Dave on guitar,

782
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,800
Michelle George on violin.

783
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,720
I think she's got a different name now.

784
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,680
And Bob Mosick on drums.

785
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,660
And it's the album called Witch Disco,

786
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,320
which I don't think you can actually get anymore.

787
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:43,380
Huh.

788
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,320
Price Bob, help me somebody.

789
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,100
Somebody...

790
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,940
Oh, oh, that's right.

791
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,880
If you're a prisoner and can't get on the Internet

792
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,880
and somehow hear this by radio,

793
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,760
you can write to us at Post Office Box 807,

794
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,680
Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

795
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,520
We sympathize with the prisoner.

796
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,760
We drive to Gatesville every month.

797
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,300
Except they're not allowing visitation now.

798
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,500
Hmm.

799
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,600
Uh, subgenius.com.

800
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,200
And thank you for all the help.

801
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,880
Those who helped and those who wanted to help.

802
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,680
Pray, Bob.

803
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,600
I to pieces.
