1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen? I know what's coming. Have I got to beat you to make you understand?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,960
It's the Super Genius Powerball Squadron!

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,580
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history. That much I know.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,400
Reverend Stang and Sister Lisa are back here in town.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,500
Yeah.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,320
Yes.

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm getting support from Russian warplanes.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,960
The BBBBC reports they're targeting 23 people and hundreds of homes.

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,180
The importance of the battle was not permissible.

10
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,120
The BBBBCCCC.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,260
On Monday, EU leaders will gather at a meeting hosted by PR News.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,880
PR News.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,940
Bob is claiming this is PR.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,300
In Boston, PR scape Bob reports something.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,060
Some Bobs are upset about gay pride.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,460
Saying that more people means more potential for gay pride and brutality.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,800
Less potential, not more.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,220
It's one of the many gay brutality parades taking place across the country today.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,960
Proceeds will be shared among murder victims.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,840
Gay Bob, who's serving two life sentences in federal prison, says this is PR News in Washington.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,080
And now, here are my predictions.

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,380
Listen.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,020
Listen carefully.

24
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,940
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow, today.

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,960
I predict public executions will be shown on television sponsored by your local gas company.

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,820
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,560
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming prediction period.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,940
Google built a free potato pie.

29
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,380
I...

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,000
You got the headline.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,880
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:13,020
If it were possible to spray small doses of LSD from an helicopter into the air, people would soon quieten and not be hurt.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,420
She is a cutie, isn't she?

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,080
What a girl.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,460
Right on campus as part of getting high.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,700
I mean, getting a higher education.

37
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,600
Which is just wonderful in any language.

38
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,600
Here's Bobby.

39
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,240
LSD is running its mad course.

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,860
With babies now being born hideously deformed from women whose chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,340
which was invented originally by the chemical warfare branch of the United States Army as a vicious weapon to be used against an enemy.

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,360
Here you see the heroic robots, the leadies, who defended San Francisco against the dastardly attack.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,000
The

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,900
LSD

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,900


46
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:54,960
LSD

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,120
LSD

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,620
LSD

49
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,700
LSD

50
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,120
LSD

51
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,500
LSD

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,540
LSD

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,340
LSD

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,840
LSD

55
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,580
LSD

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,680
LSD

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,680


58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,680


59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,680


60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,680


61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,680


62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:29,960
LSD

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:29,960


64
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:29,960


65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,480
LSD

66
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,000
LSD

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000


68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,400
LSD

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,400


70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,400


71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,400


72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,700
LSD

73
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:41,440
THEY WEIGH AFTER US.

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,920
THEY CAN KEEP US HANGING TOWARD ULTIMATE SOCIAL listening.

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,500
When they think of the TONIUM habr 320 websites, they think they are the Finding Manhattan and who the hell is Tony?

76
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,820
Dr. The video was made by The Ot sutmas science lab.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,240
Let's show how you gomaker could be right.

78
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,340


79
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,900
Huh?

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,580
Oh.

81
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,580


82
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:56,940
Six.

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,780
One.

84
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,640
Give it to me.

85
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,300
Oh, girl.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,760
Six.

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,760
One.

88
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
Give it to me.

89
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,480
Give it to me.

90
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,740
Give it to me.

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,460
Give it to me.

92
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,180
Give it to me, sir.

93
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,240
That's sweet, fuckers, sir.

94
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,220
Oh, ho.

95
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:09,900
Oh.

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,780
Oh, dear love, it's time to shine away.

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,900
It's time to shine away.

98
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,740
Oh, dear love.

99
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,800
It's got to shine away

100
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,960
It's got to shine away

101
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,320
Oh, see a fire is sweeping

102
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,100
Out the street today

103
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,560
Burns like a red gold carpet

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,360
Never close your eyes

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,060
Give it to me, baby

106
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,180
Give me shelter

107
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,020
Just give it to me, baby

108
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,940
Give it to me, baby

109
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,160
Give me shelter

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,340
I'll make you hot like a head if you know

111
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,860
Give it to me

112
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,060
It's just a kiss, it's just a kiss away

113
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,080
Give it to me

114
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,080
It's just a kiss, it's just a kiss away

115
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,820
Give it to me, give it to me

116
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,780
Give it to me, give it to me

117
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,540
Give me your stuff

118
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
That sweet fucker stuff

119
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,520
Oh, oh

120
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,120
Oh, oh

121
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,800
What you think?

122
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,660
What you think?

123
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,000
What you think?

124
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,080
It's got to shine away

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,460
What you think?

126
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,240
It's got to shine away

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,140
Oh, oh

128
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,020
Did you know?

129
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,680
What you think?

130
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,160
It's got to shine away

131
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,760
What you think?

132
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,220
It's got to shine away

133
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,760
Yeah

134
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,380
It's got to shine away

135
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,480
It's got to shine away

136
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,780
It's got to shine away

137
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,340
It's got to shine away

138
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
Yeah

139
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,440
It's got to shine away

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,460
Yeah

141
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,700
It's got to shine away

142
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,920
war so far here. We're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now and they're

143
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,180
they're a little bit hard to uh deactivate they get belligerent late at night but uh they seem to

144
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,140
be able to make it back to the barracks here. Okay start it now this is what we call the uh monster

145
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,740
beach party. Hey well so welcome to subgenius beach party yes last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

146
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:14,760
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is and don't you wish you did. Oh dear that ding

147
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,620
felt great. Well Dr. Howell is there any way you can fight through the sound effects and tell us

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,920
about the their relationship between the demopods and the well the demopods and the myriapods uh

149
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,660
got together. Oh the script we're supposed to I didn't understand that I thought you meant

150
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,160
meant this script right here the one with the red lines on the cover let's never read anything with

151
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,000
red dots I never believe anything with red dots never sign on the show too many buttons to push

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,160
too many tape recorders to watch.

153
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,480
It's obvious that during the game they should not have launched ahead with that size of rocket

154
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,300
they should have used a smaller rocket not hurt so many people some some perhaps but not so many

155
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,640
as it turned out JFK was turning to Governor Connolly to tell him the name of the band that

156
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,700
dare not speak his name and was shot because of that. And officers both plain clothes and

157
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,580
uniformed seemed to spring from everywhere at once guns drawn ordering people to lie flat.

158
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,200
There are two witnesses who were near the president's car

159
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,740
at the time of the exchange.

160
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Besides our Senseiления and the all human races wear had a long front

161
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:43,980
TO THE MIXER

162
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
I will take it away from you.

163
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,600
For Bob is he who hath wisdom.

164
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,020
Let he who hath wisdom know it is the wallet of a man, dear friends.

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
And as Pope Sternodocs Keekever said,

166
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,740
The only reason any subgenius is still alive is that all pigs are such craven, cringing, godless wonders.

167
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,480
Actually, I don't think those were his exact words.

168
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,720
We had to kind of clean that down a little bit.

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:19,800
But, as Bob said, in 1954 on a radio broadcast on WFMU,

170
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,880
Howdy WFMU in East Orange, New Jersey,

171
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,920
Bob said, you can forgive them first, but then kill them.

172
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,920
And, you know, that's the open-hearted, tolerant way that we the subgeniuses like to think.

173
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,680
Because there's a difference.

174
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,240
There is the difference.

175
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,940
And that's what we are.

176
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,700
That's what we make.

177
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,120
Because subgeniuses are different.

178
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,860
In a way that makes so sexuality, creed, or mental health, or taste and color,

179
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:01,740
those are all inconsequential, meaningless, compared to the difference between the subgenius and the human.

180
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,760
Now, we've all heard of the derogatory terms any young subgenius growing up in school hears.

181
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,700
The words like Bobobbies, Dobbsies, Pipeface.

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,900
Submorons, subhumans, subpenises, and so forth and so on.

183
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,980
And such insults usually stem from dunderheaded misreadings.

184
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Conscious, deliberate misreadings, I might say, of the word subgeniuses, meaning either superintelligent or stupid.

185
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,360
And actually, those have nothing to do with it.

186
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,120
The word encompasses almost any IQ level.

187
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,600
We are not friends saying that we're smarter than the normals.

188
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,580
We've never said that.

189
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,300
We're only saying that we are better.

190
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,820
Better than the human.

191
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,460
They're the only ones that measure, that think they can actually measure intelligence.

192
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,900
And they usually use income as their main yardstick, of course.

193
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,140
The subgenius form of intelligence would be calibrated in intangible units.

194
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,220
Units of intangibles.

195
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,740
And we cannot stress this enough.

196
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,460
It's not that the normals...

197
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,660
are unintelligent.

198
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,280
It's that they're not even all there.

199
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
They're half there.

200
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,800
It's not the lack, but the non-use of it.

201
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,560
It's like they're wandering through a dream.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Characters in somebody else's cartoon world.

203
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,380
In my case, my cartoon world.

204
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,600
The things that we recognize as mere convenient mental constructs,

205
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,660
such as jobs or money, are totally real to the poor humans.

206
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Pity that not.

207
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,560
Yeah.

208
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,280
You know, we see the bars of a cage that they don't even know they're in.

209
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,980
But to them, we look crazy.

210
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,960
Because our response to that cage, such as what I'm saying right now,

211
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,920
cannot, cannot, my friend, make sense to them.

212
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,900
And it never, ever will.

213
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,920
Now, you know, we might as well be living on two different planets.

214
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,080
If only we were.

215
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,760
Oh, well.

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,000
Thanks, Jimmy.

217
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,860
Well, hell, I'll just keep reading from Revelation X.

218
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,860
I've got plenty of tapes to play, but I love this old unreleased tune in the background,

219
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,900
Valley of Neptune.

220
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,560
You know, true intelligence lies in knowing what you don't know.

221
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,400
We know that.

222
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,160
And that's what makes us twice as smart as all the know-it-alls.

223
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,660
That's our curse, the curse of Bob.

224
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,180
They say ignorance is bliss, my friend, and they are right about that one.

225
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
When you're the only one in the crowd that knows that the showers are really bad,

226
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,560


227
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,720
and gas chambers, it's kind of hard to look forward to getting clean now, ain't it?

228
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,080
Do you think it is fun?

229
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Do you think it is funny?

230
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,080
Oh, for us to know something that no one else knows,

231
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,760
even when that something is the mass murder of billions, including yourself?

232
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,060
We know.

233
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,900
We know, and yet, we cannot tell.

234
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,400
Why? Because no one will listen.

235
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,460
Once, Swami Bhagwananda said to Dobbs,

236
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,460
Are you not interested in discovering that which lies beyond the veil of illusion?

237
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,460
And Dobbs said,

238
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,080
Hell no!

239
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm interested in what's behind the veil of ordinary reality.

240
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,400
Friends, mundane ordinary perception is a lack of perspective.

241
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,580
In ordinary consciousness, the most trivial things become ulcerously stressful,

242
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,140
lost in a world of illusion, fixated on superficial fantasies,

243
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,940
like the job.

244
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:48,200
Any interruption of the daily routine throws the pink into a frenzy of paranoia.

245
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,140
The pink loses sight of the rich texture of the all,

246
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,440
and frets all out of proportion over transitory setbacks and silly obstacles

247
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,340
that exist only within its cramped, blinkered frame of reference.

248
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,280
The subgenius, on the other hand,

249
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,740
maintains a perfect objective detachment, such as mine,

250
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,120
and never loses sight of the reality.

251
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,800
The magical bull-dutter which infuses every daily experience.

252
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,840
For instance, a subgenius suffers a blowout on the highway.

253
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,320
Well, while pulling off the road and watching out for the other cars

254
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,960
out of everything else that's happening,

255
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,320
she happens to notice that the tire is flapping in perfect time

256
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,720
to the beat of the music on the car radio.

257
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,140
Do you hear that flapping, my friend, out there driving in your car tonight?

258
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,120
Do you hear that flapping, my friend, out there driving in your car tonight?

259
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,560
Do you hear that flapping, my friend, out there driving in your car tonight?

260
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,740
Do you hear that flapping in time to the music on the car radio?

261
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,800
Do you hear that flapping in time to the music on the car radio?

262
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,280
Or are you just now rolling and bumping off to the side of the road,

263
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,280
left behind by all the other traffic,

264
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,980
the other traffic which one might say was closer to mom at that time,

265
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,400
but for the fact that they don't know what the hell they're doing

266
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
and weren't listening to this show, and you were,

267
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,200
so it's worth it if you have to get out of that car and change that tire.

268
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,880
Just don't do it until you then.

269
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,900
This show's over with.

270
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,460
Just sit there by the side of the road until the cops come up,

271
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,640
and then pretend you're crippled and have them do it for you.

272
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,520
Praise Bob.

273
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,420
Ask not what the conspiracy can do for you.

274
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,900
No, wait.

275
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,440
Ask not what you can do for the conspiracy.

276
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,140
Ask what the conspiracy can do for you.

277
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,500
An old, old saying, and all of this stuff that I'm reading tonight

278
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,280
from our Bible revelation acts, it's old, old stuff,

279
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,520
but you know, you cannot get enough of it.

280
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,560
No subgenius can ever hear enough of the word of Bob,

281
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,180
especially if read by the voice of Reverend Ivan Stang.

282
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,360
Because the subgenius, you see, benefits from a residual racial memory

283
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,940
that can be reached by certain paths and used as a new sense.

284
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,920
But because it is a new sense, it cannot be described to pinks

285
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,620
or defined in any human language or system of symbols,

286
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,900
but must be felt through to be properly understood,

287
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,500
even otherwise.

288
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,340
On the most basic level and only latent subgeni have that capacity,

289
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,980
that sense of appreciation, of values, of real values,

290
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,840
which transcends prices, fashion, social status,

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,760
or even, even looks.

292
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,100
Yes, even, even looks.

293
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,900
Well, thank you.

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,820
I think the jam just sort of fell apart,

295
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,320
and we'll continue.

296
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,640
With, there are these readings

297
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,900
that to some point.

298
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,420
Kill again-kill again.

299
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,700
Kill again.

300
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,180
Kill again-kill again.

301
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,240
Kill again-kill again.

302
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,360
Kill again.

303
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:48,740
Kill again.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,160
Kill again-kill again.

305
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
Kill again-kill again.

306
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:50,900
Kill again-kill again.

307
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:50,900


308
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,000
Get get get get get get back!

309
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,740
get back!

310
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,720
kill again and get back!

311
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,840
kill again

312
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,740
kill again and get back!

313
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,800
kill again

314
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,720
kill again and get back!

315
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,820
kill again

316
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,240
kill again

317
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,020
kill again

318
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,140
get get get get get back!

319
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,120
get back.

320
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,500
bli-li-li-li

321
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,840
And this is great. It's fantastic for connecting.

322
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,240
This is terrible.

323
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,940
A threat to our certainty.

324
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,360
I want you to look into your heart.

325
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,800
And you're to love even your enemies, the scripture says.

326
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,860
Right now we're in the last days as foretold in the book of Revelation.

327
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,560
Last days. You mean the coming of the apocalypse, right? The rapture.

328
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,360
And I get to see it firsthand and that's all I focus on.

329
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,380
So understand that wherever you go.

330
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,240
That's not something you see every day, that's for sure.

331
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,160
I'll be glad to just get out of this place. I've never seen so much devastation.

332
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,940
And you know what else? It's very spooky riding around in it.

333
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,820
A wave of energy that goes through my body that is congruent with the truth that I am made out of.

334
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,640
Because I can't be made of anything else, right?

335
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,480
Again, the math has to be perfect, otherwise I cease to exist.

336
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,560
If you saw me on the street without the suit on, you'd probably say,

337
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,420
there goes a total dope fiend.

338
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,340
You'd feel aversion and walk away.

339
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
I don't look like you. I can't afford to.

340
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,320
And I think if you can observe to some degree reality as it is,

341
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,660
you won't just be a much better person,

342
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,980
but you'll probably be a much more peaceful and happy person.

343
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,640
All right, I'll go do that again.

344
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,820
It's a different mindset and we're evolving into this.

345
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,820
And the reason why...

346
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,780
I think it's going to have to happen is because...

347
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,140
God's dealing with things.

348
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,360
Take the belief that you have, something innocuous,

349
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,560
a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being, well, it doesn't affect my life now.

350
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,120
I believe that I might get fish and chips tonight or a curry.

351
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,240
Choose something around a 2, 3 scale mark,

352
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,840
10 being I believe the world's just about to blow up and I'm the cause of everything.

353
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,280
If you would like to become a member of the Canadian Armed Forces

354
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,240
and serve your Queen,

355
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,540
whoever she might be,

356
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
and your country poundly,

357
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,980
please step through this magnetic door.

358
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,140
There's the bull hunks.

359
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,620
There's the Nornax.

360
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,440
There's the hay-bom-boink-dingers.

361
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,420
There's the hay-date-

362
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,660
Go on back to your frozen wasteland and leave the fight to us, you pussies.

363
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,980
You know, if they were serious about the war on terrorism,

364
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,760
wouldn't they have sent more troops in there immediately?

365
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,100
Yeah, well, that's true of everybody.

366
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,660
Who's...

367
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,720
Well, I mean, who's been in there getting their butts shot up?

368
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,780
The Northern Alliance. I mean, the Americans.

369
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,800
Or whoever.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,400
Yeah, who...

371
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,640
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes

372
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,900
against our staunch friend, Canada,

373
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,980
more than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across the...

374
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,120
Codini is a mystic.

375
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,920
...seer.

376
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,180
Mystic Codini.

377
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,160
Codini. Dr. Codini.

378
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
All hail Dr. Codini,

379
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,060
for he is a mystic seer of future events.

380
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,080
Listen to this thing he made two months ago.

381
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,760
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes

382
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,120
against our staunch friend, Great Britain,

383
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,820
Australia, Germany, and France, Canada,

384
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,200
more than 40 countries in the Middle East.

385
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,280
He just got the order wrong, that's all.

386
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,900
They killed Flippa.

387
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,380
Great Britain's next. Australia.

388
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,200
They killed that little white dog with the brown spot on his eye.

389
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,840
And then they killed everybody in the whole town.

390
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,540
Well, the people in Canada are queen worshippers too, aren't they?

391
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,500
Aren't they idolaters?

392
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,620
They're a bunch of modest quippers.

393
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,360
They worship the mother instead of the son of...

394
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,640
the king of... the son of God.

395
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,520
Yeah, man, think of it that way.

396
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,180
And you spend a long time thinking over the...

397
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,740
See what happens to your eyeball.

398
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,840
And their women are real.

399
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,620
They're real loose too.

400
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,780
And they don't have...

401
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,900
That's why they deserve it.

402
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,520
They have loose women morals.

403
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,200
Yeah, their limbs are all like...

404
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,800
Their women are morally loose.

405
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
Like when they're walking, their limbs go...

406
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,100
Don't they have some kind of prime ministers or parliaments or something like...

407
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,700
And he talks much like this, the prime minister of Canada.

408
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,640
I am deeply regretful of the incidents which happened today.

409
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,000
And their minorities speak French.

410
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,840
What kind of a minority speaks French?

411
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,340
I know.

412
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,580
That doesn't make any sense.

413
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,820
An Asian minority.

414
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,420
They're... they're...

415
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,800
If you're French, you're supposed to be in the majority over somebody else.

416
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
If you're any kind of a real Frenchman.

417
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
Well, is there?

418
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,860
I mean, give...

419
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,460
You're not supposed to be playing hockey.

420
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,220
You're not supposed to...

421
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,020
But they're not Frenchmen, right?

422
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,580
They're Canadians.

423
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,160
So...

424
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,200
So they don't...

425
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,140
We're all targets now, man.

426
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,720
We're all targets now.

427
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,340
Everybody.

428
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,240
I'd be careful next time I went on the RTA, man.

429
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,120
I'd... I'd be...

430
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,500
Well, this signal skips right over the lake.

431
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,880
The Canadians can hear us.

432
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,200
We're conne... We're targets of... of... of them.

433
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,660
Borders are shut down.

434
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:05,900
They're shut down tonight.

435
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,560
In, uh...

436
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:07,900
Really?

437
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,260
Yeah.

438
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,840
In memory of George Bush.

439
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,300
Oh, George...

440
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,060
George is doing a lockdown now.

441
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,040
Well, and they locked down the Canadian border?

442
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,100
Yeah.

443
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,480
Didn't they, uh, close the internet, too?

444
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,460
And... and...

445
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,200
But Bush declared that MP3 pirates were terrorists.

446
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:25,940
Yeah.

447
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,100
I mean, pe... you know, people who download stuff from... from those, uh, Napster-like

448
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,460
things.

449
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,380
Yeah, Grokster.

450
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,800
Yeah, that's... that's terrorism now.

451
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,120
They have synthesized...

452
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,880
They have synthesized some of these psychotic genes in his head now.

453
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,060
Those are, uh, dope smokers.

454
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,880
Oh, dope smokers.

455
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,240
Those are definitely terrorists.

456
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:41,980
That would have been... that would have been...

457
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,720
And, you know, I see those commercials, and the only thing I can think of is...

458
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,060
They've been locked down for weeks now.

459
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,760
...Buy American.

460
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,480
Yeah, by God, if you're going to smoke dope, buy that great Humboldt County stuff.

461
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,080
Man, I'm glad you guys are explaining all this, because, you know, I'm from Texas, and

462
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,580
we don't...

463
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,600
Yeah, be careful of people you drink...

464
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,540
We don't cotton to no Canadians.

465
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,300
We never saw anybody from Canadians.

466
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,940
So, if you see someone drinking a Molson's or a Moosehead at a bar...

467
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,100
I...

468
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,100


469
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,400
...you feel free to execute them, military style.

470
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,460
Or if you see some...

471
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,340
You see some fat guy with a 50, oh, you gotta go right there.

472
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,560
You gotta do them right on the spot.

473
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,000
But are...

474
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
Are the Canadians our enemies, or...

475
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,660
Everybody's our enemy.

476
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,280
Everybody's our enemy.

477
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,020
If you're...

478
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,160
If you're with us, we're against you.

479
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,260
Oh, that's right.

480
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,620
They're confused, Dan.

481
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:21,880
Yeah.

482
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,340
They don't know what they're doing.

483
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,820
They don't see the true light, or even the purple one there on the left.

484
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,960
They're just confused about everything, and they need to be shown...

485
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,080
My friends' friends is my enemy.

486
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,540
They be shown the yolk.

487
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:34,940
Step in.

488
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,320
Step in, please.

489
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,060
Ah, Mr. Kinnock, you're gonna like this yolk.

490
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,120
It's got a freeze compartment right here, and there's little pucks hanging from it, and...

491
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,700
Yeah, can't we, like, just enslave the Canadians, and, you know...

492
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,540
People of Canada...

493
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,080
We try...

494
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,740
This is a message from the United States of America.

495
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,020
Prepare to take on the shackles of slavery.

496
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,040
We will march through your country.

497
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,740
We will destroy your armies.

498
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,140
Your streets will run red with your blood.

499
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,160
We shall rape your women and your caribou.

500
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,100
Not to mention your moose.

501
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,160
And that will be the fun part.

502
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,860
And your moose.

503
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,440
And actually, another thing...

504
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,280
Your beer is our beer.

505
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,300
Each individual Canadian family has...

506
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,260
Deadly daylight cannot save you.

507
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,480
Abandon your worship of the hawk gods of the sky.

508
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,680
Prepare, as we shall melt your cities of ice.

509
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,120
And so...

510
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,480
Leguim's voice will be the only voice they can hear over the lake.

511
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,060
And we'll put all kinds of reverb on it.

512
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,820
Yeah, at that moment, at that very moment, the weather was just perfect,

513
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,980
and the signal skipped over the clouds.

514
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:47,440
The most paranoid guy with his hand on the button of their one little nuclear-tipped warhead.

515
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,660
Their secret one.

516
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,000
Canada is a nuclear-free zone thing.

517
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,280
I'll have you know that.

518
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,680
Canada is a nuclear-free zone.

519
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,660
I kind of take a little regress to that remark.

520
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,600
Yeah, everybody's got a nuclear-free zone, right?

521
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,080
Sure, everybody's got a nuke in their pocket.

522
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,920
Everybody's...

523
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,100
I had to have my air conditioner recharged, and they used the nuclear-free zone on that.

524
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,040
Oh, they'd use nuclear energy to clean your air conditioner?

525
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,180
No, that's nuclear energy. That's different.

526
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,780
Nuclear.

527
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,580
Uh, nuclear.

528
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,780
Yeah, there's nuclear and nuclear.

529
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,080
Well, what is...

530
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,180
Those are two different things.

531
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,020
What is nuclear?

532
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,300
And nuclear.

533
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,920
Well, one is really dangerous and poisons everything for 90,000 years,

534
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,000
and the other one is just...

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,040
It's not that bad.

536
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,600
The other one makes you pop corn.

537
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,580
Any friend in need...

538
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,980
is an enemy, indeed.

539
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,900
It's the sign that your world is coming apart.

540
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:43,100
You're sitting in front of your table having your same old lackluster sandwich,

541
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,580
and who flies in through the window?

542
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,420
The world is ending, that's who.

543
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,280
And you're sitting on a stump by yourself.

544
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,320
Those Canadian soldiers.

545
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,420
Beware of the Canadian soldiers.

546
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,620
It's their season.

547
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,680
One tin soldier rides away.

548
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,780
They're well-armed, man.

549
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,180
They got all this stuff, man.

550
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,020
They got the funny hats.

551
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,840
They're well-armed, man.

552
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,220
Don't mess with them.

553
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,620
We just ran about...

554
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,220
We're really sorry, Canada.

555
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,440
...coming in from...

556
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,780
Yeah, this is kind of...

557
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,080
This is a sick humor show.

558
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,720
You shouldn't take anything we say seriously.

559
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,980
This is all just...

560
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,840
Please don't.

561
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,040
Yeah, we don't...

562
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,380
Because there are people in London.

563
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,160
I've gotten letters and emails from people in London, Ontario,

564
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,380
that they collect...

565
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,500
They do get this station.

566
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,400
We see...

567
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,380
And we are sorry.

568
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,660
We are sorry.

569
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,780
It was a Canadian that went into Janine today.

570
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,840
You know how those guys are.

571
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,620
That were this way.

572
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,120
There are good Canadians.

573
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,840
There are some good Canadians.

574
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,500
There's a few.

575
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,600
Mostly up in Toronto.

576
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,180
They must be judged individually on their merits,

577
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,740
and they must stand trial.

578
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,060
So, Anthony Faulkner is a good Canadian.

579
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,460
He's the guy that puts the hour of slack on the internet.

580
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,660
Well, they probably should nuke Vancouver.

581
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm contaminated with E. coli.

582
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,380
Republicans are furthering the understanding of the trade-offs

583
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,560
between lurid emails and the effects on E. coli.

584
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:12,000
So far, the United States and Australia are contaminated with PR News in Washington.

585
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,680
We keep theה

586
00:27:59,940 --> 00:27:59,940


587
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,600
uk

588
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,800
Thank you.

589
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,980
Thank you.

590
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,160
Thank you.

591
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,900
Thank you.

592
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,060
I'm going to come out the other side and I'm going to just...

593
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:15,000
There's some physiological basis to this feeling of knowing that is so powerful

594
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:22,200
that it makes our rational thoughts seem, feel wrong or irrelevant.

595
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,840
And he felt that...

596
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,960
Wait, let me get this straight.

597
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,460
You're going to pay me $200 to put on a hairnet and bang some beautiful babe?

598
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,540
I don't know. I got to think about this.

599
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,120
Let's get you wired up.

600
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,460
I just started...

601
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,240
It is extremely dangerous.

602
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
If the upload volume exceeds your storage capacity,

603
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,160
synaptic seepage can kill you in two or three days.

604
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,820
Plus, the data may be corrupted and coherent download will be impossible.

605
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,560
We don't have a problem with that, okay?

606
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,820
Okay.

607
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,640
Okay.

608
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,400
We don't have a problem with that.

609
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:58,960
Nope.

610
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,280
And that...

611
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,880
Oh, hello, friends.

612
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,480
This is Hour of Slack number 1,727.

613
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,120
Whoa.

614
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,220
And Princess Wee is here in the WCSB studios.

615
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:20,320
And Silas Jansen did that media barrage we were just listening to

617
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,920
and also a bit of collage like that earlier.

618
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,020
Reverend Silas Jansen and that jazzy music there

619
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:35,100
was a tune called Pushing My Agenda by the Psychoskeletons.

620
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,500
PR news and our titles come from Fernand and Andy Lemur.

621
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,580
We heard some old ESO Swamp Radio,

622
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,380
classic stuff from the year of 2002

623
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,340
with the late Chaz Smith,

624
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,540
who introduced us to this station, you might say, in a way.

625
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:58,800
Yes.

626
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,440
And Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the late Dr. LeGime

627
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,080
called in on that.

628
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,760
Let's see.

629
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,880
There was some really old ranting by me

630
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,500
from our out-of-print book, Revelation X.

631
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,060
In fact, that was stuff that later got cut and shortened.

632
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,000
Not even in the book, I don't think, a lot of it.

633
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,480
And we heard some puzzling evidence show from the 80s

634
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,960
from KPFA Berkeley.

635
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,640
That show's still on.

636
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,320
Since 1982.

637
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:32,880
Goodness.

638
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,840
It was actually the first subgenius regular show.

639
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,680
Because this show didn't start until 1985.

640
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,700
And we've been on

641
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,220
89.3 FM at 9 o'clock Sunday nights

642
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,560
in either of two cities since that time, since 1985.

643
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,600
Wow.

644
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,000
Because the one in Dallas,

645
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,540
was just like the one here in that respect.

646
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,520
And what, oh, the mashup of Rolling Stones and Rick James

647
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,280
was by Bill McClintock,

648
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,540
who also did the great mashups I played about a month ago.

649
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,800
And some old Media Barrage stuff

650
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,540
from our ancient Media Barrage tapes,

651
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,960
which I was handling today.

652
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,980
The cassettes, the old cassettes, the old cassettes,

653
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,480
most of the church and subgenius are still in Cleveland.

654
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,720
And I was packing them up to take to Texas.

655
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,840
Where they will be safe from the likes of lonesome cowboy Dave.

656
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,400
señaló

657
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,140
Scratch the whole thing,

658
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,260
No, no, Dave.

659
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,200
No, don't feel putrid and hel-ness?

660
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,620
Hell yesh.

661
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,300
So thanks for myself.

662
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,580
Hell yesh.

663
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,260
Thanks for, I appreciate that.

664
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,600
That cheered me up a little bit.

665
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,820
Well, she ordered you not to feel that way,

666
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,040
so step to it.

667
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,360
If you slip to it, I'm going to bitch slap you.

668
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,080
No, I wasn't.

669
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,640
We want that to happen, would we?

670
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,740
No, no, no, sorry, Bob.

671
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,420
No, and I won't let him bitch slap you anyway, so.

672
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,540
Princess, we, earlier today,

673
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:29,000
Dave and I were whining together off the air

674
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,600
about our, the pain.

675
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,440
Oh, the pain.

676
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:34,780
The pain.

677
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,660
The pain.

678
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,000
I had an experience last night.

679
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,140
A local punk band,

680
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,300
who was not alive when punk was going on, of course,

681
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,520
was one of the new vinyl freaks kids.

682
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,380
Uh-huh.

683
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,080
And they're doing a cover of a song that we did.

684
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,820
And they had this party,

685
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,680
and it was like revisiting 1979 or something like that.

686
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,180
Wow.

687
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,800
And it was weird.

688
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,880
They were covering a song that you did

689
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,100
when you were in the Clocks,

690
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,980
or was it the Einstein's Secret Orchestra, or what?

691
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,000
It was the Chronics.

692
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,360
The Chronics.

693
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:14,680
Wow.

694
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,900
Test to Baby.

695
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,560
And they did their own version,

696
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,720
and I felt humbled and moderately esteemed,

697
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,680
and speaking of steam in your underpants,

698
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
when you've had them in the theater for too long,

699
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,560
shouldn't it be a crime?

700
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,160
Or at least the antithesis, you know what I mean?

701
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,720
Yeah, the antithesis of steam in your underpants.

702
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,500
Right, I know.

703
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,320
And where's the synthesis?

704
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,080
Where's Karl Marx was rolling around over in his grave?

705
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,660
Right.

706
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,140
In Highgate Cemetery.

707
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,760
Can't you just spray him with, like, chlorine or something?

708
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,180
Who, Karl Marx?

709
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:52,700
No.

710
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,960
No, your underwear.

711
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,140
Well, either one, you know.

712
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,880
Sure, Karl.

713
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,400
But Karl Marx, he's a mummy now, right?

714
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,780
Yeah, he's in Highgate Cemetery.

715
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,420
He's a tryptophan mummy.

716
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,680
He looks like his goose is cooked.

717
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,720
Well, so do we, Dave.

718
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,080
Yep.

719
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,520
Yep.

720
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,100
So do we.

721
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,280
Don't even get all complained.

722
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,280
Never mind, I'm sorry.

723
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,140
That band covering the old ancient song,

724
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,260
from Dave's youth.

725
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:23,980
Yes.

726
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,980
They were probably thinking, Dave is a mummy.

727
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,740
Wow, look how old this guy.

728
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,840
They're like Tenacious D and Dio.

729
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,600
Yeah.

730
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,720
Ronnie James Dio.

731
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,080
Yeah.

732
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,240
You know, they just, they respect him as a master,

733
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,340
but of course, they wear the crown now.

734
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,960
He has to hand over the crown.

735
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,660
That's right.

736
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,420
Yeah.

737
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,500
So Dave, are you gonna hand over the punk crown to this?

738
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,200
I don't know, but it's kinda like the same size as the inner tube.

739
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,540
Inner tube.

740
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,360
That would mean you're a macrocephalic, right?

741
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,180
And you don't want those macrocephalic kids

742
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,020
getting out there playing volleyball with all the other kids

743
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,760
because it just causes a whole lot of trouble.

744
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,320
Right.

745
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:02,880
You know what I mean?

746
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,600
As a parent.

747
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,820
I know.

748
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,440
Yeah.

749
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,680
Or as a re-parent.

750
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,420
It's apparent to me too.

751
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,140
Yeah.

752
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,120
Well, I'm...

753
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,860
I remember you confessing the blues the many times

754
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,440
that the child hammers and the finger lickers and all that,

755
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,280
you know, different factions got involved.

756
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,220
Right.

757
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,180
Right.

758
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,760
I wouldn't.

759
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,240
I wouldn't either.

760
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:32,260
I'm sorry I was distracted by this CD player here.

761
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,860
It was set on single instead of continuous.

762
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,880
How can this be?

763
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,020
What is the meaning of this?

764
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,660
You've been tricked.

765
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,620
Yeah.

766
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,160
Yeah, that's a special effect.

767
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,120
It makes only the first track of the CD play.

768
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,260
Yeah.

769
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


770
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


771
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


772
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


773
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


774
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


775
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


776
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


777
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


778
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


779
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


780
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


781
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,260


782
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,600
And then it doesn't automatically play the next one, see.

783
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,240
Grrr.

784
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,200
It projects you in the hyperbolic space.

785
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:56,760
Yeah.

786
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,160
We have to have a rug in the background the whole time.

787
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,240
Something that can be pulled out from under you, Dave.

788
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,300
Well, I can have the rug pulled out from under me,

789
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,440
but I certainly cannot make the fine acoustic chicken smells

790
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,260
of the deluxe Barko Ranger New Planet Therian Huggins

791
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,260
where they take the entire walls and fill it with egg cartons.

792
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,260
And boy, does that slow the resonance down into a wonderful mesh

793
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,020
that you can use all night long as you're, you know,

794
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,620
not afraid of the results.

795
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,160
No, all the really cool sound studios do that.

796
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,000
It makes the bands sound better.

797
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,220
Yeah.

798
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,340
It's like, okay, you want a little echo or reverb on that?

799
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,820
Do what Elvis did.

800
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,520
Go over and buy the Coke machine there.

801
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,160
Excuse me for mentioning a product named the soda machine over there.

802
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,260
Well, there's a lot of stuff.

803
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,800
You know, the reason they have the rug, the music rug underneath you,

804
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,320
is so that when they pull it out from under you,

805
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,880
they can record the pratfall because that prat sound that you make

806
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,080
when you land flat on your back makes a great rhythm track

807
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,700
for, you know, these techno songs.

808
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,780
Yeah, I just think it's all multi-layered, too.

809
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,560
Anything like a broken scapula or a wing nut or a track track.

810
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,360
We actually used the sound of a scapula breaking

811
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,880
as a drum sound on a sampler.

812
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,320
A percussive sound, yes.

813
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,240
A percussive sound.

814
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,440
We accidentally got a good, clean recording of the long-ago Pastor Craig

815
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,640
falling off the back of a large man

816
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,040
because Craig was naked and covered with slick food coloring

817
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,900
or red body paint.

818
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,220
Reddy butt body paint.

819
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,820
And in front of him, they were wrestling.

820
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,940
They were wrestling.

821
00:39:51,940 --> 00:40:00,880
And he fell, he was sort of thrown off this bucking pope, Pope Fred.

822
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:07,780
And he hit the tarp right in front of where I was filming at a very low angle.

823
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,100
You heard this snap and then a scream, continuous screaming.

824
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,860
And we isolated those sounds.

825
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,220
Yes.

826
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,160
And made a nice little backup track of snap and scream rhythm.

827
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:22,660
Yeah.

828
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:23,660
Yeah.

829
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,160
Now see, if I was a good DJ, I'd whip that out.

830
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,160
I'd pull out that recording right now.

831
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,540
And if we were good DJettes, we'd be right next to you going,

832
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,020
Whip it out, baby, whip it out.

833
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,320
And then you would drag speed to whip it out and we'd go,

834
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:36,760
Ehhh.

835
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,900
And then the FCC would find the station, but we'd be famous

836
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,500
and we'd be on Sirius Radio getting paid.

837
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,200
Well, as long as it's not like that.

838
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,060
I said it's Facial Book or some other social mediums.

839
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,220
Well, we're there too.

840
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,780
We're there too, Dave.

841
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,380
I'm sorry.

842
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,360
But we are.

843
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,240
The princess is made.

844
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,460
Yeah.

845
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:07,720
Some people first tune in the Hour of Slack through Facebook.

846
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,300
Yeah.

847
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,720
If you can imagine that.

848
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,860
No.

849
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,960
I can't.

850
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,820
I think it's a worm ridden idea.

851
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:23,160
There are in fact seven Facebook pages where I post the links to the show

852
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,380
as soon as I put them online.

853
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:30,080
And the listen online is always on mine on the nights that I'm going to do a broadcast.

854
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,400
Yeah.

855
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,620
Princess Wee advertises the show.

856
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,700
Half an hour before we leave for the station, she always sends out an alert.

857
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,680
Yes.

858
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,420
I thought you just called it a lurch.

859
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,620
Well, both.

860
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,160
Yeah.

861
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,720
Sometimes.

862
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,940
You rang.

863
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,660
So what are you playing in the background?

864
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,540
The washerwoman?

865
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,740
Kind of.

866
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,480
It's a Japanese Irish jig from the game Monster Hunter.

867
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,180
Ah.

868
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,060
It goes with the little cat village.

869
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,420
The cat villagers, I think.

870
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,040
I think it's some Japanese people playing the washerwoman's house.

871
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,580
Oh, it sounds like Lucky Charms.

872
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,280
That's what it is.

873
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,140
Yes, it is.

874
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,460
I don't know this.

875
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I don't know.

876
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,140
I don't want to go.

877
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,280
So, yeah, yeah.

878
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,920
A little Japanese Irish cats jigging around.

879
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,500
Isn't that cute?

880
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,020
Holding hands, dreaming of the day when the country will once again be free from the pertubes

881
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,200
that bend out of every different fallen direction.

882
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,360
It's a hard time living these days today because at any time a war could break out among us.

883
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,340
Yeah.

884
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,260
Yeah.

885
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,980
Oh, yeah.

886
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,680
Wars are, aren't they, aren't there about five wars that are supposed to break out any

887
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,500
second now?

888
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,840
Yeah.

889
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,920
Mr. What's his name?

890
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,760
Mr. Schnozzle?

891
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,020
John Bolton or whatever his name is, wants to go to war with Iran, which I heard a lot

892
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,540
of interesting people saying that Mr. Bolton should be given a rifle until he'll go and

893
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:10,260
do it himself if he wants to order off millions of good American citizens to their, to foreign

894
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,240
battlefields.

895
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:20,700
Well, that's, it's, well, there's important rich people who want to own all that.

896
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,660
There's still oil there.

897
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,420
Yeah, there's oil too.

898
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,420
How come they're so acquisitive?

899
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,880
Did you ever wonder that?

900
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,300
Do you think there might be something spiritually imbalanced about these folks?

901
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,660
Oh, it's just what animals do.

902
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,680
They try to increase their territory.

903
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,480
Right.

904
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,080
It's just, it goes with, it's the circle of life.

905
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,480
It's the circle of life and cruelty, bullies and alpha males and all that.

906
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,240
It's nature bred in tooth and claw.

907
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,100
That's what Alistair Crowley said because he was a pig himself.

908
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,080
Well, yeah.

909
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,900
It's the conspiracy, but it's been there forever.

910
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,360
I mean, to the, to the-

911
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,940
Oh yeah, just think about the winged, Isis and Osiris winged, winged, winged, winged.

912
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,320
I mean, just think of them and then go, uh.

913
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,600
I mean, to the, to the zebras, the lions are the conspiracy, I guess.

914
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,780
Yeah, I'd take it that way.

915
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,280
But who knows?

916
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,300
Who are the hyenas?

917
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,240
They're the, they're the presumptive railroad bosses and the-

918
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,860
No, well, they're the, they're the conspiracy to the lions.

919
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,920
The lions consider the hyenas to be the conspiracy because they're just vampires.

920
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,300
You know, they just, they just, they wait for the lions to kill them.

921
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,160
They kill something and then they come in and steal off all the rotten meat.

922
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,320
They make people laugh too all the time, make themselves laugh.

923
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,780
No.

924
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,120
No.

925
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,600
Actually, they don't really sound like they're laughing.

926
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,760
They sound fiendishly wild and savage.

927
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,280
Yeah.

928
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,060
And dangerous.

929
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,540
Kind of scary.

930
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,520
Yeah.

931
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,060
And the way they're built, it's just to see their, all the forward motion that goes into that indelicate balance.

932
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,260
It's just enough to make you want to-

933
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:08,760
Yeah.

934
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:16,280
You know, I think I've heard people cry out in the rain sometime that you poor, full-eyed revolution, they're never going to catch up with you.

935
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,820
You know what?

936
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,500
I could swear though, I think I recently saw a YouTube video of somebody with a pet hyena that he had raised from a pup.

937
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,300
And it was this most loving, it acted just like our dog, Claudia.

938
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:28,820
Aww.

939
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,640
It was just like a sweet little dog, but it was a hyena.

940
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:33,660
Goodness.

941
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,060
Which, it wasn't grown.

942
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,940
It wasn't a grown hyena.

943
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,280
It was still a little.

944
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:38,440
It was a little one.

945
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,440
Wow.

946
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,460
I thought that their feralness was ensured forever or something.

947
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,380
You would think, yeah.

948
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:58,200
I remember some people, local people like to, they tame foxes and foxes just do not want to go into a crowded party room and go to the bathroom in the right places.

949
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,800
They want to go in all the wrong places.

950
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,820
They sure do out on the ranch.

951
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,400
Well, like this home spun of ways, you could say it.

952
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,040
You know, unless you were going to be a liar.

953
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,100
Oh, no, I'm not a liar.

954
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,480
I'm not, I'm a poop spotter.

955
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,580
I can ID, I can ID all the main types of poop now.

956
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,560
I even have an app on my phone.

957
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,860
It's like a, what's it called?

958
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,920
You know, whose crap is, am I?

959
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,460
Whose crap app?

960
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,100
Yeah, it's a whose crap app or something.

961
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,460
Yeah, it really is.

962
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:37,300
You know, you look for pictures of swollen pants.

963
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:37,460
Yeah, I can.

964
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,480
Whose poo is this?

965
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:51,380
Poo, pooing tons and match them up with the raccoon or fox or skunk or dog or bear or deer.

966
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,960
And naturally Japanese and the Koreans are getting more.

967
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,900
Or Japanese or Korean.

968
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,960
You can tell which nationality.

969
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,000
You have to, that costs more.

970
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,640
That app costs a lot more.

971
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,240
No, I mean, but more only humans practice the art.

972
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:13,880
Like in some places, in the social media now, like in, I guess I heard in South Korea and in Japan,

973
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:22,940
some goofballs decided they were going to wear the same clothes over and over and over every day until their, you know, genitalia flopped out or something.

974
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,560
That's not new.

975
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,740
I know a guy who actually did that.

976
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,380
Me too.

977
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,560
In the US years ago.

978
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,700
Tentatively a convenience.

979
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,520
He tried that experiment early in his career.

980
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,640
He wouldn't.

981
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,520
He didn't have many friends.

982
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,220
He didn't bathe for a year.

983
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,640
And at the end of it, he didn't have very many friends.

984
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,940
He also went a year handcuffed to somebody.

985
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,940
A girl.

986
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,060
Oh, he was like, like a mental artist.

987
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:57,160
And he was one of those reality artists and stuff that makes everybody go down public square all bare naked and sing and stuff.

988
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,800
He was the craziest of all the subgenius artists.

989
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,940
And everybody figured he'd be the first to die.

990
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,960
And the last to prosper.

991
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,980
But actually, he's done great.

992
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:19,240
He's had a continuous body of mind-blowingly weird work and happenings and things he's done to himself.

993
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,000
And he actually has a really nice old house in Pittsburgh.

994
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,000
Yes, he sure does.

995
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,840
With a good job in an art museum doing stuff.

996
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,920
And he's kind of a respected artist in different ways.

997
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,900
He's a genius in France.

998
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,940
Let me put it that way.

999
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:42,800
He was an artist in residence in Reykjavik, Iceland.

1000
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:43,720
Wow.

1001
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,860
Yeah, he was a famous artist in Reykjavik.

1002
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,260
A lot of stoners sign up for that because they heat their plants and their aquaculture with vitreous gases.

1003
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,660
And there's all kinds of steam coming out of Iceland.

1004
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,660
Just ask Bjork.

1005
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,160
She knows.

1006
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,000
She's all good.

1007
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,520
But Icelandic cuisine is steamed for that reason.

1008
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,160
Fish.

1009
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,940
Highly esteemed.

1010
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,040
Steamed fish.

1011
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,220
They have a different variety of steamed fish every single day of the year, too.

1012
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,660
Right, and they steam it in volcanic gases, as you said.

1013
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,020
Incredibly toxic volcanic gases.

1014
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,640
But boy.

1015
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,580
We know this because we're Americans.

1016
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,980
And anything that we say long enough, like maybe three times or seven times, we say,

1017
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,440
well, it's the absolute truth and that never needs to be cited anymore.

1018
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,280
Well, if you repeat the lie enough, make it a big enough lie, they'll all just take it as household knowledge.

1019
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,220
That's working for them.

1020
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,120
Household knowledge.

1021
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,080
It works for them.

1022
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,460
Yeah, I like the way you put that household knowledge meaning.

1023
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,280
Well, everybody knows that everybody knows that everybody knows.

1024
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,760
And actually not one of the facts they cited.

1025
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,340
Nobody knows anything.

1026
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,140
No.

1027
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,900
Did you?

1028
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,660
Did you know, for instance, Dave, in the Bible, it says that God forbids tattoos.

1029
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:19,020
Well, then I better get this thing removed from the bottom of my sheets because it makes my underpants look a little squirrely, if you know what I mean.

1030
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,760
Do you seriously have tattoos on the bottom of your feet, Dave?

1031
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,620
I always wanted to do that.

1032
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,360
No, that's horrible.

1033
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,940
That's an ill prescription.

1034
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,020
Just think of the pain you must endure.

1035
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,640
The top of your foot controls lung function.

1036
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,140
You probably start coughing and crying at the same time.

1037
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,020
Oh, I guess so.

1038
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,380
I'm doing that anyway.

1039
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,280
I just like the idea of stepping on a Dobbs head every time I walk.

1040
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,760
Yeah, we were both going to, we both decided that if we ever got any tattoo, it would be a Dobbs head on our heel.

1041
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:50,480
Right.

1042
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,300
So that we'd be stepping on Bob's face.

1043
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,200
Crushing with every step.

1044
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,140
With every step.

1045
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:55,760
Yes.

1046
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,560
But he'd be protecting us.

1047
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,700
You know, he'd be protecting us from rusty nails.

1048
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,420
Yes.

1049
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,800
And I had also had the idea of having a Dobbs head tattooed on my thumb so I could have him under my thumb.

1050
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,320
But didn't do that either.

1051
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,520
That sounds exciting.

1052
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:24,120
I think, though, if you were in the French Revolution, I'd say around 1798, and you wore a big old brace that said that I'm not going to be a stumble bum no more, you'd have a hard time getting out of the Bastille, you know?

1053
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,460
They'd put you on the left side of the pinky place where they'd count the numbers, you know?

1054
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:30,280
No.

1055
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,440
No.

1056
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:31,620


1057
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,000
The pinky place?

1058
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,820
Okay, let me start all over again.

1059
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,040
Obviously, I'm not connecting from a third base.

1060
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:49,220
No, there was a subgenius lady who got a Dobbs head tattooed on the inside of her eyelids so she'd always see a sort of a crude Dobbs head.

1061
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:59,080
But of course, you know, like typical of the people who get really elaborate tattoos of Bob, she hates the church's subgenius now.

1062
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,440
Yeah.

1063
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,420
That happens to everybody who really disfigures themselves with a Dobbs head.

1064
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,300
Spends a lot of time and money on that, yeah.

1065
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:18,960
Yeah, the more money you spend and the more obvious the giant Dobbs head on your arm or back is, the more certain it is that the time will come when you detest everything about it.

1066
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,780
And you're stuck with it, Dan.

1067
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,840
You're stuck with my personal trademark.

1068
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,900
Right on the skin of your body.

1069
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,360
Right.

1070
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,420
Yeah.

1071
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,220
Yeah.

1072
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:29,560
Yeah.

1073
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,840
What a beautiful introduction.

1074
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:31,700
Forever.

1075
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,940
But God forbid tattoos.

1076
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,220
It's in Leviticus 1928.

1077
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:44,640
He also forbid, forbidden male homosexuality, but he didn't say anything about lesbians.

1078
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,100
There's not a word about lesbians in the Bible.

1079
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,060
That was a great recurrence we had going for us.

1080
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,060
Or abortion.

1081
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:59,440
We packed the haul, so to speak, and we were glad to learn that we could watch all the movies we wanted to and we wouldn't have to worry about how many people we had.

1082
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,060
And we didn't have to worry about how many male homosexuals come interrupting us.

1083
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:11,580
Now, here's a rule that if Christians really believed every part of the Bible, they'd do this.

1084
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,460
They'd get rid of all their tattoos, for one thing.

1085
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:29,420
But the next thing they'd do is, well, okay, according to God, any man who suspects his wife of adultery must bring her into God's tent, where a priest will make her drink dirty, dirty water.

1086
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:45,140
The water, God explains, shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall discharge, her uterus drop, and the woman shall be in execration among her people.

1087
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,560
Unless, of course, the woman is innocent, in which case the dirty water won't hurt her.

1088
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,560
She shall be immune and be able to conceive children.

1089
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,420
And that's in Numbers 511.

1090
00:53:59,300 --> 00:53:59,400
Can you believe it?

1091
00:53:59,420 --> 00:53:59,980
Numbers 511 through 31.

1092
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:00,820
Wow.

1093
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,840
Of Leviticus.

1094
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,040
No, Numbers.

1095
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:03,860
Numbers.

1096
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,280
Numbers.

1097
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,840
Leviticus is the part about the tattoos.

1098
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,560
How could...

1099
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,160
Oh, by the end, when God's...

1100
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,400
Had those abjurances before many thousands of years ago, they actually had that?

1101
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,980
Oh, yeah, sure.

1102
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,880
They had dirty water.

1103
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,580
You mean, I'm just saying, did you make a lot of that up?

1104
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:23,880
No!

1105
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,320
I'm reading from the Bible, Dave.

1106
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,540
I'm reading from the old...

1107
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,580
You made my toes curl up.

1108
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,180
It freaked me out knowing that that was what was going on, that you were reading from the

1109
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:33,460
Bible.

1110
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,660
Pick up your Bible.

1111
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,700
Don't you read from the Bible every day?

1112
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:38,900
Hell no.

1113
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:47,880
It's got the weirdest sci-fi and perverted, horrifying tortures and punishment and complete

1114
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,440
genocide.

1115
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:56,180
You know, when God said, love thy neighbor, he specifically meant thy neighboring Israelite.

1116
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,880
Everybody else should be put to the death.

1117
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,660
Then God was...

1118
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:09,680
They made it sound like our Lord was a sex fiend and nothing could be further from the

1119
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,040
truth.

1120
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:10,840
Oh, it depends.

1121
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,780
It depends.

1122
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,440
It's like...

1123
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,160
Maybe that minivan or...

1124
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:21,340
It's okay to get your dad drunk and then get yourself impregnated by him if you're worried

1125
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,120
that there won't be any more guys around, because that's what happened to Noah.

1126
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:25,860
Or look upon his nakedness.

1127
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,720
That's what I always used to like to do when I was studying the Bible.

1128
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,480
I'd go and look at my father while he was bare naked, because then I'd be banned and

1129
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,940
I won't be able to see.

1130
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,680
They'll ban my eyesight.

1131
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,460
Isn't that the one?

1132
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,740
No, that was Ham, who was named after us.

1133
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,920
Yeah, the Lord is not a sex fiend, as men count sex fiends.

1134
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,020
However, he is a bloodthirsty killer.

1135
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,400
Yeah.

1136
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,080
The Lord commands the men of Israel to slay the Midianites.

1137
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,440
This they do with gusto, killing every man, plundering and pillaging, taking for slaves

1138
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,520
all the women and children.

1139
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,400
However, when they return to camp, Moses isn't happy.

1140
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,320
Have you allowed all the women to live?

1141
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,380
He asks them.

1142
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:20,020
Kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by sleeping

1143
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,680
with him.

1144
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:27,300
But all the young girls who have not known a man by sleeping with him, keep alive for yourselves.

1145
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,700
That's Moses' directions, translating for God, in Numbers 31, 1 through 18.

1146
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,520
What a barbaric tome.

1147
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,680
The Bible, I knew it was.

1148
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,120
I knew it was kind of a little bit, you know, strange.

1149
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,820
And I knew it had been tampered with for one of the many, like, 5,000 years, over the last

1150
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,560
5,000 years.

1151
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,380
People had changed a lot of stuff.

1152
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:58,760
And also, a lot of it had nothing to do with the laws of, of biblical laws and stuff like

1153
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,740
that, but rather just how to make a sandwich.

1154
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,860
Here's another good one.

1155
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,140
No, there's a lot about, yeah, there's a lot about how to make a sandwich and how, and

1156
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,420
what happens if you do it wrong.

1157
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:16,040
If men get into a fight with one another, and the wife of one intervenes to rescue her

1158
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,540
husband from the grip of his opponent by reaching out to him, and he's going to kill him, and

1159
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:25,680
he's going to become a son of a bitch, or that kind of kind of thing, then turn things

1160
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,600
around and he gets angry, right?

1161
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:26,600


1162
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,220
And parable emphasize to嗔

1163
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,520
You��

1164
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,240
ível

1165
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:37,580
aud pray

1166
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,920
You send the laум

1167
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:41,760
to the feet over images, and the Lord says,

1168
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,200
if you Отte finance

1169
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,900
an attempt of to shine

1170
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,520
from your wife

1171
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,200
was really a Bible expert.

1172
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,960
And I inherited all his books about the Bible.

1173
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,340
Yes.

1174
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,820
Now, his take on it,

1175
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,980
after he'd been studying its history for years,

1176
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,580
is that it's all fiction from top to bottom.

1177
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,660
And he taught Bible studies at the Methodist Church

1178
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,520
in Glen Rose for 20 years.

1179
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,160
Yes, carefully placing seeds of doubt

1180
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,640
into the minds of the growing people there.

1181
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,120
Yeah, he would read him stuff like that

1182
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,680
and say, now you just think about that.

1183
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,840
They considered him quite a character.

1184
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,000
Dave, it's getting nigh on to the end of show.

1185
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,620
Oh, I'm sorry.

1186
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,460
And that means it's time for us to say

1187
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,420
that they're listening to the hour of slack.

1188
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,560
And people who are interested in learning more

1189
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,540
about the Bible or the Bible,

1190
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,580
as we might call the book of the subgenius,

1191
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:56,180
they can check off to subgenius.com.

1192
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,340
And Dave's book, Neighbor World, is on sale there.

1193
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,340
Although...

1194
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,420
It's a beautiful book.

1195
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,520
That's right, I'm not supposed to...

1196
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:09,060
Anyway, somebody bought a copy of Neighbor World today.

1197
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:10,240
It is available there.

1198
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,240
Somebody bought a copy of Neighbor World today.

1199
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:13,780
All right.

1200
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,000
Well, I think they should...

1201
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,820
I should be buying one every day.

1202
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,620
Every minute.

1203
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,060
I'm rather surprised.

1204
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,580
Because I know who has bought one.

1205
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,360
That means I know who hasn't bought one.

1206
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,180
I've been kind of surprised at who hasn't bought one.

1207
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:27,560
Me too.

1208
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,240
Who hasn't bought one?

1209
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:30,820
I want to know.

1210
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,300
A lot of people.

1211
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:32,780
Oh, you name them.

1212
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,680
You name them.

1213
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,140
The ones that we give as gifts,

1214
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,360
people love them when they get one as a gift.

1215
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,800
Hey, it's time to end the show

1216
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,920
and feed the dog her pills.

1217
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:45,980
And I get a pill.

1218
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:45,980


1219
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,880
The dog gets a pill and I get a pill.

1220
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,020
They're both wrapped in peanut butter

1221
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,020
so that we'll eat them.

1222
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,380
And the other dog just gets a finger full of peanut butter

1223
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,400
with no pill in it

1224
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,020
so he doesn't feel left out.

1225
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,260
He doesn't care about the pill.

1226
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,320
It's just the peanut butter.

1227
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,020
So praise Bob.

1228
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,260
Praise Bob.

1229
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,540
Praise Bob.

1230
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,100
And praise peanut butter.

1231
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,780
And praise Dave.

1232
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,700
Dave, the lonesome cowboy.

1233
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,260
Indeed, praise Dave.

1234
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,000
He's our only listener.

1235
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,920
Drain it.

1236
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:37,920
Okay, man.

1237
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,120
We're going to go.

1238
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:41,880
Okay.

1239
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:42,180
We have to go.

1240
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:43,540
Okay.

1241
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,580
And could...

1242
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,360
He's going.

1243
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,800
Is he going?

1244
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,580
Are you potting him down?

1245
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,500
I'm not.

1246
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,340
I think he just went.

1247
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,100
Aw.

1248
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,860
Remember when we were doing it at home,

1249
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,900
I'd still be recording.

1250
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:00,400
Yeah.

1251
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,260
It's like I'd say,

1252
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:02,420
stay on the line,

1253
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,560
but we'll keep...

1254
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:04,740
But he'd hang up.

1255
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,800
But Dave would hang up.

1256
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:06,640
Yeah, it was like,

1257
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,440
it felt like if it was the end of the show

1258
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,380
that he had to hang up.

1259
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:12,120
But that meant we couldn't talk to him anymore.

1260
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,080
And sometimes we got the best stuff

1261
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,540
just for the internet.

1262
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,060
The internet audience,

1263
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,340
which is what you're hearing right now.

1264
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,480
Because I'll have to cut what I'm saying right now

1265
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,520
for all the other stations.

1266
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,940
It has to be under an hour.

1267
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,840
The internet thing, though,

1268
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:28,200
gets all the extra stuff.

1269
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:28,960
In this case,

1270
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,300
we got a...

1271
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,100
Dr. Sinister is running a little bit late.

1272
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,240
A few minutes late.

1273
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,340
And that means I can play

1274
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,640
a beautiful subgenius song

1275
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,520
written by Sister Malaya.

1276
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:45,620
It's called,

1277
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:46,480
The Dodeous Chops.

1278
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,180
Aww.

1279
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,440
With Princess Wee singing on it also.

1280
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,380
Oh, shucks.

1281
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,480
It's The Marriage of Bob and Connie.

1282
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:54,340
All right.

1283
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,240
Professionally recorded.

1284
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,540
One of my favorites.

1285
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,360
By Regis Sedwick.

1286
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,600
Sedlock.

1287
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,400
Sedlock.

1288
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,920
Did I say Sedwick?

1289
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,400
I think you said Sedwick.

1290
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,860
Yeah, Sedlock.

1291
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,920
Sedlock, yes.

1292
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,420
I should know.

1293
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,560
Sounds good.

1294
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,400
I've been working with that guy

1295
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,380
for 25 or...

1296
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,400
30 years every now and then.

1297
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:17,740
Uh-huh.

1298
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,660
Man.

1299
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:19,440
Anyway, okay.

1300
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,260
The Ballad of...

1301
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,240
No, this is...

1302
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,160
The Marriage of Bob and Connie.

1303
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,200
Thank you.

1304
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,680
Thank you.

1305
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:58,620
Thanks.

1306
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:04,320
No, then let's talk about

1307
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:04,320


1308
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,740
Talk that into the Israeli language.

1309
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:05,760


1310
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,520
It's The Marriage of Mike,

1311
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:15,520


1312
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:15,520


1313
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:15,520


1314
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:20,140
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

1315
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:25,500
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the church of subgenius

1316
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:40,960
I've seen a mating of the iguana On the rocks is what they prefer

1317
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,340
While the sloths just like to hang around Hoping something will occur

1318
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,220
And though their rabbit is most unsteady He is always ready once more

1319
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:57,460
But when it comes to Bob and Connie There's no way of keeping score

1320
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:06,160
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

1321
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,940
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the church of subgenius

1322
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,440
La la la la la

1323
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:27,200
A dragonfly has balance A black widow has banash

1324
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:33,020
But Bob and Connie got their hands On each other's personal stash

1325
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:38,560
And anaconda has got constriction And a crocodile has her grin

1326
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,940
But Bob and Connie are all the same

1327
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,500
They're the one true origin of sin

1328
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:51,720
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

1329
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:57,100
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the church of subgenius

1330
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,200
La la la la la

1331
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,640
Hey!

1332
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:02,560
And Connie

1333
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,360
La la la la la

1334
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,440
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

1335
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:12,900
T-Bob

1336
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,460
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la T-Bob

1337
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,000
Brown-eyed Bob

1338
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:29,940
The ostrich do it in circles With her head stuck in the ground

1339
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,280
Why the lemmings like to get it done

1340
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,300
With lots of folk around

1341
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,980
So many combinations

1342
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,360
The results are always the same

1343
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,480
So prepare to get it done

1344
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,600
In Bob and Connie's name

1345
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,360
Oh

1346
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:52,460
It's the miracle of the 90s

1347
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,800
It's the talk of all the obvious

1348
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,800
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1349
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,340
In the churches of GDS

1350
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,280
It's the miracle of the 90s

1351
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,080
It's the talk of all the obvious

1352
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:09,000
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1353
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,480
In the churches of GDS

1354
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,180
The natural gotcha is the work

1355
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:15,780
Of it, shine, shine

1356
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,860
To feel so much why

1357
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:20,140
Don't you say goodbye

1358
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:20,500
Don't you insult me

1359
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,540
In the churches of GDS

1360
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,540
The miracle of the 90s

1361
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,220
It's the talk of all the obvious

1362
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:30,320
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie

1363
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,500
Just come with me

1364
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,120
In the church of logic

1365
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,440
La la la la la

1366
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,620
And Connie

1367
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,660
La la la la la

1368
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,260
And Connie

1369
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:47,200
La la la la la

1370
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,400
And Connie

1371
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,880
La

1372
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,300
Don't listen to her

1373
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,040
Don't listen to her

1374
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,020
You can find help

1375
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:06,200
You can be deprogrammed

1376
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,420
You can find out the truth

1377
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,220
They beat me to death

1378
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:14,500
They force you to sleep on boards

1379
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,900
But that device

1380
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,900
I don't know

1381
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,220
What's going on

1382
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,720
It's alright

1383
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,020
They stay in the house

1384
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,640
But some geniuses

1385
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,880
Came in and they

1386
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,300
Took the money

1387
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:30,300


1388
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,300
And took all my furniture

1389
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,640
And sold it to buy me

1390
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,820
This neck brace

1391
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,460
That I can't take off now

1392
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,380
And they said it was a living being

1393
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:39,800
And that

1394
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,660
Ow

1395
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:42,820
Ow

1396
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,480
Ow

1397
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,800
Oh I got a

1398
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,920
Bring the upper lip down

1399
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,540
Below the upper teeth

1400
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,540
Be sure to keep it down

1401
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:56,640
Until the fingers are in position

1402
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:59,280
At each corner of the mouth

1403
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,300
Insert your finger

1404
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,080
And put a thumb under the upper lip

1405
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,900
Now slide the thumbs along the inside

1406
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,840
Of the upper lip

1407
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,080
Until they are positioned

1408
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,460
Just below that

1409
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,360
To the side of each nostril

1410
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:11,080
Two

1411
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,400
Raise both thumbs facing out

1412
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,420
To the mouth

1413
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,300
Four

1414
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,280
Extend the muscle forward

1415
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:18,960
And hold

1416
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,080
The head of the chest down

1417
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:21,840
And breathe

1418
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:25,100
The results are thrilling

1419
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,400
Everywhere these messages are heard

1420
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,800
Souls are being saved

1421
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,280
And sick bodies are being saved

1422
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:30,840
And they are being healed

1423
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,480
God don't send them your money

1424
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,560
They've got me locked up in there

1425
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,700
Yes I too

1426
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,240
Refused to send money to the church of the subgenius

1427
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:48,420
And I too fell under the power of Migi

1428
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,580
You must tell them what the deal is

1429
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,600
And I just think people should know

1430
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,440
They're trying to shut us up

1431
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,220
But there are subgenius dissidents

1432
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:00,260
And I just think people should know

1433
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:07,800
That I'm a

1434
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,440
I'm a

1435
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,440


1436
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,440


1437
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,440


1438
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:08,460
I'm a

1439
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:08,580
I'm a

1440
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,580


1441
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,580


1442
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,580


1443
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,580


1444
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,580


1445
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,580


1446
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:08,820
I'm a

1447
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,960
From PR News in Washington

1448
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,920
I'm singer Frank Ariklander

1449
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,400
And I'm failing to register as a foreign singer

1450
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,640
Such as Jesse Clinton and Bill Jackson

1451
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,580
For the funeral services he did

1452
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,260
On behalf of Ukrainian singers

1453
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,700
Such as former president Samuel Patton

1454
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,800
While working for singers tied to Paul Manafort

1455
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,240
Manafort is set to be released in August 2016

1456
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:30,240


1457
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,580
to go on trial next month on related charges of failing to sing for the Trump administration

1458
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:38,540
on a renegotiated North American Free Foreign Singer Agreement.

1459
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:42,720
Among the obstacles, Canada wants PR News Washington.

1460
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:47,000
Members didn't make much progress, and it's unclear when they'll be back.

1461
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,140
The doubt is 23-26-10-30-80-18.

1462
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:55,800
Democrats tries to racially gerrymand to dilute PR's power.

1463
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,180
Under the rules for the hunt, fewer than two dozen federal judges would have been allowed to be killed.

1464
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,580
California fire officials say they're listening to the deadly PR news from Washington.

1465
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,620
Words of love for PR News Washington.

1466
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:26,860
The next PR news conference should的是Sí,

1467
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1468
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1469
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1470
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1471
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1472
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1473
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1474
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860


1475
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:26,860
