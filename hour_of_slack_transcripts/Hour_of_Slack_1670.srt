1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Like to drop by the fantastic bag?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,100
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag!

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,960
Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack!

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,640
La la la, la la la!

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,800
La la la, Hour of Slack!

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,420
Slack!

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,940
It's great, faster than any other leading cleanser!

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
As well as leading cleansers!

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,280
As well as...

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:41,960
Bob!

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,580
But let's leave things of this world behind,

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,700
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,400
And so, once again, we find this deep-rooted contradiction within the Word of God.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,320
Who He Himself has said,

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,820
I am everything, but yet everything is me.

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,380
And by this very selfsame contradiction,

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,540
we know that we do have some measure of free will.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,340
Yes, free choice.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,580
And it's up to us to decide whether we're going to sin in the ways that God wants us to,

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,020
or if we're going to sin against God.

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,540
But yet, since He is everything and everything is Him, or her, it, or everything,

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,280
one could say, well, everything is everything, so a sin might as well be a good deed.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,400
Helping a little old lady across the street,

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,080
might be a sin if everything is everything.

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
Now, this is an acid-head sort of mode of thinking,

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,380
and I don't think anybody wants to go along with such a vague and, say the least, fluid philosophy.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,700
Because we have to have some sort of standard reference for goodness or evilness.

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,500
We've got to zero our meter on something.

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,640
So why not let that something be Bob, friend?

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,640
Let there be slack.

32
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,100
Oh, that's crazy talk.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,480
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,100
FRIENDSHOP!

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,660
Are we controlled by secret forces?

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,260
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,840
Do people think you're strange?

38
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,160
Do you?

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
Then you may be on the right track.

40
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Give me slack, or give me food,

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,660
or kill me.

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,360
Give me slack, or give me food,

43
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,660
or kill me.

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,000
Kill me.

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:29,700


46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,440
Kill me.

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,200
It's time to be manipulated.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,560
Brother, I want to tell you something.

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,040
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers,

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,660
dead preachers preaching dead sermons to dead congregations.

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,440
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,920
The world is hungry for reality.

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,660
They've had enough of Hollywood.

54
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,620
They've had enough of Nashville.

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,720
They've had enough of show business.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,220
They're hungry for the mighty power of the man that walked the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,420
and raised the dead and cast out devils and healed the sick.

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,440
And I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ is still raising the dead.

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,120
Oh, he's back from the dead.

60
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,200
That's right.

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,820
His grinning skull.

62
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,080
His grinning skull floats ever in front of your eyes

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,600
because Jesus brought him back,

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,440
and he's lusting for the flesh of the living.

65
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,120
And these things are coming and coming speedily.

66
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,200
We are near the very, very end of the church age,

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,960
and of course the Gentile time has already come to a close.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
For the archaeologists.

69
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,580
Every day is a hair day.

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,800
Slacks are always Jesus Christ's name.

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,900
I got just what I wanted from everybody here today.

72
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,880
And everybody said,

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,600
NAMIET.

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560
NAMIET.

75
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,780
Now I reason because here is inflicted unbelief.

76
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,700
NAMIET.

77
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,620
Unbelief is the lifeless body of his sister.

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,360
Right now, man.

79
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,880
It's autistic.

80
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
It's satisfaction.

81
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,880
Secure my weapon, corporal.

82
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,560
Again?

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,360
Again.

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,620
Big day.

85
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
Did you get my present?

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,560
I punched a hole in Harvey Goldman's trailer.

87
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:28,980
Hmm.

88
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,600
The world owes me a living,

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,360
and I want my money back in one lump sum right now!

90
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,620
That's the way you ought to wake up.

91
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,900
Friends, it wasn't your parents' fault.

92
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,520
They were just as screwy as you.

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,500
It was the conspiracy's fault.

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,440
It really was.

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,620
It really was.

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,780
It was.

97
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,500
It really was.

98
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,060
Friends, the conspiracy has harged fascism long enough.

99
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,080
We're taking fascism back for the people, man!

100
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,120
Fascism for the people!

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,780
Fascism for the people.

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,100
For the individual, it's what we call patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism.

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,640
Now I just want you to hang on one minute.

104
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,620
I want you to hang on one minute, please, and I want you to hear something, and I want you to hear it.

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,080
Good!

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,420
I just want to tell you people something.

107
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,760
There's some good people out here, and you are insulting their intelligence.

108
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,440
And if you come to this country at our invitation,

109
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,040
and we have to charge you through no choice of our own,

110
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:24,900
right?

111
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,600
If you don't want to pay it, don't.

112
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
I've come.

113
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,240
Some people got to have it.

114
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,580
Give me.

115
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,440
Listen to me now.

116
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,260
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

117
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,260
Bad things today.

118
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,040
Well, to you.

119
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,140
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,080
Good things today.

121
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,480
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,140
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,960
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

124
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:55,960


125
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,460
I want it to be firmly established that any person that feels that strongly has the right to come to this microphone and speak.

126
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,960
I cannot help the system as here.

127
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,580
It is my job to entertain you.

128
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:16,260
The fact that there is an exchange from this stage, whatever it costs, has to go out there in the form of music, is the way that the world is made up.

129
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,460
I cannot help it.

130
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,780
I have no other choice.

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,280
I have no control over that.

132
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,740
Do it with something that nobody can steal from you.

133
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,540
something nobody can stop selling to you or put you in jail so you can't maintain it.

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,940
You're going to have to become self-realized to the peace within yourself on your own.

135
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,120
And beyond that, once you become self-realized, to learn how to express it,

136
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,500
how to experience it constantly, how to use the vehicles that you've got,

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,940
whether it's your emotions, your mind, or your body,

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,580
to express the divine thing that you discover yourself to be.

139
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,060
And you can only discover that yourself.

140
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,300
People don't care who they hurt or be.

141
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,720
A woman will sell her precious body for a small piece of paper and carry some lot of weight.

142
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,940
But be...

143
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,120
angry.

144
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,760
You'll forget about them and you'll marry some blonde, dull, non-entity

145
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,340
and bear a brood of snot-faced, drug-snorting brats

146
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,080
who can't believe what a doddering dullard you are

147
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,920
and can't wait for you to die

148
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,640
or...

149
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,800
leave so they can kill you or something while you sit there

150
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
exhausted, sweating blood, staring at the TV,

151
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
pondering your incredible degree of debt,

152
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,240
drinking yourself into a stupor and going,

153
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,580
What the hell happened?

154
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,460
Almighty God of God

155
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:15,860
I know money is a root of all evil

156
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,240
but it can't stop some people

157
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,160
from doing funny things to some people

158
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,700
Didn't pay a nickel

159
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,060
Money can't stop some people

160
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,740
I ran them out

161
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,040
We're all just going to have to like,

162
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,000
the police force,

163
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
the lawyers, all the people that

164
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
are running the whole thing,

165
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,340
these hippies with long hair

166
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,240
are just going to have to

167
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,040
braid their hair up,

168
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,860
put it... put on a hat, man,

169
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,860
and become policemen.

170
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,850
become police men, you know, become lawyers, become doctors, you know.

171
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,130
But then we're the same as everybody else.

172
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,710
No, I mean, but with the idea.

173
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,290
I mean, with the idea that you want to change the system.

174
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,010
You can't defeat the system from within the system because then you're just part of it.

175
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,270
My dear, could you imagine?

176
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,710
I mean, Walt Disney is the...

177
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,170
Living in the ghetto, you know, a kid three years old using Mighty Mouse or Mickey Mouse,

178
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,430
whoever it was, for an idol, right?

179
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:07,990
You can't have kids.

180
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,850
Running across the room for a gray rat thinking it was Mighty Mouse.

181
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,310
Are you ready?

182
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,010
But you can't bring all of Walt Disney.

183
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,370
Well, I can bring almost all of it, or half of it.

184
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:17,770
Half of it.

185
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,950
I can't bring all of it.

186
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,270
I can't bring all of it.

187
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,670
I can't bring all of it.

188
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,010
This is Pennywise.

189
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,270
Joan, your name?

190
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,210
This is Sue.

191
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,090
Hi, Sue.

192
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:58,710
How can I help?

193
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,370
Jim, I really have a problem with impulse buying.

194
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,330
I never have money left for anything.

195
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,550
Oh, why?

196
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:07,470
Jim, I really have a buying impulse problem.

197
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:07,870
Well...

198
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,490
Buying.

199
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,290
Buying.

200
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,690
Anything.

201
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,470
Anything.

202
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,150
Anything.

203
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,890
Wait a minute.

204
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,450
Go ahead.

205
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:12,810
Go ahead.

206
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,630
And use some of that money to bring some happiness.

207
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,050
Jim, I really have a problem.

208
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,630
Jim, I never have money left for impulse buying.

209
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,190
A lot of people have that problem.

210
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,310
Take cash.

211
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,330
Good idea.

212
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,730
I feel we really need to buy right away.

213
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,650
After all, money is only paper and metal until you put it to use.

214
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,010
I never have money left.

215
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,570
But you've already decided to buy.

216
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,370
Impulse.

217
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:32,930
Impulse.

218
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,390
I really think it'll help.

219
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,230
Good idea.

220
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:35,970
Oh, thanks.

221
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,750
Okay, let's go to line four.

222
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,690
This is Pennywise.

223
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,690
I'm Jim Phillips, and your name is...

224
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:40,970
Bob.

225
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,450
Hi, Bob.

226
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,390
What can I do for you?

227
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,970
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

228
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,570
Oh, this is Pennywise.

229
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,250
Line six, you're on.

230
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,390
And your name is...

231
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,550
Bob.

232
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,530
Caller number five, you're on the air with Pennywise.

233
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,390
I'm Jim Phillips.

234
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,970
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

235
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,510
Oh, let's go to line seven on Pennywise.

236
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,810
Hi, I'm Jim Phillips.

237
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,230
Bob.

238
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,110
Commercials.

239
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,650
Oh, oh.

240
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,150
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

241
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,590
Oh, well, listen.

242
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,150
I think your first responsibility is to yourself and your family.

243
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,730
The what?

244
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,610
Thanks for the call.

245
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,350
Hello.

246
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,790
You're on Pennywise with...

247
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,170
Jim Phillips, and you are...

248
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,350
Bob.

249
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,810
Okay, let's go to line four.

250
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,730
This is Pennywise.

251
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,770
I'm Jim Phillips, and your name is...

252
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:18,990
Bob.

253
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,270
Oh.

254
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:20,370
Commercials.

255
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:20,870
Hello, caller.

256
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,390
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

257
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,010
Oh, and your name is...

258
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,230
Bob.

259
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,590
Bob.

260
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,230
Bob.

261
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:26,830
Hi, Bob.

262
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,810
What can I do for you?

263
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:28,510
The what?

264
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:28,950
Go ahead.

265
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,490
I get confused by all the claims made in commercials.

266
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,790
Oh, you sound frustrated.

267
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,470
It's because I am.

268
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,130
Well, my kids and I, for example, love to build things with scrap lumber.

269
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:38,890
The what?

270
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,310
All right.

271
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,330
Thanks for the call, Carl.

272
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:40,670
Bob.

273
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,150
Oh, this is Pennywise.

274
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,450
Pennywise.

275
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,230
Line six.

276
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,750
You're on.

277
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,170
Bob.

278
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,670
Yeah, Barb.

279
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,070
Bob.

280
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,570
Go ahead.

281
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,870
Claims made in commercials.

282
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,310
Yeah.

283
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,410
I get confused.

284
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:48,610
Why?

285
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,930
I get commercials confused.

286
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,130
I can imagine.

287
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:51,810
The what?

288
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,530
Well, many religious people follow the biblical plan of tithing.

289
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,070
You may want to visit with your clergy about it, but of course...

290
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:58,350
The what?

291
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:58,770
The what?

292
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,490
Commercials.

293
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,010
Commercials.

294
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,810
I get confused by all the claims...

295
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,790
And your name is...

296
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:02,970
Bob.

297
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,230
Yeah, that's a tough one.

298
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,010
A lot of people have that problem.

299
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,770
The what?

300
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,550
Truth in advertising.

301
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,870
I get confused.

302
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,610
Advertising, though, can be a really good source of information.

303
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,630
Because of the truth in advertising policy.

304
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,290
The what?

305
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,190
Because of the truth in advertising policy.

306
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,930
The what?

307
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,750
Truth in advertising.

308
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,650
The what?

309
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,550
Truth in advertising.

310
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,290
Truth in advertising.

311
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,870
You see, the law requires advertisers to tell the truth.

312
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,430
The what?

313
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,010
The truth.

314
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,490
The truth.

315
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,410
To tell the truth.

316
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,430
Truth in advertising.

317
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,590
Good point.

318
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,790
Yeah.

319
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,930
So listen carefully to the wording of an ad.

320
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:30,650
The what?

321
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,610
The truth in advertising.

322
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,430
The what?

323
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,650
Well, then you have to decide if honesty goes both ways, right?

324
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,650
After all.

325
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,670
So, this is Pennywise.

326
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,650
You're on the air.

327
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,090
Hi, Bob.

328
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,110
What can I do for you?

329
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,690
Yeah, Jim, this is Charlie.

330
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,210
Okay.

331
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,030
I've got a moral question for you.

332
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:45,410
The what?

333
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,090
Wait a minute.

334
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,990
Thanks for the call, Bob.

335
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,170
This is Charlie.

336
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,830
I've got a moral question for you.

337
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,410
Well, that's a matter for your own conscience, Charlie.

338
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,230
I figured you'd say something like that.

339
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:54,890
All right.

340
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,350
Why don't you give it a try this year?

341
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:56,670
Okay.

342
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,890
But they'll never catch it.

343
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,170
Well, thanks for calling, Charlie.

344
00:13:59,330 --> 00:13:59,570
Thanks.

345
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,530
This is Pennywise.

346
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,670
Line six.

347
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,190
You're on.

348
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,670
Yeah, Jim, this is Charlie.

349
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,610
Negative land.

350
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,350
Negative land, friends.

351
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,070
Before that, Rainbow Bridge.

352
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:17,030
Some utopia and preaching from Austin, 1998.

353
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,010
All cut together by Potter Nostril.

354
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,090
Before that, new cut-ups by Artemia Salina, Fernanda Nandi-Lemur,

355
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:32,110
and old cut-ups from the subgenius Media Barrage No. 5.

356
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,790
Plus music from Saint N.

357
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,650
Memoir of the same coming.

358
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,190
But what do you want?

359
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,410
I want to be a member of your church.

360
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,490
I want to give all I got.

361
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,370
I want to love Bob.

362
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,930
I want to love Bob.

363
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,450
I was in a room just the other day in Dallas.

364
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,830
Well, I did benefit from it, of course.

365
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,930
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

366
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,050
Remember this.

367
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,970
I've been five years in the Naval Intelligence Division.

368
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,810
So that I do know a good...

369
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,950
And that was in wartime.

370
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,150
So I know...

371
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,250
I know a good deal of what goes on.

372
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,710
I mean, I had connections with CID and the lot.

373
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,030
And there is no doubt in my mind,

374
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,070
and a number of other responsible people,

375
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,690
that this isn't only just hippie fun.

376
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,010
Behind it is black power, and behind that is communism.

377
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,110
My invisible monster is bigger than your invisible monster.

378
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,550
Nyeh, nyeh, nyeh, nyeh.

379
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,330
And friends, that's what most religions are for.

380
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:40,930
That's what they're all about.

381
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,010
Yeah.

382
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,390
And you may laugh at that, but I'm afraid to tell you

383
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,850
that according to the latest study I saw,

384
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:54,130
over 87% of Americans believe that there is an invisible monster

385
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,250
that will take care of them if they kiss its ass.

386
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,250
And friends, because of those idiots believing in that monster,

387
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,250
there is one.

388
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,450
He certainly made a lot of laws that we've ended up having to live by.

389
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,110
But friends, you can...

390
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,310
You can...

391
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,090
You can fight back.

392
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,450
Yes, we can turn the tables and declare war on God.

393
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,590
Now, frankly, some people might say that was real disrespectful sounding.

394
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,310
You, I think you, most of you understand what we mean

395
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,590
when we say we're declaring war on God.

396
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,490
Repent, friends. Repent through spending.

397
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,530
And you better do it quick.

398
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:51,470
And you better do it quick.

399
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,290
And you better do it quick.

400
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,590
And you better do it quick.

401
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,410
Aut jazz.

402
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,410


403
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,410


404
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,130
Law ofтиz moralis milli countries

405
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:29,610
What if we settle this with the hellQuė.

406
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:29,610


407
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:29,610


408
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:29,610


409
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,870
For revいます,

Es que yIN

411
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,830
These students keeping asking.

412
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,830


413
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,290
I know that this music will never end,

414
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,270
but there is something you aren't allowing.

415
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,290
Be careful, have a closer listen,

416
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,290
щelis a jisk

417
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:39,570
Be a sweet首先

418
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,790
And look on the actual floor

419
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,470
Actual floor

420
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,030
Actual floor

421
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,370
Actual floor

422
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,890
It makes them proud

423
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,390
To be around

424
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,450
And take their summer pickies

425
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,370
To treat that night

426
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,050
In Soho Pops

427
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,470
And end up feeling sick

428
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,390
Whoa

429
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,290
You've got what it takes to play

430
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,410
History we've got in play

431
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,690
The dollars they got way back

432
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:24,310
The question of kids now wanting everything to be free

433
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,570
Is very hard to handle

434
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,590
Because it's hard to talk to those kids

435
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,390
Even you?

436
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,250
What?

437
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,050
Even you

438
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,530
Even me, hard to talk to them?

439
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,290
Of course

440
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:36,910
Because to them I represent, among other things, somebody who has money

441
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,310
Through this art

442
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,290
And the Traitor's Gate

443
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,830
The more popular criminals

444
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,390
Those darlings of the crowd

445
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,290
Were taken smiling

446
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,510
Into the tower

447
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,170
Rumour has it

448
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,950
That the bloodstains of Charles I's decapitation

449
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,570
Were never actually washed from the stones

450
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,570
Friends, the tribulations

451
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,390
The saucers, the rupture

452
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,130
All of those things that are discussed in Dobbs

453
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,010
The prophecy will come true

454
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,450
But profiting from it all

455
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,310
Of wading through the blood of the baptism of the fist face of Bob

456
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,210
Burning through the titanium steel fort knocks doors

457
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,530
With the power of that mighty pipe

458
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,150
Friends, it will be Bob

459
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,530
Bob is coming

460
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,590
And he will burn away the hate

461
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,210
He will burn away the radiation

462
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,390
He will burn away the fire itself

463
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,250
But you have to keep your hate burning

464
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,650
Friends, you have to feed that fire

465
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,690
Repent!

466
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,930
Quit your job!

467
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,930
Slack off!

468
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,090
While you still know how!

469
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,490
Time is running out

470
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,050
The conspiracy at large

471
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,830
Has, well, between the United States and Russia

472
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,550
Probably has 50,000 nuclear weapons

473
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,870
Maybe 100,000

474
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,390
And we've only got four!

475
00:20:59,610 --> 00:20:59,990
Five!

476
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,950
We've only got five!

477
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,450
And yet we dare to fight them anyway!

478
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,910
Because it's always been the craaaaaze!

479
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,890
People!

480
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,190
Friends, the craaaaaze!

481
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,030
People!

482
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,490
Who are the only ones dumb enough

483
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,470
To stand up and fight City Hall!

484
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,070
Now off you go, away you fly

485
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,170
We've had your money, now goodbye

486
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,550
We've laced you good, we've bled you dry

487
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:34,710
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

488
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,510
Goodbye!

489
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,310
Goodbye!

490
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,190
Goodbye!

491
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,850
Goodbye!

492
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,410
Goodbye!

493
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,170
Goodbye!

494
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,190
Goodbye!

495
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,670
Goodbye!

496
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:46,670


497
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:52,870
Goodbye!

498
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,090
Bye!

499
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,130
Goodbye!

500
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:54,170
Goodbye!

501
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:54,210
Goodbye!

502
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,250
Goodbye!

503
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,250


504
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,250


505
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,090
Goodbye!

506
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,890
The mind of the buchos, oches, daffodils and gilders

507
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,550
And a starting symbol of our caesareanity

508
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,030
Majesty of religion

509
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,530
This old game, this big wow, right?

510
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,190
About good hearted way of waltzing

511
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,770
Sashaying into a peaceful country

512
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,510
Clobbering chiefs and saying

513
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,990
That's it, this is my work

514
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,110
Not a piece of lady

515
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,470
Who was stolen by one Catholic

516
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,430
Blood in Walsh's bloody tower

517
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,570
Look who's doing that stuff

518
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,690
I don't think it's on

519
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,670
Yes, B. Peters will accept the bacon burgers

520
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,310
And here the original armour worn by Henry

521
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,970
Has now been coated in Teflon

522
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,090
So those greasy Argentinians

523
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,270
Who don't have freckles

524
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,130
Because they slide off their faces

525
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,150
Can't get their hands on it

526
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,870
How old are the Buried Riders remains?

527
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,090
Well, they're 14 to 15

528
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,410
They saw the Buried Riders

529
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,010
And they pulled his leg off

530
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,690
And counted the rings, you jerk

531
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,850
Big wow

532
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,490
Pop!

533
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,730
And some incision

534
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,630
Pop!

535
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,270
Majesty

536
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,190
Pop!

537
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,370
Me up!

538
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:52,410


539
00:23:52,410 --> 00:24:22,410


540
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:52,410


541
00:24:52,410 --> 00:25:22,410


542
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:52,410


543
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,070
I'm gonna leave money

544
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,470
Who's by the damned

545
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,030
And now a rare Bob hymn

546
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,510
From the clench of the red-eyed loon

547
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,930
Minneapolis circa 1982

548
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,490
My life has changed in many ways

549
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,290
Since I first saw the space

550
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,610
I know that Bob will triumph

551
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,630
With our friends from outer space

552
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,130
And though we suffered knee-gee

553
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,770
I know that it's alright

554
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,650
Cause I know Bob and I

555
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,190
Will never be the same

556
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,390
Tell me what to think

557
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,910
The church of the subgenius

558
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,790
Will spread across the land

559
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,470
With pipes in place

560
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,930
We'll both they march together

561
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,210
Hand in hand

562
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,150
The star-fist of removal

563
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,410
Will strike a mighty blow

564
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,550
And we'll be free

565
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,710
Of the noble and the pig

566
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,850
So give to Bob, Bob, Bob

567
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,110
And you'll feel a whole lot better

568
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,130
Swear by Bob, Bob

569
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,350
Send a dollar and a letter

570
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,410
He will change all your behavior

571
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,650
He's your short-duration savior

572
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,730
He is Bob, Bob, Bob

573
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,310
You're a miserable parasite

574
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,230
You're just after my money

575
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,790
But let's leave things of this world behind

576
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,610
And walk now down the path of Bob

577
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,050
For this brief minute of slack

578
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,950
From the church of the subgenius

579
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,330
No intelligent person would be able to say

580
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,230
You've got to go follow after that kind of stuff

581
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,490
Then what do we expect?

582
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,470
All this perversion and sex

583
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,510
Are them oily pores in your back

584
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,830
All we care about is slack

585
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,510
And letting all the slack get out

586
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,090
The devil has to be behind that

587
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,350
Think I'd follow it? I don't think so

588
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,550
I was about to grab the nearest object

589
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,190
And smash the mirror into bits

590
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,530
When I saw one with columns of numbers

591
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,430
Running across it

592
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,270
I fancy myself comfortable with numerals

593
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,070
But these were beyond even me

594
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,610
Fortunately, its words were not

595
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,250
As cycles pass,

596
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:49,990
And I came and went

597
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,190
In groupings of ten thousand years

598
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,850
The sixth ice age receded

599
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,650
Leaving behind denuded landscape

600
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,270
And four continents

601
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,170
By the four hundred millennium

602
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,130
The genetic separation was irrevocable

603
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,150
Occasional mutations proved the rule

604
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,230
Rather than overturned it

605
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,490
Separated into Eloatus humanus

606
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,110
And Morloccus dishumanus

607
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,430
The former homo sapiens left no genetic trail

608
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,890
By AD 492,965

609
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,810
Do I surprise you?

610
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,670
A little, yes

611
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,590
We weren't always like this

612
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,590
After the moon fell from the sky

613
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,850
The earth could no longer sustain the species

614
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,330
Some managed to stay above

615
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,450
The rest of us escaped underground

616
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,970
Then centuries later

617
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,450
When we tried to re-emerge into the sun again

618
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,890
We couldn't

619
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,370
So we bred ourselves into castes

620
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,030
Some to be our eyes and ears

621
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,690
Some to be our muscles and sinews

622
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,590
You mean your hunters?

623
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,410
Yes

624
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,850
Bred to be predators

625
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,450
But bred also to be controlled, you see

626
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,110
My cast

627
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,590
Concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities

628
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,150
You control their thoughts

629
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,630
Noth trust theirs

630
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,090
Heloi

631
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,130
So it's not enough that you

632
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,270
That you hunt them down like animals

633
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,390
That's their role here

634
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,610
To be your food

635
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,570
Guess

636
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,870
And for those who are suitable to be

637
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,910
Breeding vessels for our other colonies

638
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,550
You see I am just one of many

639
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,950
Is this the hour of slack?

640
00:29:59,290 --> 00:29:59,710
No

641
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,410
Yes

642
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:00,650
Oh

643
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,210
Ragnar, you're not really Reverend Cardboard Box, are you?

644
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,330
These kids with their names

645
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,030
Reverend Cardboard Box

646
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,910
Hey, come on, homie

647
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,870
It's a gang, okay?

648
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:13,550
Yeah, I know

649
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,250
I know people with funny, weird names

650
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,410
Weird costumes

651
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,630
Cool tags, you know

652
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,050
Yeah, exactly

653
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,630
Got their handles, man

654
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,570
Jumbo was here

655
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,150
Every boy should be in a gang

656
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,770
But a gang can be a bad influence

657
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,850
Or a good and slackful influence

658
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,870
For instance, the subgenius gang

659
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,150
Armies of the conspiracy of dunces

660
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,110
Was a year ago last April

661
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,050
We rode into our camps

662
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,430
The conspiracy of dunces

663
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,530
The subgenius gang

664
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,130
Long我们曾在 Exploring acceptor lonely

665
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,430
We shouldn't have somewhere

666
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,330
Of surrender

667
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,490
The subgenius bundles

668
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,510
Of life

669
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:13,510


670
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,770
the bottom of the deck if these people don't stop bothering me.

671
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,090
Those are the voices in your head, Dave.

672
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,550
Those aren't real people bothering you.

673
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,370
How come they're so clever?

674
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,210
How come they can make things move around?

675
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:25,930
Because you're clever.

676
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,310
Because you're a saint, man.

677
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,410
That goes with the territory when you're a saint.

678
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,590
The mind stuff is what drives the cosmic engine.

679
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,290
Yeah, Dave, the phone calls are coming from inside the house.

680
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:35,930
Oh, man.

681
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,890
I thought I had this place nailed down tight as a drub.

682
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,030
What, your brain?

683
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,690
No, this house brain.

684
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,890
I mean, the higher...

685
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,830
No, it was a metaphor.

686
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,230
That was a metaphor, Dave.

687
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:48,910
That was a metaphor.

688
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,730
You did.

689
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,630
The calls are coming from inside your house.

690
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,590
I thought we were going to go into something else.

691
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,990
It's just that one cell.

692
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,270
It's that one beautiful cell.

693
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,310
That one brain cell you have, Dave.

694
00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,850
Treasure it.

695
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,950
Men of the truth are so horrible, it will haunt your dreams for all time.

696
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,030
Well, I think I'm used to that.

697
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,170
No.

698
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:13,430
What?

699
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,970
Wait a minute.

700
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,270
No, you wait a minute.

701
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,450
I love that area.

702
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,110
And I...

703
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,810
Hello?

704
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:23,770
Yes?

705
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,950
Who is this?

706
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,570
Who is this?

707
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,870
Who is he who wrote to us pain and misery and terror...

708
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,210
Have some fram, Doug.

709
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,490
...and sickness and...

710
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,090
...and a headache that lasts all year.

711
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:46,430
All year.

712
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,590
That's what any deity means to me.

713
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,250
...means to me.

714
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,570
Ding dong, the deity's dead.

715
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,190
Which old god?

716
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,150
The stupid Bob.

717
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,170
And the smart Bob.

718
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,710
And the fork-tongued Bob.

719
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,410
And the straight veal Bob.

720
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,310
Are all...

721
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,130
Gone.

722
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,410
Finally.

723
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,550
Put to rest.

724
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,490
Along with the other gods.

725
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,910
And the other silly superstitions that have saddled mankind for centuries.

726
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,290
Keeping them low in their ignorance.

727
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,730
And high in their expectations.

728
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,170
Or...

729
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,730
He's lining up for the...

730
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,310
...punch, folks.

731
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,190
And he's got...

732
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,310
Yes, the bloody head of Arnold Palmer dictates what?

733
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,470
And you can see how...

734
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,650
The fucking, fake, aimless, lifeless body of Arnold Palmer does.

735
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,970
I believe in Arnold Palmer.

736
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,510
Ehhhhh?!

737
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,630

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,370
nearly immediately tightly gebearing

749
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:04,370


750
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,750
young worms

751
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,930
born of a Hallow technically call statements

752
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,950
A C tanyan will be born

753
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:13,210
off.

754
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,070
I took a ship

755
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,550
at the side of the sun

756
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,130
swam like a senator

757
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,470
I reached the shore

758
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,510
of a trip

759
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,950
the kidney was brewing

760
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,530
candle to the cake

761
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,090
to the ocean floor

762
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,950
now I'm alone

763
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,150
yes I'm alone

764
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,950
me and you

765
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,550
go wrong

766
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,650
singing like a stone

767
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,590
I am a man

768
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,250
without a country

769
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,810
and I'm a boy

770
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,450
without a home

771
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,550
I'm a casualty

772
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,750
of a battle

773
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,610
of the roses

774
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,370
and the war

775
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,450
of the broken home

776
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,730
I got busted

777
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,930
for trying

778
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,070
while begging

779
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,790
carrying a weapon

780
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,310
under my coat

781
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,110
and I'm arrested

782
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,650
for all

783
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,650
a bunch of people

784
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,310
and now I am a pirate

785
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,130
on the battery

786
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,730
boat

787
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,630
I'm alone

788
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,810
I'm alone

789
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,490
and now I'm not

790
00:35:59,490 --> 00:35:59,750
a star

791
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,330
because I am a man

792
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,930
without a country

793
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,490
and I'm a boy

794
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,110
without a home

795
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,190
I'm a casualty

796
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,390
of a battle

797
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,250
of the roses

798
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,010
and the war

799
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,050
I'm a casualty

800
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,050


801
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,050


802
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,050


803
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:12,910
I'm a casualty

804
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,150
of the broken home

805
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:37,870
guitar solo

806
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,790
oh I see

807
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:41,070
a landfall

808
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,910
divided down the middle of the sea

809
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,330
and the sides are divided

810
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,570
and divided again

811
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,770
I see so

812
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,330
many people lonely

813
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,870
lover hating lover

814
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,390
friend against friend

815
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,230
now I'm alone

816
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,390
I'm alone

817
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,990
and now I'm never going home

818
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,950
I am a man

819
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,570
without a country

820
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,190
and I'm a boy

821
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,730
without a home

822
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,870
I'm a casualty

823
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,050
of a battle

824
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,890
of the roses

825
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,670
and the war

826
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,730
of the broken home

827
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:20,630
amigo

828
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,970
algorith wallet

829
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:20,990
a

830
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,050
Thank you.

831
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,970
Thank you.

832
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,630
Thank you.

833
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,170
Thank you.

834
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:16,410
Thank you.

835
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,370
Thank you.

836
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:18,790
Thank you.

837
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:44,410
Another natural product made better by chemistry is...

838
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,730
Marijuana.

839
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,650
Years of research were necessary in order to improve the product.

840
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,290
But it doesn't take long for the drug habit to make anyone over.

841
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,790
In all the colors of the rainbow.

842
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,110
A few years back, the United States of America had nearly gone crazy.

843
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,210
They were lining up dope peddlers and shooting them in the back of the head.

844
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:05,050
Just take it or leave it.

845
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,350
Then it's chemistry to the rescue.

846
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,150
The answer is a simple one.

847
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,710
Just use your head.

848
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,430
But there's one sure thing.

849
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,030
If you use narcotics,

850
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,370
the horizon is unlimited.

851
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,910
Talk to someone who has had the experience.

852
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,710
All around us are the products of modern chemistry.

853
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,290
Heroin, morphine, reds, crack, sleeping pills.

854
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,890
Something that came out of a test tube created in the chemist's laboratory

855
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,570
by a miracle of modern science

856
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:38,370
folded into a compact little package many times as strong.

857
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,530
And the dope addicts say,

858
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,650
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

859
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:47,430
Yes, chemistry has changed the world we live in.

860
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,970
Something that came out of a test tube

861
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:55,910
is going to have been transformed into the destructive forces of useful life.

862
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,130
Most teenagers start off with marijuana.

863
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,150
Some of the boys smoke them.

864
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,970
You know, the ones with backbone.

865
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,670
My girlfriend Ann and I went around with Bob.

866
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,030
They both smoked pop.

867
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,090
That's jive talk for marijuana.

868
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,910
So I tried it.

869
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,270
Funny what it does to you.

870
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,010
Everything speeds up to a hundred miles an hour.

871
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,210
There was something intriguing and different when I came home high that night.

872
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,670
You're real sharp and you laugh a lot.

873
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,190
You're the biggest person in the world.

874
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,290
All you think about day and night is

875
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,330
the radiance of sparkling colors.

876
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,110
And then you pass out, but when you wake up, it starts all over again.

877
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,290
And that's the story.

878
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,910
Unbelievable, isn't it?

879
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,450
Chemistry takes a hand in such commonplace things as

880
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,950
dope traffic in the United States.

881
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,930
It's certainly true that the increased use of narcotics

882
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,010
is a thing of the past.

883
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,370
But it's also true that the use of narcotics

884
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:44,370


885
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:44,370


886
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,550
Carrying off the harmful fumes from other chemical processes,

887
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,070
there's always the gentle dew,

888
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,430
which cover the surface with a film of gritty scratching particles.

889
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,350
It feels like your skin is being torn right off you.

890
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,090
It does.

891
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,770
Some young man may develop startling,

892
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,350
stupid, ghastly, tragic,

893
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,990
hidden secrets of nature,

894
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,450
the pioneer of tomorrow.

895
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,930
but that's another man in the toy.

896
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,150
I'm baked, man.

897
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:28,970
I call this radio show because I'm baked.

898
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:35,910
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,

899
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,050
I'm baked.

900
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,370
You are the inescapable result

901
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,010
of the experience and experience of people,

902
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:53,950
your tragedy, just as I am the inescapable result of you.

903
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,630
Are you?

904
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,150
I am.

905
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,190
Marijuana, marijuana, but, um, marijuana.

906
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,630
Yeah, um, marijuana.

907
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,390
Marijuana, marijuana as scientists smoking it.

908
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,550
Uh, um, in, in, in, uh, of a, uh,

909
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,330
uh, the, the government.

910
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:36,870
And, um, and, uh, uh, why, um, the, the, on marijuana, the marijuana, um, it, uh, has a,

911
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:44,750
has an, a brain, and you're, uh, well, uh, that, that can, uh, marijuana, um, but it,

912
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:50,770
a hobbled of, it, it's, it's, it's, it is almost important.

913
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:55,230
And, uh, um, so, so marijuana, that now,

914
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:55,450
Okay.

915
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:55,610


916
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:55,610


917
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:20,430
are really all my friends in road use, get it, musteri, men and women go the military

918
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,350
I love marijuana weed and we get to do drugs and have our family go the unfortunate thing

919
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:21,350


920
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:21,350


921
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:21,370
그.

922
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,110
Gun Til six years ago There was a boy and a woman to this

923
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,170
I know it's making me self-conscious .

924
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:24,170


925
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:24,850
it's kind of.

926
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,090
But you love the sick.

927
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,730
Bones and Cowboy Dave.

928
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,810
You want the sick.

929
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,390
You need the sick.

930
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,210
It's because they give me the medicine.

931
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,390
You sick.

932
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,530
The medicine.

933
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,490
You know, man.

934
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,330
It's all medicine, Stang.

935
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,790
Haven't we told you this numerous times

936
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,930
through the cyber codes?

937
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,410
Through the allubrium that stretches deep

938
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:51,210
into your muscles?

939
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

940
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,330
But I love the pudding so much.

941
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,550
It's like it's worth waiting

942
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,490
for the bats on the hillside.

943
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,150
It's worth the face raping.

944
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,330
It's worth having that

945
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,690
bat poison pump down

946
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,270
my goozle.

947
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,630
When you get to

948
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:10,990
fear

949
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,430
that antidote pudding

950
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,850
up your exit wound.

951
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,150
I'm fighting with your altar eagle.

952
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,510
Can I be excused now?

953
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,510
Come on.

954
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,650
You like to leave yourself

955
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,190
and leave it in a

956
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,970
I'm too disgusting

957
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,190
and I just have to go back.

958
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,630
Openly.

959
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,250
Oh, look what's in here.

960
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,890
It looks like someone's growing a brand

961
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,770
new silica serra data.

962
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,910
A new, completely

963
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,270
new silica brain.

964
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,570
Sorry.

965
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,230
It's so bouncy and glowy

966
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,010
and round.

967
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,370
Oh, I hear them.

968
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,410
It's so smooth and unwrinkled

969
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,310
in Dave's case.

970
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,370
It's like a sheet of pudding

971
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,290
without the curds on top.

972
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,130
Or is that the...

973
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,130
Oh, yeah, that's the shmegma pie.

974
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,370
Watch as we slice down.

975
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,230
Watch on the webcam

976
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,170
as we slice down into Dave's brain.

977
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,110
It's like butter.

978
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:07,050
It's so soft and yielding.

979
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,450
It just fills right open.

980
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,430
The moons of Jupiter.

981
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,370
They just slide so...

982
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,230
And it's as if there's nothing inside.

983
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,330
Just this goo.

984
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,710
You know, this is not an intelligent

985
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,770
or refractory...

986
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:20,390
Refractory.

987
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,350
...the lubrication machine

988
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,130
if you'd like to pipe up your organs.

989
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,710
This is me, and this is you, baby.

990
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,550
This is a perversion of every natural law.

991
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,930
And what is time travel?

992
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,290
But your pathetic attempt

993
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,910
to control the world around you.

994
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,150
Your futile effort

995
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,970
to have a question answered.

996
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,890
Do you think I don't know you,

997
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,650
Alexander?

998
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:44,530


999
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,730
I can look inside

1000
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:48,610
your memories.

1001
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:51,670
Your nightmares.

1002
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:53,770
Your dreams.

1003
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,110
You're a man haunted by those two most terrible words.

1004
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:02,970
What if?

1005
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:10,250
Mr. Dulles?

1006
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,110
What is it, Jimmy?

1007
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:12,570
I'm busy.

1008
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,090
Yes, sir, I know.

1009
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,210
Only it's Sheriff Gillis, and he says he needs to talk to you.

1010
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,350
Ah, he says he needs to talk to you.

1011
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:20,390
Well, I'm sorry.

1012
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,730
You're right.

1013
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:21,730


1014
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:21,730


1015
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:21,730


1016
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:21,730


1017
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:21,730


1018
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,490
I'm sorry to say, the truth is, he's in pursuit of an immodest amount of that curious weed

1019
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:28,330
which you and your school chum seem to find so fascinating.

1020
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:29,250
Doves?

1021
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,210
Doves?

1022
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,190
What do you mean, Doves?

1023
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:35,290
I just wanted your professional opinion about a hunch...

1024
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,430
A hunch?

1025
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,750
Something just keeps going around in my head.

1026
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,610
Will you give my preoccupation?

1027
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:46,170
I've replaced missing eyeballs with sawdust and glued the lids together.

1028
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,850
I've used bent aluminum combs for dentures...

1029
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:50,370
What do you mean?

1030
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:50,370


1031
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:50,370


1032
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:50,370


1033
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,390
I've used the back part of the scalp when there was no front part.

1034
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:59,910
And I folded one hand over wadded up newspapers when the other hand had no fingers.

1035
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:02,830
You find all this obscene?

1036
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,030
Do you know what is really obscene?

1037
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,550
Look at this.

1038
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,710
Look at the work I've done.

1039
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,530
This is an art.

1040
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,170
And I am the artist.

1041
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,470
One more time, I take it from the top.

1042
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,670
Say you'll never let me stop, stop, stop.

1043
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,190
One more hit, just a little pop.

1044
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,490
To get me on my way until I drop, drop, drop.

1045
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,750
Can't come down, gotta be high.

1046
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,110
Say you'll never let me die, die, die.

1047
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,590
One more time, but just a little try.

1048
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,930
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high.

1049
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:49,970
Well, I can be sweet.

1050
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,350
But I'm not a sweet girl.

1051
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:50,350


1052
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,290
But I'm better when I'm bad.

1053
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,510
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.

1054
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,030
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.

1055
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,270
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.

1056
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,570
Can't come down, gotta stay high.

1057
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,870
Can't come together, but we try, try, try.

1058
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:10,550
One more night, a feeling so good I've

1059
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,670
gotta keep it bopping till I die, die, die.

1060
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,950
Can't come down, gotta stay high.

1061
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,310
What'll I do without my high, high, high?

1062
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,730
Life's too fast, I need a lot of slack.

1063
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,090
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back.

1064
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,190
I can be sweet.

1065
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,430
But I'm better when I'm bad.

1066
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,710
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.

1067
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,290
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.

1068
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:41,470
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.

1069
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,950
Can't come down, gotta stay high.

1070
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,890
Can't come together, but we try, try, try.

1071
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:00,930
Can't come together, but we try, try, try.

1072
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,350
I can't come together, but we try, try, try.

1073
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:03,310
I'm a high, high, high.

1074
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:08,570
Bob Diddley, Zeesa and Led Zimmerman did Hi High Five,

1075
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,690
before that clips from Mr. Sister, The Time Machine.

1076
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:19,170
ESO Radio from WCSB Cleveland, Artemia Salina, Fernanda Dandy

1077
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:19,570
Lemaire.

1078
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:20,870
and the Bishop.

1079
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,550
See Yeti video in Yahoo Group's friends

1080
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:27,470
for more from the Bishop.

1081
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,990
And now, friends,

1082
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,090
retardation from Lemuria,

1083
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,930
Puzzling Evidence,

1084
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,710
and Dr. Philodrummon.

1085
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,530
I'm hot and heat with a look at the creative

1086
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,750
and different ways to say 80.

1087
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,810
The Western's conditions are so dreadful these days.

1088
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,690
Expect highs at just about all the lower elevations

1089
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,570
in the high country.

1090
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:19,570
I like to do good things for my brain.

1091
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,610
I like to give my brain a good massage.

1092
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,350
Are you a break thinker?

1093
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,950
One of those shiatsu massagers.

1094
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,490
Just open up my skull.

1095
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,510
Yeah.

1096
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,350
And start kneading the gray matter.

1097
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,250
Uh-huh.

1098
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,170
Sort of a self-trepanator, right?

1099
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:37,610
Yeah.

1100
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:39,850
So...

1101
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,890
I don't use any fancy cutting tools.

1102
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:45,290
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade.

1103
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,330
I hear somebody's cell phone making a weird...

1104
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:50,130
that weird buzz.

1105
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,170
Yeah, you know who that is.

1106
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:51,570
That's my breathing.

1107
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,310
Hear it?

1108
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,030
That's my air tube.

1109
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:56,090
Oh, okay.

1110
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,630
That's the government listening to this show

1111
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:00,270
and all the other shows on KPJ.

1112
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:01,510
Are you still in that iron lung?

1113
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:07,210
Um, I've upgraded to a new plastic lung.

1114
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:08,230
Oh, okay.

1115
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,690
One of those new fangled things.

1116
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,050
Now, friends, this church of the subgenius,

1117
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,690
this story of Bob...

1118
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,790
It could be the greatest job!

1119
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:17,710
Ever told!

1120
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,590
But if...

1121
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:22,790
And only if Earth can make it to the punchline!

1122
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,630
And we can do that, friends,

1123
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:26,730
if you will use your own...

1124
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,050
Your own hate.

1125
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,950
Actually, you don't have to use anything of yours.

1126
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,590
As Dr. Legume said,

1127
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,690
use their hate and their fear.

1128
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,510
Pump up your mutant abnormality.

1129
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:38,850
Flaunt your weirdness

1130
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,990
and wag it in their slack-jawed,

1131
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,330
uncomprehending faces.

1132
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,770
That will do more than your vote.

1133
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:46,730
Okay.

1134
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,230
Wag your weirdness right there in public, friends.

1135
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:50,890
As St. Hendrick said,

1136
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,310
let your freak flag...

1137
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,790
Wave your freak flag high!

1138
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,570
Freedom, freedom,

1139
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,030
kindly, loving,

1140
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:02,630
you'll be absolutely free

1141
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:06,670
only if you want to be.

1142
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,090
guitar solo

1143
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,010
solo

1144
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:42,650
solo

1145
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,950
solo

1146
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,710
solo

1147
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:49,810
solo

1148
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,410
solo

1149
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,150
solo

1150
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:53,490
solo

1151
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:53,530
solo

1152
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,710
You see yourself being in the page being turned

1153
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,650
and see yourself next to a

1154
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,250
soldier

1155
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,310
being cut down.

1156
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:04,470
You know, you arrive on a scene as where everything is

1157
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,350
beautiful, lush green, brighter than day.

1158
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:07,630
And

1159
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:10,630
like you see a completely crystal scene of a

1160
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:11,770
soldier being shot down.

1161
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,670
Also you feel yourself helping that soldier up.

1162
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,330
Not

1163
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,630
his uniform, but you're feeling yourself

1164
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,590
and another

1165
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,810
vibe, another sense of that soldier.

1166
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,530
It seems like a soul of him.

1167
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,450
And then you

1168
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,710
whisk back to the waterhole.

1169
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,750
Another wild beer, thank you.

1170
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:31,310
Thank you.

1171
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:33,730
Oh,

1172
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,550
beautiful.

1173
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:36,670


1174
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:36,770
oh,

1175
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:37,550
oh,

1176
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,170
oh,

1177
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,410
oh,

1178
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,750
oh.

1179
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:46,970
I can still recall my first

1180
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,610
guitar.

1181
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:51,050
A

1182
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,350
Futurama with a tremolo

1183
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:54,790
bar.

1184
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,370
I tried to play

1185
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,490
like Jimmy with my

1186
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:01,990
teeth.

1187
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,770
The dentist

1188
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,090
He saw them, said good grief

1189
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,870
So when it is nearing Christmas

1190
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:19,070
The present I always wish for is

1191
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,750
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1192
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:27,310
When he played it was a crazy sound

1193
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:34,290
He played his bloody guitar upside down

1194
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:41,270
I would have seen him play the Isle of Wight

1195
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:48,350
I gave a pinching half way through the night

1196
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:50,090
Alright!

1197
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,250
So when it is nearing Christmas

1198
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,530
The present I always wish for is

1199
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,250
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1200
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:19,110
When it is nearing Christmas

1201
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,730
The present I always wish for is

1202
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:21,750
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1203
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:21,790
Alright!

1204
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,390
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1205
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:23,410
When it is nearing Christmas

1206
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:25,550
The present I always wish for is

1207
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,570
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1208
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,010
Alright!

1209
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,650
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1210
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,130
When it is nearing Christmas

1211
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:53,270
The present I always wish for is

1212
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,530
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1213
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:53,530


1214
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:53,690
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1215
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:53,710
When it is nearing Christmas

1216
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:53,810
The present I always wish for is

1217
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,050
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1218
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:01,570
Alright!

1219
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,110
Jimi Hendrix Strat!

1220
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,410
And now...

1221
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:48,130
Friends, that was Captain Sensible with Jimi Hendrix's Strat and some excerpts from Rainbow Bridge and so forth by Hendrix himself and some preaching from Austin.

1222
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,610
All put together that last segment there by Potare Nostril.

1223
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:58,290
And remember, friends, www.subgenius.com.

1224
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,270
Um...

1225
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,430
That's Bob.

1226
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:38,470
Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1227
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:47,890
Uh, uh, uh, where she has a three-and-a-half-year-old toddler who's already been told to hate Bob into basically killing Bob.

1228
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,270
Jim, thanks for the call.

1229
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:58,090
You know, uh, it's funny because I called in, uh, about, uh, 50 years ago and tried to get ahold of Dr. Contreras.

1230
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:04,910
Because I guess there was some other doctor who was, um, possibly getting somebody for me to talk to.

1231
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,390
An official declaration of war against Bob.

1232
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,710
Shock and horror lingered.

1233
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,310
And there goes the torch parade.

1234
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,630
What sort of goings-on is that, anyway?

1235
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,170
Some sort of rites for the Temple of Vampires.

1236
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,190
Jack, you mean to sit there and say...

1237
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,090
All that gang was vampires?

1238
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:30,970
How do I know?

1239
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,630
At least they seem to be priests of the Temple.

1240
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,830
Yeah, robes and torches and stuff.

1241
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:41,530
Okay, friends on the Internet, where I can flog our swag legally.

1242
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:51,810
If you want to help yourself and the Church of the Subgenius and get a pretty cool package with, like, 25 different nifty things in it,

1243
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:55,110
like pins and bumper stickers and a real preacher card,

1244
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:58,270
you need to go to subgenius.com.

1245
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,230
And click to become a minister.

1246
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,230
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get.

1247
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:11,130
And you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum, which is members only,

1248
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,650
and where we talk in ways that people don't talk on Facebook.

1249
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,570
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1250
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:19,370
Isn't that funny?

1251
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:25,030
We also have things like t-shirts and damn near everything you can think of with Bob's face on it.

1252
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,230
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics.

1253
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:37,150
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs of the Bob songs and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1254
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:42,950
And best of all, from our main online store, you can buy the book of the subgenius,

1255
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,570
which is by far the greatest thing we've ever done.

1256
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:50,950
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book, 22 bucks, in print for over 30 years.

1257
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:55,210
And every copy that we send out is signed by yours truly.

1258
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,210
For that matter, your address on the Puffy underpass.

1259
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,070
The envelope is handwritten by me also.

1260
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:01,450
Keeps my fingers nimble.

1261
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,410
That's subgenius.com.

1262
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,610
And remember, it's only money.
