Um, don't congratulate yourself now, Doctor.
D-O-K, Doctor.
Sit down in that chaise large.
Place your feet behind Chaz's ears and begin rubbing slowly.
Eh?
Little blue ones that dance in front of your eyes.
Just reach over and take one of these Sumerian tablets.
I think you'll feel the presence of something that goes way, way, way back.
Once you do, the floodgates will be all open.
Nice and open.
And now, the sub-genius hour of swag!
It leaves its victims either dead or incurably mad.
You got that?
Have any further messages been decoded?
Or aren't we allowed to know?
I'm not sure, Mr. President.
And now there will be no further messages to decode.
You must shut down your transmitter.
Shut it down.
I've got to clamp the lid on this business.
Stop these communications.
Oh, damn.
You know what?
Those that lie within your power, Mr. President, you can declare a national emergency.
I don't have to.
It's here.
But I don't.
And not merely national.
Wait, I'm getting a no-go signal.
Now I'm losing one of the craft.
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?
I lost contact.
A lot of dust blowing up there.
Okay, they're calling those two little peewee dogs.
The pumpkin birds, I think they're calling them now.
Okay.
Come in.
No, I'm sorry.
The Red Seed is...
We lost the Red Seed.
Now how the hell are you guys going to explain away a town that's either wiped out or reduced to mindlessness?
I'm starting it again.
Well, I can't change into Superman.
I can do my best here for the show.
I remember staying at my post.
Now it's time.
I can't stop.
I'm not being swayed by these demonic faces.
They're gibbering, squeaking ghosts and phantom of silence.
Malicious demons.
Incubi and Subdubi.
That's for you.
Oh, I couldn't see.
Twittering woofers from the underworld.
No, fleshless heads reaching up.
The terrible rotten smell of burning.
The terrible rotten smell.
The terrible rotten smell of burning.
The terrible rotten smell.
Okay, now how...
What are you having for breakfast right now?
Burning flesh.
I can't.
Hey, it sounds good.
Well, it is traditional.
So if you're going up north on 80 on Immigr...Graph...Graph...I...
Well, then you'll need your portable personal refrigerator.
It works as your condiment for the people that came across and failed to make it a cooler.
Some would call this mini-fridge a cooler.
But I choose to call it a refrigerator.
Because it looks and acts like a refrigerator.

A refrigerator.
Wow.
In fact, it acts like a duck.
It walks like a duck.
Well, I guess it's a refrigerator.
Well, it might be a cellar.
And therefore, its easy take anywhere design makes it perfect for your car, van, motorhome,
tailgate parties, lynchings, picnics, dorm rooms, sweatshops.
It's beautiful in here.
Even near the TV when you're too lazy to get up out of the chair and you don't want to
miss a minute of your...
I wonder what's in here.
A favorite sport or ballgame with written scripts for the kitchen fridge.
Oh yeah?
Ice caps thousands of feet high melted away in a few days.
Great.
Well, those people must use atomic power as we use water.
It's okay, show begins.
Dave, they'll be able to..after they sign that bill tomorrow, they can search your home
without even telling you.
They can search your bag of candy, man.
There gonna be feds on the street searching your bag of...anybody wearing a funny-looking
suspicious costume.
costume. If you ask me, the door
done swung wide open, and
every neo... I don't want to say
the word anymore, because it might not be allowed.
Just got his way.
And people didn't even know it. And, of course, we
aren't really people, are we?
Well, that's... You know, some call us
the rats in the walls.
But other people kind
of wish they could party like we do.
In those cracks.
They think we're the rats in the walls?
The interstices between
the insulation
and the walls. Wow, you're saying
that... That's where we're partying, man.
They're like mouse thing, right? And we're the rodents?
Or rodents, depending on...
I've got a plan, see?
I've got it all planned out.
We'll live underground
when they take over. And we'll
plot and plan. But you know,
there's gonna be
subgeniuses that
hunt us
for the man. They'll hunt
other subgeniuses.
I would like a bubble that no one
could pierce to float around in.
Interruption. Prolofeed.
Oceana Special Forces
have begun ground phase of Oceana's
plus war against terrorism in
East Asia, operating in small numbers
in southern East Asia and support
wise of the CIA's effort in
the East Asian heartland. The Eurasians
have said they are confident this can be
all worked out within a matter of five
fiscal seasons.
Their presence on the battlefield
field, pardon me,
battlefield,
comes amid growing indications
that the war's unintensity
is about to speedwise dramatically
after almost two weeks of oceanic air
strikes that many PACS
officials say have vaporized
East Asian defenses. Teledep mandatory
at 1800. Victory!
Brazil.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, Brazil.
That's the life
we're living in. 1980 Brazil.
It's
the reality that we have to fake
face every day when we think we might
go up the elevator and this sneaky lady
or Mr. Dogfish or some of the other
evil creatures they're releasing from
the side factories in Langley might
release on us.
This optimist, he thinks the life is
like Brazil. It's more like the
Matrix, dude. You're in a jar.
You're plugged in somewhere,
copper top. This is all just part
of the program, dude. Get used to it.
Oh, that would be so depressing.
I would want to sell my Forrester
and my Outback and I would probably want
to maybe even sell one of these
cylindrical objects that you gave me that...
No, there is no spoon.
Well, there's no silver spoon that we
can all claim was dangling from our
orifices when we were born, but
we've tried our best, haven't we?
Battle of the Millionaires.
Yes, tonight
in Afghanistan,
the Battle of the Millionaires.
Tonight, the wealthy
East Asian
is top of the lot on the news.
He's got a dream in his own mind.
He's been talking directly to his doom king.
Hello?
Hello?
Sheriff's Office speaking.
Oh, gentlemen, we're not dealing with
a flu virus here. We're dealing with
an often lethal, always
debilitating encephalic
mutation.
Bring out your days!
Attention
conspiracy!
You are condemned.
Did you know that?
The instant the normals you support
attempted to take over our slack,
you sentenced yourselves
to death.
The slack forces of the
Church of the Subgenius are here to shut
down your system and seek justice
for our oppressed.
Highly trained clergy are coming to
shut down, once and for all,
the man's ring of pinkness
and the conspiracy that
supports them and their actions.
Our forces are armed
with state-of-the-art, mind-altering
paraphernalia. What are you
using? Obsolete and ineffective
thought processes?
Our heliopters will
rain phlegm down
upon your camps before
you detect them on your radar.
Our bongs are
so accurate, we can drop
them right through your Neiman Marcus coffee
tables. Our infantry
is trained for slacking off in any climate
and terrain on Earth.
Subgenius warriors
fight with superior marksmanship
and are armed with superior
psychological weapons.
You have only one choice.
Surrender now,
and we will give you a second chance.
Really?
We will let you live.
If you surrender, no harm will come
to you. No, no, really!
When you decide to surrender,
approach subgenius forces
with your feet in your mouth.
Sling your bullshit and lies
back across your back towards
the ground. Remove your wallet
and expel any cash to the coffers
of Dobbs. Doing
this is your only chance
of survival!
Bombs
not racism!
Oh yes, my friends,
and uh, hey,
hey, we thank
to great Reverend Crawford
Smith for a great
conspiracy broadcast
script. Anti-conspiracy
war broadcast
script. Friends,
friends, oh, and this
music in the background is by
Xerox, a tune called
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
And now, friends, but actually
I want to switch over to this music
by this new, this person named
Gene Strong, who makes
movies in Chicago.
Apparently Reverend Tesla Coyle
sent us this and said that we
would like it, and he was right, because it is
wonderful background music
for such as ourselves,
so you know, to tell
the truth, the evil,
evil truth. Friends, you know
this war is, uh,
it's a confusing
mess. You know, a lot of people have very
very strong opinions, and I do too.
My strong opinion is that I
don't know what's going on.
Because I don't trust anybody.
I know that sounds
kind of
sick or something, or wise,
I don't know, I mean,
but that's the problem, now ain't it?
Um, you know, I'm, I
God bless America, I
love my
homeland, and I've traveled around the world,
quite a bit, and I know how
horrible it is in
everywhere else. I mean, it's
horrible everywhere. It's rough here, it's rough
here, there, and everywhere.
Although I understand they just
decriminalized in England, you know.
Now I don't have to learn how to say
Var is der Badkammer
und der Drugs, I still blieft.
Anyway, friends,
yes, it's an upsetting thing, and
you know, there was a time,
well, you know, I mean, uh,
for the first month or so, like
most people, I was, uh,
ready to say,
well, uh, we must
root out these
evildoers, and of course we
must indeed root out these
evildoers, but then, you know, then you start
seeing the evidence
that the evidence might be doctored,
and you have to wonder who that
evidence comes from, and you read some
anti-government thing, and
you agree with it, and then it turns out to
be from Pravda.
But you don't know if it's really from Pravda, or from,
from some, you know,
wise military person in America, like it
claims to be, saying that, well,
yes, it is all a lie,
and the whole reason for all of this is
because the oil
will be gone in 20 years,
and the world will plunge into chaos,
and, uh, 25%
of the oil is under Saudi Arabia,
and the government of Saudi Arabia
is collapsing, and
you have to kind of go, well, now,
um, uh, certainly
it's possible that this whole thing is,
is an excuse to strong-arm
into the region,
basically colonize,
uh, set up camps here, there, and
everywhere, and then suddenly colonize Saudi Arabia
before they can have a chance to side with
Iraq and form another world superpower,
and my friend, you have to ask yourself,
do I want to be
a slave
to Mullah
bin Laden, or
Mullah Bush?
And that's where, you know, it's like, well,
Mullah Bush would probably
still let me go to strip joints.
Sigh.
And, you know, once again, the conspiracy
has given us subgeniuses
a
huge range of choices between
A and B.
And this time, it's a fairly clear-cut choice.
You know, I mean, of course, it must be,
uh, uh,
well, uh, of course, you know,
we, we, we
don't,
we don't want to, uh,
have all the Connie-ites, uh,
forced underground
where they can't learn to read,
have to wear masks so we can't see their
purty faces, or their, their purty legs,
or, and, and, and,
you know, they, well, well, friends,
if you're confused, I got this little, little, um,
read out here in the, uh,
the internet from, uh,
from St. Bayron Werner,
who helps, uh, with, uh,
this handy guide
will help us to distinguish differences
between terrorists,
terrorists, and the U.S.
government. Uh,
let's just, uh, switch, and I'll, uh,
really, I guess all I need to do is describe
the terrorists, if you were
ever wondering what it is that makes
a terrorist, and, and if you're feeling
confused, this should straighten you out.
Terrorists, well,
the supposed leader of the terrorists
is the spoiled son
of a powerful politician from an
extremely wealthy oil
family. Uh,
the leader of the terrorists has declared
a
holy war, or jihad, against
his enemies, and believes that any
nation not with him is against him.
Believes God is on his side, and
that any means are justified.
The terrorists
are supported by extremely
fundamentalist religious leaders
who preach hatred, intolerance,
subjugation of women, mistreatment, and
worse, of gay, lesbian, and
bisexual, and transgendered people,
and persecution of
non-believers. That's us, friends.
The terrorists
leadership was not elected
by a majority of the people
in a free and democratic election.
The terrorists kill thousands
of innocent civilians, some of them
children, in cold-blooded bombings.
They operate through
clandestine organizations
with agents in many countries
using bombs, assassination,
and other terrorist tactics,
friends, and, worst
of all, the terrorists use war
as a pretext
to clamp down on dissent
and undermine
civil liberties. And I guess that's
what the big worry here, friends,
is that our brave soldiers
are going to go through hell
and kick booty
and come back to a country that
ain't the one they left.
Where you, all of a sudden, can't
smoke cigarettes in a bar or a restaurant
and suddenly they've made laws
to look out for your own good,
to tell you what you in your private own home
can or can't do in bed,
and so forth.
Oh, wait a minute. Now, maybe I should think of better
examples. Uh, something
worse. Anyway, friends,
the bottom...
Well,
once again, let us, uh...
People, what
have you done?
Locked him in his golden
cage.
Yeah.
Golden cage.
Made him
bend to your religion.
Him resurrected
from the grave.
Yeah.
From the grave.
He is the god of nothing,
which is
all that you can see.
Yeah.
You are the god of everything
since he's inside
you and me.
Yeah.
So lean upon him
gently
and don't call on him to say
fool.

oh...
That's not
the moment
now.
Does he realize
you've tried
to Лолъ
and to
The
guest


yeah
Each claim ain't just a part of him
Also a part of me
So you guys aren't really disturbed as you sound?
I mean, like about the fact that our world is rapidly crumbling around us?
Just like the World Trade Center crumbled around those people in Battery Park?
Well, you know, I had a full...
I avoided the news for two years, and now that I've plunged back into it,
I've been diving into all this incredible detail that you can find in foreign newspapers,
on the World Wide Web, and so forth.
Yeah, there's a lot of news out there.
But you have to turn off the TV, and the radio for that matter, to make it work.
And you have to be able to read.
But there's some weird stories out there of people,
caught wandering in the desert, and wandering in America.
Do you have one that you can play on the audience of 12 we have here?
Well, I'll tell you.
The crazies are getting crazier.
They're leeching up out of the woodwork,
as if soaked up with a miracle industrial chemical called war.
And as sacred scribe to the Church of Subgenius,
I have been the recipient of quite a...
bit of diseased mail, email,
and internet comings and goings,
by people who take gigantic world-spanning events personally.
And allow them to help create the cracks that are crumbling it.
Well, they feel responsible for everything good that happens,
and everything bad that happens, they blame on Bob.
Which, you know...
You should have neutralized this faction back when you had a 3,000-foot penis, Stang.
Oh, the conspiracy is gonna do their thing no matter what.
The consp... the conspiracy... you know, the... the... there's just... it just is.
It's... it... there's...
Stang, in the world we're in, you should have had their house numbers and everything like that.
And one day, uh, you know, as they were going out, brrrrrrrat,
you know, just like in Europe and the Middle East and everywhere else.
You know?
You would have got them.
That's what you should have done.
As a true leader... We had Bob and...
Bob in our sights.
You should have eliminated...
We had... we had the Moolah Dobbs in our sights.
And we didn't... and... and we lost... we didn't have the nerve.
It was a lack of nerve.
Look like smoking, Imam.
It's more than a hookah.
It's a bond of fixtures.
Stuck somewhere between the dentures in your head and your eye.
An aluminum paste that lives inside your...
Bob's not Bob!
Bob Dobbs.
Bob's not Bob!
Bob Dobbs.
Well, I remember him when he used to clean eels down on the dock.
He wasn't anymore than a 300, 400 pound little baby.
We had to take care of him because he couldn't fish the way the rest of us could.
Bob Dobbs.
Oh, you're saying now he's gone all the way up and down Wall Street with that one gamey leg
and making all that money.
Ah, be Jesus, sir Christ, I... I can't imagine it.
I can't imagine it.
Friends, you have nothing to worry about.
All of your needs and all of your proportionate cares and worries have been flaked about and given back to once they came, friends.
There's nothing to stampede about but panic itself.
You're all cattle now.
You're all wearing horns.
There's the river.
There's the female divestress.
You can smell the many of these a mile away.
Mmm.
Mmm.
The longhorn steers.
There are many things your pathetic human minds could never understand.
Yeah.
Yeah, they all had that W brand on them.
Earth.
The barbed and W.
Oh, my God.
Hey.

Ha!
What is this, another piece of information I forgot to pass on to you guys?
Well, it's a number.
But in any case, somebody will help.
Must be wiped out.
Someone will answer your pleas.
I cannot fly in the face of 180 years of American history.
No, don't fly in my face.
For God's sake.
I cannot start a war.
A month from now, we may not have the strength to fight one.
The Russians may have in their hands the power now.
Oh, I'm shocked.
Ah, we're remilitarizing.
This country will not launch a war.
George.
George W. Bush's desire to create a U.S. space core.
We've served a great many years together.
And there's never been a day when I couldn't happily go along with any decision of yours.
But I have a responsibility to this country, too.
And I can't stand by and see it destroyed.
Our difference is that I don't believe it can be destroyed by 13 slips of paper covered with obscure symbols.
The Ketler's empire was destroyed.
Oh, there it goes.
Obscure symbols.
An empire one moment and nothing but glowing rubble afterwards.
Excuse me, sir.
Won't you come in, please?
How do you do?
How do you do, Mr. President?
Mr. President.
Mr. President.
It was very good of you to come.
Mr. President, please do well.
I want to tell you that I'm bringing your boy with you.
Boy with you?
I want to bring your couple to the start of this whole business.
Okay.
I want you to sit down, please.
Okay.
I'm not going to drag this out.
No, not there.
Stop dragging things around.
Let's just get to business.
You made a pretty fair start in that, Mr. President.

When you clamped the center ship on us, have any further messages been decoded?
Just show.
Or aren't we allowed to know?
I'm not sure, Mr. President.
There have been no further decodings.
And now there will be no further messages to decode.
You must shut down your transmitter.
Shut it down.
We're not serious.
I've got to clamp the lid on this business.
Stop these communications.
Oh, damn.
Reach for the steam whistle.


I'm going to have to go.
I'm going to have to go.
I'm going to have to go.
I'm going to have to go.
I'm going to have to go.

I'm going to have to go.
Reach for the steam whistle today.
It will be extremely interesting to hear the reaction of President Musharraf.
And be sure to ask for free shipping.
To send a delegation into Kandahar to try to convince the Taliban to hand over Osama
bin Laden.
Even professionals can't give you the fast, easy, affordable clean of the compact steam
whistle.
Well, I'll have you know, it's a person who has very, very big ears and eyes and very
tiny, tiny ears.
And he's got very tiny, beautiful little hairs.
Osama bin Laden is not a true representative of the German or the Hungarian people.
Dave, you wanted some news?
I've got some details.
Here's some interesting details.
The Augustine haircut.
Pardon me.
I'm sorry, what?
You asked for details from the news.
And I've got some really interesting, weird little details about the Department of Homeland
Security's...
Use of the Army, Reservists, and National Guard people at internal security checkpoints.
Now get this.
Scare me, baby.
I'm here.
The basic plan is to have each of these internal security checkpoints manned by six armed Army
or National Guard Reservists carrying M16s with full field kit and a medium machine gun
emplacement.
But according...
Now get this.
You'll love this.
According to a Homeland Security representative who requested anonymity, the Department of



Security said the National Guard had ordered the M16s to be disarmed and to be dispatched




It might take, quote, it might take double or triple that number of lazy used car salesman,
fast food workers, and other weekend warriors, unquote, to man a single post.
Now, here's what they're gonna do with these things.
Gee.
All citizens not having proper identification will be detained.
All foreign nationals will be detained.
All citizens who are deemed to be acting in a suspicious manner will be detained.
Well, we're all doing that all the time.
But I...
Um, let's see, uh, the reservists and guardsmen are also, uh, oh, the, the guys that they got to do this aren't, it's like, as Tom Ridge has expressed his disgust at the quality of the reservists and guardsmen, who themselves are now objecting to their new uniforms, which they repeatedly complain are ill-fitting and silly-looking.
It's a new gray uniform with a gray helmet and a visor so you can only see the eyes. The only thing you can see is from the lips down to prevent, quote, prevent any retribution, unquote, from people who don't like this new idea.
Oh my God, this sounds like Deutschland Uberology.
Well, the, it says that is another problem. Um, the uniform looks exactly like the Imperial Stormtroopers from Star Wars, except instead of white, it is gray.
The trainees seem to like the helmet's little transceivers.
Transceivers, so they can communicate with each other, chatting until their instructor deactivates their headset. But otherwise, say they feel like extras in a low-budget science fiction movie.
Oh, well, see, now we have, we can empathize with these guys, because we felt like low-budget extras in a B-movie for how many years, Chaz?
So, um, so this...
That's a long time. All we've got to do is get the uniforms and the costumes down, and, um...
Oh, you'll like, here's, here, you'll like this part.
We could set up our own checkpoints.
This order was also, has also proved very trying for the instructors, as the reservists and guardsmen couldn't seem to grasp why people should be shot.
In frustration, the instructor finally told them to shut up and shouted, quote,
Shoot them because I say you're supposed to shoot them. Damn it, do what you're told. You follow orders. They are bad guys.
If your officer tells you to shoot someone, you shoot them.
His aggravation seemed to make little impact on the men who were...
They're mostly interested in when they can go back home to their families, or what is for dinner in the mess hall.
Thank God for people like that, like good soldier Schweick, who do...
Let's see, this drill sergeant was disgusted with the performance of his trainees.
He kept repeating and repeating, we're here to protect the people, we have to regain control over the country.
Then he put his hands, his head in his hands and shook his head.
And you could tell he didn't believe a word of what he was saying, like it was a big joke.
Well, we know you have to destroy the global village to save it.
And anyway, Secretary Ridge enraged at the shortage of personnel he deems fit to wear the distinctive uniforms he so carefully designed.
First suggested a draft until he was informed that draftees are even less disciplined than our reservists and guardsmen.
And that news came from New Monet, Reverend New Monet of the likeexcess.org.
Well, that is unsettling, Chad. What do you think about this?
You're going to be playing. Man, give it up. Not give it up.
But you're going to be like, you know, underground Joe playing in the mountains for all the compadres.
This, you know, what...
I'm going to become a secret agent man, dude.
There's going to be a barbed wire around Brushwood from now on.
That's right, I'm going to be a secret agent man.
It's going to be a survivalist compound.
I'm going to become a G-boy.
You can be number six.
I'm going to be a G-boy.
I'll be number six.
I said, go take your G-string out of here because I was not a G-boy.
When they came for the people with kind of like fuzzy lips, I said, go on out of here because I'm clean shaven.
There can only be one.
When they came for people that had, you know, like real hairy feet and stuff like that, I said, there's none of them here.
Then they finally, they came for me.
And what a party.
Well, Dave, it's because it takes one to make a village.
And we want you to be number one in our village.
Dave, you could...
It only takes one.
Village to make an idiot.
Just like a fuse, it takes one to blow.
It only takes one number six to escape from a village.
One number six?
I thought it was a seven.
Oh, that was less with an assault rifle, right?
You're not allowed to say that, Dave.
I'm not sure what the criminal code is nowadays.
You know what I'm saying?
It's how I've had pieces of my brain removed.
But, you know what I mean?
Isn't that still a number seven?
Stank?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wasn't paying any attention.
I was listening to that groovy music in the background.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
For Russians and Ukrainians, we're...
Okay.
Let me...
We try.
The opus fat ref...
No, no.
Easy.
You've died to it.
P.
P.
P.
Please.
Jeez.
All right.
Magic food.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In the course, the normal course of events,
the high E-pop comes to the...
AndIRROR to...
The
place where Vigil costs five in 지�be
of the nameless mission.
Tonight, no such report is needed.
It has already been delivered
by the yet-tinson people.
We need to talk in peace...
Yes, friends, tonight we are a species
seas awakened to danger and called to defend our slack. Our grief has turned to anger, our anger
to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to orgasm or bring orgasm to our enemies, orgasms
will be done. I thank the Council of Subgeni in the Hierarchy for its leadership at such an
important time. All the Subgeni were touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Holocaustals
and Evangelicals joining together on Alt.Slack, mocking God Bless America. And you did more than
mock. You acted by delivering the insight and freedom of speech to protect our communities
from militaristic jingoism. On behalf of the Subgeni in America, I thank the world for their
outpouring of support. Subgeniuses will never forget the sounds of our anti-music played in
Berlin, in the hash bars of Amsterdam.
And in the cold wastes of Kedah. We will not forget European skeptics pointing out the bull on CNN
or the frenzied copulation in Discordian sex temples. We will not forget the moments of humor
and days of mourning in Alt.Slack and the Subgenius chat rooms. Nor will we forget the slack
full of other religions who died with our own. Dozens of Muslims, more than a hundred and
thirty-five, have died with our own. We will not forget the slacks full of Muslims, more than a hundred and thirty-five,
and thirty Jews, more than two thousand Christians, men and women of Hindu, Buddhist and Mormon faiths,
and hundreds of atheists. Subgeniuses have no truer friends than atheists.
But Subgeni have many questions tonight. Subgeni are asking,
What will happen to our civil liberties? The evidence we have gathered all points to a
tightly organized military-industrial complex run by the Conspiracy. They are the same murderers
for the Taliban and for the Southern Baptist Convention
and are responsible for the Cold War.
The leadership of the conspiracy has great influence in Afghanistan
and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country.
In Afghanistan, we see the conspiracy's vision for the world.
The Afghanistan people have been brutalized.
Many are starving and many have fled.
Women are not allowed to attend school.
You can be jailed for using the Internet.
Religion can be practiced only as the leaders dictate.
Indeed, a man can be jailed in Afghanistan for wearing a dob's head.
Our nameless mission then begins with the conspiracy,
but it does not end there.
It will not end until every subgenius is on a pleasure saucer
with its own personal sex goddess.
And yet subgeniuses are asking,
Why?
Why do they hate us?
They hate what they see as right.
A slackful, self-indulgent anti-government.
They hate our freedoms.
Our freedom of religion.
Our freedom of speech.
Our freedom to laugh and copulate and disagree with each other.
These conspirators kill not merely to end lives,
but to disrupt and end a way of life.
With every atrocity, they hope that America and the subgenius grows fearful,
retreating from the world and forsaking our friends.
They stand against.
They stand against us because we stand in their way.
And we will accept ever tightening,
quote,
security laws,
unquote,
in the name of fighting terrorism,
in the name of freedom.
We are not deceived by their pretenses to patriotism.
We have seen their kind before.
They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century
by sacrificing human life to serve their radical vision
by abandoning every value except the will to power.
They follow.
They will follow in the path of fascism and Nazism and totalitarianism.
And they will follow that path all the way to where it ends,
in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies.
Subgeni should not expect one battle,
but a lengthy campaign like the Vietnam War and the war on drugs combined.
It may include pointless strikes that look good on TV
and covert operations against a group of people,
but it will be a great victory for the American citizens,
secret even in success.
They will seize funds from American citizens the way they do against drug dealers.
Unless they're dealing alcohol and tobacco.
Dismantle the remains of the free press,
all three of them left,
and portray any dissent as a threat to security until there is no refuge or no rest.
And they will pursue nations that deny them oil or cheap labor
on the grounds of fighting terrorism.
Every political group in every region will be given a decision to make.
Either you are with the military-industrial complex,
or you are with the terrorists.
From this day forward, any person that continues to harbor or support unorthodox views
will be regarded by the United States as a terrorist.
Our species, the subgenius, have been put on notice.
We are not immune from attack.
We will take defensive measures against oppression to protect subgenii.
Today, dozens of grassroots clenches,
as well as established groups like Sputum and the Coniites,
are taking responsibility for protecting our precious slack
from the Homeland Security conspiracy.
These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level,
so tonight, I announce the creation of a council-level position
reporting directly to Bob.
The office of the Clench of Coni Babylonian.
Many will be involved in this effort,
from slack masters to sex gods and goddesses
to the Bobbies we have called to active duty.
All deserve our thanks and all share our frop.
And tonight, a few hundred miles from evacuated Dobbs Town,
I have a message for our clenches.
Be ready.
Bob.
Bob has called the doctors to alert,
and there is a reason.
The hour is coming when subgenii will act,
and you will make Bob proud!
The Yeti world is rallying to the Nameless Mission.
They understand that if this crackdown goes unresisted,
their own cities, their own citizens may be next.
Oppression unanswered can not only bring down
politicians, it can threaten even our sex lives.
And you know that we will not allow that.
The Yeti world is rallying to the Nameless Mission.
They understand that if this crackdown goes unresisted,
their own cities, their own citizens may be next.
The Yeti world is rallying to the Nameless Mission.
They understand that if this crackdown goes unresisted,

Oh, and it is a grim and grave world that the young folks are entering.
Oh, and it is a grim and grave world that the young folks are entering.
It's not a big deal to me.
It's not a big deal to me.
When I was a teenager, I honestly truly believed that the nuclear war,
mutual assured destruction would leave the planet a barren and lifeless plane,
one that would make Planet of the Apes look good.

One that would make Planet of the Apes look good.
Now, of course, kids are merely paranoid about being thrown into a Road Warrior world.
environment, which to some of them probably looks pretty good.
And maybe they're right.
Maybe the only way to fix things right is to start with a clean slate.
But, you know, you have to wonder if they aren't going to clean the slate so well that
there's nothing left but microbes to re-evolve back up into rock-and-stick-throwing, territory-pissing
primates.
Domesticated primates who still fling their poo at each other and shriek madly as soon
as one starts eyeballing the other one's property, which is usually its lovely little
connytite bonobo sweetie.
Yes, friends.
You know, when...
The balloon goes up, and the war is engaged, you have to win.
And what worries me, really worries me, is that that is exactly the position in which
we have been placed.
And, uh...
We'll have to deal with blame later, I'm afraid.
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
This background music is, um...
The rarely heard...
It's a treasured LP.
The soundtrack of Lucifer Rising, the Kenneth Anger underground movie.
The soundtrack is by a bunch of guys in prison who did it for the movie, including Charlie
Manson's boy, Bobby Busalil, who is now dead.
Yes, friends.
You know...
In the end...
In the end...
In the end...
In the end...



Osama Bin Laden, the Mullahs, George Bush, the Afghanistan fighters and the American
fighters, you and me, we'll all end up the same way.
There's no winner.
They, as Bob said, they always end up on their heads.
One and all, from the greatest to the smallest, my friends.
We all end up the same.
Same place.
I hope not to see you there any time soon.
Praise Bob and hail Connie.
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

Oh...
And the graven image, Catholic.
Yeah
With his plastic crucifix
You get it
I hate
Confusing me
As to who and where and why
As to how he gets his kicks
He gets his kicks
Confessing to the endless end
With endless whining sounds
Every pain till next Thursday
For the gods that you can count on
I am

autopsy on John Wayne, they found 40 pounds of meat in his intestine.
People in their rapine and panic use their body as a specimen for primor of fear.
The electrician.
An impressive statistic is true.
And I also heard that now the world's first chewable green tea tablets are available
by national natural subscription.
These herbal blurbs are available in bicentennial blossoms and buds,
along with macro earthworms, each in its own earthenware urns.
And for a special time, only the Real Ease Support TM provides total relaxation
for your neck, shoulders, and bust line.
With this handy device, you can know the indoor temperature and humidity at a glance,
and safely, quickly, and easily, you can trim unwanted hair.
Avoid eyebrows like Sir Donald Wolfe or Thufir Hawat,
and trim yourself into a trim setup,
where everything is...
ship-shaped and squared away.
A1 at Lloyd's.
A-OK.
All systems go.
Yes, now you're cooking with gas.
And you're comfortable.
Listening to the show.
Don't cry, little callers.
We're here for you.
Because we...
That would be a real...
We deeply care...
about you, the listener.
I say that you don't say that.
And we feel for you...
in the hour of your distress.
Now, and at the hour of your death.
Amen.
Dammit.
Perhaps life can be projected at the end of time on a giant movie screen in God's throne room,
like Johnny Carson's favorite moments from the Tonight Show.
Johnny Carson's yet again.
Yes, you'd laugh hysterically as you saw Johnny's old routines.
All that mayhem.
All that meat.
That was John Wayne.
The impacted colon of John Wayne.
And remember the final episode of that Carson show where we all shed a tear as Bette Midler serenaded the host with the most...
And then you take the Ras Crispy thing and you throw it against the wall.
Ras Crispy.
You do it that way.
Snap, crackle, and pop.
I agree.
Ras Crispy's are great in the crushed mode.
Flattened like those guppos that landed near Roswell at high speed.
But the form of the being was so crisped and rice-like that it was impossible to determine the exact...
The little biobots were alive enough for American soldiers to run up and hit one in the head with the butt of his M1.
Some claimed it was a wireless radio-controlled device built somewhere along the lines of an Abrams M1 tank, America's super tank.
I just broke my show.
In alien form, it sprang to life.
Where's my audience?
If it weren't for the KPFA puzzling evidence show with puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, and sometimes Dr. Philo Drummond.
If it weren't for such as they and Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio and WCSB Cleveland, why this show would...
And the stuff sent in by all the wonderful subgeniuses.
Well, I guess this would be a pretty boring show.
You know.
I don't have much time.
Get out of my way, Stan.
Multiione,äischen На.
Finish!
cultures and
Right.
No, I think it's under the code
is adultery with an adult tree
fornicating,
arboreal fornication or something.
Have you ever done that?
You know, I do feel kind of weird
talking about copulating with trees
when there's a war on
and we feel like we should be
more supportive of our troops
or something.
Yeah.
What's going on?
Well, if you...
That's the thing.
They don't go into very much detail
on the news and the radio.
Are there soldiers on the ground
who know that?
Is there a real war happening?
There are,
and there's the weirdest little stories.
Like, for instance...
Right, and then they're releasing...
Then the above ground media
is releasing all these little trickles
of things like somehow
we might be losing or something.
Well...
What's he talking about?
No, no, it just might take a long time.
That's the...
Well, that's what they say.
Obviously, anything you hear,
you have to keep in mind
is spun some way or another.
Right.
Now, here's one.
I couldn't quite figure out what...
If this was...
This one was just weird enough
to be real.
This fellow in Pakistan
decided he wanted to...
He'd heard that there was
this jihad going on,
and of course,
he wanted to join it.
So he drove down to Afghanistan
and to Kabul or whatever,
and they said,
well, drive back up to the front
and tell them you're a soldier.
So he drove back up to the front,
and they said...
The Taliban sold off the military,
said, okay, well, here's your post.
Go to Afghanistan.


Go to that post
and get ready to fight.
So this guy drives over to the post,
and he runs out of cigarettes.
So he decides to drive into town
and get some cigarettes,
and he's from Pakistan.
He doesn't know his way
around northern Afghanistan.
He drives into the nearest town,
which happens to be controlled
by Northern Alliance forces
and Newsweek reporters,
where he is promptly captured
and then interviewed at length
about how he wandered in there
to get cigarettes.
He didn't really know
what it was all about.
He just knew
that there was a jihad going on,
and he didn't have anything better to do.
And now he's...
But, again, you have to remember,
every little story is turned around,
and, you know,
who did what little release
of what strange...
Remember what happened to Mardahari.
Loose tits ripped ships,
and you can't be too careful,
and you never know
who that fellow
you're giving state secrets to
might be.
That's right.
So, um...
So shut up!
I would suggest that anybody
on any public conveyance
just stop babbling
top secret stuff
at the top of their lungs.
Keep your head on the bag.
Back to the wind in your sack
and the saddle.
We'll see y'all.
Good.

That was actually the first show
called The Show.
It started around 1983
or two.

to clean our souls
and wash away the bob shite
and the stink of the war,
let's listen to this bathing collage
by St. Allian
or Stalio
or I don't even know.
It was another posted thing.
A bathing collage

But there's one other thing that makes tubby time
the very best time of the whole day.
And do you know what that is?

Hey guys.
I'll see you next time.
I taste just like candy.
Every day when I make my way to the tubby.
I want candy.
Every day when I make my way to the tubby.
Candy girl.
I'm awfully fond of you.
I taste just like candy.
Every day when I make my way to the tubby.
I like chocolate.

Splish splash, I forgot about the bell.
Ooh, you think that sounds spooky?
Just wait.
In a moment, you'll be hearing the creepy, haunting, fun sounds of Halloween.
But first, let me introduce myself.
My name is Count Chocula, and I love anything spooky.
Like Frankenberry, Booberry, and Count Chocula cereals.
Now, grab a spoon, pour yourself a bowl, sit back, and try not to be too afraid.
Because the spooky sounds of Halloween are about to begin.
