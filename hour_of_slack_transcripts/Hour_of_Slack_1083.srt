1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,320
10, 9, 7, 6, 8, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1, fire!

2
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,420
The Self-Genius Power of Splat!

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,760
The Tri-Anisaurus was very bad.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,620
This is a sub-genius Tri-Anisaurus?

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,960
Look here.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,700
The Brontosaurus is a good dinosaur.

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,140
Boy, just listen to these kids.

8
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,280
They know more about dinosaurs than the experts do.

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,680
I'll give it to him.

10
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,260
That's it.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,620
Enricosaurus is the friend of all good children.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,560
The Terranosaurus Rex was bad.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,420
Because it ate meat.

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,440
So?

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Not like nice Triceratops.

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,720
Yeah, that didn't eat meat.

17
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,280
Munching him in the grass.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,220
They didn't have grass.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,980
No, no grass.

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,280
No, there was no grass as you think of it in the Mesozoic.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:29,120
Although certain recent discoveries in paleobotany seem to indicate that some proto-grass

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,980
didn't eat meat.

23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,680
They in fact exist in the Terranian and the later ages of the Cretaceous.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,700
But for the most part there was no grass at all.

27
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,560
No ground cover like that.

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:48,580
Just flash floods, arroyos, gullies, and rapidly growing moss and fungus of gigantic and unusual

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,180
types.

30
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,000
Arlene, wake up.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,940
But what about all the dino dung?

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,060
Didn't it grow in the...

33
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,980
It festered and separated in the blazing Mesozoic sun with clouds of swarming boulders.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,820
And it was a tropical paradise.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,740
It must be horrible like a tropical wild.

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
No, no, no, no.

37
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,660
Nay, my son.

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,140
It was a tropical paradise.

39
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,240
Oh.

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,360
Horrible.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,580
It sounds like malaria.

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
This is a...

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,340
Careful in this part of the room.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,500
I don't want to be bit by a mosquito and get malaria.

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,780
Well, I'm overwhelmed.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,880
This is for...

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,900
Loyalties for the incredibly popular video.

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,240
Oh.

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,740
Rise, the subgenius video.

50
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,660
Ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,780
Wow.

52
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,240
And a royal loyalty it is.

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,360
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a subgenius contractual operation that is a payment for

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,860
services rendered being enacted right here on our stage tonight.

55
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,040
Had not been a TV show, it's about time.

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,180
Hal Robbins is being paid a check of some several, as I understand, thousands of dollars.

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,720
About two astronauts who break the time barrier and go back to the stony...

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:02:59,940
As the...

59
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,040
Triceratops.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,440
But, Hal, I mean, you know what...

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:03,940
It's about time.

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,000
It's about space.

63
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,820
It's about...

64
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,540
It's about two guys in the strangest place.

65
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,700
When they see what is in sight, is it good luck or is it good night?

66
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,120
I noticed quite a few Triceratopian...

67
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,140
As through the very end of time they flew.

68
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,100
I mean, there's some...

69
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,580
There's one horn and there's two horns and there's three horns.

70
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,320
Oh, you noticed in the...

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,260
In the...

72
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,720
Revelation.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,200
Yes.

74
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,260
Yes, that's the...

75
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,300
It's actually the...

76
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,500
The...

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,340
The armored knight.

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,620
The ten-headed Triceratops.

79
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,160
It has...

80
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,100
It has...

81
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,400
It has ten Triceratops heads.

82
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,860
Yeah.

83
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,920
And each head has three horns.

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,540
These heads represent the heads of the United Nations.

85
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, yeah.

86
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,220
Also...

87
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,740
The heads of...

88
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,840
You'll notice that...

89
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
The subgenius popes.

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,520
You'll notice that there's always this babe who looks kind of like what you might call

91
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
the whore of Babylon or something.

92
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,420
Hey.

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,340
Riding that Triceratops.

94
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,380
That is Princess We Are You.

95
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,660
Wow.

96
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,060
Princess We Are You.

97
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,160
Queen of all the UFOs.

98
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,300
Who's in the room next to you.

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,600
I'd love...

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,840
And in her hand, she bears a cup containing all kinds of delicious flavors and solvents.

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
Princess We Are You rides wild dinosaurs.

102
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,700
Is that what you're saying?

103
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:11,980
No.

104
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,120
It's not a dinosaur.

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,000
It's the nameless blob-like beast of accreditation.

106
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,620
Yeah.

107
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,940
When X-Day comes, that vision will unfold.

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,380
Will come to...

109
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,780
And may it come soon.

110
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,140
She will run down...

111
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,600
No kidding.

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
Jump on and...

113
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,540
Lay down on top of, essentially, dominate Triceratops.

114
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,880
Well, dinosaur-like creatures are going to come back.

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,240
If you must.

116
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,280
I suppose so.

117
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Michael, the pictures in this book are just artist's conceptions.

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,220
They are approximations.

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,260
Illustrate points of doctrine and predictions of Bob.

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,820
They're just there for visual impact.

121
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,180
Yeah, and we're limited by how much...

122
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,900
And whatever information.

123
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,680
You derive from that.

124
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,280
Yeah.

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,480
Would just be incidental to any other aspect of it.

126
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,120
Yeah.

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,140
Well, I don't view dinosaurs as sex objects like I used to.

128
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,260
You don't?

129
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,680
I totally don't.

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,380
No, I...

131
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,980
You don't think of them as...

132
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,320
Like...

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,540
Into a special school...

134
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Like a sex object you could just have your way with...

135
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,460
You don't think they're the cuddliest little thing?

136
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
Their emotional well-being and the distress you may put them into.

137
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,000
My parents put me into a special program when I was a teenager.

138
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,480
You're a topless.

139
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,320
I don't think they're the cuddliest little thing.

140
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,840
I don't think they're the cuddliest little thing, either.

141
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:32,840


142
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:32,840


143
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:32,840


144
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,100
When you heard the word triceratops, you thought you might try one, right?

145
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,780
I don't think anything.

146
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,600
Tricera, she's tops.

147
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,500
Doesn't have any...

148
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,820
You can measure my blood pressure.

149
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:48,660
All right, let's calm down and act like rational adults and not be all sexually supercharged

150
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,560
by the thoughts of gigantic dinosaurs that roamed the earth millions of years ago.

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
Any rationality of any kind.

152
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,840
Hey, Rastakal!

153
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm not a human, Rastakal.

154
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,860
I'm a human, Rastakal.

155
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm a human, Rastakal.

156
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:12,820
Though Seismosaurus shook the earth with gentle steps, from day to day she sought the uplands

157
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,500
of her birth, destroying forests on the way.

158
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,020
Fit objects of aesthetic contemplation.

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
But I don't think I can do that.

160
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,920
I can't do it.

161
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,420
It's a hard, cruel world out there.

162
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,800
A hard, unfriendly one.

163
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,600
I am the prime.

164
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,560
I am the prime.

165
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,140
I am the prime.

166
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,000
If you weren't so mean to people, maybe it wouldn't be so hard and unfriendly.

167
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,780
Creatures that sit and wait.

168
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,260
If only you would just be friendly yourself, then you wouldn't always be so encountering

169
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,300
unfriendly people.

170
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,400
And mad.

171
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,460
That's your karma.

172
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,520
Superior to the creatures only in his coming.

173
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,040
You go around with it.

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,120
Down on your face.

175
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,300
That sullen expression.

176
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,880
That gimpering way of...

177
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,500
There are not many men yet.

178
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,020
Pipeless.

179
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,500
Only a few shiftless, run-down hobos.

180
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,700
It's obvious you haven't groomed your tentacles in a long time.

181
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,900
The gelatin, the ooze that you're leaving behind you, that trail is way too thick.

182
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,580
Ooze?

183
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,640
You need to have your glands examined.

184
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,960
I had nothing to do with that.

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,340
Wash your glands every now and then.

186
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,080
I try to bathe them in special salves.

187
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Have you tried any of that antibacterial soap for your glands?

188
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,960
It's a little bit too strong.

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,500
That's a little too rich for my blood.

190
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,420
I like the kind you just spray it on your glands and you rub it in and then the stuff

191
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,840
disappears.

192
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, but my glands are organic too, you know.

193
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,760
They could be sensitive to that stuff.

194
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,700
That's strong.

195
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,000
Hey, I saw something called caffeinated soap today in a trendy shop in Berkeley.

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Oh yeah, shampoo.

197
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:58,720
Right.

198
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,240
No, it was soap.

199
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,500
Caffeine, eh?

200
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,380
It was hand soap.

201
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,720
It said caffeinated, as in caffeine added soap.

202
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,940
Hey, I saw some beer the other day that was like $200 a pint.

203
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,680
Was it lambic?

204
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,900
No, it wasn't lambic.

205
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,420
It was something that was like 20% alcohol or something.

206
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,620
Lambic beer?

207
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:18,780
Fembant?

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,540
Perhaps it was lambic 20, oh.

209
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,260
What does beer have to do with the word of Bob?

210
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,580
Oh, well, actually I guess it has quite a bit to do with the word of Bob.

211
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,320
Didn't Benjamin have a beer?

212
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


213
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


214
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


215
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


216
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


217
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


218
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:29,320


219
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,000
I think Benjamin Franklin said that beer was proof that God loves us.

220
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,720
Yes.

221
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,220
Beer?

222
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,340
All done.

223
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,220
Fear is proof that God hates us.

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,020
Well, there is that, the alternate opposing corollary.

225
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,240
Fear is proof that beer combats fear, as I'm doing right now.

226
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,560
Well, God works it both ways.

227
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,060
He can be good cop and bad cop at the same time.

228
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,980
He works it from both sides of the table.

229
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,380
That's right.

230
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,160
God is for people who can't believe in science.

231
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,860
It's just a bait and switch, you know what I'm saying?

232
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,260
I'm not sure.

233
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:58,820
I don't think it's a good thing.

234
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:58,820


235
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:58,880
I don't think it's a good thing.

236
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


237
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:58,880


238
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,420
It's an age-old trick.

239
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,720
It's always worked.

240
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,460
I prefer to believe that there's a giant teapot with a brain at the center of the universe

241
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,840
myself.

242
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,440
I think you're right.

243
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
The Garden of Eden.

244
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,820
Under a hundred turtles or something.

245
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,180
The Garden of Eden?

246
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,580
Well, one supernatural idiocy is just as good as the next, isn't it?

247
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Well, exactly.

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,620
No.

249
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,160
Not yet.

250
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,180
The word of Bob is superior to all other supernatural idiocies.

251
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,780
Well, apart from that, as a special case.

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,860
I don't see the word of Bob as superior to all other supernatural idiocies.

253
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,860


254
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,860


255
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,860


256
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,860


257
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,860


258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,020
I see it as a divine thing.

259
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,160
It's a special divine idiocy.

260
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,940
Well, yeah.

261
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,060
It's only for those who are stupid and idiotic.

262
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,800
An anti-divine idiocy.

263
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,940
I know that Bob does make new dogma through the process using idiocy as one of his tools.

264
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,260
Well, you have to have enough idiocy to balance off the idiomics.

265
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:48,560
That doesn't mean that it's idiotic.

266
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,940
Oh, this is getting a little bit tough.

267
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,440
Heavy.

268
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,200
No.

269
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,140
Theologically obtuse.

270
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,840
No, you've got to have enough stupidity there to balance off all the idiocies.

271
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


272
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


273
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


274
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


275
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


276
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


277
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


278
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


279
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


280
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


281
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:58,840


282
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,540
You've got to.

283
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,960
You've just got to.

284
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,800
You've just got to have it there.

285
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,300
I don't think that's anything we have to really worry about.

286
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,680
That's right.

287
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,180
Exactly.

288
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,260
Got him down.

289
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,820
I'm going to split the small stuff.

290
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,420
I just got a note from management.

291
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,600
There's not been enough catalog reading going on on this show.

292
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,360
Oh, God.

293
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
That's what I say.

294
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,980
Oh, God.

295
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,840
I hate the catalog reading.

296
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,560
Let me ask you.

297
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,060
As a long-time listener to the show, I find the catalog reading offensive.

298
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,900
Would you prefer reading the budget, then?

299
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,820
In the catalog, yeah.

300
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,820


301
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,820


302
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,820


303
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,820


304
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,820


305
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:28,820


306
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,920
No, don't read the budget.

307
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,300
Would you prefer us just getting right into the budget?

308
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:33,720
No, no.

309
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,700
Let's not waste time by reading catalogs.

310
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,500
We'll do that in a closed session, boys.

311
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,960
How about just the sales figures and what's sold?

312
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,540
We don't have to know about the things nobody wants.

313
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,740
Let's hear what's popular.

314
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,220
Well, that's kind of classified information and not necessarily for public dispersal.

315
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,800
We can't bore our good friends out there in radio land with every little thing.

316
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:58,800


317
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:05,540
Well, as a business, it does not sound very transparent to me.

318
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,160
Whoever said it was?

319
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,740
After all, we've got to realize the nitty and the gritty, the nuts and bolts of it is

320
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,660
most people aren't interested in that kind of business bourgeois.

321
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,440
They want to leave it to the experts.

322
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
They want to know who Bob's been dating.

323
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,800
They want to know who his daughter is.

324
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,700
Yes, they want to know the latest celebrity gossip from the poop sheet, but they're not

325
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,340
interested in the bottom line.

326
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:28,800
Distraction.

327
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:35,620
This is an opaque business and it has nothing to do with oil.

328
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,560
And Bob's daughter is in rehab.

329
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,120
Snake oil, yes.

330
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,940
Snake oil, yeah, a little snake oil.

331
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,160
Different kind of oil.

332
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,300
JPEG dogs.

333
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Let me show you this elixir, this magic elixir.

334
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,440
JPEG, sissy dogs.

335
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,060
Take a whiff of that, too.

336
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,760
Did Bob start out as a snake oil salesman?

337
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,400
That's what I heard.

338
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, he sold a lot of things.

339
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,620
He did not exclusively sell oleums or penicillin.

340
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:58,700
I heard that.

341
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:58,740
I heard that.

342
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,480
He had to travel all over the Midwest.

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,620
He was selling…

344
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,900
If you've ever cooked popcorn in snake oil, you know what jiffy taste is all about.

345
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,580
Just about the time Johnny Appleseed was crossing the country, there was Bob.

346
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,860
That's a little bit earlier.

347
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,580
Snake oil, popcorn, peanut butter oil.

348
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,020
Dropping little bottles of snake oil everywhere he went.

349
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,440
You mean Bob came out of the Injun territory?

350
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,680
Now we have to get that all over our shoes everywhere we go.

351
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,160
Gesundheit.

352
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,360
We're in trouble with PETA on that whole snake issue anyway.

353
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,040
anyway, you know.

354
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,380
Pita?

355
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,900
Yeah, people eating tasty animals.

356
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,540
Oh, right.

357
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,020
I never heard that one.

358
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,960
The United Snakes.

359
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,220
Yes, we remember them.

360
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,560
I just got it.

361
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,180
Oh, I got that wrong.

362
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,560
It was people eating tentacled animals.

363
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,700
You people are all crazy.

364
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,260
These people are all crazy.

365
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,980
Squid fans.

366
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,660
Crazy is a relative term.

367
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
My relatives mostly are.

368
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
I see, that's the point.

369
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,440
They're not crazy, they're just stupid.

370
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,420
How many people do I have to kill to prove I'm crazy?

371
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,860
Maybe they're in different...

372
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,300
Who?

373
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,300
Oh, howdy, Sister Samson.

374
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,640
Hey.

375
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,540
You're going to trouble me.

376
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,080
Well, I reckon so.

377
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,700
We're awful busy right now.

378
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,400
That's going to call it.

379
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,940
Well, I'm not sure I understand.

380
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,060
You say you saw some sort of monster?

381
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,840
Did you see that with your mind?

382
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,780
Did you use your eye only?

383
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,060
Did you use your other eye?

384
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,720
He's just kind of shambling.

385
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,900
In the back, it was...

386
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,160
It was the dark.

387
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,320
Now, I'm sure you think you saw what you say.

388
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,580
The sun is just going down.

389
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,760
You think you saw a pipe.

390
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,320
Wow.

391
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,020
There.

392
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,920
This is the 21st century.

393
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,300
There's no more monsters.

394
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,120
This is the 21st century.

395
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,060
You saw what you told us you thought you saw.

396
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,660
We put a man on the moon.

397
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,340
Monsters just don't cut it anymore.

398
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,720
I would say near the 15th century.

399
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,000
Maybe you were better.

400
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,420
Tall.

401
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,040
Dinosaurs could live on the moon if we built them huge spacesuits.

402
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,600
Or just hollow out a nice play.

403
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,520
I took this picture of gravity on the moon.

404
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,340
Constant state of changing into a werewolf if we put him on the moon.

405
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,560
I took this picture of...

406
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,600
The lycanthrope perhaps could be himself.

407
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,880
Probably not on the moon.

408
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,580
Look, if you could put together the business plan for the spacesuits,

409
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,420
I think we can sell the concept of putting a dinosaur in them.

410
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,860
Yeah, that was Bob.

411
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,920
I can't.

412
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,380
No.

413
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,260
Werewolf girlfriends.

414
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,440
Well, Noah had them on the ark.

415
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,380
He would go into orbit.

416
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,560
He would stay and they would percate her.

417
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,500
The line between where the moon and...

418
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,960
He had two diplodics.

419
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,720
So she was two brontosaurus.

420
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,000
She was half wolf and half girl.

421
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:40,540
How?

422
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,140
And he thought off on her sliding back and forth.

423
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,540
That was a...

424
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,100
Oh, I...

425
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,400
Gentlemen, please.

426
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,520
Those unclean beasts.

427
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,200
Those clean beasts.

428
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,620
He actually had seven.

429
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,060
Seven?

430
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,000
I wouldn't hurt that.

431
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,340
Seven pairs of them.

432
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,840
Did you know that?

433
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,240
If you read that other part, he actually had more than just two of each.

434
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,400
This is like a sandbox with a bunch of little kids just talking to themselves.

435
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,480
More like a bunch of little kittens burying turds.

436
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,960
Boy, who would win in a fight?

437
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,320
Popeye or Superman?

438
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,360
We can't get out of the sandbox even if we have a theater.

439
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,960
Jose Carver book.

440
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,280
Or Doc Savage meets Tarzan.

441
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,640
That's a great book.

442
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,760
A Feast Unknown.

443
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,160
That's a great book.

444
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes, this is the commissioner.

445
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,380
What?

446
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,600
What will Farmer do next?

447
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:46,600
Philip Jose Farmer's A Feast Unknown actually has some secrets of how the world is run buried in it

448
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,920
in the guise of a weird porno pulp takeoff.

449
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,160
That's right.

450
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,660
Okay, sorry.

451
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,200
I like that.

452
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,260
Monster movies and apparently cheap science fiction books.

453
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:05,300
There's actually profound wisdom hidden in the pages, which was only to be hinted at in those days.

454
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,440
But in our own time, it's now understood in general.

455
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,320
Yeah, it's old hat now.

456
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,660
Kids grow up knowing about the ten elder bankers of the universe.

457
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:15,940
Hi, Luke.

458
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,060
You have to know about that.

459
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,680
And knowing that they are never going to get to be one unless they can rip off Tarzan.

460
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,420
Or Doc Savage's genitals.

461
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,680
How did you get here?

462
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,080
Which is, climaxes the book, so to speak.

463
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,760
Yes, that happens in the book.

464
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,500
They both rip each other's genitals off.

465
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,260
Think of that, friends.

466
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,600
Tarzan and Doc Savage.

467
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,700
Starring the fabulous Ron Ely in a dual role.

468
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,220
And then they sew each other's genitals onto each other's.

469
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,640
And submariners.

470
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,140
Well, no.

471
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,360
You know, I don't know if we want to give away the secrets of this book.

472
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,460
Which is quite an interesting novel.

473
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:53,680


474
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,660
Well, the greatest of them all was Doc Strange.

475
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,340
That was the greatest.

476
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,400
Doctor Strange?

477
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,100
Strange.

478
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,180
Of Ditko.

479
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,720
That's not a novel.

480
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,880
Or Gene Coleman.

481
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,460
Oh, yeah, you guys.

482
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,200
Doctor Strange.

483
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,720
Highbrow.

484
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,380
Wasn't he going after some Lovecraft kind of?

485
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,800
No, he's on so many different dimensions.

486
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,520
And strings.

487
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,460
And interstitial vortices.

488
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,020
That, you know, you make your heads spin.

489
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,740
Mortices.

490
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,620
You know what?

491
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:32,480
What we're learning here is that Michael Pepe was unable to read complex material like Tarzan and Doc Savage novels.

492
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,380
He thought that comedy books were novels.

493
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,380
People say, hey, have you read a new novel lately?

494
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,800
And he'd say, yeah, I read Spider-Man the other day.

495
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,980
The new issue.

496
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,000
He would have been hired.

497
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,860
It's like a narrative.

498
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,580
It's a special one-year annual where it's like a narrative and the panels are full.

499
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,700
It's a graphic novel.

500
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,020
They're not comic books.

501
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,660
They're graphic novels.

502
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,220
They're graphic novels.

503
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,360
They're graphic novels.

504
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,500
It's a new art form.

505
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,340
I got you, dude.

506
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,120
Enough said.

507
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,680
There's only one panel per page.

508
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,040
I got you, man.

509
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,140
Are you crazy?

510
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,700
Well, you start with the splash panel.

511
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:05,980
I'm crazy, though.

512
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,460
No!

513
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,960
The splash panel doesn't have to have any actual place in the continuity of the story,

514
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,300
but what is displayed in it symbolizes the story.

515
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,380
Almost immediately, you get the first couple of panels of the story further on down the page.

516
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Who are you?

517
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,720
Who are you?

518
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,640
Doctor Howland just taught you kids how to start your career as comic book artists.

519
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,240
And the person on the left always talks first.

520
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,140
But I mean, kids, do they listen to this show?

521
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,940
And as Karl Barks liked to arrange, always make sure that some kind of crisis happens

522
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,820
in the lower right panel at the lower right-hand corner of the page.

523
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,460
So they suddenly reach a point of excitement, forcing you to turn the page at that point.

524
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,380
That's how true.

525
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,740
That's how true.

526
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:52,740


527
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:52,740


528
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:52,740


529
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,500
And the television shows are written now.

530
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,460
Build up to that.

531
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,160
For the commercial.

532
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,980
But the best one of them all was always the X-Men issue 12 of Magneto.

533
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,340
Great.

534
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,760
Beauty.

535
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:10,060
When he finally, after the whole 24-3 pages, you don't know who is the evil presence that

536
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,680
is destroying the X-Men one by one.

537
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,520
And then finally, the final page.

538
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,800
It was the first full panel page of all time.

539
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,580
Really?

540
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
As far as I know, from Marvel Comics, X-Men.

541
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,640
We'll just sit over here.

542
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,000
X-Men 12.

543
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,340
And you turn it.

544
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,900
And all it is, is this huge picture of Magneto.

545
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,480
And he's holding out his hand and he's saying, I am power.

546
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,860
Wow.

547
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Men call me Magneto.

548
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,920
For am I not Magneto?

549
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,540
Thanks, guys.

550
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,680
I'm with Magneto.

551
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,380
I was so scared.

552
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:47,860
I was so scared.

553
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,700
I was like...

554
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,760
Obviously, the subgeniuses would be with...

555
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,520
Magneto.

556
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,460
What about that guy that's fantastic?

557
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,240
In the...

558
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,020
You know, if the X-Men were real, the subgeniuses would be...

559
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,900
Who had the watchers?

560
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,620
Magneto.

561
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,740
He like wipes them out one by one invisibly.

562
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,040
Silver Surfer was his vanguard.

563
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,060
Remember that guy?

564
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,780
That bad guy?

565
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,500
Vanguard?

566
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,720
That was Galactus.

567
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,460
Galactus?

568
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:08,960
Oh, yes.

569
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,820
Galactus.

570
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,040
Yeah.

571
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,360
That was like, what?

572
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,900
80 feet tall or 100 feet tall?

573
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,560
Oh, he was as tall as a solar system.

574
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,260
He was huge.

575
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,060
He was enormous.

576
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,360
Yes, he was.

577
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,400
He traversed the solar system.

578
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:21,840
This is...

579
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,640
The only guy greater...

580
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,780
He wanted to devour the Earth, remember?

581
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,920
That was his goal.

582
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
And Fantastic Four was fighting against him.

583
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,820
Just to use up...

584
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,080
He had to eat it for it to get energy for all his machine existence.

585
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,000
They had to get Dr. Doom on their side to get it to exist.

586
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,240
Did they?

587
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:36,680
Yeah.

588
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah.

589
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,640
Oh, that's 44.

590
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,160
Well, that's like when they have to get Godzilla to help save the world.

591
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,760
You know, Godzilla is normally a monster.

592
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh, yeah.

593
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,920
When somebody from outer space comes...

594
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,520
That's a...

595
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
So like our...

596
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,720
She can take a scare at her home.

597
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,240
She's like her worst enemy.

598
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,900
So when they team up to get music, that's why.

599
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,200
It's been like Russia and America back before Reagan pulled down the wall.

600
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,180
And they were beating up China.

601
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,860
To be what?

602
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,460
Wait.

603
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,040
Beat up China.

604
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,380
Oh.

605
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,280
Right.

606
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,240
Oh, I see.

607
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,720
This is like the craziest show I've ever heard in my life.

608
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,140
What the hell kind of a show is this?

609
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,000
Godzilla versus...

610
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,720
The Wonderful Weekend.

611
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:20,920
No.

612
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,180
No.

613
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,280
No.

614
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,760
No.

615
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:21,780
No.

616
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:21,800


617
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,820


618
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,820


619
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,820


620
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,820


621
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,820


622
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:21,820


623
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,380
No.

624
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,380


625
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,840
Or do you side with King Kong?

626
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,040
That's as important as Archie versus Reggie.

627
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,660
I sided...

628
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,900
Even though I love Godzilla, I sided with King Kong because I was a patriotic American.

629
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,320
And I suppose you've heard the story that there were two endings made of the movie.

630
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,980
The American one King Kong won and the Japanese one Godzilla won.

631
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,280
I helped spread that false story myself unknowingly.

632
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,260
I did too.

633
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,340
I'm sorry, dude.

634
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm sorry.

635
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,040


636
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,440
I'm sorry.

637
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,520
I'm sorry.

638
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:51,620


639
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:51,820
I'm sorry.

640
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,820


641
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,820


642
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,820


643
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,820


644
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:51,820


645
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,500
That wasn't true.

646
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,540
But it should have been.

647
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,200
It was true in our hearts.

648
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,980
It was a nerd and myth.

649
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,080
I think, in far popular opinion,

650
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
probably switched over from Kong King Kong to Godzilla

651
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
at, what would you say, 75?

652
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,560
I wouldn't acknowledge that at all.

653
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,240
If you think people still favor...

654
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,920
I didn't see King Kong.

655
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,840
I suppose you do favor King Kong.

656
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,340
A red-blooded American is always going to side with King Kong.

657
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,320
Damn straight.

658
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,000
Especially if he's romantic and cute like the movie, I understand.

659
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:30,080
The new King Kong turns me on so much in a sexual way.

660
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,920
And Naomi Watt isn't bad either.

661
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,340
I've seen it six times now.

662
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,300
And I'm shooting for 99.

663
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,600
It's pretty great.

664
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,980
I want to be known as the man who saw King Kong 99 times.

665
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:47,000
But have you seen the new material that's in that new disc that's out?

666
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,080
As soon as I...

667
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,820
I set foot back home in Cleveland Heights.

668
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,560
I'm going to go buy that.

669
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,100
Wow.

670
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,340
Because there's more stuff.

671
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,940
There's attacks in the swamp.

672
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,780
You know, things coming out of the water.

673
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,820
My son said there are more dinosaurs, new dinosaurs.

674
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,760
A lot of...

675
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,940
I guess a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff, too.

676
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,300
Oh, I can't wait.

677
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,520
No.

678
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,120
All right.

679
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,720
I love King Kong so much, I'd let him use me as a rubber.

680
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,300
That's what I say about the new King Kong.

681
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,260
Oh, my God.

682
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,560
And I think that he should have gotten Best Actor.

683
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,200
That's extreme.

684
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,460
He should get Best Actor in the Academy Awards.

685
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,020
God.

686
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,340
Well, they ought to, really.

687
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,700
But they need a special new category.

688
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,080
Would you felch Kong?

689
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,360
Hey, I'm not some kind of pervert.

690
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,900
Oh, I see.

691
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,120
This year in Georgia.

692
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,320
Would that satisfy you in some dimension?

693
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,980
It would make you happy.

694
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
I mean, do you...

695
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,520
It would be an act of bestiality, man.

696
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,220
Would you allow Kong to insert his...

697
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,960
Dong?

698
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,080
Kong.

699
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,100
The fact is...

700
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,320
It's not illegal.

701
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,660
Dong!

702
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,560
You can say...

703
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,860
You can say...

704
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,300
That's not one of those words that's proscribed.

705
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,880
It is an indelicacy, I acknowledge.

706
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,880
A solecism.

707
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,520
That's an indelicacy.

708
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
But one's uttered, it cannot be revoked.

709
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,260
Or taken back.

710
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
So, would you accept Kong?

711
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,120
No.

712
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,640
Well, how...

713
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:13,820
Good.

714
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
I wouldn't either.

715
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,600
However...

716
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,340
However...

717
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,780
It's not necessarily...

718
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,660
Incompatible with a human.

719
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,800
Um...

720
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,440
Well, pongoid sex just doesn't really do it...

721
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,500
You know, pongoid video doesn't do it for me.

722
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,700
You're done for me, man.

723
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,020
You know, you're proud like the lion that represents your son.

724
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,100
Did AIDS come from monkeys?

725
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,820
That's the question.

726
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,120
Monkeys.

727
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,220
You're affectionate.

728
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,140
They're so cute.

729
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:38,720
I know.

730
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,400
Chimpanzees.

731
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,580
They're not monkeys.

732
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,800
They are apes.

733
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,300
Restorative in the royal manner.

734
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to insult their whole, like...

735
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,980
You insult yourself.

736
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,920
Monkeys.

737
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,300
You insult the entire human race.

738
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,160
Monkeys are to apes what humans are to subgeniuses.

739
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,840
Self-reliance.

740
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
We are apes.

741
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,360
Monkeys are not of our stock.

742
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,700
They are a different clay.

743
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,500
They're not even primates.

744
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:03,860
Yes.

745
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,460
Such as tourists.

746
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:04,860
Wait a minute.

747
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,240
But you're saying that the chimps had AIDS and that the monkeys did not.

748
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,740
Tourism has grown to a billion-dollar industry in Michigan.

749
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,280
Well, have the chimps got the gift, as they used to call it?

750
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,740
They've got the gaffe.

751
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,960
The bonobo.

752
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,420
The 70s.

753
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,900
The bonobo chimps do.

754
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,880
Oh.

755
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,660
The pantroglogites do not.

756
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,280
You wouldn't think they could get any, actually.

757
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:24,880
The bonobo.

758
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,480
Those are the...

759
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:25,900
They do.

760
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,640
They are the most sexual primates of all.

761
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,420
The bonobos.

762
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,140
Yeah, bonobo chimpanzees.

763
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,060
They're...

764
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,980
They've got those little hooked noses.

765
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,880
Their little ape society is built on cunnilingus and fellatio.

766
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,280
They're vastly ahead of humans.

767
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,660
Instead of pain and agony and...

768
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,080
They're evolutionarily...

769
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,800
Farther advanced.

770
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,540
Yes.

771
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,200
However, they're really endangered.

772
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,560
There are very few of them left.

773
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,460
You would think they're lovers, not fighters.

774
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,620
The reconstructed pit scene in the re-release of the original...

775
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,300
It's just like these Indian, you know, prominent...

776
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,680
Yeah, that's another hot scene.

777
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,900
What did you say?

778
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,020
It's reconstructed?

779
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,100
In the reissue of the original, there is an add-on.

780
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,420
It's an extract chapter there, but they reconstructed the pit scene.

781
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,140
Oh, oh, pit scene.

782
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,520
Right, right.

783
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,240
I thought you said something else.

784
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,520
Some of it is actually pretty good, but it gets kind of just funny and ludicrous near the end.

785
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,340
But, you know, they weren't Willis O'Brien, of course.

786
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,540
And then there was the spit scene where King Kong spits on his hands and does...

787
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:39,360
Oh, yeah.

788
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Now, on the new version, the guy didn't know when to stop.

789
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,020
They could have told the story in no more than an hour and a half,

790
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,000
just like the original did, but...

791
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,380
Yeah.

792
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,700
They just had to keep prancing around with his prowess there.

793
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,300
Yeah.

794
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,160
Well, that's what an add-on should be, I guess.

795
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,460
But what...

796
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,980
What, the Japanese, didn't they recently do a new, like two years ago, Godzilla?

797
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,780
That was supposed to be the great...

798
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,980
They're always re-enviable.

799
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,060
Oh, yeah.

800
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,120
Just all the time, because...

801
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,100
It had digital and physical effects combined.

802
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,520
Yeah.

803
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,240
They had a Godzilla convention.

804
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,740
They even included the American Godzilla.

805
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,300
Maybe they should re-replicate.

806
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,320
God, that's very charitable of them.

807
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,560
Yeah, that's nice.

808
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:32,480
It's kind of, you know, tails across the water.

809
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,260
Now, when we went to see that new King Kong movie,

810
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,140
Princess We started crying about halfway through.

811
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,500
When they first hurt Kong with the...

812
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,220
Harpoon him in the leg and...

813
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,640
Gassed him.

814
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,720
Princess We started crying and she cried all the way through to the end.

815
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
Well, it is sad.

816
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,920
It's a shock.

817
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,640
Are you serious?

818
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,440
We think they're...

819
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,220
What if we could transfer the new King Kong...

820
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,000
Back to 1933 and show it to audiences back then?

821
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,080
They'd go insane.

822
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,560
You know, there's not too many...

823
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,740
Human...

824
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,000
Human...

825
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,000


826
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,380
Actors that would provoke tears.

827
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,380
Right.

828
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,760
You know what I mean?

829
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,720
I mean, you're saying this guy was able to do that in a big ape costume

830
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,000
on some sort of high-tech...

831
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,560
Well, and also, there's another thing.

832
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,120
You know how it's going to end.

833
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,960
Remember Konga?

834
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,160
Oh, yeah.

835
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,760
Konga was a man in a costume.

836
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,240
Of course.

837
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,800
So was the 1970 King Kong.

838
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,860
And Michael Gao, I think.

839
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,880
Konga was a man in a costume as well.

840
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,680
It was Michael Caine in a Michael Gao costume.

841
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,120
There was at least one dinosaur movie that had guys in Tyrannosaur suits.

842
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,080
Unknown Island.

843
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,300
Tyrannosaur suits.

844
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,360
Hopelessly erect standing.

845
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,460
It was called Unknown Island.

846
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,720
Tiny little arms.

847
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:14,720
I recently saw a Son of Hercules movie that had a man in a dinosaur, upright dinosaur suit.

848
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,400
How'd it look?

849
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,280
Pretty...

850
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,000
Actually, it looked...

851
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,780
It looked pretty good, considering.

852
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,980
You were convinced of it.

853
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Well, I had seen the movie when I was about 10 years old.

854
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,460
And when I saw it again, now that I'm 75,

855
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,620
it looked every bit as good as I remembered it, which was really fake.

856
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,060
Yeah.

857
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:44,740
Well, I saw the big three in the row at Center Street Brockton Theater, Massachusetts.

858
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,080
What was it?

859
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,560
61?

860
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,080
63, your son?

861
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,100
63, the year of Invasion of the Star Creatures.

862
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,360
Oh, I didn't see that.

863
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,620
We didn't get that in Brockton.

864
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't bother.

865
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,680
You didn't have...

866
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,400
Well, you didn't have...

867
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,660
And, you know, the same incredible, imaginary, silly creatures that blah, blah, blah, blah.

868
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,500
The incredibly...

869
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:03,920
What are they?

870
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,580
Strange zombies?

871
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,180
Yeah, strange zombies that...

872
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,880
Stopped living and became crazy, mixed-up zombies.

873
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,540
The incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became mixed-up zombies.

874
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,160
God, that was a genre of movies that vanished.

875
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm on...

876
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,560
I met the guy.

877
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,960
I met the guy that did the cinematography for that.

878
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,800
I'll have you know.

879
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,860
Milo Ziggler.

880
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,300
Milo Ziggler.

881
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,540
Ziggler.

882
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,820
Yes, that's the peculiar thing.

883
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,520
I knew him.

884
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,420
One of the greatest cinematographers of all time.

885
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,760
He took my girlfriend away from me.

886
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,440
Did that...

887
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,700
Milo Ziggler took your girlfriend away?

888
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes.

889
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,340
And did the cinematography for the incredibly strange creatures who stopped living and became

890
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,220
mixed-up zombies.

891
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,100
And the roads, the river, and the close encounters of the third kind for which he won an Oscar.

892
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,260
Oh my God.

893
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,600
Yeah.

894
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,260
And he had money.

895
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,920
He had an office with it like, you know, trophies of all the awards he got and all these movies

896
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,660
back to 1950-something.

897
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,500
Well, Michael, obviously that girl must have been crazy to go off with him and ditch you.

898
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:05,740
I know.

899
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,240
I'll say.

900
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,300
How could she dump you for a guy like that?

901
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,300


902
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:08,980
You would think.

903
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,040
She had to have said.

904
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,300
You would think she was off her rocker.

905
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,640
You know, she was...

906
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,600
I think she was doing drugs at the time.

907
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,080
Oh, no.

908
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
That's what he's claiming.

909
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,440
That's Hollywood, man.

910
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:17,980
Yeah.

911
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,360
This confused glamour for real substance.

912
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,640
That's Hollywood.

913
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,900
That's the whole reason why I'm not a big famous Hollywood director is I wouldn't want

914
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,800
to be part of that.

915
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,340
Why is that?

916
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,980
Yeah, me too.

917
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,020
That's Hollywood.

918
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,880
No, this guy had a mansion in the Hollywood Hills.

919
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,360
Hello?

920
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,700
One in 83 or something.

921
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,300
There's an harbor here.

922
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,600
One in, you know, I don't know how many million dollars.

923
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,580
And this chick left you for them?

924
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,600
God.

925
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,820
You were wrong when you said there was no pool on board.

926
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:46,820


927
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,860
What was she asking?

928
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,300
I thank you there.

929
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,520
She must not have been a subgenius.

930
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,400
You took any more offers there?

931
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,840
No, she wasn't.

932
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:53,840


933
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,580
She was just a scriptwriter that had worked on this film Citizen with George Coates.

934
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,220
You remember it?

935
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,180
And it was William Farley directing it.

936
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,600
Hollywood.

937
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,080
Whatever happened to George Coates?

938
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Whoopi Goldberg.

939
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,200
No, Dan.

940
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,700
George Coates.

941
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,160
I don't know.

942
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,080
What happened to George?

943
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:10,340
Yeah.

944
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,900
He was real big in the 80s.

945
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,360
Yeah, no kidding.

946
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,460
And all of a sudden, nothing.

947
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,580
George Coates.

948
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
No, they gave him a whole cathedral.

949
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,240
Oh, he could do anything he wanted to.

950
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,880
They, for his own ACT and all.

951
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,560
I don't know.

952
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,900
He had, I know he had a child and then that slowed him down.

953
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,300
He's probably listening right now.

954
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,640
Might have committed suicide.

955
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,120
That's the end of everything.

956
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,820
He'd probably kill himself because, no, he did see there, he did be here now.

957
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,640
Hey there, it's Yogi here.

958
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,820
The way of, hey there.

959
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah.

960
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,440
You with the stars in your eyes.

961
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,860
No, the way of how was the first thing.

962
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,100
And then RR.

963
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,660
And the how of why.

964
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,140
Was the second thing.

965
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,560
And then.

966
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:45,720
And then.

967
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:45,880
And then.

968
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,060
And then.

969
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


970
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


971
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


972
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


973
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,060


974
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,680
No, not the second thing, but I heard that one in the movie.

975
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:46,940


976
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:46,940


977
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:46,980
I don't know either.

978
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,000
Is that the second one?

979
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,020
No.

980
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,040
See, see here was the third one.

981
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,400
I missed all those glory fifties science fiction movies.

982
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,240
In eighties.

983
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,500
Yeah.

984
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,860
There was some good ones, weren't there?

985
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,400
No, eighties art, art theater and rock.

986
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,440
You've never seen any more.

987
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,920
Caltycki the Immortal Monk.

988
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,400
Oh, I saw that one.

989
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,360
That was directed by Mario Bava.

990
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,580
I, oh, it was.

991
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,120
Oh my god.

992
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,160
You know, I saw that not long ago

993
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,160
and that was a movie that impressed me a great deal when I was about six or seven

994
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:11,860
years old.

995
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,900
But I couldn't remember why.

996
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:22,880
And when I saw it, I realized that what had really impressed me was there was a girl fight in a, like a gypsy camp at the beginning of it.

997
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,320
And an endangered, slutty-looking blonde near the end.

998
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,100
Strange how art follows life so closely.

999
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,900
And, uh...

1000
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,780
Oh my God! Don't press that!

1001
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,540
I mean, plus it had a monster.

1002
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,440
Suffocating a blob in the bottom of a...

1003
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,560
Don't press the dump button!

1004
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,300
Of a cave.

1005
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,040
A tie.

1006
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,120
As I've watched these movies for the first time,

1007
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,880
there were other aspects that my subconscious mind remembered even better.

1008
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:03,680
Such as the mutant Martian girl in Rocket Ship XM.

1009
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,740
Yes, she's quite memorable, isn't she?

1010
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,020
She looked a lot better than the radio...

1011
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,720
...radiated Martian men...

1012
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,920
...who had lost...

1013
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,960
Martian lost their hair and were covered with burns.

1014
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:25,160
She was merely a blind beauty who looked kind of like Moonbeam McSwine.

1015
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,480
She was kind of an idiot, but nice-looking.

1016
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,020
Moonbeam McSwine.

1017
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:29,040
Yeah.

1018
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,620
World without hands.

1019
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,000
My kind of girl.

1020
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:32,720
What do we got?

1021
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,220
All right, who's Moonbeam McSwine?

1022
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:34,840
A blind...

1023
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,880
Who's Moonbeam McSwine?

1024
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,100
Is this like...

1025
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,340
Is this...

1026
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,100
Are we talking, uh...

1027
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,080
Uh, Casper?

1028
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,100
The friendly ghost character?

1029
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,760
Certainly not.

1030
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,080
Moonbeam McSwine.

1031
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,800
Moonbeam McSwine was a beautiful girl, pardon me, gal, who used to lie in the mud and wallow with the pigs, but...

1032
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,580
Yeah, she smelled...

1033
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:50,900
Oh!

1034
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,860
She was beautiful.

1035
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,760
Daisy Mae.

1036
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,840
But smelled bad.

1037
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,700
She was well...

1038
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,040
She was known to Daisy Mae, or as the poet says,

1039
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,180
Howdy, boys, I'm Moonbeam McSwine.

1040
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,760
Hanging out with the pigs is my line.

1041
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,860
The fellows admire me, yet they don't squire me unless the weather is fine.

1042
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,980
But I does all right when the wind blows...

1043
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,700
The other way.

1044
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,220
What?

1045
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,660
Oh, no!

1046
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,580
Moonbeam McSwine is fifty feet tall!

1047
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,160
Back!

1048
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,700
Back!

1049
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,820
I created you!

1050
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,200
Fifty-back!

1051
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:25,900
Back!

1052
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,220
Smellier!

1053
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:26,880
Oh, no!

1054
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,560
Oh, the smell!

1055
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,680
You should consider yourself very fortunate, Dr. Robinson.

1056
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,380
But she's so sexy!

1057
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,640
Ah, the smell of it.

1058
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,600
Look up that dress!

1059
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,180
What an ass!

1060
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,140
It's so short.

1061
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,900
But she smells like...

1062
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,380
Al Camp.

1063
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,080
Death.

1064
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,060
Really had a run for it.

1065
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,600
She's gone away with the female form.

1066
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,340
Oh!

1067
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,840
You think so, huh?

1068
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,300
Yeah, I think so.

1069
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,020
Oh, I could never open the pages to the rest of the Sunday section.

1070
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,340
Are you aware that those babes were actually being drawn by Frank Frazetta?

1071
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,000
Well, after a certain point.

1072
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:58,960
Really?

1073
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,100
Really?

1074
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,540
Al Cap drew it at first.

1075
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:00,560
What?

1076
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:00,900
He said...

1077
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,960
Yeah, Frank Frazetta was the ghost artist on...

1078
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,360
Drew Gait?

1079
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,140
Daisy Mae?

1080
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,720
With that cleavage?

1081
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,160
Yeah.

1082
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,160
Oh, if you look at him, you can see.

1083
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:10,660
Yeah.

1084
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,660
You can see it.

1085
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,000
For Olivia.

1086
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,880
A major children's wear manufacturer.

1087
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,680
If you look at Daisy Mae really close, you can really see.

1088
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,360
Oh, yeah.

1089
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,340
The information I have just been given is that...

1090
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,520
You know, I like...

1091
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,380
...Pinetown, as of this year, will commence the durable...

1092
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,740
Did you say that Frank Frazetta was the ghost artist of Daycrime?

1093
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,140
Yeah.

1094
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,220
That's right.

1095
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,600
That's cool.

1096
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,060
That's right.

1097
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,180
Yeah, he got his...

1098
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,960
The women.

1099
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,480
Not everyone who can view the Earth from a distance...

1100
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:38,860
But he...

1101
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,160
Are you saying that...

1102
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,060
...Al Cap had a sort of staff of like slave artists?

1103
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,020
No, just Frank Frazetta.

1104
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:48,440
Oh.

1105
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,260
Because he could do breasts.

1106
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,500
You can put that gun away.

1107
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,040
He sure could.

1108
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,140
He could do Daisy Mae's...

1109
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,440
He could do many wonderful things.

1110
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,320
You know, Daisy Mae...

1111
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,160
I could put that gun away.

1112
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,820
Yeah, and of course, she resulted in the Beverly Hillbillies girl.

1113
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:07,860
Well, during the long run of Little Abner, there were a number of villainesses who all

1114
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,800
had different gimmicky short dresses.

1115
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,940
Like the wolf gal, right?

1116
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,860
Yeah, there was a wolf gal, there was a swamp gal...

1117
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,940
And swamp gal, the front page.

1118
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,480
...who wore only leaves.

1119
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,300
Isn't there some kind of...

1120
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,760
This is to distract your dad on Sunday.

1121
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,600
...breast measurements.

1122
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
Okay, that's fine.

1123
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,280
I'll do it.

1124
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,860
...sense of produce.

1125
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,200
You can model cartoon characters, considering they're on the two-dimensional plane.

1126
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,380
Well, fine, and you and me...

1127
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,440
What system did they use to measure their breasts?

1128
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,220
When you were a 12-year-old in the 50s...

1129
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,720
It's hard to judge the dimension of like flat...

1130
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,200
...a drawing, an Al Cap drawing was...

1131
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,820
...a normal...

1132
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:37,840
...different.

1133
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:37,840


1134
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:37,840


1135
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:37,840


1136
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:37,840


1137
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,600
This is the internet.

1138
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,700
You can for me like I'm on another label.

1139
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:47,360
No one realizes it today because the etiolated doodly-squat cartoons on today's newspaper

1140
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:56,180
pages can't possibly match the drama and involvement of, uh, say, Flash Gordon or...

1141
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,700
Of a visual image.

1142
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,840
...Trish Wilkin, Planeteer...

1143
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:58,440
What everybody's got.

1144
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:58,480
Two of them.

1145
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,540
...or Little Abner.

1146
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,440
Or Little Abner, pardon me.

1147
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:00,980
A visual image which...

1148
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,680
Is it gonna be gasoline alley?

1149
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,320
...was almost the coolest visual image you could get outside of a television which,

1150
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,520
of course, preceded...

1151
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:18,780
Speaking of vision, image, Don Joyce, can you pot up the mic on Princess Wee who is next to Michael E.B.?

1152
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,420
Pot up.

1153
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,740
We don't smoke anything on the air.

1154
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,740
Say what?

1155
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,360
What are you saying?

1156
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,320
I smoke pot on the air.

1157
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,700
Now we can hear Princess Wee.

1158
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,720
We are gone.

1159
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,240
Switch.

1160
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,140
Switch.

1161
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,680
Oh, the UFO.

1162
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,780
Once again.

1163
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,380
I've already absorbed.

1164
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,140
Okay, Daisy Mae, was she the first sexy cartoon?

1165
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,860
Oh, no, not at all.

1166
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,140
She was a really sexy cartoon.

1167
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,560
She was, yes.

1168
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Now, get this.

1169
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:02,800
Princess Wee's mother, the queen mom, was such an Al Cap and Little Abner fan in the 50s

1170
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,220
that she was a fan of Princess Wee.

1171
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:10,720
When she was gestating Princess Wee, she sat and drew pictures of Daisy Mae,

1172
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,720
hoping that that would help make her daughter look like Daisy Mae.

1173
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,140
And as you can see, it worked.

1174
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,900
And by God, it succeeded.

1175
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,360
That's unbelievable.

1176
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:27,320
This is the subgenius, over-the-edge conglomeration.

1177
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,820
KPFA.org online.

1178
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,680
That's right.

1179
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,700
You can listen to us in any language.

1180
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,840
Any language anywhere in the world.

1181
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,000
Just go ahead and try it.

1182
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,620
KPFA.

1183
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,540
An unusual conversation.

1184
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,140
They're not actually broadcast on any other channel.

1185
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,580
We broadcast in all languages.

1186
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,720
And influences.

1187
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,260
For the new outer shape.

1188
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,500
Wait, are you saying that Princess Wee.

1189
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,300
Exactly.

1190
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,800
While she was in her mother's womb, her mother was reading Al Cap.

1191
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,620
She was drawing Daisy Mae, copying Daisy Mae drawings,

1192
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,980
in hopes that her daughter would come out a long-legged blonde.

1193
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,440
And it happened.

1194
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,820
Under her navel.

1195
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,220
Exactly.

1196
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,980
And it worked.

1197
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,560
And it worked.

1198
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,840
Now get this, however.

1199
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,020
And that's what I'm sitting beside here.

1200
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,240
Right.

1201
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,880
I don't know if the folks, the radio.

1202
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,200
This is actually quite the nice fable that you've developed here.

1203
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,940
Princess Wee.

1204
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,900
I really like that a lot.

1205
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,060
Don't throw water on that.

1206
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,680
My mother was a big fan of Dick Tracy.

1207
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,940
And when I was gestating, she drew Prune's face over and over.

1208
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,420
She was.

1209
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,060
She was.

1210
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,060


1211
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,880
That's what happened.

1212
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,980
That explains a lot.

1213
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,200
Wow.

1214
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
The material of your tiny glasses was you.

1215
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,020
Sad stuff was.

1216
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,420
Okay, that was twisted.

1217
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,760
And it wasn't me.

1218
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,660
Prune face.

1219
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,280
And those other guys who finally made it to TV.

1220
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,820
It was a pretty good TV cartoon, too.

1221
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,660
The Dick Tracy.

1222
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,480
So horrific.

1223
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,260
That guy was on it.

1224
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,700
The guy that says so horrific.

1225
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,000
6-2 and equal.

1226
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,980
Over and out.

1227
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,320
Oh.

1228
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,300
Oh.

1229
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,300


1230
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:02,980
They look pretty.

1231
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,260
But the really good one was.

1232
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,000
Unfortunately, there was also the movie of Dick Tracy.

1233
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,520
Not with Warren, what's his name?

1234
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,200
Warren Beatty.

1235
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,740
Yeah.

1236
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,440
Oh, yeah, right.

1237
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,140
Al Pacino.

1238
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,620
Yeah, that was really.

1239
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,820
I didn't say I had the diamond.

1240
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,100
Yeah, that didn't do it.

1241
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,140
You didn't like the supervillains in that?

1242
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,960
The villains.

1243
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,920
I like the villains.

1244
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,960
I like the colors.

1245
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,160
The villains looked good, but they weren't in there very much.

1246
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,220
Yeah, and the color was good.

1247
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,020
But it had warm.

1248
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,420
Lauren Beatty as Dick Tracy.

1249
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,920
And it had Madonna in it.

1250
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,580
You know, we don't want him as anything.

1251
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,080
Maybe Clyde Barrow at the moment.

1252
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:46,160
And if you listen to the Danny Elfman score, it's one note different from the Batman Danny Elfman score.

1253
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:46,960
There you go.

1254
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,800
He makes $30 million a note that time.

1255
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,340
Is that guy related to Jenny Elfman?

1256
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:55,940
Yes.

1257
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,560
Oh, he is.

1258
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,900
Things are bad.

1259
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:09,740
But he, well, you know, actually originally, you know, he kind of ran with the whole art rock, punk rock subgenius segment.

1260
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,240
I was the biggest Oingo Boingo groupie in the world for a long time.

1261
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,640
Me too.

1262
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,020
They were great.

1263
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,820
I thought they were, you know, because of that.

1264
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,260
Yeah.

1265
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:27,280
And I think Elfman as a film score writer has ripped off some of the best.

1266
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:34,240
He has, he took Bernard Herrmann's ball and ran with it.

1267
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:41,720
I honestly think he got the sheet music for Bernard Herrmann movies and just changed the notes.

1268
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,640
He kept the basic arrangement.

1269
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
He did Psycho.

1270
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,900
He did the Psycho remake.

1271
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,440
He remade the movie.

1272
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,040
Oh, I haven't heard that one.

1273
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,840
Well, that's happened in Mothers Bond.

1274
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,960
Now, is he still like, is he a top, like, LA film director guy?

1275
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,400
Or?

1276
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,680
Mark Mothers Bond and Mutato Musica.

1277
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,880
Why isn't he on this show?

1278
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,360
He should be on it.

1279
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,220
Is doing tons, well, they're too busy doing film scores and commercials.

1280
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,020
Well, see, okay.

1281
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,520
And children's shows.

1282
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:17,080
I saw a CGI Popeye with music by Mark Mothers Bond.

1283
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:22,020
It was one of the worst cartoons I ever saw in my life.

1284
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,920
Oh, how horrible.

1285
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,720
Pluto had become a good guy.

1286
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,480
It was sickening.

1287
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,420
It was sickening.

1288
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,040
So he had to have me one of them.

1289
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,360
Did he work on the script, too?

1290
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,460
I'm going to hurl now.

1291
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,280
No, no, he just got paid a bunch of money to make out the music for it.

1292
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:46,740
So, you know, it's the revenge of the big people against the smaller nerds that should run reality.

1293
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,000
Pluto to go back to his bad ways.

1294
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,280
Now, here's another thing.

1295
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,700
I recently saw a yogi.

1296
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:05,640
Bear cartoon, a new one in which the Yellowstone Park was no longer a national park, but a rich person ski resort.

1297
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,560
Oh, no.

1298
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:22,920
Yogi, instead of being a subversive picnic basket stealer, was Ranger Smith's friend in helping to protect the rich lady who owned the park from being a discomfort.

1299
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,400
Say it ain't so.

1300
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:24,980
Thank you.

1301
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,120
What?

1302
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,340
Bye.

1303
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,040
Evil hippie eco nuts.

1304
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,320
I'm not kidding.

1305
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,280
Yogi, we hardly knew you.

1306
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,720
It's sad and sickening, but Yogi had sold out completely.

1307
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:40,280
That whistling, I always knew he was no damn good.

1308
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,140
Ranger Smith had sold out, and Boo Boo wasn't even in it.

1309
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,020
They rubbed Boo Boo out.

1310
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,240
He was too much of a conscience.

1311
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,460
Boo Boo ran wild in another episode that was much better.

1312
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,880
Yeah, that was a great one.

1313
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,700
That's a Ranger Smith.

1314
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,340
Ranger Smith got him.

1315
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,360
Oh, man.

1316
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,140
I'm so disappointed in Yogi.

1317
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,720
But, of course, Yogi did say, you know, it ain't over till it's over.

1318
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,360
Boo Boo gone bad.

1319
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:06,900
Yogi said what?

1320
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,780
It ain't over till it's over.

1321
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,500
He did say that.

1322
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,480
Yogi said, oh, that's right.

1323
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,300
Yogi Bearer.

1324
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,100
Yogi Bearer, the human baseball guy said that.

1325
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,900
Yogi Bearer also jumped on top of the TV cable.

1326
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,620
If they don't show up at the park, you can't make them.

1327
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,380
No.

1328
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,080
If they don't stay home, you can't make them.

1329
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,580
If they stay home, you can't make them.

1330
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,700
No one goes there anymore.

1331
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:25,700


1332
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:25,700


1333
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:25,920
Yogi Bearer.

1334
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,600
Who's Yogi Bearer?

1335
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,220
Who's Bandra?

1336
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
I don't know.

1337
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,440
Yogi.

1338
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,140
That's terrible.

1339
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:38,740
Well, I hope my students in the subgenius history course have learned a lot in this discussion of

1340
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,320
being called Yogi Bear.

1341
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,280
Pretty similar to comic history.

1342
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,060
Little Repskeleons who have to seize their attention.

1343
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,880
But actually, these bad films and bad comic books are,

1344
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,840
I think, part of the history of the Church of the Subgenius.

1345
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,220
These are the things that we've ripped off and stolen from over the centuries.

1346
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,200
That's our literature.

1347
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,000
Yes, it is.

1348
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,480
We try to drive out of our consciousness.

1349
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,260
You say steal.

1350
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,740
Some people say liberate.

1351
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,680
Liberate.

1352
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,140
Yeah.

1353
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,720
Art wants to be free.

1354
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,360
Just like everything has a nature that wants to be free.

1355
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,120
Religion wants to be free.

1356
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,600
Information wants to be free.

1357
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,500
Just like this radio show wants to be free.

1358
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,700
However, the church is free.

1359
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,560
The subgenius charges for it.

1360
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,660
Despite the wants of the art itself.

1361
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,600
And yet we're tethered down.

1362
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,800
But that's because of the conspiracy.

1363
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,380
Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.

1364
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,680
Well, that's...

1365
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,140
Except for this show.

1366
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:43,100
You can believe everything you hear on this show.

1367
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,820
Which does represent the opinions of all stations.

1368
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,740
No, it's only what they really feel and think.

1369
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,280
I sent off a report, got into the car,

1370
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,680
woke up here,

1371
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:55,980
and I'm here.

1372
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,780
This show is what is.

1373
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,440
Freedom isn't free.

1374
00:46:59,440 --> 00:46:59,440


1375
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,900
You say something that means that...

1376
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,620
You're late to know what you really think.

1377
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,280
That's...

1378
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,840
It is the truth.

1379
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,280
Cut it out!

1380
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,660
Cut it out!

1381
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:08,220
Cut it out!

1382
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:08,900
Cut it out!

1383
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,300
Cut it out!

1384
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:09,460
Cut it out!

1385
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,020
Wipe it out!

1386
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,700
It's a tremendous...

1387
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,640
It's a tremendous responsibility.

1388
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:14,680
It's a tremendous challenge.

1389
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:14,780
To...

1390
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,180
That's right.

1391
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,940
And remember...

1392
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,480
As oracles...

1393
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,400
Every privilege carries with it responsibility.

1394
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:18,500
I know.

1395
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,000
What about...

1396
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,760
I mean, how much was the oracle of Apollo at Delphi paid?

1397
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,260
This is mishelfing this era.

1398
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,720
Swat over the crap.

1399
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,580
That was a government...

1400
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:25,920
Government job.

1401
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,700
Would you quickly take this address?

1402
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,440
They admitted to steam from the earth and actually told you what the odds...

1403
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,600
The 1400 block of East 16th Street.

1404
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,760
I think they were paid in goat sacrifices.

1405
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,180
Was that it?

1406
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:38,800
Yeah.

1407
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,600
Where is that exactly?

1408
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,840
And they...

1409
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,400
You know, they just had to tell you...

1410
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:43,900
Down south.

1411
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,640
...whether should I attack China or not?

1412
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,220
Two blocks east of West 14th Street.

1413
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,460
Now, didn't Nancy Reagan have an oracle like that when she was president?

1414
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,720
She squatted over the...

1415
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,700
It's inside yourself.

1416
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,300
Hello?

1417
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,600
Only inside herself.

1418
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,280
Yeah, she did her...

1419
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,900
Go out without her underwear and squat...

1420
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,580
It was her astrologer.

1421
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,120
I have not my pencil.

1422
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,340
You try to find it, it will not find you.

1423
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,740
He determined U.S. nuclear policy.

1424
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,040
I'll have to get another pencil.

1425
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,360
What?

1426
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:09,320
And, uh...

1427
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,500
Well...

1428
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,380
I guess the steam just goes right up in there and...

1429
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:14,840
Into the field.

1430
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,180
Uplift.

1431
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:16,780
I can now indeed board.

1432
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,400
...the ship will fly itself.

1433
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,060
You will see.

1434
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,280
What you seek.

1435
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,140
Invade Britannia.

1436
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:23,300
A better fighter.

1437
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:24,940
Are you there?

1438
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:25,560
I'm not.

1439
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1440
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1441
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1442
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1443
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1444
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1445
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,560


1446
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:25,640
I'm just a little...

1447
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,900
Uh, register.

1448
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,480
Roger?

1449
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,840
Talking to God?

1450
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:29,900
Franklin?

1451
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,000
Jackson?

1452
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,780
Most of us are not really all there.

1453
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,180
Washington?

1454
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,180


1455
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,320
Hey, hey, hey!

1456
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,340
Hey, hey!

1457
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:36,800
Hey!

1458
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,020
Money order.

1459
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,040
Now, do you throw...

1460
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
What does Puzzling Evidence do on this show anymore?

1461
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,440
...throw the goat down there?

1462
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:41,940
What?

1463
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,620
Oh, what does Puzzling Evidence do on this show?

1464
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,120
He records music on the show.

1465
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,180
He's over there twiddling dials and flipping switches.

1466
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:47,540
He doesn't do anything.

1467
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:47,540


1468
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,340
He used to shoot...

1469
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,460
He used to shoot...

1470
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:49,840
Flipper switcher?

1471
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,660
...religious leaders.

1472
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,240
He used to shoot Bob, and now he's just a show guy.

1473
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,800
I think that intimidated him.

1474
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,720
The whole trial...

1475
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,920
He's mixing it up, man!

1476
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,040
Well, no, he, uh...

1477
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,020
Especially if it's become famous as the Water Winter Wonderland.

1478
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,860
...he was intimidated by the fact that he was on trial for two and a half years.

1479
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,180
They interrogated him.

1480
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,200
He was seduced by the dark side of the force.

1481
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:07,320
Now, that's Paul Mavridis.

1482
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:07,700
And, uh...

1483
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,520
Paul Mavridis was the prosecuting lawyer.

1484
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,040
...with the art trial.

1485
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,900
That was Bill Jelovich.

1486
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,600
And just where do you think all these weird backgrounds come from?

1487
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,860
Uh, Mavridis' civil suit against Wellman...

1488
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,780
Music account and drum.

1489
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,820
...went on for, uh, 27 months.

1490
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:23,380
And, uh, I think that's all we have for this show.

1491
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:23,920
Thank you.

1492
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:24,780
Thank you.

1493
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:24,780


1494
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:24,780


1495
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:24,780


1496
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,340
Was Wellman called before the Hinkley Commission?

1497
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,580
Well, really, Wellman was awarded, uh, money...

1498
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,000
No, the Hinkley Commission covered it up completely.

1499
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:33,640
...for shooting Bob.

1500
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,260
Yeah, they shot...

1501
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,380
Yeah, but Wellman proved that shooting Bob was good, it was important to move forward

1502
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,820
for the church at that time.

1503
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,320
Shoot Bob Gould.

1504
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,820
And as a result, got a, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, an award from the judge.

1505
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,980
Well, but then it became...

1506
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,900
2.7 million...

1507
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,040
...a form, a ritual.

1508
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,720
It was like a token thing.

1509
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:50,940
Yeah.

1510
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,860
Bob would show up...

1511
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,040
Yeah.

1512
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,040
...and somebody would shoot him.

1513
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,760
Well, it was always Wellman that shot him.

1514
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:54,780


1515
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:54,780


1516
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:54,780


1517
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:54,780


1518
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:54,980
Yeah, but...

1519
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,380
Well, yeah.

1520
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,360
You know, it was like...

1521
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,140
It really is a low wage, considering how many times he had to kill Bob.

1522
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,060
You can see why Bob doesn't show up at Sagis' Bibles anymore.

1523
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:05,160
Right.

1524
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,560
He feels he's not wanted, almost, if he's killed every time.

1525
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,880
Actually, he...

1526
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,660
It's almost like, hey, what am I doing, guys?

1527
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,920
There's just no incentive.

1528
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:14,800
There's...

1529
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,880
People need incentive.

1530
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,380
Yeah.

1531
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,500
Now, killing Bob is a minimum wage.

1532
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:18,520
Hey!

1533
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:18,760
We're just...

1534
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,560
I just think...

1535
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,340
Why am I coming here?

1536
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:20,480
Yeah.

1537
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,140
We gotta give him a little bit more...

1538
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,800
Yeah, he never did pay more than minimum wage.

1539
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,040
...and, you know, give me some help here.

1540
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,060
And they would let...

1541
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:30,600
Well, you know, that is so old way of thinking.

1542
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,200
You know, we don't launch heads anymore, either.

1543
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:33,780
Well...

1544
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,660
We've moved forward.

1545
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,460
Maybe we should, you know...

1546
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,080
To broad, sunny-lit uplands.

1547
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,780
All the heads that we come across fall into our laps.

1548
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,320
They need to be launched.

1549
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:42,860
Dig.

1550
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,080
But I'm just saying...

1551
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,440
People want instant gratification.

1552
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,940
Bob, shouldn't Bob be shot more?

1553
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,780
Some subgenius traditions have survived...

1554
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:51,800
Only through...

1555
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,260
...such as everybody talking...

1556
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,700
...whats on radio shows.

1557
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:54,760


1558
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:54,760


1559
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:54,760


1560
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:54,760


1561
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:54,760


1562
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:54,760


1563
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,660
You guess?

1564
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:56,520
Well, yes.

1565
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,900
...music, performances...

1566
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,720
Walk up.

1567
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,240
...that are basically really audience elimination.

1568
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,480
Elimination...

1569
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,840
Show them your collars.

1570
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,460
...not some...

1571
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,880
Collar killing...

1572
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,580
...is a...

1573
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,960
...not a basic...

1574
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,380
They're not collars in a cold and damp.

1575
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,240
...the grape juice...

1576
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,740
...is just like fog.

1577
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,060
They get killed every time they...

1578
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,480
People come from all over to vacation here.

1579
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:17,800
I know.

1580
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,000
Strawberry...

1581
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,640
Call us and tell us...

1582
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,900
Talk about the Jones boys.

1583
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:20,760
...that's the thanks you get.

1584
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,960
...and the first station they're likely to pick up because of the strength of the 50,000...

1585
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,160
A volcano...

1586
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,740
...took you...

1587
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:24,740


1588
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:24,740


1589
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,120
You don't think they like this music?

1590
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,260
...is WJR.

1591
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,400
...a volcano strikes.

1592
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,080
I'd like a collar to call an 848-4425 in the 510 area code if you don't like the music.

1593
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,320


1594
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,780
Who cares if they don't like it?

1595
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,240
...instant ratification reads.

1596
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,800
...sounds like an IRC ratification reads.

1597
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,060
See, no collars.

1598
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,980
That means they like it.

1599
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,000
IRC.

1600
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:41,240
That's right.

1601
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:41,660
Thanks, folks.

1602
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,120
You will not burn...

1603
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,400
...in the lava.

1604
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,420
...in the...

1605
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,300
See, no collars.

1606
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,300
That means they like it.

1607
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,880
You will get...

1608
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,600
...a flavorful mouthful...

1609
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,580
...of strawberry milkshake lava.

1610
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,540
...of strawberry milkshake lava.

1611
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,960
...said she was going to support the station.

1612
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,720
No matter what.

1613
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,540
No matter what.

1614
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,560
Yeah, that's right.

1615
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,780
Princess Wee's mom, the queen mom...

1616
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,080
No matter what they said.

1617
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,680
...my mother...

1618
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,640
...supports this station despite this show.

1619
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:02,800
...freak.

1620
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:02,800


1621
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,720
So this is the power behind the throne.

1622
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,520
Float.

1623
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,120
So, Michael, did your...

1624
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,120
...she owns the whole station.

1625
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,840
So, Michael, did your mother freak?

1626
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,540
Yeah.

1627
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,520
She...

1628
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,520
When she knew that she did it...

1629
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,880
Can you still do that rant about your mother freaking?

1630
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,280
...the world.

1631
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:15,280


1632
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,220
...freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.

1633
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,000
My mother freaks.

1634
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,080
Can you still do that one?

1635
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,320
...so old she can.

1636
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,840
No, I can never do that.

1637
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:22,800
Oh, man.

1638
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,960
That was a classic.

1639
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,700
...no, my mother freaks.

1640
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,240
...she used to own the KPFA radio station.

1641
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:26,700
Yeah.

1642
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:33,100
She decided she was going to pay KPFA any kind of money that it wanted because, you

1643
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,640
know, it was like so like freaky and like, you know...

1644
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,520
Folks, will you call in?

1645
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,960
...good or bad, you know, who cares what's good or bad?

1646
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:40,380
I promise.

1647
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,180
You know, everything's just like everything, you know?

1648
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,400
...insert ratification.

1649
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,700
Everything is just like...

1650
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,120
...and one help.

1651
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,020
...nothing matters.

1652
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,600
...nothing matters.

1653
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,180
...they stick with it.

1654
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:48,500
No, it was...

1655
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:48,720
...with the alkaloid...

1656
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,020
What was it?

1657
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,320
...portel.

1658
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,080
...my mother freaks.

1659
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:53,240
...my mother freaks.

1660
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,320
...the typical WJR audience.

1661
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,700
...my mother freaks.

1662
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,720
...my mother freaks.

1663
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,480
...my mother freaks.

1664
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,740
My mother freaked and then she flipped out.

1665
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,560
While she was flipping, my grandmother called in.

1666
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,120
She had a son.

1667
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,640
It sounds like a family meltdown.

1668
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,360
I was freaking.

1669
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,260
All the way to the bank, I was freaking.

1670
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,080
Doing the freaky thing.

1671
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,920
My grandmother...

1672
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:09,140
...my grandmother...

1673
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,540
...when I cashed in that big check she gave me...

1674
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,620
...the nechromacon by the...

1675
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,780
Man, that check was like 3Z by 2Z.

1676
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,320
...from a bag of raw garlic packs until she saw the sign $20.

1677
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,740
...wipes it all over my uncle's face...

1678
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,020
...it was a big check.

1679
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,040
...green embers.

1680
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,080
...the subgenius book is...

1681
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,180
...the green embers.

1682
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,460
...the subgenius book is...

1683
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:24,700
...the subgenius book is...

1684
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:38,900
... Male 1 of 6.

1685
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,060
You're a puppy...

1686
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,980
You're a puppy.

1687
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:53,100
Like and subscribe to f съ Friendées motor Mobils ...

1688
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,880
Until you are gratified of the Babu with 13th level.

1689
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:08,920
You will go down four levels, sideways, 14 through the fourth valley, overlap above the half.

1690
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,280
And finally she disappears completely.

1691
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,340
Rectangled into a quadrilatic avocado.

1692
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,020
Yeah, avocado.

1693
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,640
And it's just like a loaf of, leaf of lettuce that just spirals in on itself infinitely.

1694
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,220
And then she disappears completely.

1695
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,100
This is like Connie.

1696
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,920
She's not here, but she's here.

1697
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,520
She's spinning outward.

1698
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,880
No, inward.

1699
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,780
Roots in and out.

1700
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,080
Inward.

1701
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,560
Yeah.

1702
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,760
She's taking a leg into her body.

1703
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:44,800
And then the rest of her body follows itself into her body like the rubber man.

1704
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,840
Only going inside.

1705
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:54,980
And then her whole body finally reduces itself and disappears into nothing.

1706
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,900
In the corner of the top of her head.

1707
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,560
That's so complicated.

1708
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,260
Rectangular.

1709
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,180
That's what happens.

1710
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,660
Is that like those snakes taking their own tail?

1711
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah.

1712
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,760
That's why Connie can't be seen.

1713
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,520
Well, Connie can be seen.

1714
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,700
It's just that she looks.

1715
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,840
She looks different every time you look at her.

1716
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,260
Yeah.

1717
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:17,880
That's the thing.

1718
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,520
With her avocado.

1719
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,520
Exactly.

1720
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,740
Instacatto.

1721
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:25,900
As opposed to Bob, who never changes at all.

1722
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,320
Yeah.

1723
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,160
Bob don't ever change.

1724
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,080
He's Bob.

1725
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,200
He doesn't have to change.

1726
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,820
That's right.

1727
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,940
Always with Bob.

1728
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:44,100
Dr. Drummond, that's a pretty good variation on the traditional form of that old Dr. Hal.

1729
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:44,680
He's got the.

1730
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,540
He's got the music in his soul, that boy.

1731
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:46,980
Speaking of lettuce.

1732
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,380
He does.

1733
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,060
Ow!

1734
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,240
Wabbit.

1735
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,040
Hey, Getty.

1736
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,800
Speaking of lettuce.

1737
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,500
Buzzy Wabbit.

1738
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,520
Let us pray.

1739
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:53,180
The album.

1740
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:53,960
The White Singers.

1741
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,860
Let us pray to Bob.

1742
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,000
Let us pray to Bob.

1743
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,300
Yeah, now that James Brown is gone, I'm going to try out for the new Godfather of Soul.

1744
00:55:59,460 --> 00:55:59,920
Hey, my God.

1745
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,260
James Brown.

1746
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,100
James Brown.

1747
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,700
What are we going to do about that?

1748
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,080
James Brown had been worked out.

1749
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:05,520
James Brown had been worked out.

1750
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,060
Does the ad buddy have?

1751
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,360
He's Bob.

1752
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,000
He would have.

1753
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,880
Walter Funk.

1754
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,360
He did?

1755
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:09,960
Okay.

1756
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,940
Well, that's.

1757
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,360
He invented Funk, which is.

1758
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,700
Wow!

1759
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:14,780
Sitting here by.

1760
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,080
Sitting here.

1761
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,000
Through osmosis.

1762
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,380
Two feet away from me, Walter Funk is sitting here.

1763
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,720
Sitting there.

1764
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,380
Kind of individual where they are.

1765
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,200
An individual microphone.

1766
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,500
There it is.

1767
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,800
And he was invented by James Brown.

1768
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,280
And what they do for a living.

1769
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:27,860
Sitting here.

1770
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,820
They invent Funk.

1771
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,180
It's hard to believe.

1772
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,640
Philo, you're doing pretty good.

1773
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:32,800
I was hatched out of James's pour.

1774
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,620
All sorts of different situations.

1775
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,660
On a sweaty day, I came out.

1776
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,680
He sounds like a taste.

1777
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,700
And I expanded outward.

1778
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,280
Yes.

1779
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,740
Philo James Brown.

1780
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,600
What's the difference?

1781
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,700
You know, it's.

1782
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,520
There's got to be a new Godfather.

1783
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:43,580
It's almost the same thing.

1784
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,180
You can't just leave that job unfilled.

1785
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,520
Yeah.

1786
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:46,560
I know.

1787
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:47,340
Somebody's going to have to take care of it.

1788
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:47,500
So what do you think?

1789
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,900
Are you ready to take on?

1790
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,080
I'll take it on.

1791
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:50,660
I'm ready.

1792
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,500
You know, I mean, it's going to pay well.

1793
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,540
What could happen?

1794
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,860
I take it on.

1795
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,460
And you know.

1796
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,900
The sex, the drugs, the pills, all that.

1797
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,920
Gives them through all that.

1798
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,100
With the swing and love corpse.

1799
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,420
You do the time.

1800
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,420
You're a good driver.

1801
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,040
You sound bold now.

1802
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:03,760
Oh yeah.

1803
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,220
I forgot.

1804
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,220
Well, I'll see you later.

1805
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:05,640
You're going to do the time.

1806
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,140
Get in the car.

1807
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,520
Do you remember the swing and love corpse?

1808
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:08,880
No.

1809
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,020
Like my whole life.

1810
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,040
My mind was shattered during that time.

1811
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,540
I had a nice hot tub back there.

1812
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,560
I play that periodically.

1813
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,880
We had all those drugs we had to take.

1814
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,920
It was the law back then.

1815
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,440
That's what justifies my taking drugs.

1816
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,940
This music in the background was one of the early swing and love corpses pieces.

1817
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,320
This is Sphinx Drummond singing.

1818
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,180
Yeah.

1819
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:31,760
Oh yeah.

1820
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,320
Sphinx.

1821
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:34,820
Sphinx.

1822
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,500
Sphinx.

1823
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,100
Sphinx.

1824
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:36,160
Sphinx.

1825
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,520
We saw Sphinx Drummond just last week at the Frock compound.

1826
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,680
Were you able to swear at him?

1827
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1828
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1829
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1830
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1831
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1832
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1833
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1834
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1835
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1836
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1837
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1838
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1839
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:43,680


1840
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:43,860
We were about to swear at him.

1841
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:43,860


1842
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,180
Did you get his letter out of the way?

1843
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,520
When can I go to the Frock compound?

1844
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,240
For no reason.

1845
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:46,580
We took him...

1846
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,540
We were ready to take him to the hospital at any minute.

1847
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,040
Anytime he told us.

1848
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,160
Did he have too much fropp?

1849
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,220
No.

1850
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,520
No, in this case we...

1851
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,020
Can you have...

1852
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,920
Can you have too much fropp?

1853
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,280
Yes.

1854
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,040
Really?

1855
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,200
Oh yeah.

1856
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:58,680
You can.

1857
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,540
Really?

1858
00:57:59,720 --> 00:57:59,820
Yes.

1859
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:06,020
It is possible to have too much fropp if you're having more than I am.

1860
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,660
How can that be?

1861
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:06,980
It's too much.

1862
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,580
Well, you know, they do say too much is better than not enough.

1863
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:13,620
But one must...

1864
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:13,680
I know.

1865
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,140
Always hope for superfluity in the land of abundance.

1866
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,460
Yes, it's a land of abundance.

1867
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,600
Conspicuous consumption.

1868
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,380
Yes, and sometimes inconspicuous consumption.

1869
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,520
So how are you fixed for blades anyway?

1870
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,320
Well, I've got about ten left.

1871
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,480
While you're here visiting in this land of ours,

1872
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:36,400
perhaps you lack some of the amenities of back home,

1873
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,340
the homely virtues and the gentle tunes.

1874
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,740
Well, it's true that back home in Cleveland Heights,

1875
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,980
we hear none of that noise.

1876
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,020
That noise.

1877
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:54,000
We only hear the crickets that go with the tinnitus.

1878
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,380
Oh, the cricket of bickering crickets.

1879
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,920
The cricket of tinnitus which never sleeps.

1880
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,800
The eyes of the world.

1881
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:00,960
The million chittering crickets.

1882
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,640
The inner crickets.

1883
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,840
There you go.

1884
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,160
You want to be the leader of your group.

1885
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,960
Ah, there he is.

1886
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,580
The cricket on the heart.

1887
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,220
You want to be one of those.

1888
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,700
The weak outcasts.

1889
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,840
You want to be the leader of your group.

1890
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,320
You want to kick their ass.

1891
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:17,920
Exactly.

1892
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,200
In Cleveland.

1893
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,580
You want to destroy their lives.

1894
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,040
In Cleveland on the hour of slack at WCSB.

1895
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,500
Whose lives are we going to destroy?

1896
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,680
We have those who are not of our kind.

1897
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:34,360
We don't have a how, but we do have a sort of a micro-definition.

1898
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,700
You're going to get something.

1899
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,240
I can tell you this.

1900
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:38,980
Transcendence.

1901
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,820
In the neutral.

1902
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,360
Quadratic.

1903
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,280
Hyper.

1904
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,420
Elliptic.

1905
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:45,580
Rectangle.

1906
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:46,980
Yeah.

1907
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:50,220
Transcendence.

1908
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:50,460
Right.

1909
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,520
Say it now.

1910
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,020
www.subgenius.com

1911
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,220
You have been listening to the hour of slack.

1912
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,140
Although this time it was a rerun of the KPFA over the edge and puzzling evidence show.

1913
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,880
Nonetheless, it is.

1914
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,060
It is.

1915
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,300
It is.

1916
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,340
Now of Slack.

1917
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,320
Or just was.

1918
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,460
Subgenius.com.

1919
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,240
Praise Bob and thank you.
