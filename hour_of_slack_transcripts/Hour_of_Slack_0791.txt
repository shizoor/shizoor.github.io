On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers, Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the prescriptors call the advent of the angelic host.
With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small, spinning fragment of solar driftwood, which by chance or design, man has inherited out of the dark mystery of time and space.
Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle.
Intellects, vast, cool, and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track.
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me.
Give me slack, or give me food, or kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
It's Saturday.
It's Saturday.
It's Saturday.
It's Saturday.
Yes, it's little old me, Bob.
And welcome to another edition of...
That's what's up.
That's what's up.
Can you agree?
We're going to be there in less than three hours, Zach.
We'll see you there in a bit.
And I wonder if I'll end up becoming something weird.
You won't become one of us.
Some make rules, some obey, but the rules are for the fools, is what I say.
All right, let's do it.
Activate interlock.
Dynatherms connected.
Infracells up.
Megabrusters are go.
If anyone dies, move the body to another room in the house.
Label the body with name and address.
And cover it as tightly as possible in polythene, paper, sheets, or blankets.
What a horrible death.
It won't kill him.
It couldn't.
When mankind falls into conflict with nature, monsters are born.
I'm just trying to...
send him home.
Hey, what's going on here?
I'm sorry.
Along with Bob,
the pursuit of slack,
and a conspiracy of pinks,
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.
According to church doctrine,
on July 5th, 1998,
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.
They're going to...
They will put us out of our misery
unless Bob can explain to us...
...and we can explain to them in ways that they can understand
that there is something on Earth worth saving.
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket,
paid in full to the church subgenii,
have the tiniest prayer of survival.
The rest of them?
It's a tough world, Jack.
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.
Only his predictions are just a little different.
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,
the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,
the true believer subgeniuses,
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
And believe it or not, plenty of people,
4,000 of them so far and more every day,
have already joined up.
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.
Your standard religious rip-off, right?
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?
I think Bob is just...
...guy with a pipe.
Oh, that's crazy talk.
What's gonna happen to your children?
What's gonna happen to your children?
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created,
when this society we've created,
air conditioners,
are station wagons with wooden sides,
station wagons with wooden sides,
are cautious indeed,
are retired actors,
are in charge of the politics,
are in charge of the politics,
what happens when that collapses?
What happens when your diary wasn't damn well?
What happens when your diary wasn't damn well?
That's when the men from Planet X-9
are down to save the members of the church.
Are down to save this bitch?
There's just no quit.
Alright we gotta turn it off right now.
Okayatta will turn it off.
Do we want to turn into maximum force?


on origin,

you can get still
yo pick

It's getting pretty comparing about this
but until that day,
I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.
What else could it be?
Frightening as the thought may be, it could happen.
The sun will become dark, the moon blood red,
the stars of the heavens will fall,
there'll be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming,
the islands and the mountains are shaken out of their sockets,
and the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the face of the earth.
It's all coming.
Yes, I'm ready now.
Then close your eyes and tap your heels together three times
and think to yourself, there's no place like Bob.
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the earth,
on board with the Twelve.
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,
and the other so-called gods.
The gods of our legends.
But not Bob.
The gods they were.
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.
But we'll have to wait another year.
Hail the sex goddesses.
Because they did show up at X-Day.
A new day.
Yeah, we went over the rainbow into the mitochondrial yeti DNA.
Level C.
Well, we're going to have to go north and south and east and west.
And we've got to wait another year.
Yeah, but we're going to fill up a new pipe.
We're going to wait for the sun to shine.
We're going to turn around and take our time.
We're going to break the seal to the other side.
You know, from the valley, I hear the muffled cry
of all them poor sheeple that we left behind.
And we're going to...
Take that next evolutionary step.
Yeah, we're going to climb on those rocket ships.
We're going to build the vessels if we have to.
We're already testing the engines.
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.
We're on the ride, yeah.
Mitochondria leave.
Thanks for the ride.
We'll take it from here.
Oh, here.
Here, this is the video down feed from the rocket launch.
Here.
Launch the rocket ship.
This is...
Remember?
Remember they were all chanting this together
as we were lighting the fuse?
Yeah, I do.
Everyone was dancing.
Mojo and I were out there lighting rocket butt.
You know, Jehovah One is not alone in its cosmic meddling.
Earth has been inhabited nonstop for millions of years
by hundreds of different races of aliens from space,
both benevolent and hostile.
Have you ever noticed that no two UFO photographs
show the same hubcap?
Many of the saucer jockeys are simple humanoids like us.
Space Nazis who do little more than freeze up car motors
on lonely country roads at night
and occasionally break or mutilate human organs.
They usually look like careless elves or dwarves
and are of relatively minor importance
since Bob himself has faster spaceships than they have.
They only frequently break the rule of
don't let the earthlings see you.
But there are far other more confusing ones.
A false mind-breaking overwhelming on which would show death and madness
and which might as well be considered the very fingers
of the stark fist of Jehovah One himself.
Of these various comedians of the gods,
the ones which channel information from wartime to humanity
are called the injectors.
They generally make their transfer out
through children, psychics and drunkards and Bob.
So heavy.
Dozens, perhaps hundreds of entities speak through Bob.
Many voices.
They also listen and see through him.
And many even go to him for advice on handling humans.
Bob is a wide open channel they can walk into
for the divulging of past lives,
secrets, and ground rumors.
Well,
there'll be a time when spinach roots
and parts of vegetables grow out of our bodies.
There'll be a time when like our feet actually just disappear underneath us.
There'll be a time when we'll levitate.
There'll be a time when our skin expands
and our body stays the same size inside.
If that's what you really want, Dave.
That's not what I want.
I'm naming the times that will be.
There'll be a time when the electric laundromat washer thing
that will come and argue with you in the parking lot.
You better be ready to know what you want
because X day's close.
X day's real close, Dave.
Dave, it's July 5th of this year.
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.
This whole reality will be swept, rolled up like a carpet.
And you're, because you are a member in the church's subgenius.
I've never been this member.
I'm sure you sent your $30 in.
I'm still in one piece.
My name is Bertrand.
That means you are saved, my brother.
Lonesome cowboy.
It's gonna be me.
And it's gonna be you.
We're gonna be you.




We're gonna do everything we want to.
It's gotta be now.
And I can't wait.
To say goodbye to fear and all that pain and hate.
Oh!
Like a flaming baton
that's burning us warm.
Like George Bush on that day
singing the new song.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.
Gonna be a new world.
I've been saying
to anyone's last words
there's nothing left for you to say
soon you'll be dead anyway.
Well, no one here
can see it out of my eyes.
There's someone really lost my mind
and I don't care.
So close your eyes.
And you can judge off your life
And think about the times we've been and what they've been
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
We're only gonna die from our own arrogance
That's why we might as well take our time
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth
I come to you from a long, long ways off
I come from a planet that is similar to yours
Your many fears, tensions and frustrations are no longer ours
I hate them with all my heart
They're inhuman and to be destroyed
What is your objective?
You are not ready
But we will still save you
I'll be right here
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars
Now this man was invisible to me
Except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight
By 1998 every normal, mediocrity, pink boy, admin
associations of
ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand, but for the fact that many of
Nostradamus's other prophecies have already been fulfilled.
But the old ones are coming back.
I'm going to let them through.
And Banjo and Birdie and Bob.
Good.
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.
Greetings and salutations.
Hail Bob and all of his followers.
I have a question for the great and mighty Ivan Stang.
No.
Another one of those.
What exactly does it take to become a member of the Church of the Subgenius?
It's simple.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
It's too late.
What must you do to be or what?
You have to bend over and spread them because here comes Bob's big bullet, my friend.
If you ain't figured it out by now, it's just a little too late.
First, you're going to...
You're going to find out.
July 5th, this year, 7 a.m.
First, you go to subgenius.com and sign up there.
Whatever you got to do.
I don't care.
You know, pay whatever they tell you to pay.
Give all your money.
Sign your...
Just send them your checkbook with all the checks signed already.
Except then save...
Actually, then save a couple dollars, though, for...
You might need some shoes.
The church needs their shoes and their bifocals and glasses.
We're accepting anyone's glasses or anyone's bifocals or prosthetic devices, too.
If any of you have an extra arm or a leg.

If you have a leg that's flipping around, send it to the church because after X-Day,
you won't need it, but we may need it for playthings on our pleasure vessels.
There's a lot of things you can do with some canine jelly and some prosthetic devices,
so let's get snappy.
Well, some people won't be...
There won't be anything left of them but prosthetic devices.
Well, yes.
If I have my way after X-Day.
Well, you won't be allowed to mow down everyone like a sign.
No, just, you know, I won't have time.
I'll get bored with it after a while.
Delicious, delightful.
Pink creatures.
I've got this, there's this fifth grade teacher.
You're going to exhumiliate her?
Well, she's dead, I'm sure.
Oh, well, of course.
Long since dead.
But with the technology that will be brought to the subgenius believers this X-Day,
I will be able to resurrect her from her horrible, flabby, fetid corpse from the dead
and let it hurt.
And not only that, I'll broadcast it to all of her former students
so they can see what I got to do.
Go ahead and torture them.
I didn't used to, you know, I used to be a nice subgenius, an evangelical, we called them.
You know, I didn't feel that humans needed to be exterminated after X-Day.
No, but after.
I thought, put them to work.
Yes, labor camps.
Re-education.
Running the amusement parks.
Re, you know.
The X-rated theaters.
Yes, exactly.
Also taking care of the lavatories on the streets, which may no longer be needed.
But I know this year.
Our editor is getting much worse now since they corkscrew like the piece of flesh.
Oh, worse.
I'd say it's just simply more realistic.
It erupts from the top of your head.
I'm just being honest with myself.
You know, I'm not.
When X-Day comes, the subgeniuses who have actually paid their true dues,
the real dues, the ones that you only can know about between the lines,
we'll be able to.
Actually, we will be unable to prevent our whims from.
Coming to life.
A dinosaur in a schmicks.
Did you ever see Forbidden Planet, the monster from the kid?
Unfortunately, yes.
It scared me all my life.
Yeah, well, it'll be like that for every subgenius.
Every subgenius is monster from the.
Will it be a monster, my friend?
Well, I think there are some out there.
Or will it be a beautiful love goddess?
Which will you be thinking of?
Will I personally?
Will I to reach my hand out?
Are you going to be secretly afraid?
Or are you going to be secretly hopeful?
To that mellow, tourniqueted palm with its palm raised skyward.
Is it hope?
Hopeful slack or hateful slack?
Friend, what is it that powers your little Dave brain?
Poopoo slack, is it?
The tiny Dave brain in the back.
Is it hurtful poopoo slack?
Down by your pelvis.
Is it dinosaur meat that propels your engine?
The Dave had to have a separate mind located near the pelvis
to keep his legs in sync with his upper body.
Otherwise, they would head in opposite directions.
That is me.
One to heaven and one straight to you know where.
Put up an Atlantic record.
One up, one down, and one in.
Poopoo slack.
Yeah!
Yeah!
And that's when you're supposed to have a gold tooth.
Oh, el diablo.
Oh, el dom.
Pa'l fierno.
La iglesia del subgenio.
La iglesia del subgenio.
Se presenta anoche una semana.
Julio cinco.
Cin...
Viente.
Yeah.
Go ahead and kill me.
You've already said I'm dead.
A dead man with a brain and a body kept alive artificially to...
to feed a generation of monsters.
That's not true.
I like things to be like that.
Things and...
and people can't always be the same.

Who on earth...?
Now, who's gonna talk for you on earth?
Who's gonna send the word?
Who's gonna pronounce the final epithet?
Who's gonna take you off on earth?
Who's gonna force you?


Who's gonna speak for you on earth?
Who's gonna speak for you on earth?
Who's gonna talk for earth?
Harcharhichar.
We know.
We know.
speaks for the nation.
But who speaks for the planet?
Who speaks for
Earth?
Coal, zinc, and zinc steel.
Homelands without hearts. Human beings
without minds. A world of pain.
No luxury. No comfort.
No delight.
Suffering at every corner.
Enjoy yourself.
Enjoy yourself.

Is there no more?
There is no future.
Earth. Earth. Earth.
We have destroyed the land we live in.
We have taken the earth.
And we have saved the earth.
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.
And this is the story.
The short face of evolution.
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
This is the slow pivot.
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.
The slumbering, lumbaring face of evolution.
One.
We are one.
One is the beginning.
Are you one, Herbert?
I am not, Herbert.
You're not, Herbert?
We reach.
Continuing scanning, Captain.
Still no readings of life forms on the planet's surface.
Definitely something out there Captain has this way.
Instrument readings indicate life forms,
but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature.
Fascinating.
Pure energy.
Pure thought.
Not life as we know it at all.
If it is the only survivor of a dead race,
articulate,
it would be a crime against science.
For this to do what it does is impossible,
by any science I understand.
It can't be a machine if we understand mechanics.
I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy,
like a virus.
Ask me no further questions I will not answer.
If, if, Rob, Johnny Ho.
Listen,

I loved you.
However, I hate you.
My God!
My God, man!
That was Spock meets The Exist,
produced by the great The Bishop.
Live long and prosper with Bob, friends.
And the Bishop also did this piece that's running in the background.
And yes, it's an Ex-Ex-Ex Day show.
This will be the last show that I have to produce with Earth equipment.
Well, no, actually, I guess I have to do two more.
And then after that, I'll be doing them on the escape vessels,
and they'll be movies instead of shows.
Anyway, friends, coming up is, of course,
more recordings of Ex-Day's past, present, and future.
And Help Hope Huey.
We'll be preaching soon.
And, of course, lots and lots of Einstein's secret orchestra,
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith.
He's the creator and sustainer of all the worlds.
That's Chaz, I guess.
But those worlds are known or unknown to mankind.
Step right up, step right up.
Come one, come all, come on one another in great big glops.
Welcome to the subgenius festival of freaks,
the XXX Day XXXtravaganza,
that saves your soul for a mere $30 or triple your damn money back.
Woo!
It serves up tenderloin to pink
and a series of savage gestures for charm's sake.
It puts loud plaid pants on the devil.
It soothes your soul, felches your holes,
and takes you on a grand tour of the grassy knolls.
Step right up.
See common decency skewered on the pitchfork of special privilege.
Hear music that'd scare the living mom out of the local Amish
if they got close enough to hear it.
See the asses that launched a thousand wet dreams.
Hear ye, hear ye.
Woo!
Buy stained chest hairs for a dollar a pluck.
Sample this result.
Screams.
Use them as a rhythm bed for the music competition.
We'll hold the next year's two months if the saucers don't come again this year.
No!
Step right up.
One thin 30 does it.
Join the juvenile jamboree that makes that juvenile jackanette.
Jim Jones jerkwad jackoff looks like the jar of jizz it was.
Praise Bob!
Woo!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Kick it, lick it, suck it, whack it, dress it up in cutesy little pants,
and make it do the pee-pee dance.
Bring on them saucers.
I'm paid up.
I wanna get laid up.
I stayed up all night at subgenius boot camp.
Huh?
Huh?
Who needs sleep drinking that suspicious coffee and then ate through the friggin' spoon?
Just so I could be here tonight to tell you that it is a sin not to dump your soul in your wallet
and hand the whole mom-ess over to Bob.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Because it's the best deal you'll get outside a three-day blow job from Hypatia League
because the fun just keeps on coming and so will you.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Take a deep cleansing breath and release.
I'm Jackie Puss here and it smells very, very bad down here in the basement.
Some of the children have decided to rip the cages open and let the animals free.
The freed animals, however, didn't see it their way and ripped many of the small children
into these shreds we see right here.
And here is a beautiful little child who's been living in the basement for a long time.

Almost completely eaten and he still can offer up these few words for...
Did you want to say something before we...
Did you do...
Uh...

Uh...
A Newman?
Like Dave, like the Dave Man.
A Cardinal Newman.
A bright red bird with a strange hat and a lovely, lovely twist to his spasms.
Ah, what spasms friend?
Ah yes!
You're going to get a lot of spasms when you join the purchase.
I do.
Genius.
Because it costs...
Yes.
sort of foxes in your necks
that make y'all have them spasms.
I, as a very young man,
give my $30 on them days,
was 20, 20 ducks,
and was gifted,
like the sifting winds of change in my own backyard,
into what you see right now
with those hollow blue things.
Wow, that's really touching, Gary.
Ah, it's been touching me for too long.
I can see my own sins
drifting into a vast corpus collectimus.
I can see by your coat, my friend,
you're from the other side.
I have come from...
Just one thing I've got to know.
Could you tell me, please, who won?
Well, it was kind of a draw.
Ah, nobody was left to count score, but...
We made the seed, remember?
Ah, Woody Allen said...
Ah, I remember, Beck.
The important thing is showing up.
Back on the ramparts in Spain
when we used to fight for the good cause together, Dave,
remember?
See, I remember.
Fighting for anarchy.
I remember those days in the Quintana Brigada
when we fight Franco
and we fight those doctor souls
and all of the other oppressors of our smelly souls.
I remember the day when we marched on Barcelona
and I only sized it.
Fashionable.
Fascista.
Fascista.
Farcos had it put out their biggest tanks
and riding on top of one.
What's that one pig's name?
Caudillo Baño?
What was his name?
Terrible Guineano.
The Caudillo of Barcelona in the time.
He was the worst of all the bulls and the pigs.
He was not...
And they let the bulls and the wardens loose in the street.
It was a bull swap pig
and he was also an animal
and so when we take him out and shoot him,
it was a good thing.
It was a good thing.
Watch your choice, friends.
Civil war in the new accent.
Or jump on that ship and forget about it.
The choice is clear.
Clearer than you're thinking right now.
90 billion dead on planet Earth.
Yeah, that's what you thought it was.
No, actually, that's not what I thought it was either, darn it.
Uh, how did we, uh...
We're tired of your phony fireworks.
Blast off! You have earned this!
Yeah!
What about, uh, what about this, uh, reputed, uh...
Golly, my God!
Jesus, Starfleet, that was, uh, supposed to have shown up.
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central
and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.
What a space ovation!
Now let's do another.
And now in celebration of this great occasion,
we have planned a lunar party.
We hope all young people throughout the solar system
will join us in celebration of this great occasion.
And we hope you have a great day in Alpha State.
Bob?
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out,
we'll go for Sex Day!
We want you to have a dance into the new century!
Screw into the new century!
Sleep and eat your way into the new century!

Whatever you're doing,
the moment of turnover
is what you'll be doing forever.
So make sure you're not asleep!
Make sure you're not watching TV!
Make sure you're not missing the packed bed!
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch
you'll never be able to scratch!
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills!
A sea of bogged pills!
But you're just too blind yet to see them!
Oh!
Oh, friends!
I know you're not...
the dumb-asticated type!
I know you're the smart-asticated type!
Oh, but people say,
Reverend Stagg,
what is slack?
I want you to tell me what slack is!
No, friends!
The television
doesn't have to watch you
as long as you are watching the television!
And a lot of people,
a lot of people think that slack is that Miller Beer commercial
where everybody's good-looking
and you're rich and your team just won the game
and you're drinking Miller Beer
and your favorite show is on
and you know that's bullshit
because slack is not laziness, friends!
Slack is getting into the zone!
It's being awake and alert
and doing what you wanted to do
until your eyes snap open
and you're smart enough to realize
that you are God!
What is more clever
and everything is just as psychedelic
as an old t-shirt
that you can't fit into anymore?
Now, hold that thought!
Hold it in your head!
Because that is what slack
is all about, friends!
Slack is something for nothing!
Woo!
This sounds like rocket launching stuff.
I'm diggin' it.
This is rocket launching.
This is leaving it to rocket stuff.
This is swoopin' over the house of your enemy
and strafing him.
This is digging up the corpse of that school teacher
that embarrassed you in class.
Bringing her back to life
so that you can embarrass her
in front of all human reality.
Praise Bob!
X-Day is a-comin'!
Help me somebody!
And boy, you better be careful
walking past Tranquility Base.
You could get shot.
Walking between Tranquility Base
and Ed Strange's lunar base,
uh, outpost,
uh, cause he's gonna set up directly
on the other side of the road
from Tranquility Base
so that we can have a direct line of fire
between our two camps.
Oh, God, the weaponry,
the spectacle,
the fire,
the fancy naked girls,
the Cremora bomb!
Who will be the-
Who's night will it be in the barrel
this X-Day?
Which hierarchite will be tortured
for your amusement?
Amusement?
A veritable amusement park for the soul.
Say, Dave, you've never been thrown in the water.
Or, uh, or, or, uh,
hung up on a cross or beaten and-
Yes, I have.
Yes, yes I have.
No, no.
I've been bottled.
He does that to himself on a daily basis.
Oh, yeah, the cops.
Yeah, self-flagellation, self-immolation,
self-matter, natter, pre-naturation.
Dave lives the life he sings about.
He's never been roasted subgenius.
You've never been subgenius-style, though, have you?
Oh, yes, I have.
I've been bottled, I've been greased,
I've been, uh, furcoflanked,
and I've also been, uh,
You've never been conitized.
glee-infesticated.
I bet you'd love to get them conitites
torturing you like they did to me.
I would like to be perhaps wearing the-
Jesus.
the fluffed-out conitites
and, uh, be astride one of the rockets
headed for the planet Citron.
Uh, Citron.
Friends, remember,
when you join the Church of the Subgenius,
it's like a sex cult.
Remember something.
The-the-
For a long time, it was just a bunch of guys.

Sort of.
And a few really weird chicks.
Weird chicks are happening.
Oh, boy, howdy.
Connie has arisen.
And the conitites have taken over the
HMCA festivities once again.
Actually, they've planned an oobleck
wrestling fest this time.
Oobleck.
Oobleck.
Yeah, pornstarch.
Uh, buckets and buckets of colored pornstarch.
Pornstarch? Oobleck pornstarch?
Yes.
Oh, that stuff is delicious
in a mammary pudding.
Or perhaps one of those pistachio flakes
you might make in a-a cold night of Sunder,
perhaps, when the bricks are all over you.
Yeah, and remember how exciting it was
when Pastor Craig got his neck broken
at the last one?
We're gonna try to do a lot more
of that kind of thing.
So that's the unofficial name for it?
Ooderblunder? Or, um...
No, the, the, the...
Ooderblunder?
Actually, it's called Pastor Craig in them.
Oh, that's even better.
C'mon, ooderblunder!
C'mon!
Ooderblunder!
Ooderblunder!

Ooderblunder!
Dick whip it!
Oobleck!
Ooderblunder!
Ooderblunder!
Ooderblunder!
Damn!
Okay.
Whoa, hey, hold on.
Alright.
What, what's your problem?
Your shoulder?
You have a big shoulder.
Which one?
Okay.
Okay!
Okay, okay.
Huda, Huda.
Hooah, hooah.
Okay, now I want you to let go for just a second.
Just let the hand rest.
Get this one out of the way for just a minute.
Hooah, hooah.
Don't grin.
Okay, grunt.
Don't grin.
Ahhhh!
Ohhhh, yeah.
My name is Chaz.
And I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.
All quarantined.
All strapped in my suit.
Pressure suit's all pressured up.
Yeah.
It's here.
It's here.

The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.
Waiting for the moment.
The final countdown.
And that's where we're at.
Just hours away from the final hour.
The final minute.
The final second.
Ex-day.
Thought it'd never get here.
It's kind of late now.
We're there.
There's nothing else to do.
Just sit, look out the window, and wait for the light.
Is your pleasure ship hovering above, waiting for the final hours to pass?
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for you somewhere in Eurasia blue?
Mine is.
We'll see you.
Goodbye mom.
Goodbye dad.
I gotta go into space.
I gotta go into space.
It's a long way.

there was major disappointment and there was general electric
oh there i i you thought you were gonna refer to the guy's erection again

Just like a penguin in bondage, boy.
You know, on X-Day,
Negi will return to us all
the greatest tapes that we ever recorded,
which he has been keeping in.
Praise the Negi.
Oh, God, that's so good.
Negi has been keeping all of our lost recordings
in a special vault.
Oh, yeah.
Those will all be returned to us on X-Day.
Oh, that's so glorious.
Chris Jayner will get his 8mm films back.
Oh.
You know, your first show will come back.
Actually, I never did lose anything.
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?
As long as you saw them, Bill.
Things that, I mean,
things that were male-
Everything I've ever seen.
You know, that you never got around to looking at.
Uh-huh.
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second.
What about events that I never taped that never were taped?
There's a thing called the...
What?
What?
This is too damn confusing.
I'm getting out of here.
...will then be done.
They will have been done.
When you want to do a wonderful new show,
that show will materialize in your hand as it takes.
Yeah, the new program.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
Oh.
The hair escaping from your face.
The hair escaping from my teeth.
My hair.
My hair.







My hair are safe.
If you don't do a job well, cut in half.

I'm at Ardiel in Texas.
That is just like you.
The world's largest oceanح
For example.
America's biggest ocean means a little shaved ice.
Everything's cool, right?
I don't know how to end that hug.




A UFO man is sekesah-
She said we got the thôiah, so we're the same.
There would be nobody...
Hello, everybody.
illegal liquor, but forced to drink
alien substances which made them
levitate. This reports
Alien Smegma
Pie.
That'd be hilarious. The Secret Service
agents, pretty soon they'll be
by the end of the night, they're
Jim Bay Cowboys banging on drums
and the two Bush daughters are
dancing naked around the fire.
They've still got their sunglasses and suits on, but they're like
got weird hippie-like
hair on and headbands and stuff.
Like a 1960s
movie about the president's analyst
or something. All of a sudden, yeah, there's the Bush daughters
naked around the fire
doing the bonobo dance.
I'll be like the wicked Russian agent
right next to him. Comrade
Sweetcake, you must come to my country.
I will give you such a lovely tractor.
Please, come to my tent.
I will show you the way.
I have plenty of reading
material and vodka.
We will discuss politics and smoke black
cigarettes. That's right,
friends, starting July 5th at
Brushwood. The Bush Girls
at X Day. 4X
Day. They're going to be calling it
Bushwood this year and that's not all.
You'll get a little sniffle.
Bushwood, oh God.
Bush daughters in the hot tub.
It's a way of getting
back to all the slack you had when you were
a little kid. Remember when you were a little
kid and you'd be able to just sit there with your
little plastic soldiers? You'd create a whole
fantasy world around you.
This is it.
We've created our own fantasy world
around us. You know, that's what
religion's for, right? To create a fantasy world.
But we live our fantasy world out.
We don't wait until we die.
There's something about a fantasy world.
I am
spread wide for the
final ride because
the X's are coming fast
and you are too.
They didn't take us seriously last time.
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.
Didn't take God's prophecy
seriously. But this time we've
learned our lesson.
We can't rely on invisible
monsters from outer space.
We can't even rely on Bob.
We have to learn
how to escape Earth
without being dependent
on the conspiracy or any
extraterrestrials or salesmen.
Sure, send in your 30 bucks
but
build your own ship.
Yeah! You may not have
to, but just recover your ass.
Build your own ship.
Even better than my
hangar entertainer, Area 51
or Cape Canaveral or
Studio 54 and
steal your own ship.
Ah, yes.
Extract
your own fuel.
And while you're at it, friends, let's
swab the deck on the
spaceship that we're already stuck together
on. We're already riding on it.
And it's in bad shape.
And it's high time we cleaned it up.
Earth!
We must
get off!
Whether we leave it or leave it
a cinder. Whether we blow
it off or blow it up, just
don't blow it, friends.
Regrettable.
The society has chosen suicide.
Tell me how.
Tell me how.
Tell me how.
Tell me how.
I, too, felt a brief surge of racial
bigotry.
I, too, felt a brief surge of racial
bigotry.
I, too, felt a brief surge of racial
bigotry. Most distasteful.
I find your arguments strewn with gaping effects in logic.
You are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the Amoeba.
In a month, you'll have as much in common with us as we've had with a ship full of white mice.
They could reach out and swap their ship as over a clock.
If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.
Not white as we know it at all.
For the first time in my life, I was happy.
Friends XX Day was a wonderful success.
I'm so happy.
I wish that you could see the slides and videotapes that I've got in my pocket right now.
Where's Dave?
You know, we've gotten famous for beautiful naked women and other mutants.
Butants, we call them actually, at these subgenius beauty contests and wrestling events.
Rocket launching, acid jazz disco, funkadelic...
Destructo parties.
And there were more of each and they all were prettier than last year.
And we had a prom, a lovely mutant prom, friends.
You know, we, a lot of us subgeni, either don't remember our proms or wish we didn't or didn't even go.
And this year it was like a twist.
We turned the tables.
It was the exact opposite.
It was a funhouse mirror image of the high school from hell.
It was all the geeks and weirdos outnumbered the normals and populars so much that there were none.
They were completely ostracized to the point where there was nothing but ostracized weirdos and geeks having a party, man.
Oh, yes.
With Glenn Miller songs like any prom should have.
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll
In the air there was a ship a rare ship an XF ship with the ship in the air
The air through the smoke the smoke from the top of the front of the pipe of the pipe of the grid of the grid of the bomb
Popped down in the saucer roll
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll
Brown brown the slap Phil Bob, the Bob down in the saucer roll
And in that shift there was a Bob
A rare changes that I love.
Bob J.R. Bob Dobbs.
With a bob on the ship and the ship in the air and the air through the smoke and the smoke from the prop and the prop and the pipe and the pipe and the grin and the grin and the bob.
Bob Dobbs in the Sosaro!
Sosaro!
With me, ship me.
Don't let me sleep that night.
Don't let me sleep that night.
July 5th.
Yeah.
This year.
Go second.
I'm gonna break the sea into the other side.
I'm gonna break free of the suicide.
From the valley.
I hear the muckle cry.
It's all in poor sheeple that we left behind.
And I don't wanna sleep no more.
Don't close the door.
Over me.
Over me.
Over me.
Are you gonna be?
Are you gonna be there, children?
Are you gonna be there July 5th at that magical place, Russia?
Will you be there to see the battle of unforgettable?
Will you be there to see the blood wrestling?
Will you be there to see the rocket launching?
Yeah, will you be there when the pleasure ship's coming down?
Yeah.
Take us all away.
0.



I mean, It's no.
How�'m I going on to answer that?
Beginning.
