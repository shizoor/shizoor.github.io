1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen?

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,220
I know what's coming.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,280
Have I got to beat you to make you understand?

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,360
It's...

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,320
The Super Genius Powerful Slug Genius!

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,060
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,580
That much I know.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,820
Why does the word ties remind us of a slender thread that can't be broken?

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,500
A tiny, thin thing that actually tugs and pulls like a huge mortar line.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm sorry, I feel obstructed.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,620
As tough and as thick as monofilament line, you can't break it with your hands.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,300
You must be talking about that invisible soul connector

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,200
that so many nutcases have written about over the years.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,120
Like the umbilical line of ectoplasm that connects seekers

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,800
with the soul of the soul.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:54,800


17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,520
The spirit world.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,440
Or the line from every seeker's wallet that connects us,

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,220
the Church of the Super Genius, with magnetism.

20
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,740
That reminds me of a costume at the Uncostume Ball at X-Day.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
I saw that.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,380
That's true.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,300
There was the Uncostume Ball.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,300
Now that doesn't mean that people are wearing no costume at all

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,280
and walking around...

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,300
Oh, well, yes it does.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,660
In the case of these two girls,

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,500
because this is what Stang is thinking of,

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,200
they were connected.

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,180
Unclothed bodies were connected with strands of twine,

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,900
one of which went to the navel,

32
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,300
and the other which is not describable on family-style radio.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,920
Once again, angelic pubic hairs and demonic pubic hairs.

34
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,080
Angelic enough looking.

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,280
I like them.

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,160
I thought they were nice.

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,520
Two girls who had an umbilical cord on and nothing else.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,540
Yeah.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,040
It was beautiful.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,620
Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,140
Dude, what kind of pedophile are you?

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,960
They still got the umbilical cord in them?

43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,560
They're adults.

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,460
And you find that interesting?

45
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,860
I don't know.

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,360
They're adults.

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,080
They were well past 18, but they still had this cord.

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,620
In fact, I'll tell you this right now.

49
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,000
I tried.

50
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,880
I helped attach it in one case.

51
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, I was right there.

52
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,820
They wanted my help.

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
They always want your help.

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,140
They always want Dr. House.

55
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,960
That's because they know I will help and not just stand there saying,

56
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,580
They know you'll prescribe any damn drug there is to get your job.

57
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,760
They are half the women at X-Day run up to Dr. House.

58
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,980
Oh, draw Cthulhu on my breast.

59
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,180
Oh, draw Frankenstein on my breast.

60
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,660
That's because I bring pens.

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,520
That's your secret.

62
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,780
You know, if you simply...

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,520
The fact that you have some choice.

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,600
These things don't happen out of, you know, happenstance.

65
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,560
Under that sheepskin, you're a ravening wolf.

66
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,760
I, uh, this sheepskin is an accredited diploma from a major university.

67
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, uh, we're all losing our colors right now.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Not enough for our listeners.

69
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,740
You may not know.

70
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,220
What is the true meaning of Bob is a head of his time?

71
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,660
He is, in fact, a head of his time.

72
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,600
And we'd use that slogan a lot more except somebody else beat us to it with their head.

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,300
And time is necessary to sustain the head from nanosecond to nanosecond.

74
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,480
Each pulsating dot floats on the stream of time.

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,780
And as time changes from time to time,

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,020
the head changes, but remains basically the same.

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,400
No teeth, no ears, one huge middle proboscis, three eyes, big, big, big, big, gigantic titties.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,580
Speak for yourself, Dave.

79
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,940
I'm not sure you're seeing the same head all the rest of us see.

80
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,700
Dave, Dave, Dave, we're not talking about your mirror, Daddy-O.

81
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,620
He has an unusual and intimate relation with the Dobbs head, which others can only envy.

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,700
And my mirror.

83
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
I go in.

84
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,900
I come back out.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
Hiding in the mirror.

86
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,820
The secret mirror world.

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,960
The mirror world where everyone goes to X-Day every year,

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,300
and every year everything stays the same because every fucking one of you doesn't believe.

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
That's why you're still here.

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,160
Look around.

91
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,920
Are there people here who weren't here?

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,260
Or are there people who weren't here who are here?

93
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,000
See, they were ruptured.

94
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,200
They, they, they, mm-hmm, yeah.

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,920
Pastor Craig said that he suspected that the X,

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,620
that the sexists had not come yet because we weren't having enough sex.

97
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,980
So therefore he told me that I should tell all the subgeniuses that sex is now a sin in the church

98
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,600
and you're not to do sex anymore.

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,040
This, we figured, was the only way to get them to actually start having sex, is forbid the act of sex.

100
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,520
So as you have announced that.

101
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,520
Motomec announced it via Bullhorn earlier.

102
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,980
Motomec has announced that sex is now forbidden at, in subgenius.

103
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:52,980


104
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:52,980


105
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,380
So kids, I think you know what to do.

106
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,040
We need more little subgeniuses.

107
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,840
You know, I couldn't show the slides of my grandson.

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,720
I've been wanting to show everybody.

109
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,880
I've got over 4,000 pictures.

110
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,040
Oh, well, all right.

111
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
But he has a beaver-shaped head, Stan.

112
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,960
Actually, I just said that to torture all the child haters here.

113
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,240
It's, it's sad.

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,460
It's like in that movie, Idiocracy.

115
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,300
The ones that could possibly raise a child properly won't do it because they're afraid they can't.

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,960
And the ones who can't, they're not going to be able to raise a child properly.

117
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:22,960


118
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:22,960


119
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,940
The ones who never even think about it have 40 kids.

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,800
That's me.

121
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,420
I need a maglev device to raise my kids.

122
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,780
There will be no shortage of Stangs nor Smiths.

123
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,500
You'll notice in the coming years, especially Smiths.

124
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,820
A terrifying fact about the world of the future.

125
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,960
And about the etymology and the evolution of Bob himself.

126
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,280
There was little Stangalina.

127
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,540
There was Stangovsky.

128
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,460
There was Stangoff.

129
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,560
Bob and the Seven Dwarfs.

130
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,260
That was one of the fairy tales we didn't get to.

131
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,860
And kids.

132
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,760
Kid Stanky.

133
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,760
He was cute.

134
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,060
He only had one eye too, right?

135
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, but you know when he grew up, his life was hell.

136
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,140
He became a drug addict.

137
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,080
When he was little Stanky, you know, that was the best time of his life.

138
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,140
He was beloved by Americans.

139
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,220
Like so many child stars.

140
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,560
Don't these extra days remind you of the Little Rascals, friends?

141
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,680
Those old Little Rascals shows where they put on a play to raise money for the orphanage.

142
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,900
I've got a mustache.

143
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,120
I could be the old man.

144
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,840
I could be the old man.

145
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


146
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


147
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


148
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


149
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


150
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


151
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:22,840


152
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,360
Copyright fire sign.

153
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,580
Ya, thank you, girl.

154
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,360
I noticed Dr. Leguim is dressed up for the beach.

155
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,780
As a woman.

156
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,800
For this genius beach party.

157
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,920
In a beautiful bikini.

158
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,060
His version of a girly girl.

159
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,420
And it's true, actually, Dave, I don't think you were told the schedule.

160
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,920
But at 4 o'clock, everybody jumps into the pool of blood up there and gets Bob-tized.

161
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,580
I just want to ask you.

162
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,280
briefly are you going in to be baptized?

163
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,780
I'm not sure

164
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,380
that I'm worthy but I'd like to be worthy.

165
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,840
You'd like to be baptized. That's wonderful to hear.

166
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,560
And how about yourself?

167
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
Just watching.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,460
Just watching perhaps.

169
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,480
But the idea of having the

170
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,840
concept of your sins washed away

171
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,780
that's better than having the sins washed away

172
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,080
isn't it?

173
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,460
It is. It is. That's what I

174
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,600
kind of thought that too.

175
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,780
And so it'll be the first or maybe or not.

176
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,600
Thank you very much.

177
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,480
What's your name? My name is Raven and this is

178
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,900
Petals.

179
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,960
And you're

180
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,680
Reverend

181
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,780
I'm sorry

182
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,300
and you're going in this for the 20th time you've been

183
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,600
baptized? 20th time.

184
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,420
And there's 20th time.

185
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,080
And how do you feel about it?

186
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm staying here. Could you please?

187
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Reverend Pop-Tart.

188
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,480
This is your 20th time also

189
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,220
right? 20th time.

190
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,840
And just the idea

191
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,880
of your concept or your sins

192
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,300
which is it is getting removed.

193
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,740
I'm sinless.

194
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,960
I'm perfect.

195
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,840
So then the meta concept of

196
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,720
sin. Maybe you're washing it away

197
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,340
or? You're using big words.

198
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,120
Okay.

199
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,820
Yeah well there's I guess there's a lot of it

200
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,680
in there to get if you

201
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,700
want to.

202
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,360
Some human stew.

203
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,540
Are you?

204
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,340
Oh hi. How are you?

205
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,520
Hi. And how are you doing this year?

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,540
I noticed that you were

207
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,740
last year you beat somebody up isn't that correct?

208
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,620
Could you say your name?

209
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,940
Oh Pisces. Yes sir. Reverend Pisces

210
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,640
and you're quite familiar I'm sure

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,000
with this ritual because you've

212
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
actually you were one of the

213
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,420
I forget the word.

214
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,780
I'm a Cognite but I have

215
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,680
a secret which is. Oh that's

216
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,960
what I was trying to get at because I forgot.

217
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,560
The dirty secret is is that

218
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
I've never been baptized.

219
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,740
Okay then.

220
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't think I'm going to because I like my sin.

221
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,980
Oh you're kind of hanging on to it then you don't want to you know don't want to you know leave it somewhere and you know.

222
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,660
I thought that you would have to get rid of it on a regular basis.

223
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,620
But apparently that sin sack is not unlike a stomach on a mammal and it keeps expanding.

224
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,320
If you have more and more sin in it almost infinitely expanding.

225
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,600
Well yeah that's one of the main things about it but you know you've got.

226
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,000
From your many Dobbs Co.

227
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,040
products you can actually remove that and they can exfoliate that sack and they could turn it into a new new sack.

228
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,080
I know I recognize that they would have to at this point staple my sin sack in half.

229
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,560
Oh geez that's a delicate thing.

230
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:50,760
If I was baptized I would yeah with that surgery is a risky surgery but I've stretched my sin sack so large that they might have to actually do a staple kind of deal or so.

231
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,800
it up or something because otherwise it would just be this.

232
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,700
It would be like a broken water balloon.

233
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,820
Oh my God that would be terrible.

234
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,100
Well I don't know if it could be fine I suppose.

235
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,800
Doing that.

236
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,140
No I mean your sin sack at that point you just need to.

237
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Unfortunately the sin sack will not get smaller on its own so I'm just going to have to not lose those sins.

238
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,500
Well it sounds like some of them are having a hard time right now they're actually they're hurting them I don't know what they're they're using those devices.

239
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:20,760
Yeah.

240
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,060
Again or.

241
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:30,340
I don't know if it's the devices or the fact that the pool is set up for a balance between male and female pulled organs.

242
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,020
Not organs organs.

243
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,280
Organs right.

244
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:50,680
And the organs which are part of the orgone process which is has to do with the orgasmic energies of the sexes as explained by Lenny from Hawkwind I think was who explained that.

245
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,440
And Lenny.

246
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,040
Yes.

247
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,680
The guy from Motorhead now is a guitar guitarist kind of guy.

248
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:56,920
Singer.

249
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,860
Is that is actually a guitar now and a singer to their.

250
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:10,420
With he has a mole that might be a guitar I'm not real sure but he was explaining about the Oregon Oregon thing and there's too many male polar energy.

251
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,240
Oh I understand that.

252
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:19,360
And the male polar energy is in that pool or when they're off like that it zaps the participants every so often.

253
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,320
And.

254
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,120
Flashes this thing in front of their eyes that says sausage sausage sausage.

255
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,120
So that's kind of what we're all hoping to do then isn't it.

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,240
You know have those things flashing in our heads.

257
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:40,140
At least most of the time you know because sometimes I guess if it's too much then they'll put you in handcuffs and like shackles and all that.

258
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,500
Like that one time.

259
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,540
But.

260
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,460
Well yeah.

261
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,320
Anyway so.

262
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:45,920
We are.

263
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,380
I'm wondering what's going to happen though if the balance is off in that in that.

264
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,020
Could be big trouble I mean it could explode or something.

265
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,680
Yeah.

266
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,320
It actually could blow up there.

267
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,160
I think I was hoping it wouldn't anyway.

268
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,820
I think I'm glad that I think I'm glad that you're on hand to document you know do the documentation.

269
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,580
Oh yeah.

270
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,160
Of a potential horror.

271
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,880
Reverend saying is yelling now so we better walk over there because he wanted me to make sure I could hear him yelling and so forth.

272
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,380
Yes.

273
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,560
Stand right here.

274
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,820
Out of the way.

275
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,420
Stand over there.

276
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,120
Yeah.

277
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,900
I can smell myself.

278
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,960
Oh it's it's kind of loud in here and I guess.

279
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:35,100
Well it looks like a large large pool full of people and most of them are completely and totally buried naked getting sins take taken off of them.

280
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,220
Oh my God.

281
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,060
Look they're just.

282
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,020
I can't really tell which some of them have more than one.

283
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,280
We have like five limbs whatever that means.

284
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,900
It looks like some kind of new horrible ritual.

285
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm not familiar with this.

286
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,360
Well yeah I know there there is an element of horror in all this for sure.

287
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,120
Some of the people aren't really what you call full blooded humans.

288
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,140
But.

289
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,300
Oh my God.

290
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,960
Well maybe they're going to stop that or gone split.

291
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,320
You know that you were worried about.

292
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
Might be it.

293
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,140
That might just be it.

294
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,480
OK well we'll be right back.

295
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,060
We're here at the baptism and we're going to cut away to a short argument I guess.

296
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,660
I can't remember.

297
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,600
With her.

298
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,020
My.

299
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,280
And the subgenius gang wars are supposed to start up.

300
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,960
It's like it's real blood and the.

301
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,000
Attention gang.

302
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,780
We're going to raid.

303
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,280
We're going to raid the place.

304
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,000
You're going to write a page about.

305
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:42,960
Yeah.

306
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,400
The problem is the Holocaust.

307
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,580
Are the only ones who want to fight the evangelicals.

308
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,180
They're all busy fucking right now.

309
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,340
It's against the rules.

310
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,320
See any evangelicals in here.

311
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,040
I don't.

312
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,260
I'm the only one here.

313
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,200
And that's only because I have to run the equipment.

314
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,620
Do you see any people with that new rule and ran off for a quick.

315
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,460
Oh.

316
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
Well there you go.

317
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,340
Good.

318
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,640
Good.

319
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,400
Then we'll have more little babies here.

320
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,100
Probably.

321
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,100
Yeah.

322
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,920
They'll be scattered on the pond much like the Bodhisattva.

323
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:17,740
Remember him.

324
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,960
He was a funny guy.

325
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,340
There's a.

326
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,160
A genius here.

327
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,820
That's only about.

328
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,280
16 year old.

329
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:21,600
Perfect.

330
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
Five and a half weeks long.

331
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,120
The strange child.

332
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,340
I saw her last night.

333
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,680
She's not quite old enough to be married off yet.

334
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,620
But.

335
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,400
You know.

336
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,640
Give it another couple of weeks.

337
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,220
Not old enough to marry.

338
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,340
Old enough to bury.

339
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,980
That's what my old grandpa Slim used to say before they fried his ass.

340
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,300
Just.

341
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,060
Just his ass.

342
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,520
Of course.

343
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,480
I mean the rest of them still hanging around here someplace.

344
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,960
There he is.

345
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,160
For the love of.

346
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:49,960
Old.

347
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,040
My women like I like my whiskey.

348
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
12 years old and mixed up with coke.

349
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,420
Well.

350
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,240
For those radio listeners who didn't ever heard that.

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,600
Dr.

352
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,500
Legume said he liked his women like he likes his whiskey.

353
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,040
12 years old and mixed up with coke.

354
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,880
No.

355
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,300
Eat over easy with fuzzy ears man.

356
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,620
They grow up so fast.

357
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,420
But not very much.

358
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,340
Unless you have to kill them.

359
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,340
As soon as they grow up.

360
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,560
Because once they grow up they cause trouble.

361
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,720
There's.

362
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,160
On.

363
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,460
A way here for anyone.

364
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,160
We're all headed south somehow.

365
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,180
Dave's.

366
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,900
It was steaming demijohns and flagons of hot job and mug of Merck.

367
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,660
Large.

368
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,340
A manly mug of Merck.

369
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,680
Cream.

370
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,360
Oriental hot cream.

371
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
Would you like a.

372
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,320
Made from.

373
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,820
Agar.

374
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,400
Milk.

375
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,320
Do you want it larded with powder.

376
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,940
I want it lard with American lard.

377
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,920
The kind they used to sell in bitten back.

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,180
In.

379
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,140
1972.

380
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,580
For.

381
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:50,940
Those.

382
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,400
They have is some sort of.

383
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,320
Cherry vanilla.

384
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,160
Supreme almond butter extract.

385
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
Chemical concoction.

386
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,580
But.

387
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
It gets the job done.

388
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,800
Well they removed a large portion of my corpus callosum buddy boy.

389
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,540
So I.

390
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:04,800
Certainly.

391
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,400
Over this.

392
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,580
Arm load.

393
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:06,840
If.

394
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,440
They were.

395
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:07,880
Placed.

396
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,340
With them.

397
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,520
All right.

398
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,720
Dave has an antenna in his head but it only picks up stations from like the 40s.

399
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,200
And.

400
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,000
How he calloused his corpus.

401
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:17,520
And.

402
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,740
And the hurtful stations.

403
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,240
I remember the.

404
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,880
Make you cry.

405
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,740
Nineteen.

406
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,020
Nineteen.

407
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,520
Sixty three I think.

408
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,060
No no.

409
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,300
Wasn't that was named ninety three man was ninety three.

410
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,340
Well the hurtful first album was.

411
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,820
I thought way back.

412
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,560
Back.

413
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,720
In the sixties.

414
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,000
But.

415
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,700
Well that was when they were in dental school.

416
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,340
But when they grew up to be large.

417
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
Well they weren't humans but.

418
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,700
When they grew up that's that's what they became the next version of the hurtfuls.

419
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Well they certainly knew the over drill.

420
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,640
And they were able.

421
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,320
To.

422
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,800
Create.

423
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,660
A career.

424
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,840
Out of it.

425
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,500
And they filled a niche.

426
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
As well as stadiums with angry discontented people.

427
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,580
I think Susie should come up here and dance with us.

428
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,800
Yeah.

429
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,400
Seriously.

430
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,040
I'm serious.

431
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm serious.

432
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,180
Woo.

433
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,600
Woo.

434
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:04,680
Woo.

435
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,580
Woo.

436
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,280
She's far better looking than we are for that camera.

437
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,020
We love you Susie.

438
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,560
Yeah.

439
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,820
Thank you.

440
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah.

441
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,760
She never got tired of wall grandma momum distributed.

442
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:39,760


443
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:39,920
We can installed a bill.

444
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:39,920


445
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,460
Used to live with my dad.

446
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:41,460


447
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,680
Well when everything was great.

448
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:42,680


449
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,100
And to the process.

450
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,100


451
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,120
I was a little scared.

452
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:43,140


453
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,760
That you add me to your roles.

454
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:43,760


455
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:43,760


456
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:43,760


457
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:43,760


458
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:43,760


459
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:43,760


460
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
End of.

461
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,360


462
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,360


463
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,360


464
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,440
You made me.

465
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:45,440


466
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,000
Very happy.

467
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


468
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


469
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000


470
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,140
On the.

471
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,160
Day.

472
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:56,740
Thank you.

473
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Thank you.

474
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,660
Thank you.

475
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,560
Thank you.

476
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,680
Thank you.

477
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,940
Thank you.

478
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,160
Thank you.

479
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,740
Thank you.

480
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
Thank you.

481
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,120
Thank you.

482
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:19,800
Thank you.

483
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
Thank you.

484
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,260
Thank you.

485
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,120
Thank you.

486
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,140
Thank you.

487
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,720
Thank you.

488
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,500
Thank you.

489
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,500


490
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:25,500


491
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,520
Here is theikka Lem Suff volunteering at the Calvary Center for

492
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:32,780
Human Rights, a senior Republican working on an ongoing

493
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
program entitled Human Rights and senate enforcement for

494
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,700
lahi tamamali.

495

rover, a Nearrene같in Burke oheroneathon blessed

496
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,280
Lynnnda 911 by 나와계לч.

497
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,320
We have the privilege of assuming azębrahman and

498
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,480
I'm fully licensed in the state of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Arizona.

499
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,140
We can also pop up the microphones if you have a lighter.

500
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,320
Well, maybe not.

501
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't know.

502
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,860
I could withdraw that offer.

503
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,040
We've got to stay crusty and sharp for the Bobtism, which is coming up very rapidly.

504
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,700
That would be, oh, my goodness.

505
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,380
Look at that.

506
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,880
Oh, my God.

507
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,940
I guess one of them just actually evaporated into thin air.

508
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,560
That's what you call it.

509
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:41,920
We're standing in weird configurations as if they're sort of the configuration, maybe some sort of pattern passing energy.

510
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,520
I don't exactly know what you mean by pattern.

511
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,680
Oh, like an escapee.

512
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,080
Escapee?

513
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,500
Oh, yeah.

514
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,880
They're getting down.

515
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
They're running out the back way there.

516
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,840
And it looks like some of those fully closed security guards are chasing right after them.

517
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,220
I don't know what the deal is with that.

518
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,720
Yeah, they won't get far.

519
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,740
And at least there's no arguments among those being baptized.

520
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,820
They're doing a double check.

521
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,500
It looks like they're trying to confirm who has been done.

522
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,100
So this is not only a baptism, but it's a form of confirmation, right?

523
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,280
Exactly.

524
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,140
Exactly.

525
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,680
Are they going to be giving out them little dobs?

526
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,260
The cookies, you know, with the pipe with the sequins on them?

527
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,980
I don't know.

528
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:31,380
I know that there was a gentleman last night giving out the dobsian communion wafers, but this seems to be only half of the ritual.

529
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,080
Oh, and now they're all, they just drowned one of the participants and they thought it was funny.

530
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,160
Did we drown Pastor Craig again?

531
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,640
Well, no, he's already dead, but we'll try, maybe we'll get another one in there.

532
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,380
Do they recycle the Pastor Craig's, I guess?

533
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:58,380
Well, there's quite a few people in there that look just like him, but I don't know if they're his actual doubles or perhaps even his meta double or...

534
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,580
I have no idea, but if you notice, you can see the marking imprints on several of the backs of the creatures.

535
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh, that's a mutant of some sort.

536
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,240
Look at that mask, will ya?

537
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,480
No, that's his actual face.

538
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,180
Oh!

539
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,400
They really should go to Dockstown.

540
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,240
They can fix that.

541
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:24,140
I don't know what they could do about something like that. He looks like he doesn't have a nose or a mouth.

542
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,140
Well, how do you... I thought part of the process was getting the holy water up your sinus cavities.

543
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,860
Oh, oh, oh, there's a new subject.

544
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,200
Oh yeah, she's a young one, I guess about maybe what, 43, 5, 7 years old?

545
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,340
No, I'm just kidding, she's...

546
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,580
And it looks like that she's being...

547
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,380
A non-sexual Baptist.

548
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,760
Oh!

549
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
I'm smelling it.

550
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,600
Oh, that's so good.

551
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,360
That's so good.

552
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,540
Oh, now that's your Katahdin for every time.

553
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:55,760
Right.

554
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
Katahdin the groom to stop ties to the new Bible.

555
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,960
Yeah, that's the new model they put out for the Cronyites.

556
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,200
Oh, oh my God, he's put his finger in her eye.

557
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,720
What the heck?

558
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,380
Well, that must be part of it, and she seems fine now.

559
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,840
Albeit with only one eye.

560
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,360
Oh, no, this is too much.

561
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,620
Confession, we got confession, we got all your, you know, everything.

562
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,820
He's been baptized.

563
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,720
He's been baptized.

564
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,700
And there's a polite applause, they're taking most of his body parts out of the pool now, I guess, to assemble him later.

565
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,640
Oh, right.

566
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,140
Yeah!

567
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,260
Get off!

568
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,820
Well, I guess they gave him the hoof her wings, right?

569
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,220
Yeah.

570
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,100
But he's such a good sport of all.

571
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,600
Yeah.

572
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,500
Now people are making this sign of the pipe on his head.

573
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,600
Oh, Dr. Dark, he's gonna...

574
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,040
Dr. Dark!

575
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,640
Steve, you made it finally!

576
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,780
God bless you.

577
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,900
God bless you too.

578
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,720
He's gonna explain, I guess, about the organ thing so the pool doesn't blow up.

579
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,100
Could you say a bit about that?

580
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,820
Exponential existential nausea.

581
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,480
Void were prohibited, but it's essential.

582
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,540
Aesthetic void ahead.

583
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,400
I got things, I gotta do some things, see, some things that I've never done before.

584
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,400
Now, do you understand what he's talking about?

585
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
No, I do not, and there...

586
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,740
See, like another confession and then an outburst of some kind.

587
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,980
Some form of water miking is necessary.

588
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,180
You've heard of water miking.

589
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,100
Here we need water miking.

590
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,840
Ah, well, I thought the pool would be some form of acoustic generator.

591
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,120
Well, that's part of it later.

592
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,980
But it's not torture though.

593
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,540
Can you water miking while waterboarding them?

594
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,040
Well, it depends.

595
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,040
Yes, you can if you do it on porpoise.

596
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,300
You put the mic on the porpoise, put the porpoise in the water.

597
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,100
It's very important to take the mic where the bubble is.

598
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,460
Could you explain what just happened?

599
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,900
Yeah, someone bubbled a confession while being waterboarded because they saw Dr. Lagoume's test.

600
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,500
You could see the rats melting and washing off.

601
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
Oh, there you go then.

602
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,580
See, I asked someone who knows, you know.

603
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,260
I've never been naked.

604
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,360
This man, this fellow right here is getting baptized, but he said he's never been naked in his life.

605
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,560
And I don't want to be.

606
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,540
You want to keep those sins then, right?

607
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,480
You want to keep them right where you can look at them?

608
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,500
Grandma, I keep them warm and cozy.

609
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,060
To be fair, this man has a bigger sin sack than me.

610
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,220
And that's what's happened.

611
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,900
I'm going to release my sins on the escape vessels.

612
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
All at once.

613
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,520
All at once.

614
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,940
Just like those 747s.

615
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,740
They too have purged their fuel.

616
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,360
And right now there's a bunch of purging of sins going on.

617
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,820
I can see them on there floating on the top of the water.

618
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,700
It looks like someone's exhalation in here.

619
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,640
It's sort of as if they covered glitter on the top.

620
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,580
Well, we don't have to worry about the blue bloods drowning.

621
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,760
Susie the floozy's probably been baptized numerous times.

622
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,020
Her breasts alone neutralized 12 males.

623
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,420
And that's what's happened.

624
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,560
We got her good on that one.

625
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,720
She was in some sort of epileptic tizzy that involved the bouncing of the breasts.

626
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,120
And he saved her life just now in front of all of us.

627
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,400
That certainly is something.

628
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,400
It was such a sight and life-saving moment.

629
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,380
Could have been real tragic.

630
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,360
Everybody is.

631
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,040
Yes, but he saved her life.

632
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,480
Thank you.

633
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:10,680
Thank you.

634
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,680


635
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,680


636
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,680


637
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,680


638
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,680


639
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,680


640
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,160
Susie the floozy.

641
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,040
And your soul, too, by getting rid of whatever it could have been.

642
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,580
Well, we're going to have to ask Susie what it was like there.

643
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,060
She's kind of a luminary of the iglesia, so to speak.

644
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,780
And this is probably her maybe 300th.

645
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,780
How many times have you been baptized, Susie the floozy?

646
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,880
Not nearly enough.

647
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,940
I'm still so steeped in sin.

648
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,720
Look at me.

649
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,980
I'm like tea-stained dentures.

650
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
You can't wash it off of me.

651
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah, it just won't come off unless you really get in there and, you know.

652
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,680
Well, I'm kind of like...

653
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,180
I'm like China, you know.

654
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,220
I had a nice, nice sheeny surface, but it's crazed.

655
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,800
And when things get crazed, stuff soaks in.

656
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,520
Oh, yeah, so you're saying like you're like a cracked cup or something.

657
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,900
I bet that's got...

658
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,000
It's all in my crack.

659
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,180
Oh, hey.

660
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,800
Yeah, I don't know what to make of that, but...

661
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,480
I think it's time to...

662
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,020
You should probably check with the victims.

663
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,760
I mean...

664
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,020
Well, there are quite a few of them, too.

665
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,600
And we'll have to check on...

666
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,320
And I'm going to have to run and check on any victims who have run away.

667
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,720
Yeah, I have to go and put my socks in hot water.

668
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,280
So I guess that's about partially it from...

669
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,460
Yeah.

670
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,380
Absolutely.

671
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,860
It's good to work with you on this.

672
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,240
Nice working with you, Helen.

673
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,320
Or I mean, Pisces.

674
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:27,860
I'm sorry.

675
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,180
I use your other fake name.

676
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,560
You've had a number of co-hosts over the years.

677
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,340
Yes, and I...

678
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,360
You know, one time I was blind for a while there after the, you know, the explosion.

679
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,860
But at least you had a good, you know, background on the whole event.

680
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,340
You know, with that upside-down Dobbs head in the back of my eyeball,

681
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,200
I tend to be able to see the emanations on people and things.

682
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,940
For example, Dr. Lagume here, you notice you can see the changes that happen from being in that water.

683
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,380
Yep.

684
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,060
Yep.

685
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,000
Much like yourself.

686
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,160
I mean, you pulled through fine, and so did you.

687
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,240
Absolutely.

688
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,960
It's been a real treat.

689
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,100
I don't know if that's the right word, but...

690
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,380
Absolutely, it has.

691
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,340
And I hope you enjoy your sock necessity.

692
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,740
And I am going to wander off and take care of my employment.

693
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,440
You know, it sounds like I peed myself, but I didn't.

694
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,320
Being an employee of Bob, I'm often called to the cause.

695
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,600
Well, we'll keep you on call.

696
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,760
We've got your cell right here, and if you want to phone in one, we'll be right back with you.

697
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:26,440
Absolutely.

698
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:26,940
Thank you.

699
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,360
Thank you.

700
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,800
Well, that was a rather bogus report.

701
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:38,020
If you ask me, a rather truncated, shortened report from what was really going on here.

702
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,340
But I guess that's the best they can do with the editing.

703
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,060
They've got...

704
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,640
And then you'll want to stick around for the continuation of the auction.

705
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,760
The fabulous auction, which only got started yesterday, and will roll on through this evening,

706
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,720
starting around 7 p.m., following the gang war, which follows the Bobtism.

707
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,960
Now that you have had your sins cleansed, be aware.

708
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:15,020
At 6.30 tonight, Reverend Angry Larry will be performing a mass wedding.

709
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,320
A shorter per mark.

710
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,220
Also an announcement for the Blue Lady Cafe.

711
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,260
You can all agree.

712
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,500
The Blue Lady Cafe will just fall out of my family tree.

713
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,560
Until 10.

714
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,380
They will be open as long as people come and buy stuff there.

715
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,920
And I ain't no lame-ass motor man.

716
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,800
Shh.

717
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,820
Sucking dick on the corner for a fistful of cracks.

718
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,940
More gangs coming.

719
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,140
Gang.

720
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,060
Well, what's the other gang besides your gang, my dear?

721
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:48,900
There's other gangs.

722
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,780
Everybody's supposed to form their own gang.

723
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,100
I can tell you, every evangelical is standing right here.

724
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,160
Get him!

725
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,060
I don't think there's really a whole lot of gang warring.

726
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,780
I don't want to be in the war at all.

727
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm not a warring type.

728
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,200
I'd rather eat and sleep.

729
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,900
Well, I know.

730
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,540
I'd rather videotape if there's going to be something like that.

731
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,500
I'm not going to eat and sleep until I...

732
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,420
I mean, I can eat and sleep when I'm dead, you know.

733
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,860
Or sleep, anyway.

734
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:27,140
Now, the gang war, what we want to do tonight is make sure that those people who are fully licensed to carry planks and other orbitures

735
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:32,540
and don't take off their clothing before they begin the gang fight, it may confuse some of the gangies.

736
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,660
And also, we need a few umpires, a couple referees.

737
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,640
And also, some people with guns.

738
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,400
Anybody out there carrying maybe a Tek-9, 5?

739
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,040
Okay.

740
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,100
There is a gun.

741
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,100
There's the head referee right there.

742
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:54,440
The short duration shotgun wedding was supposed to be or will be performed at some time today, rather.

743
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,440
That is one scheduled event that's going to take place.

744
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:07,380
And there's going to be a lot of unendurable crying, a lot of ringing of hands, and pails of feet.

745
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,940
Okay, everyone's got like five minutes to find out who they're going to marry or what they're going to marry.

746
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,480
I'm going to marry in a chair.

747
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,820
Because it's comfy as all day now.

748
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,340
What? Oh yeah, your chair.

749
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,540
You better bring that up here, man.

750
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,320
Like right here.

751
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,080
Sit right there.

752
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,940
They don't expect that they're going to get laid even if they get married.

753
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,220
Oh no, this is a you will get laid marriage.

754
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,960
You have to.

755
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,020
You have to.

756
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,860
Okay, step right up.

757
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,940
Can you feel this?

758
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:37,940


759
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,100
Feel the spirit.

760
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,820
Can I get a fucking praise bob?

761
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,120
Praise Bob!

762
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't get in the way.

763
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,560
Don't let her ask.

764
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,200
Praise Junitani.

765
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,460
Now, put your hands on one another.

766
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,080
Everyone's pretty much doing that already.

767
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,880
Better be careful.

768
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,400
That's how babies are born.

769
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,560
This is a bond of sub-holy wedlock.

770
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,960
So no matter what physical position these beloved may take in the next 24 hours,

771
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,020
their moral standing,

772
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,780
shall remain upright.

773
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,280
So, if there are any jealous losers here who believe that this marriage should not take place,

774
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,640
not even in a short duration fashion,

775
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,500
you know what, nevermind, we don't fucking hear about that.

776
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,860
Now, put your hands on each other.

777
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,100
Hold on real tight.

778
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,920
Do you, man and or object, take this woman and or object to be your lawful wedded wife?

779
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:37,920


780
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,020
In short duration sub-genius matrimony, to have and to hold,

781
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,680
in fact, to do just about anything it fucking wishes?

782
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,780
For a period of 24 hours,

783
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,660
for richer, for poorer, sickness and kinkiness,

784
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,680
through any hardship that may befall in the next 24 hours,

785
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,560
say I do.

786
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,480
I do!

787
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,920
By the authority vested in me by J.R. Bob Dobson,

788
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,340
in defiance of laws and states of nature,

789
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,980
I now pronounce you man and or object and wife and or object for the next 24 hours.

790
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,780
Now you must kiss one another.

791
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
I, I, oh, okay.

792
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,340
You are now duly authorized and excused for sexual couplings of any perverse unspeakable kind

793
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,680
for a period of 24 hours starting now.

794
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,240
If you don't,

795
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,320
you will make a mockery of the sacred institution of marriage,

796
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,140
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

797
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:38,920
It is done!

798
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,200
A man and a woman, praise Bob!

799
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,280
Inhale, party!

800
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,940
Wailing and gnashing of mandibles.

801
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,160
I think the shotgun wedding happens during the Bobby Awards.

802
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,600
It's one of the awards.

803
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,420
All right, yes, so stay tuned for the Bobby Awards.

804
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,980
All the more reason to go to that glamour fest,

805
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,500
which will occur on the day of X-Day itself.

806
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,320
Yeah, that'll be on my escape vessel, too.

807
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,000
Tomorrow at 4.

808
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,380
Well, who asked, how is Babby formed?

809
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,040
That was during the Ask Dr. Hal show part that we had yesterday.

810
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,420
That was one of the questions that came to my desk.

811
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,500
How is Babby formed?

812
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,280
What's, what's Babby?

813
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
I thought it was, uh...

814
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,820
Bonnie Day?

815
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,820
I took it as, how is Babby formed?

816
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,440
Well, that's your interpretation.

817
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,720
How about this one?

818
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,300
How, how, how, how's Babby, how, how, how, how's Babby?

819
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,720
I thought that's, uh...

820
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,440
I expected you wanted a demonstration, right?

821
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,660
Well, see me after the show.

822
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,460
All right, well, now we're getting somewhere with a concrete response.

823
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:46,940
I can...

824
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,880
Yeah, we give sex education.

825
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,500
Heavy, weighted, freighted.

826
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,840
And what kind of...

827
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,260
I'm a grandpa, so I know all about that kind of stuff.

828
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,720
What, what do you teach the kids in sex education?

829
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,620
Not to do it in front of grandma.

830
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,400
I thought that was not to do it in front of an adultery,

831
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
because that was adultery.

832
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,480
adultery. Yeah, I actually had to tell my son, now, son, that's a private thing, and don't do

833
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,260
that in front of grown-ups, and especially not Ma-Mamie. And he said, and a little time went by,

834
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,760
let go of his dick for a minute, and then he goes, dad, would you leave so I can continue with my

835
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:32,260
private stuff? I said, no, you're going to have to wait just like I did. Well, child-rearing,

836
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:38,900
you can tell who's been through it. And everyone who has actually had a child is an adult, but

837
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:45,780
everyone who has not had a child is eternally a child. Let's keep that straight. Well, some

838
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,780
children have had adults two or three at a time, I guess. Nowadays, things have changed so much,

839
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:57,760
so rapidly as we approach. The child is father to the man. And sometimes, in one zygote, he pulls

840
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,760
off the machinery, right? That's what you're trying to say to me? Well, something?

841
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,040
All right.

842
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:08,240
On that TV show, Lost, the child literally is the father to the man. I think every character is

843
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,160
going to find out that they're their own parents. That's better than being your own grandpa.

844
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,680
That's my theory about that show. Everybody is everybody else's parents,

845
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,880
and Miles is going to adopt himself. What a nightmarishly claustrophobic setup.

846
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,500
Yeah. Speaking of becoming a dad, have any of you ever noticed the phrase,

847
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,660
when you're looking at cute girls, cute derriere, and some guys will go,

848
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,220
huh?

849
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,620
Hey, look at those wind gates.

850
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Wind gates?

851
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,480
I hadn't heard that one before.

852
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,740
Wind gates?

853
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,600
Check out the mud flaps on that baby.

854
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,500
Sometimes the wind gates are all chained shut.

855
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,960
Sometimes.

856
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,240
Man, that's some lug nuts on that dude.

857
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,620
On those double wides.

858
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,120
Check the carburetor on her neck.

859
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,900
All right, let's bring it down to a...

860
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:02,020
Okay, we have to start wrapping this up because we have to jump in the pool. I have to jump in the pool,

861
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,000
and help wash away the concept of sin from these folks.

862
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,440
See, Dr. Legume's getting ready. Okay.

863
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,260
He was just smiling at the concept of sin.

864
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,420
Stop on my recording.

865
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,780
Oh, this is...

866
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,740
Are they getting out of the water?

867
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,520
Anybody else will.

868
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,920
They're going around in circles now.

869
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,400
Oh, they're not supposed to do that.

870
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,700
No, they like broke the pool one time.

871
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,220
Okay, now there appears to be some trouble brewing.

872
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,640
Ah.

873
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:39,140
It's gone so well so far. You know, everything was just absolutely perfect, and then all of a sudden,

874
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,000
some of the younger, wilder crew decided to...

875
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,420
I would have to have some major, major soul surgery, and it won't work.

876
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,000
You know what it's like.

877
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,960
Well, you know.

878
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,360
You need a laser aura piercing.

879
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,940
Remember Tater Gumfreeze has got that going for him there.

880
00:41:59,240 --> 00:41:59,360
Yeah.

881
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,120
But doesn't that leak out the...

882
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,620
Yeah.

883
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,740
The saintly and the sin...

884
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,180
You know, I don't know.

885
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:11,940
I didn't read through to the end of those posts, but he's got it all worked out with quantum mechanics and everything.

886
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,460
Well, you see, it depends on the source of interface.

887
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:24,380
If you just, you know, if you're just ramming it right through like the forehead or something, yeah, you're going to have saint stuff, sin stuff, and all sorts of weird goo going out everywhere.

888
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,860
You have to hit just the right spot in order for the sin fluid to leak out.

889
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,920
No.

890
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,800
I was explaining that I don't do that because of my...

891
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,920
I don't want to lose the sin.

892
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,360
You want to keep the sin.

893
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,580
Because my sin sac has stretched out so bad.

894
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,160
Oh.

895
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,940
And then it would be kind of like a mammalian stomach, and you'd have to staple it.

896
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,420
But in getting that done, there's only like three guys who do it.

897
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,580
One of them is Philodruman, I think, actually does that surgery.

898
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,580
And then the guy in Zurich that you mentioned.

899
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,620
Yeah, the guy in Zurich, and Bob himself.

900
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,080
And I don't know if I trust any of them for that surgery.

901
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,220
It's probably not covered either.

902
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:13,080
Oh, it's never covered. It doesn't... your deductible will not handle your sin sac stapling.

903
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,340
It never happens. It never does.

904
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,520
Not even the good plants?

905
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:27,060
No, no, no. You know, Lord Swath over there had like the premium of Dobbsian psychic surgery plans, and they told him no as well.

906
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:27,400
Oh.

907
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:38,480
But ironically, those two, like Stang and a few others who were on the sort of Dobbs-provided retirement health care plan...

908
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,740
The senatorial type plan.

909
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,540
Yeah, that particular soul care plan will cover it.

910
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:44,980
There it is.

911
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:52,460
Which is why you see so many older subgeni walking around with an empty and well-formed sin sac.

912
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,600
Like a walnut.

913
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,540
Right.

914
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,320
Versus the young ones.

915
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:00,580
Their sin sacs are all stretched out. It's sort of an opposite situation.

916
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,640
Or an acorn.

917
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:12,780
Well, I think, I guess they were trying to describe the eggy-like mass that develops some of these...

918
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,740
Yeah, they don't seem to mind... I'm sorry, I've got to get back to this.

919
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,440
Well, we can't talk about it much further. That's the problem.

920
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,120
It's just, there's not much... there's things that certain, you know...

921
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,020
Mr. Sister and I share knowledge that...

922
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,080
That shouldn't probably be out there.

923
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,540
No, not at all.

924
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,000
I just didn't want to have to get back to this.

925
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,920
You shouldn't repeat these things to others unless you... they know it already.

926
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,400
So it's kind of a... is it like a catechism or something you've got to learn, you've got to buckle down and study?

927
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,720
It's a secret knowledge. Whether it's a walnut or an acorn, you know, this is private.

928
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:55,480
Sometimes it's just a seed, but sometimes it's many seeds put in the acorn.

929
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,220
Yes, there can be stones in the acorn.

930
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,560
Sometimes the walnut will hold many, many, many seeds of knowledge.

931
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,000
This is true. And you drain your sin out of your walnut so that...

932
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,320
Right.

933
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,940
The seeds can...

934
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,120
Right, so that...

935
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,520
Germinate.

936
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,420
What they do.

937
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,600
Right, right, because as seeds of sin...

938
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,680
I understand that in certain subgenius types and models that they will even come out on their own.

939
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,600
With no...

940
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,460
Sometimes at night you will release your sins.

941
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,180
Right, right, right. And this doesn't happen to the Kaniyite model.

942
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,960
Well, see this is a mystery of the Kaniyites that we just don't understand.

943
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:48,060
We suspect that they have the joy without the release, however.

944
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,300
Praise the mafia.

945
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:53,780
Actually, I'm not so sure I'd agree with that. I mean, there is some evidence that...

946
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,480
It's universal in all models. You know, I mean, it's...

947
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,700
You're talking about the sin sack? Is there...

948
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,780
Is it in all quantum... Jeez, everywhere?

949
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,700
Oh, yes. The world is one big sin sack if you think about it.

950
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:13,060
I never thought of it that way. That's an erudite thought, you know, if there ever was one for crying out loud.

951
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,140
They were announcing the war, I believe they were just announcing. The spontaneous battle.

952
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,880
Seven o'clock will be the continuation...

953
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,500
Just notice...

954
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,560
Now that we've got our acorn and walnuts back, we're able to go into battle.

955
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,280
Pat your nuts together, eh? They're all in one place.

956
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,840
Yeah, yeah.

957
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:40,920
Just took the work of... You have to have two people involved and your nuts and acorns will sort themselves out, but you do need two models.

958
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:51,740
What do you think about those South American doctors that were not trained in the United States or Malaysia?

959
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,100
They're not trained in the United States.

960
00:46:54,100 --> 00:47:01,920
Oh, I would not actually trust that for any... There's two surgeries that you really only want to do with a professional, as I think a few of us here are familiar.

961
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:11,080
One is soul snipping when you have a little too much soul. That's a very delicate surgery that you don't want to hand over to some Argentinian hack.

962
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,720
The other one would be, again, this sin sack stapling, as I discussed.

963
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,380
I think that should only be done by a true trustworthy professional.

964
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,340
Or really bad things can happen like leakage, burning...

965
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,500
Itching, I suppose. Psychic itching at least.

966
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:44,840
Yeah, and if there's a leak in the sin sack, it can sometimes become disaffected, which can cause, again, as you and I both have talked about in previous, it was a swelling and things like that.

967
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,620
Yeah, you don't want your sack to become disillusioned, I suppose.

968
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,500
No.

969
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,360
I've heard that the sin sack...

970
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,740
The sin sack cannot become infected because it's already full of bad stuff.

971
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,320
Well, I think Reverend Paisley's already...

972
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:03,240
It was disaffected. It becomes disaffected. You're right, it could not become infected. It can become disaffected.

973
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:18,640
The worst thing that can happen is there will be often a soul or space gas buildup if for some reason there is a non-sin or saintly goes into the sin sack, something of a saintly nature.

974
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:27,260
And the sin sack will start to expand with a sort of space or soul gas, which usually just typically leads to flatulence.

975
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,060
See, you do.

976
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,860
Well, that doesn't sound good.

977
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:39,640
Can't you clear that up with like an infusion of sea monkeys, though? I hear they eat that kind of material when it's introduced to the system in such a way.

978
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,080
Well, that's an interesting idea.

979
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:47,600
I don't know. I haven't had any experience with that. Mr. Sister has been an expert in some of this and he may have some experience.

980
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,420
Well, there are...

981
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,400
There are some subgenii who have tried to use peen worms to eat up the sin.

982
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,040
Peen worms?

983
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah, and they... It just simply... Well, it's tragic what has happened.

984
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,760
What's a peen worm?

985
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:11,080
Well, it's best left to the imagination what that might be, but you see it's a worm that will go into the sin sack and they thought it would suck the sin.

986
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,220
Oh, yeah.

987
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,540
But instead it, you know...

988
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,280
Like the maggots back in your old days.

989
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,420
Yeah, it's just...

990
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,420
The leeches.

991
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:17,520
Yeah.

992
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:24,380
You know, it's just... It creeps you out in the first place, but it's been proven to be ineffective.

993
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:37,860
There's just a small tribe of subgenii in Luxembourg that... They hang around in caves and they stay away from all slack and they maintain that it works, but they're hideously deformed.

994
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:38,680
Yeah.

995
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,760
So, a simple...

996
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,000
Thank Dobbs for that, you know.

997
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,200
A simple baptism is all you need to get the same thing.

998
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,280
One wipe does it all, I guess, you know.

999
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:56,340
That's right, because, you know, in Luxembourg, you just don't go out in tubs of water because they're only maybe three weeks a year when they're not frozen.

1000
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,520
Well, I mean, it's probably expensive beer or something.

1001
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,380
Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,280
Water's very expensive.

1003
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,280
The prince, you know, maintains ironclad control over the water in the tubs.

1004
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,140
Hi.

1005
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,500
How are you?

1006
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,780
Oh, we were just talking...

1007
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,040
I'm fine.

1008
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,220
We were talking about...

1009
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,300
You didn't get your sins washed away now, did you?

1010
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,320
I didn't.

1011
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,180
What is it?

1012
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,540
It's just a microphone.

1013
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,060
It's asking you if you...

1014
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,200
You didn't get...

1015
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,820
No, they weren't washed away?

1016
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,360
You were going to taste me.

1017
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,240
Yeah, right.

1018
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,000
Like, I know where you live.

1019
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,100
You were in my physics class.

1020
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:35,660
Well, that was one thing, I guess, that it took care of.

1021
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,140
How about...

1022
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:36,640
Did you...

1023
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,240
No, I didn't get baptized.

1024
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,400
So, you wanted to keep your sins, too?

1025
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,220
I love my sins.

1026
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,360
There's another one, just another one who loves her sins.

1027
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm not sure.

1028
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,300
I'm not sure.

1029
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1030
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1031
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1032
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1033
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1034
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1035
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1036
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1037
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,480
I don't know.

1038
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:46,480


1039
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:46,880
I'm ashamed of them.

1040
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,620
Are you going to polish them up or keep them in a special place of any kind?

1041
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,360
I'm going to let them collect for a while.

1042
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,380
I haven't made up my mind yet.

1043
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,100
I'm saving mine up for a new car.

1044
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,440
Well, I guess that's a good way of looking at it.

1045
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,280
You know, get a new car and...

1046
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,120
But then, someday soon, then, you're going to try it, though, right?

1047
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,040
I'll do it.

1048
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:05,480
Yeah.

1049
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:05,960
Hold on.

1050
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,100
Let's see.

1051
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,160
I forgot what I was...

1052
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,940
Did you get your...

1053
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,680
Excuse me, sir.

1054
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,740
Did you get your sins washed...

1055
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,600
The concept of your sins erased.

1056
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,280
I did so against the law, sir.

1057
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:16,780
It's my will.

1058
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,280
So he was forced into it, and you refused?

1059
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,180
I just let him be forced into it, though, yeah.

1060
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,700
And you refused also?

1061
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,060
I didn't refuse.

1062
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,500
I just, you know, slacked off and watched instead of jumping in the pool.

1063
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,860
Now, when they gouged out that poor little girl's eye, did you see that, any of you?

1064
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,400
I was really excited about it.

1065
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,800
She had it coming.

1066
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,540
She had it coming.

1067
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,740
While they were calling her, you dirty little brat, one was trying to drown her, I guess.

1068
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,800
Do you still think it's all right?

1069
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,880
She needed to find Bob, and, you know, whatever it takes, however long.

1070
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,800
That sounds a little stern to me, but do you agree with that?

1071
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,100
Why not?

1072
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,660
Well, there you go.

1073
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:03,320
Three out of five say it was a good thing that happened to that poor child there, but I guess when the—

1074
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,160
I'm sorry, sir.

1075
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,160
They should make a law.

1076
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,140
Well, there you go.

1077
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,080
And maybe they already did.

1078
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,780
Did you have anything to say about it?

1079
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,960
Praise Bob.

1080
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,800
Praise Bob is all I—well.

1081
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:22,560
These are the denizens, and they seem to enjoy what they're doing.

1082
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:29,600
They seem to be happy, not alarmed by anything.

1083
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:38,400
That baptism, you know, I've done baptisms 14 times—baptisms 14 times now.

1084
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,720
And this one was the closest to plumper heaven I've ever done.

1085
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,020
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,100
And Dr. Leguien was kindly.

1087
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:54,740
Now, he, of course, being the world's smartest subgenius, placed himself at the entrance so he could baptize the girls as they came into the pool.

1088
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:03,020
Nonetheless, he was merciful and allowed me to double baptize the ones that he knew were the double girls.

1089
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,940
Well, I was imagining that what was happening is, is you were taking the time to ask the questions.

1090
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,420
He was just kind of going by, do you—yeah, okay, slam, and then go to the next one.

1091
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,460
And he was, like, ripping them out real quick, and then you were over there still, like—

1092
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,900
Doing the master's.

1093
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,880
Oh, I try to remember.

1094
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,820
Remember their names and have a special gag for each one.

1095
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,360
Last year, I remembered all the names except Reverend Venus Envy, which you'd think somebody would remember.

1096
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,280
Yeah, Chaz was in a band called Venus Envy.

1097
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:38,900
But we have strayed so far away from where we were trying to bring back the good news, the happy word from X-Day,

1098
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:43,100
the word that we weren't all fried to a crisp out there, and neither was anybody else.

1099
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,720
And Ivan Stang has some—

1100
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:56,660
Well, I guess I took it off.

1101
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,900
I'm talking about Dinosaur.

1102
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,220
Yeah, if you want to ramp up with some new revelations.

1103
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,340
Well, it's not so much that.

1104
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,520
We just had a fabulous X-Day.

1105
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,580
The turnout was great, as usual.

1106
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,040
There were about five people from this city.

1107
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,860
And everybody else was—

1108
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:20,640
Everybody else came from other countries or San Francisco or—

1109
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:21,980
Oh, God, there were people.

1110
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,620
There were two from Alabama.

1111
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,220
And nice guys, too.

1112
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,060
Yeah, yeah.

1113
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,100
Absolutely straight-up nice guys.

1114
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,000
What about the Uruguayans, you guys who met them, of course?

1115
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,080
Because of the loud noise.

1116
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,040
Well, nobody could understand their accent.

1117
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,700
But they were friendly, and they were generous with their thoughts.

1118
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,080
There were people from Uruguay there.

1119
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,980
They were from Uruguay, and they hipped us to this salsa thing that we began the show with.

1120
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:45,520
Man, I—

1121
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,140
And then they found a four-leaf clover within the first hour they were there.

1122
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:55,440
I'm looking over a four-leaf clover that I've overlooked before.

1123
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,060
One thing I should say about this last X-Day.

1124
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,920
It was the coldest, rainiest one yet.

1125
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:10,400
And which only served to draw the newcomers, the shy subgeniuses, together for shelter.

1126
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,280
Is that snow? It's freezing out in here.

1127
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,260
It actually was bitter.

1128
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,340
It was bitter cold on July 5th at 6.30 in the morning.

1129
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,520
It was the day the earth froze.

1130
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,620
And it was rainy and horrible for the first three days, and yet—

1131
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,560
And whiny and horrible.

1132
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,380
Oh, it wasn't whiny, though.

1133
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,280
Everybody had to, you know, made the best of it.

1134
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,800
As we know that it's going to be terrible weather at least one day at X-Day,

1135
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:45,400
and we felt rather honored to have three days of dreadful, horrible, freezing, drizzling rain.

1136
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,960
It was good weather to be back in bed in, you know, and all snug and tucked away.

1137
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:56,620
Well, we had to, instead of the drive-in bad films, we watched them indoors in this big studio.

1138
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,880
We saw Robot Monster, for one.

1139
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,780
I must, and yet I cannot.

1140
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,320
Our subgenius classic.

1141
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,900
And we saw—

1142
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,460
And we had Jiffy Pop.

1143
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,940
That's right. I hadn't smelled Jiffy Pop in a long time.

1144
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,180
See, they don't go for their microwave ovens and that other modernistic grepple.

1145
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:14,800
They have—

1146
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,220
You hold it over the fire and it pops up.

1147
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,480
Now, what do they call them?

1148
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,620
There was a subgenius gang war.

1149
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:24,280
He used Iconoclast or Luddite or—no, what is it?

1150
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,140
A Jiffy Pop fan.

1151
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,160
A Jiffy Popper.

1152
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,460
But there was a subgenius gang war.

1153
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,400
And I could hear distant detonations going on all the time.

1154
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:41,720
Well, the thing is that what we discovered about the subgenius gang wars is that every subgenius is its own gang.

1155
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,180
And so what you ended up with was—

1156
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:52,660
A field of a couple of dozen youths squirting each other wildly with squirt guns loaded with—

1157
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,840
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

1158
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,840
Ha, ha, ha.

1159
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,680
I'm just picking on everybody.

1160
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,800
Is your squirt gun a poison sprayer?

1161
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,300
Which one has the hydrogen fluoride?

1162
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,480
We'll find out.

1163
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,320
The goons has got DDT.

1164
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,000
Now, one set of squirt guns—

1165
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,680
Hal and I had—

1166
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,800
Had secretly loaded with Yellow Jacket Wasp Attractant.

1167
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,520
Now that it's all over, we can admit this.

1168
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,940
Yeah, the other squirt guns had Yellow Jacket Wasp Repellent.

1169
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,980
So had the subgeniuses been able to organize, one team could have won.

1170
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:36,120
But as it turned out, everybody was covered with both juices, and it evened out.

1171
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:44,440
It's too bad I left my notes, because I could tell you just what Yellow Jackets were attracted, but my notes I don't have with me.

1172
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,820
Well, did it work on paper wasps, only on Yellow Jacket Wasps?

1173
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:54,920
Yes, but there are many different varieties of Yellow Jackets, which can be found even in a single area.

1174
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,140
And you tell this by the abdominal markings.

1175
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,680
But as I said, I don't have my notes, but I've got them at home.

1176
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,480
Speaking of abdominal markings, you've been listening to the underbelly of Cleveland Radio.

1177
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,120
Oh, excuse me, let me button this up.

1178
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,060
WCSB Cleveland.

1179
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,580
Never saw those ones before.

1180
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,440
We are out of time.

1181
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,560
We are completely out of time.

1182
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:13,380
Cat carried away.

1183
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,780
Oh, that's all right.

1184
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:14,780


1185
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:14,780


1186
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:14,780


1187
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,300
Holy number.

1188
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,340
Rocknard and Dave, I want to thank you for calling in.

1189
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,360
All right, thank you very much, Dr. Howell.

1190
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,120
Thank you, Reverend Stang.

1191
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,120
Thank you, Princess Lee.

1192
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,260
I thank you, Dr. Sinister, for letting us have these two hours of yours.

1193
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,760
The pleasure was all mine.

1194
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,860
And your post-X Day extravaganza.

1195
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,040
He was just smiling at the concept of sin.

1196
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,460
I thought you were going to stop the meta-concept of sin.

1197
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:40,880
Shut up!

1198
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,260
Okay.

1199
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,780
And now this brings to end this version of...

1200
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,180
The Hour of Slack.

1201
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,340
Part 29.

1202
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,000
We move...

1203
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,160
They're always so happy when it's over.

1204
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,300
Have you noticed that?

1205
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,020
That's when they laugh and applaud and get big smiles.

1206
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,540
They laugh and applaud.

1207
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Well, okay.

1208
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,780
Bob saved my life with his uncanny ability.

1209
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,300
You and Bob must have imagined it.

1210
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,160
For Pete's sake.

1211
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,180
Come on, Bob.

1212
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,100
Good night.

1213
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,540
Good night.

1214
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:14,780
Good night.

1215
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:14,780


1216
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:14,780


1217
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,040
Good night.

1218
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:18,500
Sorry for anyone who's a friend of...

1219
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:18,660
What?

00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,420
