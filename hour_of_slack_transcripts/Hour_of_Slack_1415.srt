00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,660
To process the magnanimity that is Korok, for your simpler minds, we have translated the following images into a format that we think that you will find more familiar.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,880
I believe in your world they are called cartoons.

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,780
Oh, Bobby, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,920
What happened?

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,500
Everything gets wrecked.

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,540
Everything.

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,740
Bobby?

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,760
We have three good candidates in here today.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,660
We have Fluffy, Skipper, and Bob.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,860
And with any luck, one of those will come at you at full speed.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,720
Fluffy, Skipper, Bob, gee, with names like that, it must be the subgenius.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,200
Our old swag.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,080
This is the Slag World Cup.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
This is the Slag World Cup.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,880
This is the Slag World Cup.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,980
This is the Slag World Cup.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,700
This is the Slag World Cup.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,100
This is the Slag World Cup.

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,020
These are the calling cards of a con artist.

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,360
Whatever happened to Bob?

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,820
We could revive the lost arts of con.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,360
Panko!

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,100
Oh, Bobby.

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,460
I know right where she's at right now.

27
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,720
All right, listen, Bobby.

28
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,380
Just head right for where she's at.

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,880
Tell me on the radio, let's boogie.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,000
Eh, I'm really more of a slacker.

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,060
You've even foiled Bob on five separate occasions, and he's a genius.

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,600
Oh, Bob.

33
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,940
Everybody in here is so crazy about Bob.

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,920
Slug.

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,600
Everybody in here is so crazy about Bob.

36
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,500
Everybody in here is so crazy about Bob.

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,240
Everybody in here is so crazy about Bob.

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,160
Eternal salvation, or triple your money back.

39
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,520
All of the religions will be having a heart attack.

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,100
A pipe full of froth equals what?

41
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,960
A lot of slack, no matter how you kill it.

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,340
He always keeps coming back.

43
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,720
Bob.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,420
I'm talking about Dobbs.

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,860
Repent quickly.

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:56,900
Repent quickly.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,300
Get your job and slack off.

48
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,480
Get ready to blast off.

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,380
When that state comes and all the geeks are on the run from Bob.

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,820
Bob.

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,600
Bob.

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,880
Bob.

53
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,300
Bob.

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,700
Bob.

55
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,200
Bob.

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:12,720


57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,840
Bob.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,620
Bob.

59
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,100
Bob.

60
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,240
Bob.

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,420
Bob.

62
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:15,760
Bob.

63
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,280
Bob.

64
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,520
Bob.

65
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,020
Bob.

66
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,440
Bob.

67
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:17,620
Bob.

68
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:17,640
Bob.

69
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,220
Bob.

70
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,000
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,380
Start to realize what till now has been disguised.

72
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,440
Keep looking to disguise.

73
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,700
That the sauce is flying by.

74
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,600
And maybe by and by.

75
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,500
You will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs.

76
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,380
Bob Dobbs.

77
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,780
Talking about the salesman.

78
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,700
To the gods.

79
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
He's still a chattel coffin lid.

80
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,660
On a conspiracy of normality.

81
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,820
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

82
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,220
Bob.

83
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,140
Bob.

84
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,340
Bob.

85
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,360
Bob.

86
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:48,940
Bob.

87
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Bob.

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,300
Bob.

89
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Bob.

90
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,080
Bob.

91
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,500
Bob.

92
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,780
Bob.

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:54,780


94
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:54,780


95
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:54,780


96
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:54,840
Bob.

97
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,420
Bob.

98
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,420


99
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,420


100
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:08,200
Oh, Bob.

101
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,320
Saw the dots blanket Emilel's

102
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,720
By Samック

103
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:13,720


104
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,480
Lab

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,360
The race became the banger and the fool became the wise

106
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,860
Cause it's a way out, far out

107
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,960
Psychedelic freak out, took a hit of Bob

108
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,380
I'm starting to freak out, geek out

109
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,920
My friends are gonna leak out

110
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,040
Look out everyone, here he comes

111
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,700
It's Bob

112
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,080
I wish you could forget

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,560
I wish you could forget

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,100
I wish you could forget

115
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,300
I wish you could forget

116
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,420
I wish you could forget

117
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,440
I wish you could forget

118
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,460
I wish you could forget

119
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,660
You wish you could forget

120
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,120
You wish you could forget

121
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,140
So crazy about vai

122
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:32,040
It's so crazy about your ba da da pa

123
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,940
Please

124
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,220
so crazy about va

125
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,620
simmer

126
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,960
ND

127
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
Oh, Bob.

128
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,080
Bob.

129
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,960
I've been slacking off.

130
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,960
Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella, Bucky Dent,

131
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,280
Billy Martin, Dallas Green, Dick Houser,

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,260
Bill Verdon, Billy Martin, Stump Merrill,

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,680
Billy Martin, Bob Lemon,

134
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,100
Billy Martin, Bob Lemon, Gene Michael,

135
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,060
Buck Schultz.

136
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,520
Oh, you didn't hear that from me.

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,000
So how did your date work out with the mysterious pony?

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,140
I am telling you, this woman is strange.

139
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,040
She never wants to leave the apartment.

140
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,860
Ready for lunch?

141
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,420
I'm stuck here editing the stupid catalog

142
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,680
because of stupid Bob.

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,980
Listen, there's something really suspicious about this guy.

144
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,700
Every time Mr. tries to assign him any work,

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
he says he can't hear,

146
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,180
and it all gets dumped on me.

147
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,460
You think he's faking?

148
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,900
I don't know, but I'd like to try that earpiece on,

149
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,580
see if it's real.

150
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,820
Bob, you know what?

151
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,040
Um, I'm kind of swamped here.

152
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,980
You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalog?

153
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,980
I'm kind of swamped.

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,240
Swamped.

155
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,700
Did you see that?

156
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,960
Did you see that?

157
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,760
That was him?

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,180
Yes.

159
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,700
Somehow I thought he'd be taller.

160
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,360
All right, listen.

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
We'll have to do this again some other time, okay?

162
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,580
I got a lot of work to do.

163
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,120
Hey, Bob.

164
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,620
Bob?

165
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,080
Hey, Bobby, over here.

166
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,120
Bob.

167
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,120
Oh, Bob.

168
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,440
Bob.

169
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,360
Oh, my God.

170
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,900
He's dead.

171
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:12,880
He's dead.

172
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,160
Yeah, this is Connie.

173
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,060
You gotta help me.

174
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,840
Some guy dropped dead on top of me.

175
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,020
I can't call the cops.

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,740
I can't.

177
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,260
I'm stuck.

178
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,720
You gotta help me.

179
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,140
I think I've been working you a little too hard lately.

180
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,760
Oh.

181
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,660
So I have two tickets.

182
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,480
For you to the Bob show.

183
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,020
Oh.

184
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,520
It is a real hoot.

185
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,820
Oh, thank you, Mr. Emmerty.

186
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,260
Oh, thank you, Mr. Emmerty.

187
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
Oh, thank you, Mr. Emmerty.

188
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,120
Oh, thank you, Mr. Emmerty.

189
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,400


190
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,900
Oh, the tickets are for tonight, so you and Bob can knock off a little early so you both

191
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,440
can get ready.

192
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,180
There's no need to deny it.

193
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,820
I heard every word you said.

194
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,860
And I know you wouldn't be just having fun with this handicap.

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,580
Ooh, that kind of cruelty would be grounds for dismissal.

196
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,160
Oh, God, what happened to you?

197
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,620
She tried to kill me.

198
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,000
Who?

199
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,520
Connie.

200
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,500
What did she do?

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
I don't know.

202
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,820
But I woke up in the Hudson River in a sack.

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,620
I think she drugged me.

204
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,720
But she's a murderer, and I'm calling the cops.

205
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Why would she try and kill you?

206
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,420
Oh, isn't it obvious?

207
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,500
She doesn't want anybody else to have me.

208
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,660
Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?

209
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,380
Bob.

210
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,560
I want you so bad, Bob.

211
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,320
You turn me on so much.

212
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,000
You're so damn sexy.

213
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
Oh, I'm starting to unbutton.

214
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,440
Anything getting through, Bob?

215
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,040
No.

216
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,500
Try not to dawdle, Amos.

217
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,640
Oh, honey, don't worry.

218
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll be gone before you know I'm back.

219
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,540
And for goodness sake, don't forget the bread for the sandwiches.

220
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,600
Oh, they'd be awfully messy if I did.

221
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,340
More like a hand sandwich than a ham sandwich.

222
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,640
Oh, yeah.

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,860
I was just picturing our guests trying to eat without bread.

224
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,580
Oh, that would be funny.

225
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,820
Well, Sarah, I think the guests of the Longhead Bay Inn have come to realize that zany humor is just a pleasant bedfellow to their clean soap.

226
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,940
Or napkin.

227
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,740
Yes, Mr. Funny Funny Man.

228
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,840
Well, don't have so much humor that you forget to come home.

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Now, watch.

230
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,960
I'll be trying to think up jokes about being late.

231
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,900
Oh.

232
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,620
Oh, I forgot.

233
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll be back in a minute.

234
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,560


235
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,400
I'll just get my bed.

236
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,400


237
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,400


238
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,860
I'm gonna have to go to work.

239
00:08:59,860 --> 00:08:59,860


240
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,800
See you later, Bob.

241
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,740
Bye-bye, Bob.

242
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


243
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


244
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


245
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


246
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


247
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


248
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


249
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


250
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


251
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


252
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,740


253
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,540
We're back.

254
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,540


255
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,540


256
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,540


257
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,540


258
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,420
I think I got a very good idea.

259
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,640
I think I got a good idea.

260
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:07,640


261
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Cause when your forehead's screaming, it isn't really you.

262
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:28,380
That barren plain of madwood, smack on the front of your head.

263
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,120
Smack on the front of your head.

264
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:39,620
Between your face and hairline, like a sandwich cloaked in bread.

265
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,220
Foreheads have a place upon your face.

266
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,560
It's all just part of the human race.

267
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,980
But you're not dreaming, your forehead's screaming.

268
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,020
It's screaming.

269
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,560
That we're really all from outer space.

270
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:13,480
Our hearts and heads are different in their respective means.

271
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,300
In their respective means.

272
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:24,700
Decisions can't be awkward unless our forehead leads.

273
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,660
Some may say.

274
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,480
In this world.

275
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,620
But I say it's wrinkled and flawed.

276
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,980
I say it's twisted.

277
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,240
I say it's smarter than our brains.

278
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,360
Smarter than our brains.

279
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,040
Unlikely.

280
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,720
Unlikely.

281
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,600
Though they talk.

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,500
People call it bra.

283
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm not your heart.

284
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,400
It can have no.

285
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Have no.

286
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,400
Sin.

287
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,780
No.

288
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:58,780


289
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,540
But wouldn't our love.

290
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,840
Just push and shove.

291
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,240
Just push and shove.

292
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,940
Until love no head.

293
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,440
Sets us free.

294
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,780
Now some may say.

295
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
It is furrowed, furrowed.

296
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,100
But I say it's wrinkled in thought.

297
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,400
It's smarter than our brain.

298
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,660
It is unlike.

299
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,060
We have all.

300
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,360
We have all.

301
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,540
Been taught.

302
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,460
We have all been taught.

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,200
Trail of the screaming forehead.

304
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,080
What can a body do?

305
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,320
Pause when your forehead's screaming.

306
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,300
Is screaming.

307
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,940
Screaming.

308
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,580
I.

309
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,260
Love.

310
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,260


311
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,600
I. Love.

312
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,200
You.

313
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,600
You.

314
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:23,980
And so, in conclusion, we must conclude that it is the human forehead and not the much publicized brain, which is the source of all man's and woman's knowledge.

315
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,580
Bravo, Sheila.

316
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,540
That sounds very real.

317
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,560


318
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,060
And scientific.

319
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,640
Oh, really, Dr. Latham.

320
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
You disappoint me.

321
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,740
How can you be taken in by such drivel?

322
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,360
I don't know.

323
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,380
I just am, I guess.

324
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,620
I take it you disagree with my theories, Dr. Applethorpe?

325
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,980
I not only disagree with them, I think they're insane and wrong.

326
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,500
Might I understand you'll be cutting off my funding?

327
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,520
As head of the department for thinking and thought studying, you leave me no choice.

328
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,140
Really, Dr. Applethorpe?

329
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,480
No, no.

330
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,300
It's all right, Philip.

331
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,580
You see, I understand the good doctor.

332
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,060
Isn't it not about my theories at all, Dr. Applethorpe?

333
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,320
Isn't it because.

334
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,520
I'm a woman?

335
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,700
Don't be absurd.

336
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,960
If a man told me our foreheads were the seat of all human knowledge, I would react exactly

337
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
the same way.

338
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,360
Really?

339
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,420
Really, Dr. Applethorpe?

340
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,860
And what if that man were a woman?

341
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,560
Well, this is insane.

342
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,040
Theophilus the Thistle Sifter sifted six thistles into the thick of his thumb.

343
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:22,600
See therefore that thou and thou siftest thistles, sift not six thistles into the thick of thy

344
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:22,980
thumb.

345
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:23,480
Hm?

346
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,140
Hm?

347
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,180
You sure got a pretty mouth, Dr. Howe.

348
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,500
Yes.

349
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,000
Amidst the mists and coldest frosts, he beats his fists against the post, and still insists

350
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,020
he sees the ghost.

351
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,460
I'm ready for that ghost, because I want to make some cheese, too.

352
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,780
I have a question for Dr. Howe.

353
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,520
Uh, the refrigerator.

354
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,500
Notice I didn't say icebox, and it's a GE turret top.

355
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,400
It's full of tasty stuff, kids.

356
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,700
Oh my God.

357
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,040
The refrigerator is?

358
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:02,940
Uh, it's bulging at the seams with, uh, illegal, uh, uh, food, uh, consumables.

359
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,460
You made me forget my question for Dr. Howe.

360
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
That's all right.

361
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,600
Reach deeply down into memory's well.

362
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,720
There's that sound effect of clunking and crashing that we have often played, because

363
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,680
we intended to all along, from the very beginning of the show.

364
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


365
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


366
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:29,240
It was, uh, it was put into our, uh, special storyboard here, you see.

367
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,240
I can't hear anything.

368
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:37,060
As though some oafish lout overturned, uh, a valuable, vital piece of equipment.

369
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,720
Ah.

370
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,320
Have you ever heard that sound effect from the sound effects record of a body falling

371
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,940
downstairs?

372
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,100
Ever heard that one?

373
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,700
The ka-thumpity, ka-thump-thump?

374
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:46,880
Yeah.

375
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,140
Sure.

376
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,660
My brother made a loop of that and put a beat behind it and, uh, made a nifty, nifty, nifty,

377
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


378
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


379
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:52,660


380
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,780
little tune out of it.

381
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,500
Yes, he did.

382
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,220
Back in the day.

383
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,400
Now I'm not gonna pussyfoot around before I get to telling you about my twelve-module

384
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
course in success in sex and real estate.

385
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:08,860
Oh.

386
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,060
It always gets down to that, to, to, to, to, twelve steps.

387
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,180
Well, I'm quite willing to, to put this educational and amazing message aside, even

388
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,400
though it could affect you personally and change your life for the better.

389
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,660
The day you've heard that sound effect, you've got to get out of here.

390
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


391
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


392
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


393
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


394
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:22,660


395
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,300
You know, I don't know if you've heard of Dr. Howland Owl's course in success in real

396
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,580
estate.

397
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,960
Could be the first day of your new existence.

398
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,700
But if you don't want to hear about it, that's quite all right.

399
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,920
Your privilege as a free American.

400
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:43,620
Well, you know, these events do not put themselves on.

401
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,640
We have to be realistic.

402
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,000
We live in a world of buying, of getting and spending, of financial transactions, whether

403
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,640
capitalism or communism.

404
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,240
The workaday world must go on.

405
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,080
How's your microphone, Dr. Drummond?

406
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,280
Oh, he's coming through just fine.

407
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,300
Ah, yes, like a...

408
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,480
I'm still concerned about the hellest economy.

409
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,560
Like a tiny baby budgie, a canary in a coal mine,

410
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,380
to tell us whether things are going south,

411
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,700
to the land of sorghum and molasses.

412
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,060
I don't know that I hear Dr. Drummond.

413
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,760
Oh, listen, you can hear it now.

414
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,060
Now, the money bird.

415
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,880
Withered little thing.

416
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,480
Yes, but it's flying towards Dr. Hell's real estate.

417
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:31,860
Get away!

418
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,120
Ow!

419
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,100
Ah, nasty little thing.

420
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,300
Well, that's the way I treat all such invaders.

421
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,000
You just stepped on it.

422
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,200
Well, it's not able to...

423
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,180
Its fragile skeleton with hollow bones

424
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,800
is easily intimidated by the weight

425
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,640
of a heavy graviportal individual.

426
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Such as myself.

427
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,100
So, uh, back to, uh,

428
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,320
chewing the cud and...

429
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,400
You know, let's, uh, shoot the, uh, shite

430
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,460
and, um, chew the popcorn.

431
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,440
We'll chew the fat in the kitchen.

432
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,980
Uh, Dr. Hell?

433
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,340
Have a good old chinwag.

434
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,920
Yes, yes, what is it, Dr. Drummond?

435
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,560
I have Philo on mic now.

436
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,360
You want me to turn him down?

437
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,080
Turn him down?

438
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,600
No, he's a brilliant stream

439
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,800
of mind-breaking special effects.

440
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,040
Okay, whatever you'd like.

441
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,280
No, which mic is that?

442
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:21,740
I'll turn it on.

443
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,980
Turn him down.

444
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,160
No, wait, wait.

445
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,280
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

446
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,040
He's gonna go down with the ship.

447
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,980
By God.

448
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,280
Well, uh, we can always, uh,

449
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,080
talk about some...

450
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,980
These ghosts are going down together.

451
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,860
Other time, the, uh, way

452
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,060
my course in success and sex

453
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,300
and real estate can turn you around,

454
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,580
uh, particularly, I will require

455
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,860
that you do this when you receive

456
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,700
the 11th module of hands-on instruction.

457
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,260
But, uh, let's, uh, go back

458
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,360
and discuss something

459
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,220
of an interesting historical,

460
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,720
uh, historical,

461
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,500
or, uh, psychological nature.

462
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Perhaps psycho, uh, historical,

463
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,840
or, uh, psychological, uh, mythological.

464
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,400
Hey, careful, Michael.

465
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,540
Please don't spill any jujube juice

466
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,660
on the b-b-b-board.

467
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,820
They'll be so angry.

468
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,520
If you've been reading the chat stream,

469
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,680
you'll know that no one is allowed

470
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,940
to consume, uh, liquids, solids,

471
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,660
or oxygen in the control booth

472
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,540
during broadcast.

473
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,460
This subgenius must have snacks.

474
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,700
They're a terrible thing.

475
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,620
Hey, that reminds me of snack.

476
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,920
Hey, I just got a message

477
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,820
from Princess Wee.

478
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,760
She made it safely to her home planet,

479
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,880
and she found the, uh,

480
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,400
computer, uh, drive,

481
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,620
the dilithium crystals,

482
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
just where I said they would be.

483
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,400
She found it?

484
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,620
I built it right where I said

485
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,580
they would be.

486
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,740
There I said it again.

487
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,220
I had hidden them there.

488
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,900
You'll pay to know what you really eat.

489
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,720
You'll pay to know what you really eat.

490
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,260
Oh, that's right.

491
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,520
We're coming up with all, uh,

492
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,740
variations and...

493
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,880
Variations...

494
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,800
...on the theme.

495
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,220
Have sex with your beautiful live self.

496
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,060
You'll pay to pull your eyes

497
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,360
over your legs,

498
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,100
which will be on fire at the time.

499
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,500
Um, and you'll do this gladly

500
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,380
in the wonder world of tomorrow.

501
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Pull your eyelids over your own eyes.

502
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,360
All of this in module 12.

503
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,480
That's right.

504
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,940
The culmination, uh,

505
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,340
the climax, as it were,

506
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,240
of the relentless pounding

507
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,600
of the rest of the course.

508
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,020
See, only after you worked out the origins

509
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,220
could you come up with classic variations.

510
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,400
Well, this started when I got a comment

511
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
on some YouTube video

512
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,300
where the guy didn't have much to say.

513
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,940
He just wanted to show that he was

514
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,740
subgenius-friendly,

515
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,300
uh, and he...

516
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,520
his comment was,

517
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,520
pull the wool my own eyes.

518
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,820
Duh!

519
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,660
I hope you sent him a dollar.

520
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,720
All right.

521
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,180
Pull the wool of my own eyes.

522
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,760
And that's what Philo and I were thinking.

523
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,740
Our...

524
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,060
The Bob slogans are a little too long.

525
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,480
Bob's just moving faster,

526
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,380
making everyone else seem slow and stupid.

527
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,560
Why do we need the details?

528
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,040
It's subgenius must have.

529
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,040
That's good enough.

530
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,480
Too much reverb on kindly Reverend Stang.

531
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,920
Too much is not enough.

532
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,520
Can't hear his wisdom.

533
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,020
No, too much is not always better than...

534
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,700
Pull my eyelid over your own eyes.

535
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,460
Not enough.

536
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Eyelids of morning.

537
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,620
The Lord is in his holy temple.

538
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,580
Too much is better.

539
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,160
The Lord's throne is in heaven.

540
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
Subgenius must.

541
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,980
His eyes behold,

542
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,620
his eyelids try the children of men.

543
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,600
That's a new perfume, subgenius must.

544
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,260
The Lord trieth the righteous.

545
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,860
It's kind of thick in here at the moment.

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,100
But the wicked and him that loveth violence

547
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,600
and video games his soul hateth.

548
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,140
The subgenius must have slack.

549
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,820
Upon the wicked he shall pour snares,

550
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,160
fire,

551
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,080
and brimstone,

552
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,160
and a horrible tempest.

553
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,980
This shall be the portion of their cup.

554
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,420
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness.

555
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,660
His countenance doth behold the upright piano.

556
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,280
What is it, Dr. Goldie?

557
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,900
I'd like to help with your posture just one second.

558
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:07,200


559
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,200
Relent.

560
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,140
Get a job.

561
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,600
Forget slack.

562
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,000
Like the sons of Arius.

563
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,160
And invade Poland and annex the Sudetenland.

564
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,140
No longer do I need to.

565
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,140


566
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,000
I bend over in a servile posture to speak into the rectifier.

567
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,980
What is the law?

568
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,000
The laws to not broadcast on two feet.

569
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,220
What hath God wrought?

570
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,800
Um, that's a rhetorical question.

571
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,120
What has God wrought?

572
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah, what's God wrought these days?

573
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,820
What's God wrought these days?

574
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,680
What's God wrought for me lately?

575
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,220
Well, he wrought...

576
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,780
Come on, God, what you wrought?

577
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,980
He's, uh, he's, uh, reeking a shopping center,

578
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,840
replacing Candlestick Park.

579
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,460
All I know is that God's not wroughtin' much around here lately.

580
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,480
He knocked a crane over by the Bay Bridge.

581
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,080
God hath forgotten.

582
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,760
He hideth his face.

583
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,120
He will never see it.

584
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,940
So, Father, could God wrought something that he can't unwrought?

585
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,640
Sure, God can wrought whatever he wants to wrought.

586
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,020
Arise, O Lord.

587
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
But can he unwrought something he wroughted himself?

588
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,780
Yeah, but he's smart enough to know better.

589
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,860
I'm really, really impressed by the new Pope.

590
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,600
Where did you find him?

591
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,420
That little dog?

592
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:19,900
Yeah.

593
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,740
Pope Pero.

594
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,180
He's, uh, he's a little German.

595
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,640
Come on, boy.

596
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,160
He's smart enough to know better, that's why.

597
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:26,840
Yeah, listen to that.

598
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,960
That's Pope Pero.

599
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:36,020
Yes, he, uh, he's actually a Spanish, uh, mutt, a stray, who was owned and raised by,

600
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,460
uh, Reverend Kai Wicker in Germany.

601
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,200
Well, he's just got this darling little accent.

602
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,500
It makes you want to reach down and...

603
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,040
Ow!

604
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,260
He looks so cute.

605
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,400
Ow!

606
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


607
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


608
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


609
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


610
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


611
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


612
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


613
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,400


614
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,560
He's got the crap out of him.

615
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,960
Get off my leg.

616
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,880
Get off my leg.

617
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,420
Woof!

618
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,020
Woof!

619
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,000
Hey, something my leg.

620
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,240
All right, that's disgusting.

621
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,820
Uh, get that animal out of here.

622
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,920
This is a studio for higher beings, uh, for advanced creatures.

623
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
You know, this reminds me, Doctor...

624
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,000
We were trying to be uppity and we...

625
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,480
Once in a time.

626
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:09,940
We were asking...

627
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,180
All canine Americans required to leave the room.

628
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:13,940
...if God wrought.

629
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
All I wanted to know is if God wrought.

630
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:15,920
That's a good idea.

631
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Get him out of here.

632
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,400
Yes, God could create a human being.

633
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,400


634
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,400


635
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,400


636
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,400


637
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,400


638
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,400


639
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,180
He created a ditch so big he couldn't jump over it.

640
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,560
In fact, he did and that is the result.

641
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,600
Uh, I mean, our present predicament is the result.

642
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,760
Well, a ditch too big for God to jump over.

643
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,900
And we left God behind.

644
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,020
Too big to fall in.

645
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,180
Well, we're on the wrong side of that ditch, partner.

646
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,080
We swam across that ditch and left God on the other side.

647
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,720
Ew, it's full of sewerage.

648
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,360
And now God...

649
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,440
We don't have a God no more.

650
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,200
God hath left us.

651
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,160
Flying through a mile of that tunnel.

652
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
I shall not be moved.

653
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,040
I shall not be moved.

654
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,360
I shall not be moved.

655
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,380
I shall not be moved.

656
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,380


657
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,380


658
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,380


659
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,560
I shall never be moved.

660
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:49,560


661
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,020
To break out of subgenius prison.

662
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,400
I shall never be in adversity.

663
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Climb through the sewage to reach the fresh air.

664
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,560
And I forgot my poster of Raquel Welch.

665
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:58,900
Freedom.

666
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,320
And then you realized, oh, no, I left my pocket knife back there.

667
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,940
And God climbed back into that sewer and went to get his body.

668
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,400
The sewer known as the human body.

669
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,960
Yes, God became a blob of glup and entered into the womb of the descendants of an ape.

670
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,340
Yes.

671
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,720
A human woman.

672
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:31,360
And thus it was that God's little son was expelled in a cave over which a crude shelter

673
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,180
had been built.

674
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:38,260
Excuse me, I know this doesn't sound like anything remotely related to having any kind

675
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,720
of sex or real estate.

676
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,280
We need to know the basis to achieve equity in sex and real estate.

677
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,320
One must understand the metaphysical.

678
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Basis.

679
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:58,920
Of the legends which you will use to shift legions of suckers onto your path as valuable

680
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,720
assistants and cannon fodder.

681
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
Well, I don't know.

682
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,060
All I do is, I spent all my money on this real estate and now I can't live on it or

683
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,240
rent it out for six months or else I won't be able to have sex any more.

684
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,760
Well, it's a funny thing about money.

685
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
Money is funny.

686
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,480
Money is given a value which is...

687
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,840
I followed every bit of advice in modules six through eleven.

688
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,320
Well, that's very advanced, Pilgrim, but in module number one, that's where I say that

689
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,700
we give the value to our children.

690
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


691
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


692
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


693
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


694
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


695
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


696
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


697
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


698
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


699
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


700
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


701
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,700


702
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:30,820
It's not just about the value of your money.

703
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,840
It doesn't have value in and of itself.

704
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:38,900
By giving me a significant amount of your money, even a disabling amount, it shows that you

705
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,620
are ready for an exchange of true value.

706
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,120
Let me see that, Michael.

707
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,060
Can you tell us your secret for free, Dr. Howell?

708
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,300
Well, for those who are willing to listen to this program, it doesn't seem to be playing.

709
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,020
There's something the matter with it.

710
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,660
Let's take it out and try it again.

711
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,340
It won't come out.

712
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,600
It seems that it's wadding up inside the machine.

713
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,600
Well, this is unfortunate.

714
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:00,680
It's not a good idea.

715
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,680


716
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,680


717
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,680


718
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,680


719
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,680


720
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,680


721
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:00,880
It's unfortunate.

722
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,100
We do have a digital copy somewhere, but I need somebody who knows how to run it.

723
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,020
Let's look at the screen over here.

724
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,440
Does anybody have a small...

725
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,240
What are those mean people talking about?

726
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,120
Well, somebody wrote old rules for old guys.

727
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,800
I'm not sure I like that.

728
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,820
What else are they saying?

729
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,100
They won't have to worry about getting old, most of them.

730
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,040
Hey, can I see...

731
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,520
These guys are so full of they selves.

732
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,200
Yeah.

733
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,620
And...

734
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,320
Duh.

735
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,320
Old blah blah.

736
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,840
We're doing great, folks.

737
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,680
Old blah blah.

738
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,640
Here's one I like from Mel DeRorah.

739
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,340
What absolute twaddle.

740
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,460
You know, these are great.

741
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,860
We could use them as pull quotes.

742
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,040
Hi, this is Bob.

743
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,540
Yes.

744
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,100
Hi.

745
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:41,780
And...

746
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,540
How you guys doing?

747
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,340
Mel, thank you.

748
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:43,760
Hi.

749
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,820
Yes.

750
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,140
Enjoy your meal, sir.

751
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,280
Good thing I'm hungry.

752
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,520
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask you to raise your glasses to the hero of the hour,

753
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,860
my savior.

754
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,880
Appreciate it.

755
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,360
Greetings and salutations.

756
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,940
I'm Bob.

757
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,280
We met before.

758
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm Bob.

759
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:00,680


760
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,380
Ever so briefly, I was gruffling in fear at the time.

761
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,140
You got the salt over there, Bob?

762
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,540
Salt is not good for you, hence it is illegal.

763
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,440
Thanks, Mom.

764
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,120
Thanks, Bobby.

765
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,180
Thanks, Mom.

766
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,800
Thanks, Bobby.

767
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,840
Thanks, Mom.

768
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,520
Thanks, Bobby.

769
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,540
Thanks, Mom.

770
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,140
Thanks, Bobby.

771
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:18,540
Sure.

772
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,720
Aside from that retard trying to punch me, it was actually pretty good eating.

773
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,000
And then one day my dad said, Bobby, you're 17.

774
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,180
It's time to throw childish things aside.

775
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,340
And I said, okay, pop.

776
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,680
You sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery in your house, huh?

777
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:30,680


778
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:30,680


779
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:30,680


780
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:30,680


781
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,460
Let's turn back.

782
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,540
No, it's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.

783
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,980
But does it have to be in a cemetery?

784
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,500
You would understand.

785
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,840
Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.

786
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,380
But there's so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.

787
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,920
Sure there are, and I've tried them all.

788
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,620
Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.

789
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,660
Now there was a good one, that dog story all about...

790
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,160
But horror stories, why all the time horror stories?

791
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,600
I wrote for years without selling a single word.

792
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,460
My monsters have done well for me.

793
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:17,300
You think I'd give that up just so I could write about trees or dogs or daisies?

794
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,000
Daisies? That's it, I'll write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies.

795
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,980
You want to see what we got her?

796
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,980
I do, I can't wait to see what you got her.

797
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,240
I gotta put the pink stuff in it.

798
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,060
Oh.

799
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:28,680
Oh.

800
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:29,860
Oh.

801
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,740
What's a good photoshoot made of?

802
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:33,720
Shoes,

803
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,220
Barbies,

804
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,760
and beautiful girls.

805
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,140
Photoshoot.

806
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

807
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

808
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,740
I don't know what you're talking about.

809
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

810
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,500
Barbies and I don't know what they are.

811
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,520
And then beautiful girls.

812
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:45,920
That's it.

813
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,580
Well he's an international celebrity really who revolutionized the way the world looks.

814
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,640
If you don't look good, we don't look good.

815
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,520
A multi-million dollar...

816
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,160
International corporation.

817
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,740
Famous for creating the bob and the many many more.

818
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,900
anxiety

819
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,880
high on the ladder

820
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,540
depression pushed down on your bladder

821
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,500
it seems there's no way to attain laughter

822
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:49,040
only results in feeling sadder

823
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,180
and it's fixed to you

824
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,000
like crazy you

825
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm just crazy too

826
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,240
just like crazy you

827
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm just crazy too

828
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,260
I'm just crazy too

829
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,080
just like crazy you

830
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,040
I'm just crazy too

831
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,960
everybody crazy too

832
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,600
crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

833
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,200
high on the ladder

834
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,760
crazy, crazy

835
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,620
The competition and power struggle

836
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,600
It only makes frustration double

837
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,600
Forward intention and backward thinking

838
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,900
Addicted to you and I can't stop drinking

839
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,300
And it sticks to you

840
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Like crazy

841
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm just crazy too

842
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,340
Just like crazy you

843
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,300
I'm just crazy too

844
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,140
Everybody crazy glue

845
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I'm just crazy glue

846
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,200
Just like crazy you

847
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,060
I'm just crazy too

848
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,060
Everybody crazy too

849
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,980
Crazy too

850
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,440
Crazy

851
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,520
Crazy too

852
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,200
Crazy too

853
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,480
I'm just crazy gold

854
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:04,480


855
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm so crazy stuck to you

856
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:19,500
I'm so crazy crazy proper crazy

857
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Now let's close out with the bad guy affirmation.

858
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,840
I am bad, and that's good.

859
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,640
I will never be good, and that's not bad.

860
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,200
There's no one I'd rather be than me.

861
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,320
Okay, gang, see you next week.

862
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,520
Jonathan Livingston Siegel, I'm afraid I can't indulge the chat board.

863
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:09,800
No, we're not going to talk about dispensable Kleenex tissue of the literature of the 70s.

864
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,000
We were talking about the Church of the Subgenius.

865
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
What's the difference?

866
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,300
Because we do not pretend that our work is fiction.

867
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,360
Price Harris.

868
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,860
Oh, come on.

869
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,400
Those people are certain.

870
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,680
They're like the Clampers.

871
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,000
Hey, Larry.

872
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,760
The E. Clampus Vitus characters.

873
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,940
I shouldn't even run them down.

874
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,880
You know, we're all in the religion game.

875
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,180
We're all trying.

876
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,320
No, I was just kidding.

877
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,060
I love my Discordian brothers and sisters.

878
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,560
They don't care if you do or you don't.

879
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,760
That's the problem with them.

880
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,440
You know, I'll tell you.

881
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,440
Well, that's the charming thing about them.

882
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,520
Let me discuss something real that actually is a matter of some concern to me.

883
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:55,660
Oh, what?

884
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,100
Oh.

885
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
I don't know how to resolve.

886
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,920
You know how on Facebook people are always trying to friend you and so forth?

887
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:10,260
Well, in mine, there's an enormous queue of jokers trying to friend me who I've never heard of,

888
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,120
but they've all got gag-like names.

889
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,600
Yeah, they all try to friend me.

890
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,180
It's enormous.

891
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,460
It goes on forever.

892
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,260
You know, like Lee Harvey Wallbanger and that sort of thing.

893
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,400
Some dumb twat.

894
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,560
Yes, exactly.

895
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,100
And many of these characters call themselves J.

896
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,460
R.

897
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,720
Bob Dobbs, and they want to be my friends.

898
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,060
How?

899
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,660
I cannot be the friend of anyone who calls himself J.

900
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,140
R.

901
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,100
Bob Dobbs.

902
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,320
I don't assume here.

903
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:36,880
Absolutely.

904
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,300
Bob Dobbs Jr.

905
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,420
Bob Dobbs Jr.?

906
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:45,280
Well, that's at least better, but a lot of these folks don't even put the quotations on.

907
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,420
What about Little Bobby Dobbs?

908
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,740
They can't spell Bob.

909
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,000
They can't even spell Bob.

910
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,100
I don't wish to muddy the waters, but my God, look at the long line of them.

911
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,760
On the other hand, I could be insulting an army of people.

912
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,120
Good.

913
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,880
Who it would be better were on my side.

914
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,280
Anybody who's such a copycat.

915
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:01,540
J. B.

916
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:01,660
Robby of Dobbs.

917
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
A calico copycat.

918
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,180
Would you?

919
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,960
Well, if they weren't, they'd be starting their own religion, and we'd have to be their

920
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,520
followers.

921
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,800
Well, I.

922
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,860
It seems like you're complaining about the wrong thing.

923
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,720
J. L. Bibb.

924
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,840
Blibbs.

925
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,200
I called up a list of.

926
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,880
I saw that, too.

927
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,000
I've seen, you know, the names are funny.

928
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,580
They'll make you laugh, but I have no idea who any of them are.

929
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,820
The weirdness of everything.

930
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,660
Some dumb guy.

931
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,320
That's a Thai food dish.

932
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:37,240
I called up the list of all the Bob Dobbs on Facebook, and my finger wore out before

933
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,140
I could scroll to the bottom of that list.

934
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,000
It's all your fault.

935
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,480
Well, they are.

936
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,260
They could be an army that would come to your aid.

937
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:45,440
I'm just a clerk.

938
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,240
But on the other hand, you would have to bear their snarky personality.

939
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,340
Oh, my own eyes.

940
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,380
See?

941
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,100
I know all about Bob.

942
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:55,560
I'm just a clerk.

943
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm just a guy.

944
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,680


945
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,680


946
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,680


947
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,680


948
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,680


949
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:55,700
I'm just a guy.

950
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:55,700


951
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:55,700


952
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:55,700


953
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:55,700


954
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,640
My friends, those of us who are higher in the echelons of the Church must bear with temptations

955
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,360
and struggles that the laity, and even the Communicating Members, can scarcely imagine

956
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,780
on their own.

957
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,300
These gods are so full of themselves.

958
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,320
What is God, Rat?

959
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:17,040
They think that if they make some feeble joke that they can be admitted to the empyrean

960
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,420
levels where we despoil with the angels.

961
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,260
They're old.

962
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,580
I'm never going to be like that.

963
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,060
Hoh.

964
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,320
Hoh.

965
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,560
Well, it depends on where your fandom allegiance lies.

966
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,340
To what god of popular culture will you grovel and kowtow?

967
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,520
Will you drink his blood and ceremonially eat of his flesh?

968
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,860
I know mine.

969
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,500
What ridiculous twaddle.

970
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,100
Yeah, they're saying that.

971
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,200
They don't really like our broadcast, so we could talk about something else.

972
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,000
But what about this?

973
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,660
Do you have the nudist Hootie and the Blowfish album?

974
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,920
Nudist Hootie and the Blowfish album?

975
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,040
Yeah, nudist Hootie.

976
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,160
They're trying to get us to come back.

977
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,380
Those guys were made illegal in San Francisco.

978
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,360
I didn't even know they'd released an album.

979
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,760
But at any rate, I'm sure it's full of pictures and well worth a dollar.

980
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,860
No, the Blowfish, of course, being highly poisonous, its music is to be disregarded.

981
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,960
Do the Blowfish still have their clothes on?

982
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,060
They pop them when they inflate their bodies.

983
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,740
I know Hootie probably does.

984
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,280
The front guy's name is Hootie.

985
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Yeah, Hootie?

986
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,660
Menuhin?

987
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,760
Blowfish in the back.

988
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,520
Is there a keyboard that I can type in a comment complete?

989
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,580
Philo's got one.

990
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,080
You can borrow it from Philo and type it in and it'll appear.

991
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,600
Wait a minute.

992
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,720
Philo's the one sending all those messages in.

993
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,520
He's sending a number of them.

994
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,580
He's complaining about himself as he's complaining.

995
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,820
If you want something done, the right way to do it is to do it yourself.

996
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,760
That Philo Drummond is so dull.

997
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,980
He never brings anything interesting to the table.

998
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,400
Well, he does the best he can.

999
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,960
Who's that new asshole?

1000
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,120
He's called the Naked Guy.

1001
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:02,200
But is any of this stuff you can extract and squeeze in the wine press of the gods for your own radio purposes?

1002
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,180
Or is it too random and wandering and incoherent and impotent, weak?

1003
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,920
Stumbling along.

1004
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,940
Lost.

1005
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,720
Hopeless.

1006
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,980
Near death.

1007
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,780
Ready to drop.

1008
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,740
Obsolete.

1009
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,340
You are obsolete.

1010
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,860
Obsolete.

1011
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,380
Kicked by the young people walking up and down.

1012
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:20,380


1013
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,540
Is this newage?

1014
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,040
Just outside.

1015
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,680
Is this music?

1016
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,120
Is this newage music?

1017
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:24,580
Yeah.

1018
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,820
It is, but we'll fix that.

1019
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,040
That pretty much senses one of the main key elements of...

1020
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,020
What is that?

1021
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,860
Sewage rhymes with sewage.

1022
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,780
Yeah, what did...

1023
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,660
You mean Jonathan Livingston's...

1024
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,620
Don't worry.

1025
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,660
Boots, saddles, horses...

1026
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,280
Newage rhymes with sewage.

1027
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,140
I never heard that one before.

1028
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,220
Since 1979.

1029
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,580
You heard it when I said it the first time.

1030
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,380
Oh, right.

1031
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,460
Back in 1979.

1032
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,500
What are you going to call us all sheep?

1033
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,240
Are you going to call everybody else sheeple now?

1034
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,340
And what all of us want to know.

1035
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,700
To show how original you are?

1036
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,640
Are you going to call...

1037
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,960
Let's all name ourselves Garrett Bob Dobbs to show that we really understand that.

1038
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,620
Who threw the overalls at Mrs. Murphy's chowder?

1039
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,140
I'll just call them pink.

1040
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,520
I'll call them pinks like I always have.

1041
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,920
Speak up, pink boy.

1042
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,560
There's a new one.

1043
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,860
Speak.

1044
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,760
Now I'm doing it.

1045
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,880
If it is upon you.

1046
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,360
Incumbent Bob lost to challenger Bob who used to represent Bob.

1047
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,900
It was a rematch.

1048
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,180
That was before a video of an intoxicated Bob hit the internet first.

1049
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,080
And again, the latest incident prompted a...

1050
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,960
That garnered nearly 4,500 church-ch-ch-churchers.

1051
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:36,960
Wab.

1052
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:43,000
Bob and Ak-Mak-Kernel emerged as the top two wub-getters during century January in primary.

1053
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:49,460
Besides personal behavior, a main issue for Bob was a proposed off-reservation casino.

1054
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:58,580
Man at NERCron accused Bob of leaking bits and pieces, but not being fully forthcoming, and what the financial obligations would be.

1055
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:07,900
For his part, Bob said he was doing his best to move from his past as a manufacturing center to his future as a tourist and entertainment destination.

1056
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,500
Unofficial results show Bob beat tourists roughly.

1057
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:22,420
Legal expert says Constitution does not comply with U.S. implausibly denies rolling Noriega Pan Am 103 in Israeli Lizard King Terror Squad.

1058
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,060
I wonder what the hell that's about.

1059
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,840
The FDA does not care about your health.

1060
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,360
CNN is peeing on dead Afghans.

1061
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,800
The FDA is killing you.

1062
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:34,100
Dad punishes Facebook with eight bullets to laptop.

1063
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,620
Fair and balanced.

1064
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,000
Fox News axes freedom.

1065
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,860
No more freedom.

1066
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,480
U.S. officials confirm the bill.

1067
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,780
The FDA is in denial of any covert Western action in Iran.

1068
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,780
And you're not the captain.

1069
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,660
Well, I may not be the captain, but you're not the god.

1070
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:48,980
Good.

1071
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,540
Because I don't want to be the stupid god fucker.

1072
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,480
I'm Bob Bob Bob.

1073
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,020
I'm Bob fucker.

1074
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:56,920
Alright?

1075
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,420
And by the way, Bob told me you offered him the job first.

1076
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,060
Nice to know I was your sloppy seconds.

1077
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,140
You spoke to Bob?

1078
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,220
Yeah, I did.

1079
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,860
I had beers with him last night.

1080
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,740
He's in town for a convention.

1081
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,380
That's it.

1082
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,260
You're done.

1083
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,220
You're done.

1084
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,440
You know what?

1085
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,780
No, wait.

1086
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:11,500


1087
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,340
What wheel?

1088
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,800
The wheel.

1089
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,220
The little hamster wheel that we're all running up to get a taste of your little water thingy.

1090
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,020
Just please approval.

1091
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:18,940
Approval.

1092
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,800
What the hell are you doing?

1093
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,460
It was the legendary Bobby Rush.

1094
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,900
The Bob Rush has real strong roots in the community.

1095
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,060
Bob Rush was, you know, a panth panth panth panth.

1096
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,500
Then he matured.

1097
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,500
That's like when a, matured.

1098
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,920
That's like when a, a guy that took that toughness in the community.

1099
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,520
I've always felt like I needed to earn my way into this family.

1100
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,620
Bobby's giving him the money?

1101
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,640
Give me my money.

1102
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,100
Give me my money.

1103
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,220


1104
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,240
Get it back in business, Bobby.

1105
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,920
And I'm gonna take you down, brother.

1106
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,500
And he gives me this whole spiel, right, about how next in line to his throne.

1107
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,200
He came up with his name?

1108
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,120
The Bobfather.

1109
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:57,760
Really?

1110
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
He said that to you?

1111
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,200
Wow.

1112
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,800
He pulled the same fish on you, didn't he?

1113
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,840
The world's just hamsters on Bob's little wheel.

1114
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,860
His circus of trust, or whatever he calls it.

1115
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,400
Circle of trust.

1116
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:14,140
I had no idea how deep I was in until I stepped away.

1117
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,820
And I'll tell you something.

1118
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,000
Once I got off the treadmill, I'd never been out of here.

1119
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,960
Yes, this is the time for you to articulate.

1120
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,640
What's your beef?

1121
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,300
Why don't you tell the doctors of the air and see how much good it does?

1122
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,360
Why do you guys all talk at the same time?

1123
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,200
Nobody can understand any of that stuff.

1124
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,900
It just totally alienates the audience.

1125
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,840
And then, I'm gonna tell you something.

1126
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,780
It actually alienates me.

1127
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,840
It drives me nuts.

1128
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,140
The Happy Talk Radio.

1129
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm a nut, anyway.

1130
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,680
Well, I'm sorry.

1131
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,760
I don't know what to do except offer my profoundest apologies.

1132
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,320
Just like the McLaughlin Group, the Capital Gang, all our great progenitors, we do tend

1133
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,220
to yell a little bit in the heat of argument.

1134
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,720
Yes, but we could go to a different level, a better level.

1135
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,960
And why not?

1136
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,780
That's interesting music.

1137
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,560
What is that?

1138
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,820
This is the music of Loop Station.

1139
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,320
Robin Coomer singing.

1140
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,240
She was here last time.

1141
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,680
You might have met her.

1142
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,000
She and Spy Emerson were here.

1143
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,260
Oh, okay.

1144
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,180
I never was formally introduced to anybody.

1145
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:31,900
Ah, too bad.

1146
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:39,420
When one does radio, one must stick at the microphone and not get up and circulate about shaking hands.

1147
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,480
And receiving the attention of exquisite beauties.

1148
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,740
What makes these microphones so sticky?

1149
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,560
I'm afraid to touch them again.

1150
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,020
Generations of spitters have spit popped into them.

1151
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,940
Oh, man.

1152
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,040
As we used to say.

1153
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,940
The foam is almost hard with the snot.

1154
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,760
Foam on the range.

1155
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,320
Yes.

1156
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,260
Spitto, spittere, octui, splatus.

1157
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,140
Say it.

1158
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,920
Don't spray it, Dr. Al.

1159
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,100
Look, I'm just saying this is a...

1160
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,300
Came right through that squim screen at me.

1161
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,640
The squim screen?

1162
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:15,320
Yeah.

1163
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,180
Good Lord.

1164
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,580
I didn't realize we were being bombarded by Gleet.

1165
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,340
Now, kids, you can look that up in the dictionary.

1166
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,040
Gleet.

1167
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,980
G-L-E-E-T.

1168
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,860
Or can you?

1169
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,640
I thought it was something Philo made up until I actually encountered it in writing about World War I.

1170
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,320
Yeah.

1171
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:50,360
I think I may have first seen it in a short story about P-Dawg, which used the term anticipatory Gleet.

1172
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:59,440
A droplet of anticipatory Gleet quivered at the tip was the sentence, I believe.

1173
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,180
Yes, I recall that well.

1174
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,920
It was a vivid one.

1175
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,640
Care dog meets P-Bear.

1176
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,100
Was it?

1177
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,300
Oh, that's right.

1178
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,660
I wrote that line.

1179
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,120
That's right.

1180
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,260
No wonder I remembered it for a second.

1181
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,720
At least you remembered that much.

1182
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,520
You drew that, too, didn't you?

1183
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,520
He would remember you.

1184
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,440
That was a great coloring book.

1185
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,920
But you first wrote a version of that in Behold the...

1186
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,540
What was it, the one about the robot with the scepter?

1187
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,900
Oh, yeah, the Scepter of Pretorius.

1188
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:30,760
That was terrible.

1189
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,960
Was it really?

1190
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,300
I was like 18 when I wrote that.

1191
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,080
I redid it to put something in it.

1192
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,880
I subgeniously stuffed in it just...

1193
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,180
I don't know, because otherwise nobody would ever have printed it.

1194
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,200
Now I wish they never had.

1195
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,120
It was one of those famous underground people that I've now forgotten about.

1196
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,200
Peter Wilson, that was it.

1197
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:55,820
They're so talented.

1198
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,680
You want him on his face to get to the top.

1199
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,500
No, let's not go over old...

1200
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,460
Let's try to settle old scores.

1201
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,740
Put on your old baseball cleats and climb on their faces.

1202
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,020
No problem.

1203
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,900
Put on your new bra, look at my bonnet, and...

1204
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,880
The husks. All those editors.

1205
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:12,980
Huh?

1206
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,980
The husks of all your former editors.

1207
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,360
That corn husker's lotion.

1208
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,160
Sucked.

1209
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,680
I wish you hadn't mentioned that.

1210
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,600
Sucked. Dry.

1211
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,220
Saper thin rustling in the corner.

1212
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,580
Jabba the husk.

1213
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,360
Well, it killed the first one.

1214
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,900
Then the second one tried to kill us.

1215
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,940
And then there weren't any more.

1216
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,940
Funny how that happened.

1217
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,360
Really?

1218
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:41,140
nothing's left but this they killed each other yeah all this subgenius then there was the poor

1219
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:47,600
japanese translator that some japanese publisher actually gave us five grand about a million years

1220
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:53,640
ago they were going to do a japanese version of the book of the subgenius and then nothing

1221
00:46:53,640 --> 00:47:02,140
happened and we later heard that 19 translators has committed seppuku out of shame because they

1222
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:09,300
were unable to get through the first sentence or two they were still working on page three the last

1223
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,280
time there's still armies of them over there killing themselves every day because of that

1224
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:22,000
even now i know of at least one finn trying to translate oh is reverend shining path translating

since reverend li li jing was the first one whatever happened so we've only got a

1233
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:13,600
one billion to go or so he must be a millionaire by now selling bootlegs

1234

in

1256
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,120
the

1257
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,140
I love the manatees.

1258
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,160
And you know what I mean?

1259
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,100
But I've had my things with those other fish.

1260
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,900
I've had my deal with those.

1261
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,400
I've had my experiences with them.

1262
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,780
Not fun.

1263
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,540
But no, and then the other thing, what do you think about the proliferation of like jellyfish in the ocean now?

1264
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,520
It may have something to do with the Earth's magnetic field.

1265
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,260
What kind of creatures would feed on sex drugs and sea slime?

1266
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,240
Huh.

1267
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:23,860
Hmm.

1268
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,100
Oh, yes.

1269
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,720
Wonderful.

1270
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,080
Kind of look like this.

1271
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,800
Like some sort of a lackadaisical lump just sitting there.

1272
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:41,240
If they are threatened, they can sort of turn their skin from a leathery kind of rough texture into a gelatinous, of course, slimy material,

1273
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,560
which is a nice way to get other organisms or predators to sort of go away.

1274
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,440
Kind of shape-shifting almost.

1275
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,620
They can also eviscerate.

1276
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,660
So if something is going to attack them, they basically eject either this mass of white sticky tubules

1277
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:56,700
to...

1278
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:04,140
Act as a decoy or to entrap predators, or they actually eject their internal organs as again as a decoy,

1279
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,620
and then they kind of slowly crawl away.

1280
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,020
Crazy.

1281
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,980
But amazingly, they can regenerate their internal organs within three to five weeks.

1282
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,700
What's that smell in here?

1283
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,420
Some kind of...

1284
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:19,240
Well, it might be the smell of herbal air freshener.

1285
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,180
Somebody's wearing some fancy French perfume.

1286
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,220
I just took my shoes off.

1287
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,740
That's all.

1288
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,620
Set a spell.

1289
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,560
I'm sorry.

1290
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,400
I smell like one of them fancy French whores.

1291
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,760
Should I put my shoes back on?

1292
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,640
No, you're going to leave them off.

1293
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,380
You better tell me how much you charge.

1294
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,180
It was just Pete Goldie burning his socks.

1295
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,620
Pete knows his onions.

1296
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,340
Are you selling your wares there, little lady?

1297
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,340
A lady?

1298
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,480
Oh, there's no lady this time.

1299
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,900
We had the women before.

1300
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,520
I thought maybe my friend would come in tonight, but she didn't.

1301
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,440
That's such a sad statement.

1302
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,240
She was too worn out to come, but she still might come.

1303
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:56,700
Too worn out.

1304
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,340
Too worn out to come.

1305
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,700
We had women before.

1306
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,440
Exactly.

1307
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,140
Oh, hell no.

1308
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,520
But now you're going to have to be the woman.

1309
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,200
Well, I...

1310
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,060
Here's the wig.

1311
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,020
Here's the dress.

1312
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,800
There's either going to be blood on my knife...

1313
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,880
Now, boys, it's time for your Bible lesson.

1314
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,540
Or something on my something.

1315
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,640
You're going to be the woman tonight, Philo.

1316
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,180
Halloween is Satan's Christmas.

1317
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,220
I just wear my mask backwards.

1318
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,220
Mask backwards?

1319
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,080
I just put that little girl mask on.

1320
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,700
The back of my mask.

1321
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,060
My head.

1322
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,280
We smell sausage.

1323
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,720
So it's a sausage party, huh?

1324
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,160
No, that was the back mask.

1325
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,280
My scat rat, though.

1326
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,520
Who's back masking God?

1327
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,660
Well, uh...

1328
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,260
Bat Masterson.

1329
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,380
Once when the West was very young

1330
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,720
There lived a man named Masterson

1331
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,400
He had a cane and wore a derby hat

1332
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,140
They called him Bat

1333
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,840
Bat Masterson

1334
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,180
Yes.

1335
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,640
How easily it washes away.

1336
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,640
I can tell you guys are a couple of years older than me

1337
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,140
because you can remember another couple of seasons of television.

1338
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:15,080
How about Yancey Derringer, Riverboat Rogue?

1339
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,360
Did you ever watch that one?

1340
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,580
Yeah, that's before that time.

1341
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,800
Yancey, Yancey Derringer, Yancey...

1342
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,020
You remember him, right?

1343
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,480
Yancey Derringer.

1344
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,440
Derringer popped out of his belt buckle.

1345
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,120
And he had a little...

1346
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,100
He had a little mustache and he was on a riverboat

1347
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,960
and he gambled and he had a fancy shirt

1348
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,220
and it didn't last long.

1349
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,060
He carried a derringer.

1350
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,560
Yeah, he was known for his derringer.

1351
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,480
He only had one shot in that little popper

1352
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,620
so he had to make it count.

1353
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,000
But it was a deadly derringer

1354
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,640
later published by a certain Donald...

1355
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,940
Donald Wilkes Booth or somebody like that.

1356
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,120
But he could make it come shooting out of his sleeve.

1357
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,980
Yeah, like that.

1358
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,640
With a little spring on it and it would...

1359
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,660
Oh, he was a bastard.

1360
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,780
It would deliver itself in his hand, right?

1361
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,140
An unfair advantage.

1362
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,040
What can I say?

1363
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,160
Oh, you're talking about a gun.

1364
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,360
I thought you meant his...

1365
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,200
Yancey Derringer, you moat.

1366
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:03,920
No, no.

1367
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,000
I sympathize with the one pop per load.

1368
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,100
And then how about Jim Bowie, Jim Bowie?

1369
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,120
Hey, pop.

1370
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,620
As a fellow agent, you know, things change.

1371
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,620
Jim Bowie, Jim Bowie.

1372
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,100
Remember that one?

1373
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,840
Yeah, the Jim Bowie show.

1374
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,360
But how about Casey Jones?

1375
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,920
The Casey Jones show with Alan Hale Jr.

1376
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,720
You're old.

1377
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,020
And Red Rock.

1378
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:26,980
And Casey Jr.

1379
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,560
You're old.

1380
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,080
His blade was tempered and so was he.

1381
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,920
Because of what he's done.

1382
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,640
And destructible steel was he.

1383
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:39,400
God, those guys are so old.

1384
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,220
I'm never going to get like that.

1385
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,260
Well, not very much to tell you about the apparatus itself, Wilma.

1386
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,780
Except that here in this little pad under his head

1387
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:56,020
is an extremely sensitive and high-frequency response piezoelectric oscillator.

1388
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,200
A quite complicated design.

1389
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,300
Yes, I guess so.

1390
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:00,820
Yes.

1391
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,060
And I've succeeded in tuning it to receive the minute electronic impulses

1392
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,040
that emanate from his brain.

1393
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,560
Yeah.

1394
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,760
Through the medium of a super-radiating protoniform.

1395
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,120
Oh, yes.

1396
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:11,540
I...

1397
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,380
Oh, what?

1398
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,120
In other words, we're able to obtain sufficient amplification

1399
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,300
of the impulse output to register audibly

1400
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,220
through a process of thermionic note magnification.

1401
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,680
That's all there is to it.

1402
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,100
First of all, we'll have to see if it's going to work.

1403
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,100


1404
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,260
Switch in the electroniformer.

1405
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,640
Give the electroniformer a sort of eerie sound.

1406
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,220
Yes.

1407
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,400
And now, when I switch on this microphone and speak to him,

1408
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,400
my words will be registered directly on his brain.

1409
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,000
Not through his ears, you understand, but directly on his brain.

1410
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,460
Uh-huh.

1411
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,260
And if we're successful,

1412
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,080
we'll receive his subconscious response through the loudspeaker.

1413
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,820
Go ahead, Doctor.

1414
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,420
Now, young man, what is your name?

1415
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,740
I...

1416
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,560
I said, what is your name?

1417
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,400
Bob!

1418
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,100
Well, now, it works!

1419
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,080
But, Doctor...

1420
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,080
My invention's a success!

1421
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,040
Doctor, what happened?

1422
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,800
It works even better than I thought it would.

1423
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,840
He didn't move his lips, though.

1424
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,080
It read his mind.

1425
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,600
Great day.

1426
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,540
It doesn't seem possible.

1427
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,140
Yes.

1428
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,020
Yes, by all means.

1429
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,560
Listen.

1430
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:12,900
Yes?

1431
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,100
Did you, um...

1432
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,820
Did you find anything new and different when you came in the 25th century?

1433
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,600
Oh, a great deal.

1434
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,680
Thanks to Dr...

1435
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,100
Doctor...

1436
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,780
The greatest scientist who ever lived.

1437
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
Uh, what's this?

1438
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,080
Nowhere in the universe is there a scientist...

1439
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,820
Please, please.

1440
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,740
...or done anything to think that you could...

1441
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,460
Now, now, now, wait.

1442
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,480
Wait a minute.

1443
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,160
Yes?

1444
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,620
Judge, go on with what you were saying.

1445
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,240
But he's the man who invented the moon.

1446
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,120
Very true.

1447
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,400
Nothing wrong with this machine, Doctor.

1448
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,080
Where else have you gone?

1449
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,240
Well, that's hard to say.

1450
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,920
But first to Mars, where we held King and Archon's Tiger Men.

1451
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,220
Yes.

1452
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,360
Then to Saturn, and the Saturnian moon, Venus, Jupiter, and even far off Pluto.

1453
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,680
You see, Wilma?

1454
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,940
May I ask? May I ask?

1455
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,140
Surely. Go ahead. Go ahead.

1456
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,440
How did you happen to come...

1457
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,460
In 1919, I was in the lower workings of a beautiful girl soldier I met when I first met him.

1458
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,560
Oh, Wilma, Doctor.

1459
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,880
The finest and bravest girl who ever lived.

1460
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,580
Yes, yes, yes, well...

1461
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,160
All of a sudden, the whole thing caved in on me.

1462
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:10,420
Yes?

1463
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,060
Some kind of peculiar gas was released.

1464
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,020
It kept me in a state of suspended animation for 500 years.

1465
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:17,700
Well...

1466
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,860
Then the ground shifted and let in fresh air, and I woke up.

1467
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,580
And when you woke up, you were hearing Hour of Slack number 1000.

1468
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,400
415 from subgenius.com.

1469
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,820
Which included, from the beginning, titles by The Large,

1470
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,000
the song Crazy about Bob was by the great, groovy Neptune,

1471
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,240
The Large did the Maestro Bob collage,

1472
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,300
and then we heard clips and the title song,

1473
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:54,020
from the beginning of the Larry Blamire film, Trail of the Screaming Forehead.

1474
00:56:54,020 --> 00:57:00,480
The heaving bulk of the show was from the Ask Dr. Howe show of February 22nd

1475
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,380
on Radio Valencia in San Francisco

1476
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:08,600
with Dr. Philodrummond, St. Palmer Breedies of Lies,

1477
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,980
electronics expert Pete Goldie, and Reverend Ivan Stang.

1478
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:21,620
There were more collages by the large and a song called Crazy Glue by Fishbone.

1479
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:26,560
The bad guy affirmation is from Wreck-It Ralph.

1480
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,820
There was and will be a long string of media barrages

1481
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,360
supplied by Reverend Royal Decapitator.

1482
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,100
PR news is lemur.

1483
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:45,560
Praise Bob and see subgenius.com for all other details.

1484
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,460
The music in the background is by the Flying Ryan Brothers.

1485
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,240
Praise Bob.

1486
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,780
Praise Bob.

1487
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,420
And now, from Reverend Just John, this.

1488
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,260
They say if you've never eaten human flesh and been glad of it,

1489
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,280
you want a life when Y2K hit.

1490
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,080
All the stopped clocks, cars, elevators,

1491
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,260
burning buildings,

1492
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:14,420
pet sacrifices,

1493
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,440
grey men,

1494
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,760
stalking the streets

1495
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,620
with washboards,

1496
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,280
and calendars.

1497
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,260
But, maybe, we're past that far enough to settle an issue that sparked the strangest

1498
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,660
spate of bloodshed between two straggling camps.

1499
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,680
Exactly when did the millennium start?

1500
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,660
All because there's no year zero.

1501
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,960
I said on December 31, 1999 and I say it now, let's declare a year zero.

1502
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,660
What is now 1 BC becomes year zero.

1503
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,320
What is now 2 BC is promoted a year to 1 BC.

1504
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,400
And so on.

1505
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:57,540
The fact that we now call them BC shows that they've been redated at least once before, eh?

1506
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,600
This will have an effect on commerce.

1507
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:07,820
The current, no year zero arrangement requires computers to have an extra hitch in their algorithms to deal with dates.

1508
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,600
Incorporate our year zero in that, simplifies things.

1509
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,600
Each access to a date calculation takes a millisecond or two less to work.

1510
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,520
Multiply that, times billions of transactions a day,

1511
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,300
and it's simple.

1512
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,280
It starts to make a difference.

1513
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,600
I don't think the change hurts anybody, and it's a boost to textbook publishers everywhere.

1514
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:34,700
Plus, since simply changing all the dates will feel like a paltry reason to publish a new edition of a history book,

1515
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:39,180
this will be an opportunity to include recent events and improvements to existing articles.

1516
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,980
A learning renaissance will undoubtedly follow.

1517
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,260
The only problem I see is the name, year zero.

1518
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,640
It's been used before, by unsavory outfits.

1519
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,740
We don't want to be seen as emulating.

1520
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,760
So I say, call it the year of Bob.

1521
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,040
Year of Bob.

1522
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,740
Christianity still gets thousands of years referring to their savior.

1523
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,020
Well, I think my faith, the church of the subgenius, deserves at least one.

1524
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,680
And what are you giving up?

1525
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,740
Nothing.

1526
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,640
Year of Bob.

1527
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,420

1531
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,420
Praise Bob!

1532
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:56,860
For Sire, there is no more money.

1533
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,300
We gotta get some money!

1534
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,520
That dirty, perky, sharka-packed, flackin' wharton,

1535
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,460
Philip Bunker Burton,

1536
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,740
Perkaluma Burton,

1537
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:05,900
Dirt and Bustin' that!

1538
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,900
Beef. Beef. Beef.

1539
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:17,200
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1540
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,380
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1541
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:29,480
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1542
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:36,980
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1543
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,300
and help out financially as best you can.

1544
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,660
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1545
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,180
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own money.

1546
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,880
We want to help people like you,

1547
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,420
and help you get through the hard times.

1548
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:58,180
We know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1549
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:58,720
and we'd love that.

1550
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,740
And if you're the type of individual who's not afraid of any of this stuff,

1551
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:05,160
and doesn't want to be a part of the隙,

1552
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,740
we're ready to help.

1553
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:09,360
We're ready to help.

1554
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,360


1555
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,360


1556
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,500
We're ready to help.

1557
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:09,500


1558
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:09,900
We're ready to help.

1559
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,460
We're ready to help.

1560
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,600
We're ready to help.

1561
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:30,700
Foundation. P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118. Thanks for anything you can do to help

1562
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,520
