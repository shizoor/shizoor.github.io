1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
I'm sure I saw a flash of light in the sky.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,600
Really?

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,420
The...

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,660
Self...

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,440
Genius...

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,640
Paul...

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,560
Of Spock!

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,700
Who are you?

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,300
My name is Naya.

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:31,920
Really?

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,160
Where do you come from?

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,180
Mars.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,140
Really?

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,100
But that's preposterous.

15
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,760
Really?

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,620
You're not that poor.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:57,620


18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,060
It's Peppa.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,720
Peppa?

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,000
Peppa?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,360
Yes.

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,360


23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,360


24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,940
The Peppa Можно.

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:00,940


26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:00,940


27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,120
Peppa is an American...

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,940
In the universe.

29
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,560
From the top of the Empire State Building, and broadcasting loud to all time zones around

30
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
the world in stereo...

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,360
This is...

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,860
Alive...

33
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,420
It's alive!

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,180
It's alive!

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,220
Mom, Dad, it's evil!

36
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,980
Don't touch it!

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,820
Because Bob came.

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,260
Bob doesn't care about your sins.

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,800
Bob won't die for your sins because Bob's not the son of God.

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,140
Bob won't die for your sins.

41
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,600
Bob won't forgive you for your sins.

42
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,580
Bob will justify your sins.

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,160
First, I'd just like to say that it's really great to be here.

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,020
I mean, it really is.

45
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,020
It's real good.

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,700
Good God.

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,400
God, it's good to be here.

48
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,980
I don't know where to begin to tell you.

49
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,700
Damn, it's good to be here.

50
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,640
You cad.

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,360
You dirty swine.

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,760
I never cared for you not once.

53
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,680
I was always making a fool of you.

54
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,380
It made me sick when I had to let you kiss me.

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,340
I only did it because you begged me.

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,240
You hounded me.

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,200
You drove me crazy.

58
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,240
And after you kissed me, I always used to wipe my mouth.

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,780
Wipe my mouth.

60
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,520
You are a menace.

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,020
A walking pest.

62
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,080
I'm telling you, they can't get in here.

63
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,860
And I'm telling you, those things turned over our car.

64
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,100
Hell, how many good five men can do that?

65
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,980
That's my point.

66
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,220
Only there's not going to be five or even ten.

67
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,140
There's going to be twenty, thirty, maybe a hundred of those things.

68
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,780
And as soon as they know we're here, this place is going to be crawling with them.

69
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,320
The air attack warning sounds like this is the sound.

70
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,420
Are we men? Or are we just machines?

71
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
Slaved to an electronic beat.

72
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,560
A probability wave in space.

73
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,220
You are on the brink of extinction.

74
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,280
Seriously.

75
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,320
We are an army of strangely dressed, deeply confused, pseudo-individual conformists.

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,660
Look up and the ghost!

77
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,620
Smashing!

78
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,280
America, the number one nation.

79
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,760
And we're number one.

80
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,140
Hi, we're the Rusty's.

81
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,540
And we're from Gary, Indiana.

82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,820
We're number one segregation.

83
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,160
And murder.

84
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,540
Hi, I'm Virgil Strickman from Claxton, Georgia.

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,060
We are number one in fruitcakes.

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm Bill McNutt, Collins Street Bakery, 4th St. of Texas.

87
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,880
And we're number one in fruitcakes.

88
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,100
No, we're number one in fruitcakes.

89
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,720
No, we're number one.

90
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,020
No, we are number one in fruitcakes.

91
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,060
Who are these people?

92
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,120
Why do they enjoy spending their leisure unclothed among other nude people?

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,700
The tumor on her neck is definitely a fetus.

94
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,420
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth, I come to you from a long, long ways off.

95
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,800
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

96
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,900
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

97
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,720
I hate them with all my heart.

98
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,220
Pop.

99
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,720
Rock and roll is dead and pop is in.

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,800
Why not discover the excitement of the science of music yourself?

101
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,960
Thanks to the science of music, you don't need musical talent to make great music.

102
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,960
Just listen.

103
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,880
I created that just by pressing a button.

104
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,240
Synthesizers are the new wave.

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,080
Why work hard on difficult compositions when a machine can make music better than you've ever dreamed of?

106
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,920
You'll be the hit of the party.

107
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,340
It's perfect for in-restaurant entertainment.

108
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,120
Cover bands and funerals.

109
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,920
Make fugues funky and death marches danceable.

110
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,520
It's the science of music.

111
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,340
Remember, you don't know you're a musician until you try.

112
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:37,480
My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever.

113
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,860
We begin bombing in five minutes.

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,680
The funeral program in this baby is really gone.

115
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,840
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the...

116
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,660
We've got to put some food coloring in there.

117
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,200
They stole the election.

118
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,760
We had a cool day at town.

119
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,160
We prevented the hijacking and theft of the presidency of the United States.

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,120
We know the race is not to the swift, nor the bound to the strong.

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,920
Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?

122
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,980
You're a freak, man.

123
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,300
What a way to go out.

124
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
If any of you are copying this, it is illegal.

125
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
And I hope you burn in hell.

126
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,280
But might I suggest you turn the cassette over?

127
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,680
This is, of course, a compact disc.

128
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,840
A brand new format heralding a new age of lasers.

129
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,860
An age typified by man and machine living as one with bangs.

130
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,500
From PR News in Washington, I'm Far From Functional in New Jersey.

131
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,420
The Justice Department says it has 209,000.3% of PR news in New Jersey.

132
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,940
PR reports police in Australia say President Trump has his New Jersey.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,360
Israeli authorities say PR's reporting reports police are investigating bribery, fraud, and breach of New Jersey.

134
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,460
In New Jersey.

135
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,180
On Wall Street, 38.8, 38.7, 3.

136
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,440
The Prime Minister of Cambodia says thanks, but no PR news in New Jersey.

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,900
Thank you, Fernanda Nande-Lemur, for PR News.

138
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,940
Earlier, we heard some media barrage stuff that was cut up by Cool Hand Chris.

139
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,200
And now, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

140
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,560
We're in the South.

141
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,900
This is the Central Newsroom.

142
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:02,900


143
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
Great.

144
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,320
Thanks for coming.

145
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,320


146
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,380
Take care, everyone.

147
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:08,380


148
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,820
Have a good night, everybody.

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,460
Have a good night.

150
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,480


151
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,580
Bye-bye.

152
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,780
Have a good night.

153
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,060
Have a good night.

154
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,060


155
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,800
Bye-bye.

156
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:25,960
Thank you.

157
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,860
Thank you.

158
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,200
Now beware, have a care,

159
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,160
you're just filled with air.

160
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,080
A single pin

161
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,000
would rip your skin

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,060
and the pincushion man

163
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,020
in the forest there

164
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,980
would pop you both

165
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,020
if you don't take care.

166
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,900
Most is trash in the flesh,

167
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,940
I'll settle his hash.

168
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,920
I'll bust right in

169
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,800
and twist his chin.

170
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,740
I'll get rough, I'll get tough,

171
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,640
I'll just call his bluff.

172
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,740
No, no,

173
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,560
please don't go.

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,180
I'll bust right in

175
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,100
and I'll bust right in.

176
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

177
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm the old pincushion man,

178
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,900
terror of

179
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,180
balloony land.

180
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,220
Folks all hate me,

181
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,860
how they hate me,

182
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,960
tickles me the way they rate me.

183
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,200
Always have a pin

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,040
at hand,

185
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,220
that's the reason I am panned.

186
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,060
How I stop them

187
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,720
when I pop them.

188
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,680
Ha ha ha!

189
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,680
How I get to deliberately

190
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:46,680


191
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,940
I'm a one came,

192
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm a fortune teller.

193
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,620
I'm sissy .

194
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,660
Not a thing believe to Fangs

195
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,480
before I live a few weeks!

196
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm a grown up now,

197
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,200


198
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,200


199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,200


200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,380
Five c-quad Petанием.

201
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,620
Hey folks,

202
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:58,640
the one time is fine.

203
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:58,640


204
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:58,640


205
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
Thought you were looking for clippity?

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,520
꼭

207
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,600
約

208
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,120
Lo, looco, loo, loo, rouu, adaaargh!

209
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,340

210
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,920
こ、あи、 FPs, G sempre be careful, stop being talkative.

211
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,300
Thank you.

212
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,640
Thank you.

213
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,100
Thank you.

214
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:43,760
Thank you.

215
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,100
Thank you.

216
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,420
Thank you.

217
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,500
Thank you.

218
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,280
Thank you.

219
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,500
Thank you.

220
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:42,700
Thank you.

221
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,420
Thank you.

222
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,580
Thank you.

223
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,820
The tapes are okay, Doug.

224
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,540
We can go to bed tonight and sleep soundly.

225
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,860
As long as nobody's listening to them, everything's fine.

226
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,120
As long as they're not being copied or preserved.

227
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,060
This is a wonderful story because Gary had a Fostex

228
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,460
that we just brought to Doc's Dock.

229
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

230
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,620
Really nice recordings of silly times.

231
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,360
And then the Fostex died at one point.

232
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,900
And I was at the White Elephant sale

233
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,400
and found a T-Act of the same,

234
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
I think it's T-Act, right?

235
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,040
Tascam.

236
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,980
Boy crack, yeah.

237
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,520
T-Acts were better.

238
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:45,940
Same one.

239
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,400
And so now I can save those band tapes.

240
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,040
I was thinking I should just get that stuff back to you

241
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,080
and just go ahead and make four channel tapes

242
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,300
before that thing dies, too.

243
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,100
And then sell it to some 30-year-old who goes,

244
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,380
wow, tape technology.

245
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm still looking for the buttons for my Rhino suit,

246
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,980
so I really can't.

247
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,400
I had to buy a fruit drying machine

248
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,080
to...

249
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:11,800
Yeah.

250
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
...bake my reel-to-reel tape.

251
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,900
No, no, really.

252
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,180
You bake old tapes...

253
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
A rice cooker, yeah.

254
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,780
...because you only get one last chance to play them

255
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,580
after their binder has failed.

256
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,080
Yeah.

257
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,140
You can heat them up

258
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,080
and the binder will hold just long enough

259
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,940
to run them through a machine one time.

260
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,800
But your oven is too hot for that.

261
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,120
So there's a certain level on this fruit dry,

262
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,640
this cheap fruit dry thing.

263
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,220
Yeah, they work in the back.

264
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,580
Yeah.

265
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,920
If you leave your tape there for two hours

266
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,320
and sure enough, it will improve.

267
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,140
What you're doing is making the binder...

268
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,640
Bringing the binder back.

269
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,180
You can do both the salmon and the tape.

270
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,060
The binder between the tape and the emulsion

271
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,720
and the heating makes it flexible again.

272
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,880
And Don swore that he could get a week out of it.

273
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,700
He could do it and still play a week later.

274
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,820
Yeah, but a Don week.

275
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,980
A Don week, yeah.

276
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,520
So it was Don Joyce for us, the late Don Joyce.

277
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,400
He turned me on to that trick.

278
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,140
His late week.

279
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,440
And he'd seen it.

280
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,300
It was a guy at Ampex over in the South Bay.

281
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,300
It was a huge Ampex place.

282
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,400
Oh, right, right.

283
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,220
And somehow he accidentally decided to make cookies

284
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
out of old tapes or something

285
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,320
and found out he could do this, restore the emulsion.

286
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,140
Were there gill or gill tape?

287
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,160
I always heard it attributed to Dr. Demento.

288
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,200
I thought it was like you pulled it out of the river.

289
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,080
It's like the story you have in your book.

290
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,880
I love that.

291
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,240
The man I was always taught started the Civil War,

292
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,080
with Edmund Ruffin pulled the lanyard

293
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,100
and fired the first cannon at Anderson's command.

294
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,800
Fort Funston, right.

295
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,640
Fort Funston, yeah.

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,720
And yet there's this whole story about somebody else,

297
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,160
some other guy fired a cannon,

298
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,120
and then the argument became this delicate thing of,

299
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,920
well, the first cannon was actually a flare that goes off.

300
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,740
Then there's another cannon that actually hurts people.

301
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,400
So they were just one of those great,

302
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,760
that's what history is.

303
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,420
But as a matter of honor and respect,

304
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,260
they did allow.

305
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,640
They did allow the northern soldiers to order out for pizza.

306
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,760
Yeah, yeah, because it was a pizza store.

307
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,480
Yeah, the Confederates in Charleston Harbor

308
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,380
were actually really,

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,800
as long as nobody wanted arugula and smoked chicken on their pizza,

310
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,200
they would allow the Union soldiers to order anything.

311
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,760
Well, okay, well, who started making the reel-to-reel tapes?

312
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,140
The Confederacy or the Union?

313
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,680
No, it was the Union because the Confederacy didn't have enough power

314
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,180
to get the little baker thing.

315
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,540
And they didn't know what the tapes were.

316
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,140
They just.

317
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,920
They had them, but they.

318
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,000
Plus the cotton threads would get caught in the heads.

319
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,080
No, but you know what's amazing?

320
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,460
Didn't they have a spy that took them to Jeff Davis

321
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,020
and he'd look at them for hours and hours with these other guys

322
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,360
and they figured out that it was just some sort of Yankee contraption

323
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,300
that they couldn't do anything.

324
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,480
You saw this movie, huh?

325
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,100
And then when they played the tapes back,

326
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,100
it was nothing but a bunch of doctor bands,

327
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,040
subgeniuses all talking at the same time.

328
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,500
Yeah.

329
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,800
Yeah, and they were all fat and stuff and had big ears.

330
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah, and were all successful and had huge ranches.

331
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,540
But we can't transfer tapes if you want to come by.

332
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,460
And the testers all crawl behind the console

333
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,380
and plug in all the plugs.

334
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:16,860
Yeah.

335
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,900
We do that as a free service of the church.

336
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,420
Did you ever use one of them sound-on-sound vehicles

337
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,140
where, like, if you keep bouncing tracks back and forth,

338
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,860
you build tracks?

339
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,360
Yeah.

340
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,260
Oh, are you kidding?

341
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,700
Of course.

342
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,240
That goes back to what we were just saying.

343
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,980
The early Beatle albums were done that way.

344
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,000
It's called ping-ponging.

345
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,540
Yeah, the early subgenius albums were done that way.

346
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,280
Yeah, everybody's early albums were done that way, yeah.

347
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,400
And especially cool because at that time you could mix for mono.

348
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,480
So until Spectre took over, you know,

349
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,880
you could just do a lot more,

350
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,460
and it came out of this one four-inch speaker

351
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,420
in the back of your car.

352
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,580
Well, you and Glass Madness had a way of making

353
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,920
double tracking on a cassette by covering up

354
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
one part of the recording.

355
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,500
The erase head.

356
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,220
The erase head.

357
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,260
Yeah, the erase head with a piece of a matchmaker.

358
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,800
I don't know how new that is, but in these newer ones.

359
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,620
The new what?

360
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,360
Digital recorder?

361
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,200
Yeah, the little digital recorder like this one

362
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,220
and a couple of companies I've looked at.

363
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,780
How do you get the match inside?

364
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,860
They have that in as a command.

365
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,180
You do a whole track.

366
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,720
You do what we're doing now.

367
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,480
Oh, really?

368
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,420
There's a way to go click, click,

369
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,920
and now you can just dump another two tracks

370
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,080
on top of those two tracks.

371
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,640
I didn't know you did that on a little handheld.

372
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,100
I'll have to read the instructions one of these days.

373
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,740
I think it's also kind of a new trick.

374
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
So you just push a button.

375
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,740
You don't have to stick a match head in there?

376
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,080
Exactly.

377
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,240
You stick the match head in electronically now.

378
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,980
This was the coolest trick ever.

379
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,520
Yeah, if you covered up the erase head,

380
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,180
then your track would be in there.

381
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,260
The tracks didn't go away, see?

382
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,680
And you could pile up until just like nine times

383
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,620
as a kid when you'd have it.

384
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,980
It just sounded like sonic soup.

385
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,800
You couldn't tell.

386
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,140
But over time, you learned to be careful.

387
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,620
I kind of did screwy four-channel thinking with it.

388
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,120
I'd mark with pieces of paper where the next verse started.

389
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,220
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,240
Then you dropped the microphone in the toilet.

391
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,840
No, the sad part was I lived.

392
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,960
It's a beautiful sound for like half a second.

393
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,300
Yeah.

394
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,340
I actually tried to make a waterproof mic

395
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,860
and then had like 300 feet of cord

396
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,540
and the beach was right there.

397
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,560
So I went out in the water and I yelled in the thing

398
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,860
and got home and nothing on the tape

399
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,700
because I didn't know anything about powering the signal or anything.

400
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,840
I just thought, oh, it doesn't work.

401
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,180
I'm surprised you didn't at least get some voices from the dead.

402
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,320
I probably did, but I just wasn't open to it.

403
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:36,700
Right.

404
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,700
I don't think you couldn't record voices from the dead before 78, could you?

405
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,380
Before 78.

406
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,040
No, back in third, by the time.

407
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,920
No, they had 78s with voices.

408
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,840
That's what I was going to say.

409
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,060
I mean, more people had 33s and 45s.

410
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,700
If you watch movies, White Noise 1 and 2,

411
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,840
that's all about finding the people in the white noise of a tape recorder.

412
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
And they were so lighthearted, too, at the same time.

413
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,460
That's why they had to smash.

414
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,980
They had to smash them with a mighty, mighty fist.

415
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,220
Oh, yeah, we're getting back to some of this theology here.

416
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,600
Yeah, that's theology.

417
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,160
Well, it's not everything, but it certainly is everything.

418
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,120
I mean, if you...

419
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Well, we used to leave an open mic in a room with the tape deck on

420
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,380
and we'd walk away for an hour and we'd come back and listen for an hour

421
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,780
to see if Bob had said anything.

422
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,820
But the most we ever got was this real, real faint sort of...

423
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,560
I don't know.

424
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,900
If they can't take a show...

425
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,100
Oh, God.

426
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,440
Yeah, and then that's the whole thing.

427
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:39,660
That was it.

428
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,260
You have to listen really carefully.

429
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,580
That was 45 minutes in.

430
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,300
Yeah, so you have to listen...

431
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,380
That's a slack hour.

432
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,400
A couple of times to the whole 45 minutes

433
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,100
to make sure that's where the voice is.

434
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,560
Yeah, we did that three times a day for two years.

435
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,540
That was the only line we got there.

436
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,420
Amazing.

437
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,300
You know what it's like in social comparisons like masturbation.

438
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,120
If you do many times, you go blind.

439
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,780
Yeah.

440
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,040
Or perhaps you have a hard time hearing,

441
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,380
you become hard of hearing.

442
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:05,780
Yeah.

443
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,240
And that's really dangerous.

444
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,560
And you're taking a walk

445
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,760
and there's like electronic cars going by

446
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,760
because they could impair your visual optometry.

447
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,140
You know what I'm saying?

448
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,260
I'm not sure what you mean.

449
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,140
It's Ohio speak.

450
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,480
Oh, yeah, that's right.

451
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,900
Neighbor world talk.

452
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,140
Once in a while, Vreedys will break into full-on Ohio speak.

453
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,600
And we'll have to slow down.

455
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
I'm not talking Pittsburgh young for talk.

456
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,780
Yeah, because we come from the fast coast,

457
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,660
you know, where everything's different speed

458
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,860
and different intonation

459
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,860
and completely different subject matter.

460
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,840
We're just too cool for ourselves.

461
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,860
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't be able to understand Youngstownian.

462
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,580
Yeah, not at all.

463
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,540
Not at all, yeah.

464
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,300
The Youngers.

465
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,860
You employ a translator for this kind of thing.

466
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,240
They say Youngers, the views are y'all.

467
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,960
They call people Youngs

468
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,120
and they say they're going downtown.

469
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,480
Stuff like that there.

470
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,040
Yeah.

471
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,460
Sounds like New Orleans.

472
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,820
Where I'm from, people talk about going pouch groveling.

473
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,420
Yeah.

474
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,160
Which is...

475
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,880
Oh, I could love such an event.

476
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:12,840
Yeah.

477
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
You might.

478
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,580
Yeah, boy, damn on the coast.

479
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,580
Yeah.

480
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,340
I would rate very high rating.

481
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,320
He is on the coast.

482
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,140
He's on the north coast.

483
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,860
Ashtabula's right on the lake.

484
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,860
On the Great Lakes of...

485
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,720
Did they move it to Wisconsin?

486
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,440
No.

487
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,560
No, no, that's very far north,

488
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,440
but on the Great Lakes.

489
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,400
Great Lakes due north.

490
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,180
Yeah, well, you can swim to Canada from Dave's house.

491
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,620
Really?

492
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,340
Let's do that.

493
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,440
Actually, you can drive to...

494
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,300
There have been people who drove to Canada

495
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
across the lake when it was frozen.

496
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:50,920
Wow.

497
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,420
But there are also many pickup trucks

498
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,660
at the bottom of the lake.

499
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,320
Huh.

500
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,020
It didn't quite make it.

501
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,280
We should go down there and salvage the guns.

502
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,380
There's plenty of them.

503
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah.

504
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,120
Yeah, because you drive out and go...

505
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,740
There was a great...

506
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,880
A true story.

507
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,700
These guys that went out fishing on the lake

508
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,680
when it was frozen.

509
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,640
I heard that one.

510
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,960
And they decided they were going to blow a hole

511
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,220
with some dynamite.

512
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,500
And they threw the dynamite

513
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,260
and forgot about the little dog.

514
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,940
The dog ran and picked up the dynamite

515
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,240
and ran back to their truck

516
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,380
and blew it up there.

517
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,720
And everybody died except for the idiots.

518
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,720
The dog and the truck and, you know...

519
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,840
The men ran, you know,

520
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,220
when they saw the dog come back.

521
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,300
And that was it.

522
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,020
That's the way to go.

523
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,240
Poor little Fido.

524
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:38,940
Yeah.

525
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,800
Yeah, that's a surprise.

526
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,000
I believe that that actually really happened.

527
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,660
You believe it happened.

528
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,040
I believe it.

529
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,080
I choose to believe.

530
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,680
I believe what I need to believe,

531
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,700
to quote Pappy.

532
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,620
On the corner of Pico and Sepulveda,

533
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,420
that's where you ground out your last delicious meal.

534
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,020
Pico and Sepulveda.

535
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,240
La, la, la.

536
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,340
La, la, la, la.

537
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,180
You guys are so old.

538
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,940
Yeah.

539
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,880
It's true.

540
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,900
Ob-spreen.

541
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,000
But I didn't learn it from...

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,680
From the 1930s movies.

543
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,600
I learned it from The Forbidden Zone.

544
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,620
Richard Elfman's movies.

545
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,800
So that makes it okay.

546
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,320
Yeah.

547
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:13,980
I'm not old.

548
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,520
It's ironic.

549
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,720
It's not historical.

550
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,400
Right.

551
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:16,600
Yeah.

552
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,920
I didn't just know it.

553
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,160
I'm not old.

554
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,860
Legitimately.

555
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,680
I knew it ironically only.

556
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,500
Yeah.

557
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,980
As a cultural bystone,

558
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,800
not getting stoned myself and liking it.

559
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,440
Yeah, right.

560
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,000
And like, what if you had all those different stones

561
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
like they do down in Georgia?

562
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:34,900
Yeah.

563
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:34,980
Yeah.

564
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


565
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


566
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


567
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


568
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:34,980


569
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,720
I would smoke marijuana

570
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,780
so I can hate the world instead of myself.

571
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,580
I said...

572
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,520
Oh, man.

573
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,500
What a great idea.

574
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,160
I wish I was...

575
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,120
I thought it was frop.

576
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,020
In the original thing,

577
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,980
let's get back...

578
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,180
Yeah, it was frop.

579
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,800
Let's smoke frop

580
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,720
so we can get back to hating the world

581
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,600
instead of ourselves.

582
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah.

583
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah.

584
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:49,720
I said that to Paul.

585
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,220
Marijuana?

586
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,480
Why would you...

587
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,260
Because I had not smoked...

588
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,180
Abused marijuana in a great while

589
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,780
and my friend Lies had some.

590
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,220
So I rushed over to his house

591
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,200
and I said, yeah,

592
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,020
now I can hate the world instead of myself.

593
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,280
Paul left real hard.

594
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,760
Uh-huh.

595
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,120
Uh-huh.

596
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,040
That's not funny.

597
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,900
That's not funny.

598
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,680
No, that's sad.

599
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,060
That's too close to the truth.

600
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,360
Too close to the truth.

601
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,360
It's a little too real, man.

602
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,400
That's what show is now.

603
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,320
You're triggering me.

604
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Listen, young people.

605
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,560
The show's going to be trickling down

606
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,180
to almost nothing soon.

607
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,040
So something really important

608
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,460
should be discussed here.

609
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,020
Okay.

610
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,360
Well, there's...

611
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,920
Oh, here's the next book

612
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,760
we're going to publish.

613
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,600
It's actually just the first chapter.

614
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,580
The blue folder?

615
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm not mad.

616
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,540
Yeah, it's a science fiction story

617
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,760
which involves...

618
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,660
X day called Eyelash.

619
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,880
And it's really weird.

620
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,080
It's by a subgenius named

621
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,160
Nikolai Kingsley

622
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,220
who lives in Australia.

623
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,900
And that's going to be

624
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,040
our next novel

625
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,200
that we publish

626
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,220
as a print-on-demand thing

627
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,740
so it doesn't cost us anything.

628
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,560
Oh.

629
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,480
Dave, I think we sold like...

630
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,440
I think we sold like

631
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,860
75 copies of Neighbor World now.

632
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,100
75 copies?

633
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,120
Yeah, and I gave one to my niece,

634
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,980
the subgenius,

635
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,400
the one member of my family

636
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,920
who actually listens to Hour of Slack

637
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,140
besides my wife who's on it,

638
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,360
this one niece of mine,

639
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,560
my brother's daughter,

640
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,660
the one who left Glen Rose

641
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,720
and became an archaeologist.

642
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
You're related to a lot of people, man.

643
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,900
Anyway, she's a regular listener.

644
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,140
She's a...

645
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,780
In her points of duty.

646
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,360
She's listening right now.

647
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,940
Yeah, I gave...

648
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,020
She wanted a copy of Neighbor World

649
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,660
and I...

650
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,880
Dave, I just gave it to her.

651
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,820
I just handed it to her.

652
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:33,980
Yeah.

653
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,940
No commerce involved.

654
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,280
No commerce involved.

655
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,780
Right.

656
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,800
People are trying to get me to do that too

657
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,820
but I don't have enough.

658
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,680
I'm afraid to go ahead and go and...

659
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,020
Well, I got a new shipment of them, Dave.

660
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,560
I got...

661
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,020
I ordered 16 new ones

662
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,220
of which I have 15 now.

663
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,700
So, you know,

664
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,040
if you need one, tell me.

665
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,240
I can send them to you

666
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,080
or I can tell them to send them.

667
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,560
Well, I've got three I'd like to return.

668
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,560
At the local college library

669
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,980
might want one copy

670
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,600
because they publish local...

671
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:01,940
They...

672
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,640
You know, what you call local authors.

673
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,040
And you go there and you sign them

674
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,860
and stuff like that.

675
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:06,960
Yeah.

676
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,060
You should do that.

677
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,180
And there's some other crap like that.

678
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,500
The really lonely authors,

679
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,980
they go into bookstores

680
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,880
where they haven't been asked to sign them

681
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,380
and they go ahead and sign them.

682
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,320
I know this because I've done that

683
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,400
and I picked up a screenplay book

684
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,940
by Joe Esterhaus in Cleveland

685
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,280
and where he lives

686
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,800
and I got it home and it was signed.

687
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,820
I realized he did the same thing I did.

688
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,120
He found his book in the bookstore

689
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,440
and went,

690
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm just going to go ahead

691
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:34,940
and sign this

692
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,260
and see if anybody believes it.

693
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,940
I got a letter from somebody going,

694
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,840
I was in a Barnes & Noble in Dallas

695
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,220
and I picked up Revelation X

696
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,060
and it said it was

697
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,500
Reverend Ivan Stang was here

698
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,800
and it had the date.

699
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,540
Could that be real?

700
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,620
I went, yes, that is definitely real.

701
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
That's how I signed them

702
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,080
and I did do that

703
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,220
in that Barnes & Noble

704
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,840
just because.

705
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,060
That's the noble.

706
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,520
Just because.

707
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,480
That's the noble.

708
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,640
It's like, why didn't they ask me

709
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,740
to come in here and sign them?

710
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,300
God damn it, I'm going to sign them anyway.

711
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,280
Phooey.

712
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,480
Don't they know who I am?

713
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,580
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang,

714
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
author of this one,

715
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,820
of the only one copy

716
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,840
in the humor section.

717
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,240
Oh, well, I'll sign that.

718
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,500
Darn them.

719
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,640
I haven't seen one

720
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,020
in a bookstore in years.

721
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,960
But I haven't been

722
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,900
in a bookstore in years.

723
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,060
Do you smell the brownies yet?

724
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,080
What if you would have signed

725
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,700
a Bible of something new?

726
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,600
I smell the fairies

727
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
and the trolls.

728
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,060
Trolls, run!

729
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,780
I don't smell the brownies.

730
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,740
You don't smell the brownies?

731
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,180
No.

732
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,360
Boy, Dave, you smell the brownies?

733
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,320
I smell the Girl Scouts.

734
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,200
I'm afraid I'm different

735
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,360
than the rest of you fellows

736
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,300
because I can definitely

737
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,220
smell the brownies.

738
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,700
I smell the Girl Scouts

739
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,100
if I don't smell the brownies.

740
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,480
Well, I sniff the Girl Scouts,

741
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,240
but I definitely smell brownies.

742
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,340
I'm talking about chocolate,

743
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,520
gooey, delicious,

744
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,800
cannabis-laden brownies.

745
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,120
No, these are not,

746
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,120
that's not what we're talking about.

747
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,340
No, these are covered with ice cream.

748
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,360
Yeah, these are going to be,

749
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,820
these are just regular brownies.

750
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,720
You know,

751
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,820
when I hear on the show,

752
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,940
we like to pretend,

753
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,460
that we're on all high all the time

754
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,380
and on these drugs.

755
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,400
But really,

756
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
when you hear me sniffle,

757
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,160
it's because I have the sniffles.

758
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,540
It's not because I'm snorting anything.

759
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,180
Well, what about the eugenics part?

760
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,820
Do we have to sign that waiver

761
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,480
and release it for everyone?

762
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,100
Yeah, yeah,

763
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,780
because that's what we have to say legally.

764
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,240
You know, you have to sign

765
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,160
the wafer release

766
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,880
before you can take a wafer.

767
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,300
Before anybody will give you

768
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,180
a real wafer.

769
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,720
That's a good comedian.

770
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,600
First, you sign the thing

771
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:31,920
that says,

772
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,060
no, we didn't take,

773
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,520
anything.

774
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,240
Then they give you the stuff

775
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,520
so you can take it.

776
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:37,860
But first,

777
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,940
you have to say you didn't.

778
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,880
That's show business.

779
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,540
It's just FCC rules.

780
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,320
It's good legal jargonese, too,

781
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,180
because if you drive by

782
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,000
a licensed used car

783
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,140
or vehicle or automobile

784
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,720
or perhaps a gun of some kind,

785
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,480
then they'd have to throw you

786
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,120
out of the station

787
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,160
and put your pants down

788
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,680
right away.

789
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,560
I think the subgenius girls

790
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,540
ate all the brownies.

791
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,220
Really?

792
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,680
No, the subgenius girls left.

793
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,080
They went over to the house

794
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,420
of Anti-C, the rub genius.

795
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,660
That's my sister.

796
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,200
Really, look in the subgenius.

797
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,080
She's got a whole quote paragraph there.

798
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,740
Did they go there?

799
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,840
Her quote was,

800
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,180
someday I will be a large scar.

801
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,580
And that was a good prophecy

802
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,100
because that pretty much came true.

803
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,760
Folks.

804
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,260
Yeah.

805
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,500
My little sister is...

806
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,280
No, I hear noises in there.

807
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,960
Indeed.

808
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,940
I hear noises in there

809
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,560
indicating the staff is still with us.

810
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,220
Yeah, I was hoping they were here

811
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,900
instead of there.

812
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,580
Yeah.

813
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,720
No, nobody is...

814
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,220
Oh, that's right.

815
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,960
They had to come back

816
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,900
to take the brownies out of the oven.

817
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,580
That's the one,

818
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,880
just so the guys wouldn't have to...

819
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,120
Are they going to leave?

820
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,340
Okay, you guys keep talking.

821
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,360
I'm going to go check the brownies.

822
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,580
Okay, yeah.

823
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,780
Okay, see if the Cub Scouts

824
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,160
are out of the broiler, too, would you?

825
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,080
So I thought my idea was

826
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,600
that Doug Smith could play Bob Nelson

827
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
and see him be like the old show.

828
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,020
Yeah, that's right.

829
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,360
We'll pot him down

830
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,660
every time we want to say

831
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,460
something really funny.

832
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,260
And the best part is,

833
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,020
I never reminded him to play a CD,

834
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,380
so the editing is a lot easier,

835
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,420
but just voices

836
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,540
instead of having music

837
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,500
in the middle of all of it

838
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,980
and copyright problems

839
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,500
and lawyer fees and this way...

840
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,920
You think you can get him

841
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,680
to talk about that milking incident?

842
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,260
Probably not.

843
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,440
Yeah.

844
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,000
Because I think the family

845
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,360
was greatly embarrassed by it

846
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,980
for 130 years here in Smith County.

847
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,020
Well, you know,

848
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,040
the problem is now

849
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,780
that they have regular milking machines

850
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,940
and women are demanding

851
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,040
the right to be able to go

852
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,160
and pump,

853
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,260
as they call it.

854
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,740
Yeah.

855
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,140
And also,

856
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,680
you were talking to some other

857
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,360
owner of a plank

858
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,480
here in the county, right?

859
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,640
By the city hall there

860
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,400
the other day.

861
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:41,960
Of an appliance?

862
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,380
Yeah.

863
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,780
Isn't there a guy looking for bricks

864
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,120
with his family's name on it?

865
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,540
Oh, right.

866
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,040
That fellow.

867
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,940
Everybody goes downtown

868
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,860
and looks for bricks

869
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,440
with their family's name on it.

870
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,120
Yeah, you gotta look

871
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,120


872
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,180
Yeah, but none of those people

873
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,360
really live there anymore.

874
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,700
Well, some of them have come back.

875
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,020
And some of them

876
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,320
have their little plaque

877
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,740
that's gone.

878
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,880
Somebody actually stole

879
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
somebody else.

880
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,420
way to go with that problem.

881
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,260
The memory of someone.

882
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Somebody else, yeah.

883
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,280
And I thought,

884
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,380
I'm nicer,

885
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,300
so I just assumed

886
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,680
the screws came loose

887
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,280
in the family

888
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,520
and the thing was gone.

889
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,760
The screws came loose

890
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,540
in a lot of families,

891
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,480
but they didn't

892
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,100
lose their plaque.

893
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,120
Yeah, once a family

894
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,060
loses their plaque

895
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,300
and they're standing downtown,

896
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,100
it's pretty much over.

897
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
See, there was probably

898
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,800
eight people from his family

899
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,660
there by the time

900
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,460
the sun went down.

901
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:25,900
Wow.

902
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,680
That's worth it.

903
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,340
Yeah.

904
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,540
Oh, now you lost me.

905
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,100
I thought,

906
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,820
I thought you were still

907
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,800
talking about the old

908
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,480
shoulder bags

909
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,760
that Stan was supposed to wear.

910
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,340
Yeah.

911
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,180
I don't know if he does

912
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,480
anymore.

913
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:39,820
Well, what happened,

914
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,900
you had people walking

915
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,440
down the street

916
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,660
by the old public square.

917
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,240
Right.

918
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,600
Yeah, a couple fire marshals

919
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,220
there and some

920
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,140
scene sailors.

921
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,780
And the metal statues

922
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,680
that came to life.

923
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,280
Right, right, right.

924
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,240
The talkie-talkies

925
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,880
you call them, right?

926
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,600
The metal statues.

927
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah.

928
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,760
Yeah, and they start

929
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,820
striding down the street

930
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,540
trying to tell you

931
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,220
about old history.

932
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:57,960
And, you know,

933
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,600
Hippas has its feed bag on.

934
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:00,940
Yeah, it was

935
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,720
a pretty normal day.

936
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,140
Yeah, well,

937
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,180
what about the sea bag?

938
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:04,820
That's what got

939
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,920
my conflating going.

940
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,700
I didn't understand.

941
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,380
Cowboy Dave,

942
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,660
have you ever been here

943
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,660
to the staying ranch?

944
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,020
No.

945
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,160
Well, come on down

946
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,680
right now.

947
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,800
Okay, you can,

948
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,160
we can pretend and stuff

949
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,100
or do I have to really

950
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,920
try and figure out

951
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,680
how to use this thing?

952
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,160
Well, if you think

953
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,640
there shouldn't be

954
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
brownies left

955
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,980
when you get in.

956
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,320
But now,

957
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,120
be careful, you guys.

958
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,280
We are having a party

959
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:24,820
next week,

960
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,180
but it's only for Texans.

961
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,540
Texas subgeniuses.

962
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,380
Man.

963
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,600
We really are.

964
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,800
We really are having

965
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,720
a party next week

966
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,000
and that's all

967
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,780
we've invited.

968
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,640
So, Ohioans,

969
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,220
forget it.

970
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,460
And we got to be

971
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,180
Well, they'd have to be

972
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,460
in Texas to come

973
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,100
to the party.

974
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,500
Well, that makes sense

975
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,620
if the party's in Texas.

976
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:45,960
Yeah, and

977
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,480
Actually, they can't even be,

978
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,760
they can't be from Dallas,

979
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,180
though.

980
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,920
They can be from

981
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,420
anywhere else.

982
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,120
You're from Dallas.

983
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:52,660
Huh?

984
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,400
Yeah, like the

985
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,660
Jack Ruby homunculus.

986
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,100
Well, no,

987
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,680
I'm not really from Dallas.

988
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,740
No, you're not really

989
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,360
from Texas.

990
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,100
No.

991
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,240
No, but I did grow up here.

992
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,580
That would be a bummer.

993
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,140
But I grew up in Fort Worth.

994
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:03,840
Oh.

995
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,380
That's better.

996
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,080
Yeah.

997
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,600
Why?

998
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,840
Because it's not Dallas.

999
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh.

1000
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,180
That's the only reason.

1001
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,400
That was easy.

1002
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,520
That's absolutely it.

1003
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,620
So, did you know it

1004
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,240
as a cow town?

1005
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,180
Is it real, like,

1006
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,500
steers still going through town?

1007
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:14,780
No.

1008
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,360
Is that gone?

1009
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,660
No.

1010
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,420
When I was a little boy,

1011
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,080
it still smelled like cow.

1012
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:20,960
Cow.

1013
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,300
Yeah.

1014
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,260
Cow, cow.

1015
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,260
Because I told my dad,

1016
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,560
I went to

1017
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,220
It smelled a little bit

1018
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:24,920
like Gilroy.

1019
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,480
When we did couch talk,

1020
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,220
I told my dad,

1021
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,260
yeah, I'm going to Fort Worth.

1022
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,240
And there's this long,

1023
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,800
silent,

1024
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
because he'd seen it

1025
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,340
only as a cow town

1026
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,380
in the 1940s or something.

1027
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:34,780
He'd thought,

1028
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,260
why are you going there?

1029
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,640
They ate all the cows.

1030
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,000
Exactly.

1031
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,480
The cows were all

1032
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,200
eating them.

1033
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,640
We or mailed them.

1034
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,880
So, is the show over now

1035
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,300
or what?

1036
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:43,900
Yeah.

1037
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,920
It's been over

1038
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,940
for the last hour.

1039
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,360
Yeah.

1040
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,040
This is the good part.

1041
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:47,840
The part where

1042
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,940
you were reading

1043
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,540
or we left you here,

1044
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,200
that was the

1045
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,980
that's all we needed.

1046
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,860
Were you eating

1047
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,400
or reading?

1048
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,300
Both.

1049
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,160
Oh, at the same time?

1050
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,620
I was reading the brownies

1051
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,580
and eating a book.

1052
00:34:59,680 --> 00:34:59,820
Yeah.

1053
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,800
We started this show

1054
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,020
by,

1055
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,500
turning on all the machines

1056
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,760
and then running away

1057
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,740
and leaving Gary here

1058
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,260
by himself.

1059
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,820
And Gary's not very funny.

1060
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:08,780
Oh,

1061
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,220
from what I heard

1062
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,040
from upstairs,

1063
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,740
it was pretty,

1064
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,700
pretty lame.

1065
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,820
You were basically

1066
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,640
going on and on

1067
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,700
about how not funny

1068
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:15,940
you were

1069
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,740
and how awful

1070
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,860
it was to sit there.

1071
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:18,900
Yeah?

1072
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,400
Yeah.

1073
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,040
But,

1074
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,640
I said,

1075
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,240
okay,

1076
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,520
I'm not going to cut the show.

1077
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,380
This is not going to be

1078
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,280
one of those edited things.

1079
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm going to start it

1080
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,580
at zero o'clock

1081
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,600
and at exactly

1082
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,220
one hour

1083
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm going to shut it off.

1084
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,440
Oh my God,

1085
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,120
what time is it?

1086
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,740
It's an hour.

1087
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,440
It's been,

1088
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,160
like,

1089
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:36,980
it's 11 minutes.

1090
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,600
It's an hour and eight minutes.

1091
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,000
So,

1092
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,380
actually,

1093
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:39,980
it's been over

1094
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,800
for eight minutes.

1095
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,060
I've been taping longer.

1096
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,140
In my world,

1097
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,940
I've been taping longer.

1098
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,420
So,

1099
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,960
it's an hour and 12 minutes

1100
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,020
of my life is wasted.

1101
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,160
Yeah.

1102
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:50,600
And also,

1103
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,060
don't you think

1104
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,420
you should get

1105
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,160
Eohippus here?

1106
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,000
Eohippus?

1107
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,620
Yeah,

1108
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,420
there's an Eohippus

1109
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:55,660
running around.

1110
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,400
Well,

1111
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,620
and Princess Wee,

1112
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,960
actually,

1113
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,400
and for that matter,

1114
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,200
we love her.

1115
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,100
Eohippus.

1116
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,020
Princess?

1117
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,640
Wee-mongus.

1118
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,480
Cremongulous.

1119
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:04,940
Here,

1120
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,320
I can,

1121
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,780
why don't I get up?

1122
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,460
Okay.

1123
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:07,660
Here.

1124
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,200
No,

1125
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,380
no,

1126
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,940
you guys just sit.

1127
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,180
No,

1128
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,280
no,

1129
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,760
you get there.

1130
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,400
Wait,

1131
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:11,800
wait,

1132
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,300
you sit here.

1133
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,160
I'll sit right on your lap.

1134
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,500
It's just you and me

1135
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,040
and,

1136
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,180
uh.

1137
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,280
But isn't the show over?

1138
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:18,920
No,

1139
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,120
no.

1140
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,380
We're allowed to be on the show

1141
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,180
now that it's over?

1142
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,060
Yeah,

1143
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,240
exactly.

1144
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,340
Now that the show is over.

1145
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,140
Well,

1146
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,480
actually,

1147
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,600
it was over an hour ago.

1148
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,520
Okay,

1149
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,900
so now it's okay for us

1150
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,580
to be on it.

1151
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:28,800
Yeah,

1152
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,320
the queen,

1153
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,780
and you should be on the show now.

1154
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,660
So how does it feel

1155
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
to be an Eohippus

1156
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,580
and be on the radio

1157
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,180
right now?

1158
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,880
It feels just lovely,

1159
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,900
like floating,

1160
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,800
like floating,

1161
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,500
and having suddenly

1162
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,440
a big,

1163
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,200
a big

1164
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,120
team of people

1165
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,180
paper mache you,

1166
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,580
and then you have this outside

1167
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,820
that's all kind of,

1168
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,520
whoa,

1169
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,500
you know,

1170
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,360
like paper mache

1171
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,100
and you're floating.

1172
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,020
That's how it feels.

1173
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,640
Then they make a,

1174
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,120
they make a pinata out of you

1175
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,500
shortly afterwards.

1176
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,620
Oh my goodness.

1177
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,260
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1178
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,100
in your ears.

1179
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,040
Oh really?

1180
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,600
Um,

1181
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,940
you don't have a bat,

1182
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,340
do you?

1183
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,720
No,

1184
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,900
but I've been associated

1185
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,280
with a number of people

1186
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,480
who thought they were bats.

1187
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,440
Really?

1188
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,560
Yeah.

1189
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,840
I don't know what that means,

1190
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,080
but I think that sounds

1191
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,940
very affirmative.

1192
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,840
But why an Eohippus?

1193
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,300
Why not any other kind

1194
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,940
of extinct animal?

1195
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,980
Why not Miss Lovely Lips

1196
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,580
Mac and Jane Janet

1197
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,860
the Hippocratic Oaks?

1198
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,640
Use those headphones

1199
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,160
and dance.

1200
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,160


1201
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,180
I'll,

1202
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,240
I'll,

1203
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,240


1204
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,240


1205
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,900
I'll take this microphone.

1206
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,900
I'll take the hippocampus oath.

1207
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,480
I take the hippocampus oath,

1208
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,560
which includes the hippocampus

1209
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,580
and also the pituitary gland

1210
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,080
and the infundibulum

1211
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,540
and I,

1212
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,100
I take that oath

1213
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,700
to the hippocampus.

1214
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,940
And it will give you

1215
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,780
the cramps of the eye wigs

1216
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,420
if you do not use properly.

1217
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,780
Repeat after me.

1218
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,400
I will not use improperly.

1219
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,600
I will not use improperly.

1220
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,660
I will not use improperly.

1221
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:58,980
Yes.

1222
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,640
Yes.

1223
00:37:59,640 --> 00:37:59,780
Yes.

1224
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,040
You all can go in now.

1225
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,460
Where are we going?

1226
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,120
Where are we going?

1227
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,320
Where are we going?

1228
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,520
I was just,

1229
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,240
I was just going to ask you guys

1230
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,040
where you want to go

1231
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,740
and neither one of you

1232
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,420
had any ideas.

1233
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,020
No.

1234
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,020
Let's take that flying saucer,

1235
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,320
that red flying saucer

1236
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,460
with the yellow brim.

1237
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Oh, that's a good idea.

1238
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:19,900
Okay.

1239
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,020
I'll go with you.

1240
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,500
Are you,

1241
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,600
are you okay on that?

1242
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,420
Yeah.

1243
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,040
Am I okay?

1244
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,000
I suppose I'm okay,

1245
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,500
but I was kind of looking forward

1246
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,340
to filling mignon

1247
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,920
and potato salad on the side.

1248
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,820
Do they serve that on the saucer?

1249
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,480
If you so desire.

1250
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I thought that was part of the pitch

1251
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,360
in the grown ham.

1252
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,800
Yeah, you can get anything you want.

1253
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,060
Anything.

1254
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,460
Anything.

1255
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,280
Well, let's go up there.

1256
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,700
It's only up a little ways.

1257
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,160
You know,

1258
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,340
we can scale the side

1259
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,420
of this little wooden pegged surface

1260
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,400
and we can get up

1261
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,320
to the flying saucer.

1262
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:52,800
Yeah.

1263
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,820
That's ridiculous.

1264
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,240
You can't do that.

1265
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,300
That's totally

1266
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm doing it right now.

1267
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,300
That's totally ridiculous.

1268
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,300


1269
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,300


1270
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,300


1271
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,300


1272
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,300


1273
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,720
That's totally cool.

1274
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,620
Man.

1275
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,340
Be careful, you guys.

1276
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,760
Man.

1277
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,860
If one of you slips,

1278
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,520
that's a pretty long climb.

1279
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,680
Oh, reaching.

1280
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,360
Oh, man.

1281
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,200
I never was good.

1282
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,440
I never went to the climbing gym

1283
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,300
like I should have.

1284
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,780
I can't believe you're doing this.

1285
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,260
Me either.

1286
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,060
Man, my muscles are so weak.

1287
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,820
I thought they were much stronger.

1288
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,060
I put the climbing weight

1289
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,800
over here, Janet,

1290
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,880
and it looks like

1291
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,740
they'll know.

1292
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,260
Well, how's that?

1293
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,600
Okay.

1294
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,980
How's that saucer looking?

1295
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,620
Oh, it's just there

1296
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,760
a little bit farther

1297
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,580
and we've made it.

1298
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh.

1299
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,920
Well, you made it,

1300
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,180
actually.

1301
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,200
What condition is it in?

1302
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,340
Do you think you can

1303
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,940
get it started?

1304
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,880
Do you know how to open

1305
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,160
this thing?

1306
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,020
Does it wind up

1307
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,140
or how does it crank?

1308
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,920
Is there a crank?

1309
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,020
We have to find

1310
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,820
a big, long strand of plastic

1311
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,060
that's pushing this opening here

1312
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,540
and then we pull it out

1313
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,160
the other end

1314
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,960
and then it'll go.

1315
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,440
Where's the button

1316
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,260
you push to make it open?

1317
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,400
Oh, I see it pulls.

1318
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,540
There's gears in there.

1319
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,440
There's gears in there

1320
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,560
that get triggered

1321
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,140
by a strip of plastic

1322
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,240
getting pulled through.

1323
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,240
It's a magic plastic strip.

1324
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,100
Do you have one?

1325
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,980
No, I don't have one.

1326
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,580
I heard somewhere

1327
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,460
that you can get those

1328
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,480
from the Church of the Subgenius

1329
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,120
for only $35

1330
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,820
from Post Office Box 807

1331
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,400
Glen Rose, Texas

1332
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,200
76043.

1333
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,160
So get your magic plastic strip today.

1334
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,100
And take off

1335
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,660
in Flying Saucers

1336
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,620
from Stang Ranch.

1337
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,900
I just did that holding

1338
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,040
an ear...

1339
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,300
What do you call these little earbuds?

1340
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,120
Earbud.

1341
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,380
Against my hearing aid.

1342
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,420
Oh, wow.

1343
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:38,760
So the ear,

1344
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,080
you can't put the earbud...

1345
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,780
Hey, you guys took the headphones.

1346
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,760
Puzzling left his earbuds.

1347
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,240
Well, I've got hearing aids.

1348
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,320
I can't get the earbud

1349
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,360
into my ear

1350
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,540
because there's a damn hearing aid.

1351
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,420
The earbud's connected to the ear.

1352
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
You hold a tiny bud

1353
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,900
up against the hearing aid mic.

1354
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,000
This is the first time

1355
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
I've ever encountered this.

1356
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,580
But it's the only way to hear Dave.

1357
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,480
Without the hearing aids

1358
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,680
and the earbud.

1359
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,560
I can't hear that.

1360
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,700
I find that very interesting concept

1361
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,000
and I think if there was a way

1362
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,380
I could capitalize on that,

1363
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,580
make some money,

1364
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,920
I'd gladly do it.

1365
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,300
I'd do it in a heartbeat,

1366
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,700
but since I have no heart

1367
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,900
and no beat, no bone,

1368
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,660
and in fact,

1369
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,580
a form of sinewy meat

1370
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,320
is all I own.

1371
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,440
All,

1372
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:27,880
all,

1373
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,160
all,

1374
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,740
all I got

1375
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,600
is a lot.

1376
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,120
Never mind.

1377
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,980
Do you have a patent attorney?

1378
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,560
No, but I do have

1379
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,780
a residual railroad

1380
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,840
retirement program.

1381
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,280
I'm on the plan

1382
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,500
for five years now.

1383
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,060
Wow.

1384
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,540
I had no idea.

1385
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
He's on the five-year plan.

1386
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,280
Yes, comrade.

1387
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,820
This is five-year plan.

1388
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,580
We expect to get through

1389
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,880
one year and that's it.

1390
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,880
Well, that's a good,

1391
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,900
pretty realistic plan there,

1392
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,340
Comrade.

1393
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,460
I can be prospectus

1394
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,600
as far as I can see

1395
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,860
and you know I'm half blind

1396
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,680
to begin with.

1397
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,240
Oh, good.

1398
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm half deaf.

1399
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,360
We could be a super

1400
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,720
half-villain together.

1401
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,840
A half-villain?

1402
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,460
Yeah.

1403
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,780
Yeah, we can't be a super

1404
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,760
half-hero.

1405
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,800
Hemigod.

1406
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,540
Yeah.

1407
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:18,660
Yeah.

1408
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,660
What's my name?

1409
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,800
They're pansies anyway.

1410
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,580
And Hemigod.

1411
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,440
A Hemigod and a Demigod

1412
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,160
versus one

1413
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,860
versus two.

1414
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,140
Together?

1415
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,500
I'm going to be a right

1416
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,020
Hemigod or a left Hemigod.

1417
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,240
The right Hemigod.

1418
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,800
I'm not listening.

1419
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,440
That's not what I'm laughing at.

1420
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,920
Well, that brought on

1421
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,860
the surprising results

1422
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,200
that I had never

1423
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,420
predicted before.

1424
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,620
Really?

1425
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,020
What?

1426
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,740
No.

1427
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,380
Yeah, really.

1428
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:57,920
Of course.

1429
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,600
Of course.

1430
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,360
I'm not lying.

1431
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,240
He wasn't expecting mirth.

1432
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,040
I guess not.

1433
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,280
You should always expect mirth.

1434
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,680
I missed a bunch of that

1435
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,080
but I

1436
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,000
at one point

1437
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,400
something about superheroes

1438
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,600
and supervillains.

1439
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,200
You know,

1440
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,580
Philo started a new Facebook page

1441
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,040
called

1442
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,760
Bad Superhero

1443
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,860
and Supervillain Names.

1444
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,660
Oh.

1445
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,580
And it's a brand new Facebook page.

1446
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,280
It's like two weeks old

1447
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,480
and so far it's mostly just

1448
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,700
Philo and John Shirley

1449
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,940
and some people whose names

1450
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,840
I never heard.

1451
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,580
But you and me contributed one.

1452
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,080
It was like Repairman

1453
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,600
was the bad superhero.

1454
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,740
Oh, the loser

1455
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,480
was the bad supervillain.

1456
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,360
He was good at losing things.

1457
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,680
The Repairman,

1458
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,580
I think it was frankly

1459
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,740
based on you and me.

1460
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,940
I won't say which was which.

1461
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,780
But another one I found here

1462
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,080
that was

1463
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,900
meaner than Dracula

1464
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,220
but nicer than Trump man.

1465
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,900
That's a villain.

1466
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,920
A bad supervillain name.

1467
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,460
Meaner than Dracula

1468
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,240
but nicer than Trump man.

1469
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,260
And then there's one

1470
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,840
that Gary invented tonight

1471
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,800
at the restaurant

1472
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,180
very loudly.

1473
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,460
Face fucking Batman.

1474
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,620
And I'll leave it at that.

1475
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,100
The,

1476
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,520
the,

1477
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,400
the broadcast radio audience

1478
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,440
will have to guess

1479
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,780
Holy complexion.

1480
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,560
the first parts of the,

1481
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,660
what led up to the Batman part.

1482
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,260
But it's a type of Batman.

1483
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,140
Holy antidote pudding.

1484
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,900
FFB man,

1485
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,240
you might call it.

1486
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:39,980
Yeah,

1487
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,860
holy antidote pudding Batman.

1488
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,640
FFB man.

1489
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,020
What's up that in the air?

1490
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,580
Oh God.

1491
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,540
Close your mouth.

1492
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,640
Close your eyes.

1493
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,860
Help my face.

1494
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,960
Batman.

1495
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,700
Holy.

1496
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:54,820
Yeah.

1497
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,400
Holy antidote pudding Batman.

1498
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,240
Okay.

1499
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,500
And on that note,

1500
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,140
I think we can bring

1501
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,300
a thankful close

1502
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,060
to this hour of slack.

1503
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,800
Number 1,670.

1504
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,740
Three or two or one.

1505
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,020
That's it.

1506
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,660
Dave, are you okay?

1507
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,060
I'm,

1508
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,360
I'm going to sleep now.

1509
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,880
That's the wise thing to do.

1510
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,160
Sleep well, Dave.

1511
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:24,640
Good night.

1512
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1513
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1514
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1515
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1516
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1517
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1518
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1519
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1520
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:24,640


1521
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,420
According to this week,

1522
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,900
we ended the show

1523
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,620
an hour and 18 minutes ago.

1524
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:28,900
Sleep well, Dave.

1525
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,380
Dave Sleepwell

1526
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,320
has been our guest.

1527
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,040
Thank you.

1528
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,980
Dave Sleepwell indeed.

1529
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,780
With Sleepwell tablets,

1530
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,800
you'll be asleep

1531
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,860
in no time at all.

1532
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,480
Many Dave hearts

1533
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,580
lie asleep in the deep.

1534
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,340
Stop the rest of it.

1535
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,640
Why are you being mad?

1536
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,660
My grandfather wrote a novel

1537
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,980
called Many Dave Hearts.

1538
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,000
Oh, look, he's gone.

1539
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,600
He went under.

1540
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,700
He'll be back next week.

1541
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,280
Don't worry.

1542
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,820
I'm sorry that song ended up.

1543
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,060
That was really going places.

1544
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,480
Which song?

1545
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,120
Earbuds connected to the

1546
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,280
hearing aid.

1547
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,060
Oh, God.

1548
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,740
Hearing aids connected to the

1549
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:16,940
Sick.

1550
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,920
That's not funny.

1551
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,620
How about Superman?

1552
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,780
Superman.

1553
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,580
Superman.

1554
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:24,840
Superman.

1555
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,260
Yeah.

1556
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,440
Face meets versus

1557
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,480
face fucking Batman.

1558
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,360
Or super woman.

1559
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,140
Well, there was a super woman.

1560
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,600
They just haven't gotten around

1561
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,220
to making that movie yet.

1562
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:40,900
Superman.

1563
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,260
Superman.

1564
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:42,580
Superman.

1565
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,460
Superman.

1566
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,360
Wake up, Superman.

1567
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,260
Wake up.

1568
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:49,840
Get us to fly.

1569
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,760
Superman.

1570
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,360
Where is Superman

1571
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,480
when we need it?

1572
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:54,640
Superman.

1573
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,820
In the gutter.

1574
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:56,980
Flat on his face.

1575
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:57,580
Again.

1576
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,040
Well, he's like

1577
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,700
Filbert Desinex, you know?

1578
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:00,820
Desinex?

1579
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,080
Filbert Desinex.

1580
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,280
I don't know about Desinex.

1581
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,500
He's the alter ego

1582
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,660
of Wonder Warthog.

1583
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,140
Desinex?

1584
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,440
He's a total miserable

1585
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,740
failure at everything.

1586
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:11,980
Oh, right.

1587
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,120
Yeah, the narc.

1588
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:14,520
Filbert Desinex.

1589
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,920
Yeah, he was a cop.

1590
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,300
He was like a DEA agent.

1591
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:17,740
No, no.

1592
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,680
That was the other.

1593
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,880
No, there was.

1594
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,760
Oh, there is the.

1595
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,540
Yeah, Filbert Desinex

1596
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,700
was like a cop.

1597
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,060
Oh, was he the guy

1598
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:26,520
who was trying to.

1599
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:26,560
No, no.

1600
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,100
There's the other guy

1601
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,440
with the Dick Tracy chin.

1602
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,100
Right.

1603
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,260
Well, he was always

1604
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:31,820
trying to bust

1605
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,840
the Free Freak Brothers.

1606
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,420
No, that was

1607
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
Norbert the narc.

1608
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,480
Oh, God, man.

1609
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,880
I'm so out of it.

1610
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,780
That was funny.

1611
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,800
Please don't tell Gilbert.

1612
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,940
Don't tell Gilbert, please.

1613
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,480
Don't tell Paul either.

1614
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,560
That was the.

1615
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,760
You'll know I didn't study

1616
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,240
my rip-off press

1617
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,580
underground comic books.

1618
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,220
I remembered it.

1619
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,460
J.R.R.

1620
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:53,740
I remember it.

1621
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
I remember it.

1622
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:55,680
Price Bob.

1623
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,700
Are you sitting comfortably?

1624
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,520
Then we'll begin.

1625
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,500
Another day.

1626
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,980
Another man.

1627
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,220
The white hot heat

1628
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,120
of a woman possessed.

1629
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,120
Possessed of an uncontrollable

1630
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,240
and natural passion.

1631
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,660
So all consuming

1632
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,360
is to make the flames of hell

1633
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,560
mere glowing embers.

1634
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,840
The insatiable depraved hunger

1635
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,000
of a woman shorn

1636
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,020
of her mask of fidelity

1637
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,960
and respectability

1638
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,460
and buried for what she really is.

1639
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,440
A crazed female animal

1640
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,220
on the prowl.

1641
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,800
A dehumanized creature

1642
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,100
grasping and clawing

1643
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,260
for instant gratification

1644
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,460
from any source.

1645
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,900
Now you got to go out there

1646
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,980
and you got to get the best ones

1647
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,820
you can find.

1648
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,980
And you gotta work them broads

1649
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,840
like nobody's ever worked them before.

1650
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,600
And never forget.

1651
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,740
Anybody can control a woman's body.

1652
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,000
See?

1653
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,800
But the key is to control the mind.

1654
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,460
Here I am.

1655
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,460


1656
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,460


1657
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,460


1658
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:54,460


1659
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,580
I'm working my ass off

1660
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,860
and he's spending my money

1661
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,920
on some trashy white bitch.

1662
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,340
You better be quiet

1663
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,700
otherwise you go out.

1664
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,960
There's a big difference

1665
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,820
in having a baby

1666
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,720
and us getting married.

1667
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,020
I don't see why.

1668
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,440
Because we're still brother and sister

1669
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,260
and that's a fact.

1670
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,560
You done it

1671
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,300
and I know you did.

1672
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,160
No.

1673
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,080
It wasn't my secret, you hear?

1674
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,380
And just what have you done

1675
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,800
to deserve what you're calling love?

1676
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,740
The girl stalked by men

1677
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,400
fights like a wildcat.

1678
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,020
Oh, I'm so horny.

1679
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,440
Gotta teach her how to love.

1680
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,520
Teach that chick a lesson.

1681
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,280
Gonna give her a real scare.

1682
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,140
That bad broad is never gonna mix up

1683
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,180
a top stud again.

1684
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,940
Why are you afraid of me, huh?

1685
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,320
Tell me.

1686
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,340
I mean, why are you so scared of me?

1687
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,120
We're not gonna hurt you too much.

1688
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,100
Just maybe a little at first

1689
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,660
and then you'll see how good it is

1690
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,980
being one of my girls.

1691
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,920
Being one of my girls is good.

1692
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,880
Gets you special favors

1693
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,280
and keeps others away.

1694
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,420
Yes, I got it.

1695
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:54,620
Yes sir!

1696
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,080
Yes sir!

1697
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,540
Yes sir!

1698
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:56,980
Yes sir!

1699
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,320
Yes sir, yes sir!

1700
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,180
Yes sir, yes sir!

1701
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,520
Yes huh!

1702
00:49:59,520 --> 00:49:59,960
Yes sir, yes sir!

1703
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,240
Hahaha!

1704
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,380
Yes sir!

1705
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:01,400


1706
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:01,400


1707
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,320
Woo!

1708
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,720
Yah!

1709
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,360
Hehe!

1710
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,140
I'm grateful, I'm grateful.

1711
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, haha!

1712
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1713
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:11,780
Woo!

1714
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,060
I began having vivid, detailed memories

1715
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,140
of being used as a sex slave.

1716
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,480
The truth is, that there are slave auctions

1717
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,980
that very elite people attend.

1718
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:31,160
to be able to own and buy the best mind control slaves that money can buy.

1719
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:35,960
Jumping young teeny boppers get with it to the savage feet of the big blast.

1720
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,600
A red hot mob of rambunctious tiger kittens on the prowl.

1721
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,220
They are the fire that blows up your blood to the boiling point.

1722
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,920
Masturbation has also been documented as a useful practice in the treatment of sexual dysfunctions.

1723
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:57,160
If the woman has gonorrhea or syphilis, as she probably has, you must now do these things as quickly as possible.

1724
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,340
First, urinate. Pass your water.

1725
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,260
Second, wash your hands, your penis, and the surrounding skin and hair thoroughly with soap and water.

1726
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,920
Third, get to the nearest prophylactic station for a treatment.

1727
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,100
Hey, hey, now. Careful down there, ma'am.

1728
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,480
If you bite it, you and I is going to have a set to it.

1729
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,440
And if you don't, we ain't gonna have enough corn left for shocking.

1730
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,040
Papel para mi culo.

1731
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:26,920
Que necio.

1732
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,680
Just think of pleasing him more and more and more.

1733
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:41,540
Father, I feel scared and a bit funny.

1734
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:46,060
Thank you, chief. Thank you, chief. Tell him I know I wasn't worth it.

1735
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,220
Holy high five.

1736
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,580
But...

1737
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,600
Hip, hip, high-five!

1738
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:04,680
Watch out forもし do you.

1739
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:04,680


1740
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:04,820
Hey, hey.

1741
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,380
Sh unlikeuto, hey actually.

1742
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:12,380


1743
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,620
See, now ya got me.

1744
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,660
You're fucking meaning it.

1745
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,860
We'll be right back.

1746
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,420
We'll be right back.

1747
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,120
We'll be right back.

1748
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,460
And that was Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1749
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,660
From PR News in Washington, I'm E. Noon.

1750
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,720
Hi.

1751
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,240
Hi.

1752
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:49,360
Hi.

1753
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,120
So, what do you do?

1754
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,880
I do not.

1755
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,620
Well, you're lucky.

1756
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,000
Yes.

1757
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,660
Yes!

1758
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,040
Wow.

1759
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,140
So, ready to play?

1760
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:57,760
Yep.

1761
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,580
Here is your first Twitter phrase.

1762
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,080
I get wet.

1763
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
I can't get.

1764
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:03,540
Yes.

1765
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,900
No, wait a minute.

1766
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,260
Oh, right!

1767
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,140
Here, Leah, is your next Twitter phrase.

1768
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,320
I can now use my power.

1769
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,980
You say that with such sadness.

1770
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,700
All right, here is your last Twitter phrase.

1771
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,480
A baby dog.

1772
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,540
Yes.

1773
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:19,440
Baby?

1774
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,700
Your little idiotic baby dog is embarrassing.

1775
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:29,720
Intelligent baby dogs tested scientists, and it turns out they are more likely to interact with idiotic baby intelligent dogs from the University of York.

1776
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,720
Congratulations!

1777
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,240
Thanks.

1778
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,460
Now it's time for our final answer.

1779
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,180
Bill, can you give us the score?

1780
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,120
Three, four.

1781
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:41,840
Go.

1782
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,260
Right, go.

1783
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,280
Fill in the blank.

1784
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:43,740
Blank.

1785
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,080

00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,540
Blanked on Tuesday.

Right.

1789
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:46,240
Good.

1790
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,380
This week's a New York blank.

1791
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Another powerful blank.

1792
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,040
I can now use my power.

1793
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:52,920
Yeah.

1794
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:53,700
On Sunday.

1795
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:54,040
Blank.

1796
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:54,380
Yes.

1797
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,980
This week the big blank.

1798
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,120
And this is true.

1799
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,680

00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,240
Uh, right on Tuesday.

00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:08,720
Blank.

1803
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,000
Right.

1804
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,180
After a contentious blank.

1805
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:10,720
Right.

1806
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,060
After passing a giant blank.

1807
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,460
After blank.

1808
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,140
Right.

1809
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:15,800
This week a blank.

1810
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,240
That's exactly blank.

1811
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,020
Exactly.

1812
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,220
And how do we know about blank?

1813
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,700
Well, you're not gonna believe blank.

1814
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,260
Right.

1815
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,980
On Monday it was reported that blanks.

1816
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,640
Right.

1817
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,100
On Monday a government blanked.

1818
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,660
Right.

1819
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,580
According to new research blank.

1820
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:30,500
Yes.

1821
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,280
This week blank.

1822
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,980
Yes.

1823
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,020
This week English blank.

1824
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:33,960
Yes!

1825
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,840
That's exactly right.

1826
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,560
Bachelor scandal.

1827
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,760
But first let me tell you that's a PR.

1828
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,620
It comes from PR stations and dot dot com and Doug dot org.

00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:55,920


1833
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,900
High ground.

Right.

1837

Your derive

1838
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,440
Tool.

1839
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,980
道也者可须于礼也,可离非道也。

1840
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,740
恃故君子戒这乌其所不足,恐惧乌其所不闻。

1841
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:32,480
莫羡乌云,莫羡乌尾,祝君子善行行也。

1842
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:43,340
喜怒哀乐之未发,未知终,发而皆终结,未知何。

1843
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,540
终也者天下之大人也,何也者天下之大道也。

1844
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,940
至终何天地未定,万物未天。

1845
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,460
须须悲哀乐之未发,未知何。

1846
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,080
恃故君子戒这乌其所不足,恐惧乌其所不闻。

1847
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,020
恃故君子戒这乌其所不闻。
