1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,120
Howdy there, Bob. How you feeling?

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,620
Oh, now, Bob.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,500
Well, now, if you're so anxious to help Crow-Bait Bob,

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,860
why don't you go out and pay some of his bills around town?

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,980
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,240
Well, I'd suggest that you get a room at the Dodge House

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,160
and think about your sins.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,860
The Self-Genius Power of Swatch.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,500
Well.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,360
Well, you know, I kind of think old Crow-Bait Bob might approve of that.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm returning to normal without permission.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Iran's president is running out of propellant.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,220
Pani told an audience in northeastern Iran that PR News will certainly increase.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,140
The messenger space program

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,700
will crash into the planet.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,900
NASA's messenger plans to slam into the lopsided planet,

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,300
ending its memorable PR News.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,480
The Colorado Department of Transportation told employees

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,760
that British aviation authorities are people with drones.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
There's no pilot.

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,120
Officials say drones are flying over congested areas or close to buildings,

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,140
including one that came close to a PR News landing in Washington.

23
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,020
Attention.

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,400
Attention.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,140
You may be entitled to a curfew.

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,220
You may govern a contended life by effort.

Just taking body fat for only $29.95.

41
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
It really does. It does.

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,820
Or your money back.

43
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,520
But you must call right now because this is not available.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,200
Attention, call now.

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,620
Attention, now.

Call now.

47
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,740
But wait, free.

48
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,980
Good afternoon, doctor.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,940
Sit down, Mr. Howard.

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,360
What have you got to tell me?

51
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,380
In your case, my boy, diagnosis is extremely difficult.

52
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,880
But the examination you made this morning, the x-rays.

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,180
Examination discloses one condition, pressure upon certain parts of the brain.

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,660
This condition, coupled with your belief that the moon can bring about a change, accomplishes exactly that.

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,060
During the period in which your reasoning processes give way to self-hypnosis,

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,720
the glands which govern your metabolism...

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,140
Get out of here.

58
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,340
...are under control.

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,220
Like Steve mentioned, without a balance wheel.

60
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:50,920
When this happens, the glands generate an abnormal supply of certain hormones.

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,480
In your case, those which bring about the physical transformation which you experience.

62
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,480
Explaining it doesn't help.

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,320
What can you do about it?

64
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,740
Operate?

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,280
A surgical operation to enlarge the cranial cavity is a long and dangerous one.

66
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,280
Then there's nothing you can do to help me.

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,560
There might be.

68
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,200
Come here, my boy.

69
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,340
Under tropical conditions, which we've tried to duplicate here,

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:23,220
this hybrid plant, the varia formosa, produces a mold from which we've been able to distill...

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,640
Well, a substance which possesses the property of softening any hard structure composed of calcium salts.

72
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,060
Bone, for instance.

73
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,060
With this medium, it might be possible without surgery to reshape the cranial cavity and thus eliminate the pressure.

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,180
You can do that now?

75
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,700
Yes.

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,000
Can you?

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,840
Unfortunately, it'll take some time to produce mold in sufficient quantity.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,820
Tonight the moon will be full again.

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,380
Time after time, people have tried to help me.

80
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,780
Time after time, they've failed.

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,220
If this fails, I...

82
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,700
It won't fail, Larry. You must believe that it won't.

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,120
I've tried to.

84
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,000
But when I face the night...

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,680
Try to see the night as something more.

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,020
Beautiful.

87
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
Until the full moon turns it into a thing of ugliness and horror.

88
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,060
Soon you'll see it as everyone else does.

89
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,420
Restful, tranquil, and serene.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:34,020
Until that time comes, I'll live a thousand hopes, die a thousand times.

91
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,320
It'll never be ugly to you again, Larry. Believe me, I know it.

92
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,320


93
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,040
How do you know that?

94
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,820
My heart tells me.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,120
Wow.

96
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,140
Perfect.

97
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,160
Nicholas Dankjevic, Prince of POFA.

98
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,080
I really like my weight.

99
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,260
I like my legs.

100
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,920
Every time I wear a skirt, I always keep tugging it down because I think my thighs are fat.

101
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,500
Once everyone hits the bit.

102
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,300
I grew up in collisions with these women for years.

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,120
Barbie, you're beautiful

104
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,480
You make me feel

105
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,780
My Barbie doll is really real

106
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,880
Barbie's small and so petite

107
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,120
Her clothes and figure look so neat

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,880
Her dancing outfit rings a bell

109
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,220
At parties she will cast a spell

110
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,600
Purses, hats, and gloves galore

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,840
And all the gadgets gal's adore

112
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,220
And so they starve themselves and they work out like crazy?

113
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,700
Barbie dressed for swim and fun is only $3

114
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,400
Her lovely fashions range from $1 to $5

115
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,260
Look for Barbie wherever dolls are sold

116
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,100
Start thinking all the time in your head

117
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,300
I'm fat, I'm fat, I'm fat

118
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,760
Someday I'm gonna be exactly like you

119
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,560
Till then I know just what I'll do

120
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,340
Barbie, beautiful Barbie

121
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,180
I'll make believe that I am you

122
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,680
Barbie could never be that

123
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,320
Unless I went to unhealthy means to get that

124
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,660
And it's not worth it

125
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,580
I wanna be skinny

126
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,580
Everyone's worried about what other people think

127
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,480
You can tell it's Mattel, it's swell

128
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,340
You're skinny

129
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,460
And it's just, it's not fit

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,600
You're look younger, smaller, lighter, taller, tighter, thinner, softer

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,460
Barbie, you're beautiful

132
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,940
You make me feel

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,160
My Barbie doll is really real

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,900
Women are looking at bodies like that going

135
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,520
My stomach doesn't look like that

136
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,660
I'm supposed to look like that?

137
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,960
Barbie, you're beautiful

138
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,580
Barbie, you're beautiful

139
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,420
You are my harbor

140
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:40,500
Not like other women

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,620

And I mean by that the greatest of all love.

151
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm not talking about that love you see on TV

152
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,440
or in the movies or read about in the back section of the magazine rack.

153
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm not talking about sex.

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,800
If you don't already know about sex, you're in the wrong church, friends.

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,580
Go to one of them non-industrial churches.

156
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,580
If you're afraid of sex, they'll just fuck with your mind.

157
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,240
Everyone here should be experts in intercourse.

158
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,940
But we don't want your mind, friends.

159
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,840
Here at the Church of the Subgenius, our heads are big enough as it is.

160
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,340
No, what we want is your money.

161
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,740
And we don't want your money for ourselves.

162
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,800
No, no, no.

163
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,400
We want it so that you won't.

164
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,920
That's right, friends.

165
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,180
There's nothing wrong with having money.

166
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs' very own words said,

167
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,340
In money we trust.

168
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,620
No, friends, the problem is wanting money.

169
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,240
Like the...

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,100
Good book he says,

171
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,340
The love of money is the root to all slacklessness.

172
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,980
See, a lot of folks think the saying is,

173
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,820
Money is the root.

174
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,740
But that's just disinformation, friends, put out by the conspiracy in order to confuse you.

175
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,860
It's the love of money that loses you slack.

176
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,500
And believe me, if there's one subject in the conspiracy wants to confuse you with,

177
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,700
it's the desire for money.

178
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,820
Because it's that desire for cash that fuels the conspiracy,

179
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,840
and enslaves 99.9% of the human race.

180
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,300
And yes, even a few unwary subgenies.

181
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,220
You get so wrapped up chasing those pieces of paper around,

182
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,100
that you're too busy to see the conspiracy has got you wrapped around its little finger, heart, body, and soul.

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,460
You're so busy working for money, that you forgot money is supposed to work for you.

184
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,280
And that's the good news, friends.

185
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,240
There is a way out of the rat race.

186
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,640
Through the conspiracy.

187
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,480
Money made.

188
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
There is a key.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,980
There is an answer.

190
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,140
And J.R. Bob Dobbs has often thought aloud,

191
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,540
Life is a game.

192
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,140
And you can play by their rules, or you can play by your own rules.

193
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,440
But if you play by your own rules, friends,

194
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,380
you can always get away with cheating.

195
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,640
That's right.

196
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,420
See, the conspiracy has got you going around that monopoly board, friends, in circles.

197
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,440
Hoping to pass goal and collect that lousy $200.

198
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,960
You're just trying to last until the end of the week, friends.

199
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,700
Trying to collect that chintzy little ass paycheck.

200
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,020
Praying all the while not to land on someone else's property.

201
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,240
Especially if they have hotels.

202
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:34,980
Yes, sir.

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,460
After that happens a few times, it's game over now, isn't it?

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,980
That's because they've got you playing by their rules.

205
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
But why not make up a few of your own rules, friends?

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's only fair.

207
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Why should the conspiracy get the monopoly board?

208
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,300
Why should it monopolize all the laws?

209
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,800
It's supposed to be a democracy.

210
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,600
Hell, you already got free parking now, friends.

211
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,780
What does that tell you?

212
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,880
And we know how good it feels to land on that free parking now, don't we?

213
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,480
And you collect that big pot of money in the middle?

214
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,740
Yes, sirree.

215
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,780
But do you think they, the conspiracy, would let you enjoy that little bit of slack deliberately?

216
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,160
Hell no!

217
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,120
It was J.R. Bobstob's idea.

218
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,200
And it pissed them off so much that they expressly forbid the practice,

219
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,300
and their rule book.

220
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,260
I kid you not.

221
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
Look it up if you doubt it.

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,760
You know what they, the conspiracy, say should happen when you land on free parking?

223
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,880
Nothing!

224
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,320
Nothing at all!

225
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,440
That's right!

226
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,220
It's just supposed to be free parking.

227
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,600
Like a day of rest, Sunday, to pacify you.

228
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,100
So you'll calm down and then go around the board for another week,

229
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
and put up with the conspiracy bullshit.

230
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,280
Well, friends, that's not good enough now, is it?

231
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,700
Hell no!

232
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,760
That's not how Bob Dob plays the game.

233
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,560
And that's not how you have to play it either.

234
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,140
But some of you out there are probably wondering,

235
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,440
and you're thinking aloud,

236
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,080
Father Joe Mama, how come Bob's changed that rule for us,

237
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,440
but he hasn't changed the other rules?

238
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,180
Well, friends, I'm glad you asked that.

239
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,060
Because Bob wants you to think for yourself.

240
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,340
He doesn't want to rule your lives,

241
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,580
but he doesn't want the conspiracy to rule it either.

242
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,720
He wants you to rule your own life.

243
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,940
And that's why he's giving you a hand instead of a handout.

244
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,160
Like Bob Dob says,

245
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,980
many a time, you can lead a man to slack,

246
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,800
but you can't make him use it.

247
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,260
He doesn't want to lease you slack.

248
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,440
He wants you to own your very own.

249
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,000
The next rule to break is up to you.

250
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,820
Imagine the possibilities!

251
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,400
Why not agree that when you land on someone else's property,

252
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,040
you give each other no fees, no fines,

253
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,120
just good neighborly hospitality?

254
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,360
Or better yet, make the state pay the fee,

255
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,640
and abolish taxes while you're at it?

256
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,700
You can do it, friends.

257
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,360
You'll make the rules.

258
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,300
Remember free parking?

259
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,500
The possibilities are endless.

260
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,020
Now instead of trading going around the block,

261
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,220
you're actually looking forward to it.

262
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,520
Now you're having fun with the game

263
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
instead of the game having fun with you.

264
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,800
Now instead of minding the masters,

265
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,580
you've become master of your own mind.

266
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,940
Now instead of being a board player,

267
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,700
you're chairman of the board.

268
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,920
Now every time is your move.

269
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,640
Now you're using the money instead of the money using you.

270
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,320
Bob turned around all this a long, long time ago, friends.

271
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,980
He also learned that it takes money to make money.

272
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,500
That's exactly what he wants to do now.

273
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,480
Take your money so that you can make more of it.

274
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,540
Show the conspiracy that they no longer have charge of your charge card.

275
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,580
Take it out! Take it out of your wallet right now!

276
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,060
And cut it in half! Send it to us, friends!

277
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,680
Be sure to include both halves.

278
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,840
And also avoid cutting it vertically there.

279
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,900
You don't want to do that.

280
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,860
If you damage the Mad Max Strike, we'll burn that sucker for you.

281
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,860
I promise!

282
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,480
Or better yet, just send us cold, hard cash.

283
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,720
Or sign checks.

284
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,240
We'll even fill them out for you.

285
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,820
Hell, we don't care about the money.

286
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,140
You think we'd be the first church to pay taxes if we cared about money?

287
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,680
No!

288
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
We only want to show the conspiracy you don't care about money.

289
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,020
In fact, I'll personally make sure that money is not spent on anything tangible.

290
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,420
That number is on your screen.

291
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,340
Send that money in and praise Bob, amen!

292
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,620
The Miracle of America.

293
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,540
You are a true believer.

294
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, I like money.

295
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,340
Blessings of the state.

296
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,540
Yeah!

297
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,640
How many billions?

298
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,420
Blessings of the massive.

299
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,400
Vow all to such.

300
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,680
But a fundamental part of the American way is our economic system.

301
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,220
I like money.

302
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,060
I like money, though.

303
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,540
Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.

304
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,500
I like pride.

305
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:39,860
Work hard.

306
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Increase production.

307
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,740
Prevent accidents.

308
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,740
And we can afford that.

309
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,120
And ...

310
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,440
Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers,

311
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,640
but the American economic system has brought greater material means for happiness to more

312
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,740
people than any other system the world has ever known.

313
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,100
All of us should work to defend and improve this system.

314
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,780
Yeah!

315
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,720
You are a true believer.

316
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,380
And the best way to defend and improve our economic system is to learn how it works.

317
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,620
Oh, I like money.

318
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,620
You are a true believer.

319
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,400
Blessings of the state.

320
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,060
My time is yours.

321
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,860
Go ahead.

322
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,860
Yes, fine.

323
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,240
Yes.

324
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,480
We're on the cheetah.

325
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,100
Oh, I like money.

326
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,140
Could you be more specific?

327
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,320
It is on EasyPay.

328
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,100
Lori, take it away.

329
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,180
And what you're getting is you are getting all five of these pieces plus the tote.

330
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
I know you're looking, you're blinking.

331
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,820
Money.

332
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,360
Money, money, money.

333
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,300
It's all about money.

334
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Actually, our theme for tonight is not so much money, but body image and daylight savings time.

335
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,220
We heard the wolfman there having problems with his body image.

336
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,500
And some idiotic doctor trying to explain it scientifically.

337
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,700
We all know that the wolfman is simply cursed.

338
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,980
It's as simple as that.

339
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:24,560
And then some girl trying to act like she was going to love him.

340
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:31,540
But the collage we just heard about marketing was from our new collagist, Reverend Lee Carlton.

341
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,220
He also did the Barbie vomit collage.

342
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,900
That was some of our body image stuff.

343
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,160
We heard the preacher.

344
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,100
Papa Joe Mama.

345
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,440
And we heard collages by Lee Murr at the beginning.

346
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,280
And now we should be hearing loathsome cowpoke Dave.

347
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,880
I hope.

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,800
I hope.

349
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,420
Hello?

350
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,520
Oh, please let it be Dave.

351
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm having a suspenseful moment.

352
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,360
I've got Dave turned up all the way.

353
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,500
It says.

354
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,060
Oh, no.

355
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,580
You want to?

356
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:09,980
This.

357
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,320
No.

358
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,280
Is this Dave?

359
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Can you hear me?

360
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,700
Is that Dave?

361
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:13,980
Yes.

362
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,680
Now I can.

363
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,700
I can hear you.

364
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,700
I can hear you.

365
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:18,840
Oh.

366
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,200
Dave.

367
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,820
Well, that's good because I assumed you could to begin with.

368
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,220
And then I got doubtful there for, you know.

369
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:31,300
Well, Dave, I don't know if you knew about the new board at the station.

370
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,460
It's got a new mix board.

371
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,040
No, I did not know.

372
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,880
And I just pushed the wrong button for the very first time.

373
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,400
But maybe.

374
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,140
Maybe I won't do it again.

375
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,580
We really did.

376
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,000
They really did install a brand new, very fancy board in the station.

377
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:57,480
And it's a little confusing for a subgenius, a little subgenius man to try to figure it out.

378
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,080
And, of course, it didn't help that the conspiracy changed our time control or our time anyway.

379
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,340
No.

380
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,200
What happened here, too, briefly, because the inner uterus device I was using.

381
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,580
I misplanned it as usual on my forehead.

382
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,580
And it just didn't start to stink for a little while.

383
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,240
So I became a little, you know, got a little angry.

384
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,380
I looked up in the dictionary.

385
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:27,340
And he's called it's a social phobia called called platysma or platasma or something like that.

386
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:39,340
And it may be referred to the church as a subgenius as a hothouse or a whorehouse den of iniquity or something of propagating these kind of refugees from various parts of the.

387
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,200
Uh.

388
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,920
You know, the devices.

389
00:18:44,100 --> 00:19:02,940
Well, we've always said, send us your raggedy, your your your stinking of frop, your your spoiled rich kids, your bored rich kids, your easily influenced gullible rich kids.

390
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,280
Yeah, that's what we want him want sent to us.

391
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
So would you like to put them like.

392
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:20,920
In a kind of a poor sign form, like if you had a herd of pigs and you had them right between the third rail of the, you know, the old country or backyard fence there and stuff like that.

393
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,060
And, you know, like like Ned Bain, Red Bain, Ned Bain and Deliverance or something like that.

394
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:34,500
Well, only they were all students of the they're all theosophists and students of theosophy.

395
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,120
Well, one thing that makes them so susceptible to cultish programming is their.

396
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Is the fact that they already think of themselves as pigs, especially oddly enough, the richer and more.

397
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,820
I don't know.

398
00:19:50,920 --> 00:20:00,560
Good looking or the people who inherited a lot of stuff that they didn't earn seem to often have the worst body images.

399
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,700
They think they're pigs when they are in their souls.

400
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,360
But they think it's you know, they all think they're too fat.

401
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,640
Have you noticed that?

402
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
They all think they're too fat.

403
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,120
Even the fat ones think they're too fat.

404
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,220
And it's it's the Wolfman had that problem.

405
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,720
All the fat ones are the worst of them all, my lad.

406
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,980
They grow everywhere on radios, on the trees.

407
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,140
I mean, you see them, you smell them, but you can rarely touch them.

408
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,520
And just like this, that they're gone.

409
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,520
Well, one way the conspiracy controls you is.

410
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,820
Of course, they have space control over you.

411
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,820
They control your mind.

412
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,440
They make ladies and girls think that they're supposed to look like Barbie.

413
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,660
And so that's what you might call space control.

414
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:01,140
And then as they did at two o'clock in the morning, they change the time and make it leap forward with daylight savings time.

415
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,100
And that's how they do time control on us.

416
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,300
You know, they never explained why they passed all those laws.

417
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:23,780
And I guess Richard Nixon was one of them as an early, early representative was one of the first things he got to sign on to was a bunch of daylight savings time, which I think came right after World War Two.

418
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:35,340
Well, they and Nixon did do the fifty five mile an hour speed limit nationwide, which was about as popular as a subgenius in a punch party.

419
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,700
But God.

420
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,360
Gee, you know, people people didn't put up with the fifty five mile an hour thing for very long.

421
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:53,440
I wish I kind of you know, a lot of people would hate me for saying that, but I wish they'd make the maximum speed limit about 30.

422
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
But I don't expect that to happen.

423
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:03,300
And I don't expect the world, the world's humans to have water to drink in the next 50 years.

424
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,280
There's a lot of things I'm glad I won't live to see, but I'm afraid they're going to stick with this daylight savings.

425
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,180
Time thing.

426
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,780
Yeah.

427
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,080
Well, it was an overt attempt to control the minds of many to just a simple act of Congress.

428
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:32,180
Like we're going to have every day, every third Thursday of every fourth month, everybody's going to have to, you know, expel gas for some cause, either distant or united or based on any sort of collateral damage.

429
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,100
You say you have to expel gas.

430
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,560
Oh, you will have to.

431
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,160
You know, it's.

432
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
You'll be expected.

433
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,280
You'll be expected.

434
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,280


435
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,480
You'll be expected to.

436
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,000
It'll be.

437
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,320
If you want to graduate from high school, they'll have these huge burping contests or something like that.

438
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,120
I could have won that.

439
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,680
I don't know.

440
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,320
I can only.

441
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,900
Pardon?

442
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,760
I can burp anytime I want.

443
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,900
How's that, man?

444
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,800
Oh, am I supposed to do that on the radio?

445
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,720
I can't remember.

446
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,200
I was demonstrating my mutant X-Men talent.

447
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:06,040
Actually, it's more of a it's the kind of talent that makes you want to join Magneto instead of Dr. Xavier.

448
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,280
But yeah, and I've.

449
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,580
It runs in my family.

450
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,060
My niece is able to belch.

451
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,160
Oh, she's way surpassed her teacher.

452
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,640
Me.

453
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,300
Yeah.

454
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,560
I have one niece who also couldn't burp all songs.

455
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,100
Yeah, it's amazing.

456
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,240
I used to be able to do that, but I have the problem of it getting trapped.

457
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,500
I can't get it all out.

458
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,600
I can inhale with my stomach, but I can't exhale all the way sometimes.

459
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,400
And then when it's stuck in there, it's that's a problem.

460
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,180
Well, that's some kind of.

461
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:38,680
Frisbee.

462
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,180
Yeah, the Frisbee.

463
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:48,920
Frisbee of the colorectal thermometer that you might have inadvertently given me somebody for a birthday.

464
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,160
You know.

465
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,340
Well, all I know is I'm really proud of my my my niece.

466
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:06,820
And the thing that makes me the proudest is one day my sister, the mother of this high school kid, went to a.

467
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,260
Well, I.

468
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,260


469
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,260


470
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,260


471
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,260


472
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,260


473
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,260


474
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,380
Like an open house or something.

475
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,260
PTA meeting.

476
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,820
A PTA meeting.

477
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:18,380
And the teacher came up to her and said, well, Claire's doing real well, even though despite her condition.

478
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,760
And my sister goes, her condition?

479
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,260
He goes, well, you know, the burping.

480
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,460
And my sister went, oh, yes, it's sad, isn't it?

481
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,940
Because the kid had convinced the teacher that it was a condition that she had no control over.

482
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,640
And therefore she could just sit right in the middle.

483
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,600
She got bored in class.

484
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,020
She would just let out a huge belch.

485
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:52,900
If only she could have been like the great Lepetimane and and inhaled from both ends that way and then let it out.

486
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:53,860
Bloodlines.

487
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,380
Dang.

488
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,760
Geez.

489
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
You know, that's what we need to do.

490
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:57,600
I agree.

491
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,280
And I need to track down the descendants of Lepetimane, the sons of Lepetimane.

492
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,380
And I don't mean the band Sons of Lepetimane.

493
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,400
That was Philo's band for a while.

494
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,140
But first there will be like these monkey looking creatures or no, they'll have leprechauns before that.

495
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,660
And then they'll have like these creatures who are like one big huge eye in the middle of their forehead and stuff.

496
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,280
They still look kind of like a monkey.

497
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,060
Be kind of pretty shaggy for him.

498
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,500
You know, Dave's become a creationist, Princess.

499
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,660
We wow.

500
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,660
Yes, he's.

501
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,360
That's the creationist line.

502
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,100
Oh, man.

503
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,280
Huh?

504
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,320
That man man was originally a sloth.

505
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
Oh, no.

506
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,920
That man.

507
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:46,880
And unicorns and dragons all frolicked in the Garden of Eden until there just wasn't any room on Noah's Ark for the really large ones like the dinosaurs.

508
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,260
Well, they have plenty of Christian comments with Adam and Eve on dinosaurs.

509
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,540
Well, actually, I've noticed that that's got to be quite a meme on the Internet.

510
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,220
Images of Jesus riding a dinosaur.

511
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,180
I think this was originally sort of a protest against the.

512
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,420
The creationists who.

513
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,760
Well, of course, there's some creationists who say that dinosaurs are made up.

514
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,940
There were dragons because it says so in the Bible and there were unicorns because they're mentioned in the Bible, but it doesn't mention dinosaurs.

515
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,120
So therefore, dinosaurs are just made of the skeletons you see.

516
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,000
And I've heard people say this.

517
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:33,940
They're really just rocks that kind of look sort of like bones and these egghead scientists put them together and make them look like a dinosaur.

518
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,820
Heck, you can make a dinosaur out of car parts.

519
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,980
In fact, by the way, Princess, we had looked it up.

520
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,240
I Googled how to make a dinosaur out of car parts and we were wrong.

521
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,440
There's not an article out there that all those redneck artists have been using.

522
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,320
They've been doing it on their own.

523
00:26:50,360 --> 00:27:04,520
I found a million pictures of sculptures of dinosaur skeletons, usually theropods, bright dinosaurs made from tractor parts, lawnmower blades, Dave Bones and so forth.

524
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,720
And behind the cabinet drawer.

525
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,720
Everywhere.

526
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,640
And it's just so silly.

527
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,560
These creationists, they should understand that the Bible is a silly fairy tale.

528
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,420
It says in Book of the Subgenius that Bob invented the dinosaurs in a laboratory in 1956.

529
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,240
Yeah, I'm sorry.

530
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,820
Now, that's time control, though.

531
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,600
See the fact that that Bob was able to invent dinosaurs in a lab in 1956.

532
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,760
Of course, they based Jurassic Park on that.

533
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,600
But that was equivalent of.

534
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:45,180
Instead of daylight savings time, they had millennium savings time where they'd switch things back instead of an hour.

535
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,120
But you'd leap ahead 100,000 years.

536
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,920
Or so.

537
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,860
When did they do that again?

538
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,580
I mean.

539
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,400
Well, that's a moot question, isn't it?

540
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,100
Be safe when?

541
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:58,780
Right.

542
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,260
Right.

543
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,760
Right.

544
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,100
Why do you think 1998 hasn't happened yet?

545
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,560
We thought 1998.

546
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,800
Because it hasn't happened yet.

547
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,420
Right.

548
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Because they keep doing century savings time and Dark Ages savings time and so forth.

549
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:27,420
What if these were like drills or little experiments conducted by these like huge praying mannish like looking creatures from distant stars?

550
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,300
What do you mean what if?

551
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,300
Oh, yeah, of course.

552
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,320
Anyway.

553
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,200
I don't discount it.

554
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,780
I can't.

555
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,680
This daylight.

556
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,620
This daylight savings time.

557
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,620
We're not the only ones who are suspicious about it.

558
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,920
I got a letter this very morning from our friend Reverend Zafod Rokitansky of Carrollton, Texas.

559
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,260
Praise Zafod.

560
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,380
Well, yeah, majorly.

561
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,860
How much equipment am I carrying that he donated to the church?

562
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,520
Anyway, he wrote me.

563
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,080
It was an open letter to all of us.

564
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,720
All of his friends.

565
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,480
And he said, dear friends, daylight time, they call it.

566
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,180
Slavery equivalent, I say.

567
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,120
The government steals an hour from us in the spring and then pays it back in the fall without interest.

568
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:26,040
Oh, well, maybe this year when they add a leap second at the end of June, they consider that adequate payment.

569
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,620
I don't.

570
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,440
Notice the creeping socialism of it.

571
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,340
In recent years, they steal our time even earlier in the year and return it even later.

572
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,400
Rip off.

573
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:50,680
So set your clocks back and accept your loss of freedom or refuse and go out and buy a new gun to defend your freedom and shun any gun stores that buy into this socialism by changing their hours to conform to this atrocity.

574
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,040
This shall not stand.

575
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,520
Put it in your tea bag and soak it.

576
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,040
Paranoia strikes deep into your life.

577
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:05,320
It will creep a new cause for the Tea Party, just as rational as all the rest of their position.

578
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,180
Yeah.

579
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,560
So says reverend.

580
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,040
I guess he's not a tea belly.

581
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Well, have you heard this is an interesting development?

582
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,920
True.

583
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:30,200
But there's a group in Florida that have banded together to fight the utility companies to fight the big utility companies with solar power, which everybody in Florida could have and make all the solar power needed not only for the entire state, but a whole bunch of other stuff.

584
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,300
So anyway, the Tea Party's Tea Party and the Tea Party.

585
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:42,400
The Green Alliance got together like there was like this left right coalition because everybody thought utilities were ripping everybody off and so forth.

586
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,500
And so they called the Green Key Movement.

587
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,140
But that was interesting.

588
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,620
I mean, it was ever boring, but true.

589
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,480
The Green Tea Movement.

590
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,840
It's these people who have disavowed the old Tea Party because they realized where they were getting their money or something.

591
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,540
I don't know.

592
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,340
These were people who genuinely believed in the tea stuff or something.

593
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,240
You know, I don't know.

594
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,460
I don't know.

595
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,040
People with four skins and no labial controls.

596
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,140
No labial controls.

597
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,660
You mean their lips are just a flapping?

598
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,580
No labial controls.

599
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,080
Their lips are just a flapping.

600
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Just a flapping away.

601
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,220
You know who might start?

602
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,780
Speaking of flapping lips, you know who might start calling into this show to compete with Dave?

603
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,180
Tell me.

604
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,260
The only other person that I would allow to call the show.

605
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,760
Who?

606
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,920
Dr. Philo Drummond.

607
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,120
Really?

608
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,020
Well, I mean, we were talking on the phone today.

609
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:57,780
I mean, he does a show in California that I could call him to, but I don't because I'd have to get up at 7 in the morning to call them at 4 in the morning.

610
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,360
Right.

611
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,180
But if he calls me.

612
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:08,700
If he calls me at 9 o'clock at night or 9.30, in his time, it's only 6.30 where his time control is.

613
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:13,060
Of course, depending on daylight savings time and dark age savings time.

614
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,040
He's got it easy out there.

615
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,380
Well, he does and he doesn't.

616
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:27,120
It's rough for Philo because he lives very close to San Francisco and the radio station is in Berkeley.

617
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,160
And he handles the Green Pasty thing.

618
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,220
They do the puzzling evidence shows done in KPFA and Berkeley.

619
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:43,540
So he must needs be surrounded by, well, I don't know what to say, but hippie libtards of the most libish kind.

620
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,680
You know, the kind that make me look like Rush Limbaugh because they want it all and they want it now.

621
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,380
And they don't.

622
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:57,920
They expect the middle of the country, all the farmers and sacred scribes to be just like these.

623
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,480
They're just like these egghead professors in Berkeley.

624
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,560
Now, see, if I lived in Berkeley, I'd become an insane right winger like Dr. Drummond.

625
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,400
I'm not so sure about that.

626
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,300
No, no.

627
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,520
Well, that's what happened.

628
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,580
And the people toiling in the fields.

629
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,260
And you see like the American flag up in the distance and stuff.

630
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:23,540
And you think to yourself, oh, my wonderful, wonderful, wonderful planet.

631
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,620
And the Rogoco national anthem.

632
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,240
But yeah, we have all this.

633
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,280
Right?

634
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,040
And, and love.

635
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,520
All that kind of ellas.

636
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,520


637
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,520


638
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,520


639
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:03,520
handed sons of the soil, car mechanics offspring and stuff, why it made us want to rebel against

640
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:10,140
them and become mighty libtards. But then if you go to some place like, I don't know,

641
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:17,420
any college town, a big college town where everybody just assumes that you're cool.

642
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:24,120
I hate people assuming I'm cool. It makes me want to be totally uncool just to prove

643
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:28,080
them wrong because they shouldn't be assuming things like that. It's silly.

644
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,500
What preachments? So, so, so, Bob Gobs, don't you start acting like you just because I've got long

645
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:44,900
hair and and redolent of skunk weed. That doesn't mean that I'm going to be some kind of libtard

646
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,240
hippie, although I happen to be one.

647
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,400
Right.

648
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:54,640
I'll admit it. Speaking of which, I picked up some hippie classified ads. This is from

649
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,420
I'm going to do some really, really short, Dave. I found this magazine called Hippie,

650
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:07,820
the magazine that turns you on. This is the April 1968 issue. And the price, the price

651
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:17,380
says thirty five cubes for his free love. Worth it is the headline article. But what I like

652
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,200
about this is that it's not a bad thing for the class of fives and you'll like him, too.

653
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,500
Here's young male hippie leaving for India to find God desires young female traveling

654
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:37,180
companion in case I don't connect Greenwich Village. Hippie seeks trip to West Coast. I'll

655
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:47,120
stay here. You drive my mind to California week of July 5th. That's weird. Male hippie.

656
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,080
with one leg seeks female hippie

657
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,260
with one leg. Object?

658
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,640
Real out-of-sight boogaloo.

659
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,660
Wow.

660
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,780
Yeah, those were the days.

661
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,740
Those were the days.

662
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,760
You can still find classified ads like that.

663
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,760
Huh?

664
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,800
Are you sure that isn't from the EZO or something?

665
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,560
Well, actually, it's from my favorite

666
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,220
new book,

667
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,780
Mad About the 60s.

668
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,700
The best of the decade

669
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,040
from Mad Magazine.

670
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,000
And you would love this book, too,

671
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,740
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

672
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,440
because I would vouchsafe

673
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,540
that you probably read, like me,

674
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,580
bought all of these

675
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,700
when they were current

676
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,700
in the 1960s

677
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,160
as, like, a little snot-nosed 12-year-old.

678
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,920
Because they were 25 cents

679
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,440
cheap.

680
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,840
And it was the best satire

681
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,500
there was.

682
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,520
What? New worry?

683
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,340
Mad Magazine.

684
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,060
They've, of course, you know, they're still around,

685
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,180
but they were supplanted

686
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,040
by, what, National Lampoon.

687
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,900
Of course, then Lampoon got lame.

688
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,400
And then The Onion.

689
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,680
Yes.

690
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,660
And there was another magazine

691
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,680
that was a mad rip-off.

692
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,100
I can't think of the name. Cracked.

693
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,280
Well, oddly enough, Cracked.com

694
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,500
is really good.

695
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,880
We must mention Funny Times.

696
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, yes.

697
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,620
Oh, yeah.

698
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,400
To become a purely pulpish thing,

699
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,520
but you can't even submit

700
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,380
via the Internet.

701
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,620
You have to send them hard copy.

702
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,160
You have to send them, you know, paper with cartoons on them

703
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,000
and an actual copy.

704
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,920
I suppose you can, you know,

705
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,040
print it out from your computer

706
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,560
and then mail it and stuff like that.

707
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,560
But, I mean, in a good way,

708
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,640
because they're trying to keep something...

709
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,180
Dave is talking about a magazine

710
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,660
called Funny Times, which we, of course,

711
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,600
have subscribed to on and off

712
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,460
over the years.

713
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,760
That's produced right in Cleveland Heights,

714
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,000
the home of the

715
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,320
Subgenius headquarters.

716
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,960
Or it was born there, at least.

717
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,380
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure

718
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,220
that we've probably

719
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,180
walked past the hippies

720
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,620
that do Funny Time magazine

721
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,360
in the post office many times.

722
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:56,780
Yes.

723
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,560
I just don't recognize them,

724
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,860
because they're so old.

725
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,160
They can't tell they're hippies anymore.

726
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,700
And they can't tell I am,

727
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,280
because I always wear my long braid

728
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,540
hidden under my hat

729
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,220
in that place where my,

730
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,540
that hole in my head

731
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,140
where that big organ used to be.

732
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,620
I can pack a lot of hair

733
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,160
into that cavity in the back of my head, Dave.

734
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,820
And I do.

735
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,820
Whenever I travel and go out,

736
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,360
I hide my hippie hairdo.

737
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,900
You're a drama gold.

738
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,700
Because they'll profile you.

739
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,820
And you know what happens

740
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,300
if you're profiled in Cleveland?

741
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,300
They just kill you.

742
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,200
Oh, I see that guy's profile.

743
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,320
He must be dangerous.

744
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,920
I'll kill him.

745
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,900
No, they haven't.

746
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,060
And then they later admit that

747
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,740
a whale of us...

748
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,600
He draws a cartoon

749
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,960
real quick of the guy's face.

750
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,180
He's like,

751
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,000
he's like there's a character.

752
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,980
And then he puts it up

753
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,200
and he says like maybe,

754
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:48,880
you know,

755
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,640
$50 or a sandwich

756
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,580
or something like that.

757
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,880
And he walks away and cries.

758
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,500
Just like a,

759
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,300
like a big draggled little rat

760
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,220
scurrying along.

761
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,000
I wonder if the cops

762
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,580
will shoot you

763
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,020
for drawing a picture of him

764
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,780
when they're prosecuting

765
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
an arrest or something.

766
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,320
You know,

767
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,320
because if you point a camera at him,

768
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,260
they have,

769
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,100
you know,

770
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,560
that's like,

771
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,580
you might as well

772
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,660
point a gun at him.

773
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,420
They're trying to...

774
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,100
They're trying to shoot to kill

775
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,260
when anything with a lens

776
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,800
or a barrel is pointed at him.

777
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
It is unusual

778
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,180
that the hippie capital

779
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,780
of the,

780
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,260
of the Great Lakes area there

781
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,420
and the Cleveland Heights area

782
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,960
and stuff also has a very

783
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,560
menacing on occasion

784
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,020
police force.

785
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,760
Especially when a 112-year-old...

786
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,840
Never mind.

787
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,420
It gets back to the dinosaurs

788
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,320
because you're all on steroids too.

789
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,640
Speaking of dinosaurs,

790
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,400
I have a question.

791
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,520
I have a new scheme

792
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,980
for X-Day.

793
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,620
You know,

794
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,940
the prophesied X-Day

795
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,020
when the men from Planet X

796
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,940
come and lift up

797
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,300
the dues-paying subgenius ministers

798
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,940
and believers

799
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,060
and allow them to do

800
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,200
anything they want

801
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,680
using space magic.

802
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,140
Such as,

803
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,500
and that's why I have,

804
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,460
when X-Day finally comes,

805
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,640
I have dibs

806
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,420
on certain things

807
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,120
that I'm planning to beam up

808
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,360
to my escape planet

809
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,400
because we can each have

810
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,300
our own saucer or planet

811
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:14,860
or whatever.

812
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,940
I'm going to have

813
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,800
an escape planet

814
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,360
and I'm going to beam up...

815
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,860
We've been through this list

816
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,020
a million times on this show.

817
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,820
The Grand Canyon,

818
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,760
the British Museum,

819
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,360
and so forth.

820
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,760
I've got to fit all this stuff

821
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,000
into the Grand Canyon.

822
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,500
I don't want to beam up

823
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,380
anything more than I can fit

824
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,660
into the Grand Canyon.

825
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,780
But one thing,

826
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,080
I suddenly had an idea.

827
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,100
I now have dibs also

828
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,660
on all of the

829
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,160
19 or 20 remaining

830
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,300
Komodo dragons

831
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,340
on this planet.

832
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,180
They're not really dragons.

833
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,660
They're just very large lizards.

834
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,980
They grow up to be

835
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,300
about 12 feet long or so.

836
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,300
And they have

837
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,600
not exactly venomous bite,

838
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,980
but their saliva is so rotten

839
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,960
and nasty

840
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,040
that it infects you

841
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,940
and he then can kill you

842
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,180
while you're limping away,

843
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,920
getting sick and throwing up.

844
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,760
Anyway,

845
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,820
I have dibs

846
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,260
on all of the Komodo dragons.

847
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,620
I think there's about 10 in zoos

848
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,000
and probably about 10 in the wild left.

849
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,960
So X-Day better hurry up.

850
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,800
But here's my plan.

851
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,400
You know, I love this video game

852
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,520
called Monster Hunter.

853
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,580
Well, guess what I'm going to do

854
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,600
with those Komodo dragons.

855
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,400
Now, I'm not going to wipe them out

856
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,500
like the humans would.

857
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,820
I'm going to clone them first

858
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,720
so I have an infinite supply,

859
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,400
just like in a video game.

860
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,000
And I'm not going to grow

861
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,540
the monsters huge.

862
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,980
Using atomic radiation,

863
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,940
because that would be

864
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,960
cruel to an animal.

865
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,820
I'm going to shrink myself down

866
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,740
to about one third my size

867
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,680
and make some cool

868
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,480
giant switchblades and axes

869
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,560
that shoot fire

870
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,340
and lightning out of them.

871
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,480
And I'm going to go hunt

872
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,140
these giant dinosaurs.

873
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,660
Of course, they're just lizards,

874
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:07,180
but to me, they'll look huge.

875
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,800
And you know, the great thing was

876
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,040
there was a time

877
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,780
when cavemen fought

878
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,800
giant reptiles.

879
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,520
Of course.

880
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,100
Well, it was,

881
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,220
and I don't mean in Genesis.

882
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,820
I mean Homo floresiensis,

883
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,760
the hobbit, they call them.

884
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,240
The early men that were,

885
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,900
they found all these skeletons

886
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,180
in the Isle of Flores.

887
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,080
Yes.

888
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,720
And it was a shrunken version

889
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,700
of human beings

890
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,360
that evolved kind of small.

891
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,940
Well, not humans, exactly.

892
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,640
They're more like a Homo erectus,

893
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,800
a dwarfish midget Homo erectus.

894
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,420
They probably did have hairy feet

895
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,140
like a hobbit.

896
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,340
But they,

897
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,760
also the elephants on this island

898
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,300
became the size of pigs,

899
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,360
yet small things became huge.

900
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,820
And Komodo dragons lived there.

901
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,960
So there were,

902
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,480
there was a time

903
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,500
when little people

904
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,020
were probably chucking spears

905
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,560
at giant reptiles.

906
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,820
And by gobs,

907
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,300
that means at some point

908
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,400
my dream came true.

909
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,260
Somebody got to do that.

910
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:14,960
Yeah.

911
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,180
Yeah.

912
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,580
Like, I was just thinking

913
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,660
of Turok's Son of Stone.

914
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,900
Remember that old comic book

915
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,220
book from the 90s?

916
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,200
I memorized every issue

917
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,580
of Turok's Son of Stone.

918
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,260
I'm talking about the original,

919
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,380
not the redo.

920
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,820
You know, believe it or not, Dave,

921
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,260
they've, you know how they have

922
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,420
to remake everything.

923
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,620
Well, they did that.

924
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,500
Oh, I might have heard it

925
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,160
in that character.

926
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,360
No, you don't want to know.

927
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,200
You don't want to know.

928
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,340
But the original Turok's

929
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,000
Son of Stone,

930
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:41,940
for one thing,

931
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,100
he was a son of stone.

932
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,640
So that's cool.

933
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,740
And of course,

934
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,880
like Batman and Robin,

935
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,680
Turok and his young ward,

936
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,540
Andar,

937
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,300
in a world without

938
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,120
any Indian women around,

939
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,160
you had to wonder.

940
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,160
But there were several species

941
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,660
of, let's call them cavemen.

942
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,920
Yeah, the cavemen did.

943
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,860
The ones, the dwarf ones,

944
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,360
they had septic teeth

945
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,300
just like the Komodo.

946
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,000
So they could,

947
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,360
they could like argue,

948
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,980
you know, like in a place,

949
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:13,700
in the era,

950
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,080
they would have big arguments

951
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,440
in these huge amphitheaters

952
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:16,920
and stuff.

953
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,440
I don't know who built them,

954
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,500
perhaps some sort of

955
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,400
alien creatures.

956
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,220
But they would get

957
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,000
in the middle of it

958
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,320
and there'd be like different,

959
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,380
you know, like different

960
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,720
quadrants of the place

961
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,320
and be like a Roman Coliseum

962
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:28,820
or something.

963
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,080
And they'd be fighting

964
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,280
with anvils and storks

965
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,460
and going on the monkey bars

966
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,220
and stuff like that, I guess.

967
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,900
And it sounded like this.

968
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,640
By the large.

969
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,300
The large set.

970
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,180
A bunch of,

971
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,420
he hasn't been doing collages lately.

972
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,600
He's been doing music

973
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,760
that tends to be like

974
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,080
10 or 15 minutes long.

975
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,880
And this one,

976
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:56,080
I waited until now to start it

977
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,020
because the last five minutes of it,

978
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,080
he took the soundtrack

979
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,920
from pornography videos.

980
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,960
Yeah, it's hot.

981
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,380
But it's too hot for the airwaves.

982
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,180
But that won't come along immediately.

983
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,740
That'll be a while before we hear that.

984
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,120
And you won't get to.

985
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,120
No one will.

986
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,800
Just me.

987
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,740
Me and Princess Wee.

988
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,600
You've got a vested interest.

989
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,640
Well, I'm excited about all these.

990
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,020
The lack of sanity of the population,

991
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:30,960
that's for sure.

992
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,460
I'm excited about the cavemen

993
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,360
and the dinosaurs

994
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,500
and the future and the past

995
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,360
and how they all run together

996
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,900
in a big time control thing.

997
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,720
And definitely,

998
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,960
how's your body image?

999
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,560
So I get back to the theme.

1000
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
How's your body image

1001
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,520
been doing lately?

1002
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,560
Oh, I don't recognize myself.

1003
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,500
That's what you mean.

1004
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,620
Do you keep wanting to be

1005
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,740
look more like Barbie?

1006
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,360
No, I'd rather look like Ken

1007
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,920
with a huge proboscis

1008
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,100
and a suit of body armor

1009
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,540
that could deflect

1010
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,800
all the Komodo dragons

1011
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,740
with one swell poop.

1012
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,380
Oh, well,

1013
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,140
if I got a video game for you then.

1014
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,300
Yeah, you do, man.

1015
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,360
That was killing me.

1016
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,400
That was wonderful.

1017
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,100
Wonderful is anything

1018
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,620
I've heard in many, many years

1019
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,080
and I wish I could play it.

1020
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,340
But unfortunately,

1021
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,460
when they took that part

1022
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:19,280
of my brain out,

1023
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,040
nobody can use it anymore.

1024
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,300
Not even me.

1025
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,000
And the sad thing is,

1026
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,140
Dave doesn't have any,

1027
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,660
a long hair braid

1028
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,600
to shove into the cavity left

1029
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,660
when they turn the brain.

1030
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,800
No, but he can stuff

1031
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,480
his double mean baby head in there.

1032
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:34,860
Yeah.

1033
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,860
Well, but the double mean baby head

1034
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,700
is kind of like...

1035
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,240
Yes, perfectly.

1036
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,820
But it still doesn't,

1037
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,800
it kind of complicates things.

1038
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,380
It doesn't make sense.

1039
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:42,620
It doesn't make sense.

1040
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,260
And that was better.

1041
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,560
Yeah, I can imagine.

1042
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,820
You need to change

1043
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,960
hair creaming device

1044
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,560
that goes right in the back there.

1045
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,800
Dave, for our listeners

1046
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,720
who don't know this,

1047
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,560
Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1048
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,200
our co-spouter,

1049
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,300
has a parasitic twin head,

1050
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,580
a babbling, drooling baby head

1051
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,540
that cusses,

1052
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,460
that's on the back of his head.

1053
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,480
It doesn't have any body of its own.

1054
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,540
It's just the head on the back.

1055
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,460
It's not the first time

1056
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,560
in history that's happened.

1057
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,340
It usually happens

1058
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,800
to English noblemen.

1059
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,080
Do you have any royal blood?

1060
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,300
Oh, of course.

1061
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,000
I come from a royal seat.

1062
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,580
If you want a call doing that

1063
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,220
at the same time

1064
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,860
you're trying to have breakfast.

1065
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,900
I come from the bloodline

1066
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,920
of Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Frank, Lewis.

1067
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,460
Lefty, righty.

1068
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,720
Uh-oh.

1069
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,080
Uh-oh, you're in trouble, man.

1070
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,340
Yeah.

1071
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,160
I'm in trouble, man.

1072
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,700
Well, you're from the bloodline

1073
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,140
of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1074
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,240
Well, I got news for you, dude.

1075
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,020
They didn't exist in history.

1076
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,500
So you're not really here either, bub.

1077
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,060
Actually, I don't know

1078
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,740
that Jesus never existed,

1079
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,960
but I don't know that he existed.

1080
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,840
And I have reason,

1081
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,220
I have every reason

1082
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,960
to think the whole thing

1083
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,740
is just a made-up story

1084
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,500
like some people like to do,

1085
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:08,760
inventing religions

1086
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,780
out of whole cloth.

1087
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,120
Yeah, it's funny because

1088
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,180
in one of those Gospels,

1089
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,700
it was said that he would be

1090
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,520
of the line of David.

1091
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,340
And one of the Gospels

1092
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,460
has a whole series of begots

1093
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,000
at the beginning

1094
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,760
trying to chase Jesus' lineage

1095
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,840
back to King David.

1096
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,060
But then it goes to Joseph

1097
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,960
who is not even his biological father.

1098
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,900
Yeah, right.

1099
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,860
That's really helpful.

1100
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,420
Yeah, and they base their whole

1101
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,240
cultural identity on this.

1102
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,420
Because they all come, you know,

1103
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,740
so they're all related somehow.

1104
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,980
And they all went to the British Isles

1105
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,020
in some year that hasn't yet to be,

1106
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,180
you know, this must be

1107
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,540
during Roman times, of course.

1108
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,620
This has to be before the invasions,

1109
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,580
the Saxon invasions and stuff like that.

1110
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,980
And, well, no, that hasn't happened yet.

1111
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,560
Well, at least as far as I can figure.

1112
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,180
But these people still all believe

1113
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,400
that there'd be blonde-haired,

1114
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,700
blue-haired Anglo-Saxon Protestants

1115
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,060
of the tribe of Judah or something.

1116
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,200
Well, yeah.

1117
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,340
Yeah, Americans are the true Israel of the Bible.

1118
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,860
We've known that since the first time

1119
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,160
we read the aggressive Christianity tracts.

1120
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,000
Just ask a Mormon.

1121
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,480
Yeah, yeah.

1122
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,420
Heck, now, if Jesus, okay,

1123
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,980
so Jesus and his descendants, like yourself,

1124
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,320
in the Priory of Zion, which is a hoax,

1125
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,160
if you guys have the DNA of Jesus in your blood,

1126
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,720
that means you would have some God DNA

1127
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,280
because he doesn't have Joseph DNA.

1128
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,380
Jesus would have Mary's DNA, but not Joseph's.

1129
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,620
If we have Mary's and God's,

1130
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:51,580
is it possible to isolate the God amino acid chain?

1131
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,400
And then possibly, like in Jurassic Park,

1132
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,460
make new gods, you know, if we could find...

1133
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,580
The God gene.

1134
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,080
Just any, if you could narrow that God gene down,

1135
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,940
we could create God in a laboratory.

1136
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,440
God in a laboratory.

1137
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,020
God in a test tube.

1138
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:10,780
I tell you.

1139
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,180
Can't wash them, stone or dry.

1140
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,760
I think the creationists got it backwards.

1141
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,980
I think that we weren't made by a God.

1142
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,580
I think we're going to eventually make a God

1143
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,860
or evolve into one.

1144
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,780
Yeah, man, then he'll make a time machine

1145
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,660
and go back in time to the Big Bang.

1146
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:26,640
And that's how it all happened, see?

1147
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,340
So if we can stop those guys

1148
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,020
from inventing that new God and the time machine,

1149
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,360
we can keep the Big Bang from ever happening.

1150
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,480
Do you realize what this means?

1151
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:38,520
Slack.

1152
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,080
Total, pure slack.

1153
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,300
Slack.

1154
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,380
Well, I hate to agree with you,

1155
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,020
but just think of it this way.

1156
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,680
What if it was like THX 1138 or something like that forever?

1157
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,740
What do you mean, what if?

1158
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,900
Again, I have to ask you, what is this what if?

1159
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,700
Didn't you see World of the Future?

1160
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,040
Let's Visit the World of the Future,

1161
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,520
that great non-award winning movie?

1162
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,500
That proves that it is indeed.

1163
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,180
It's been like that THX 1138 all this time.

1164
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:09,900
The Matrix.

1165
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,600
Also.

1166
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,680
You know, you're just imagining

1167
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,980
that you're on the phone to a college radio station.

1168
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,480
Again.

1169
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,500
I know, I know.

1170
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,980
It's a recurrent nightmare, I know.

1171
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,240
It's like the event called Water of Time

1172
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,880
or something like where I'm actually on the planet Venus

1173
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,460
and everything's reversed.

1174
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,720
I know, we've done all that.

1175
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:31,780
We've been through this so many times

1176
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,680
because, well, we're just recordings anyway.

1177
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,160
We have to.

1178
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,000
We're recordings.

1179
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,220
We're magnetical.

1180
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,620
We're waves.

1181
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:40,860
Goodbye.

1182
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:46,580
If you put enough monkeys in front of enough microphones,

1183
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,400
they'll eventually produce this exact same hour of slack.

1184
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,020
Given enough time.

1185
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,820
That's the thing that the non-scientifical people don't understand

1186
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,680
is how much time we're talking about.

1187
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,760
And that's where it all falls apart in the expanded brains.

1188
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,260
Especially our perception of time.

1189
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,960
You know, like how we are measuring it.

1190
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,980
See, there you go.

1191
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,000
Daylight savings time.

1192
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,420
You never did tell me how your body image is, Dave.

1193
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,840
You went off on some weird tangent.

1194
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,440
No, he said he didn't recognize his body anymore.

1195
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,980
That was the only fiction answer I gave you.

1196
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,360
I said I didn't recognize myself sometimes.

1197
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,840
Like there's some kind of old fat guy or something like that.

1198
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,860
You know, I was like, what the?

1199
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,200
The me I don't recognize is the one that they claim is me

1200
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,740
in really old pictures.

1201
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,920
And I keep going, no, that's a nice-looking young actor

1202
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,760
that they hired.

1203
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,880
And they found.

1204
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,800
People who look like our other old friends.

1205
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,420
But you can tell it's not us.

1206
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,420
There's no way.

1207
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,020
We were never that cute.

1208
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,920
I don't think we were ever quite that young.

1209
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,020
I mean, these were people who were in their 20s.

1210
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,400
Give me a break.

1211
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,140
That didn't happen.

1212
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:55,980
I'd remember.

1213
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,220
Wouldn't I?

1214
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,240
Or would I?

1215
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,280
Would I?

1216
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,840
That gives me wood in my eye just to think about that.

1217
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,880
It's like one of those sexist farmers.

1218
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,660
They don't have any more farmers' daughters jokes.

1219
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,740
They don't have any more farmers' daughters.

1220
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,760
That's what's wrong with this country right now.

1221
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,020
If they wanted to.

1222
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,300
Well, if the farmers would quit throwing the baby girls down wells,

1223
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,220
maybe we'd have more farmers' daughters.

1224
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,720
And salesmen.

1225
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,580
The 13th e-mom is going to come back with you-know-who.

1226
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,200
The smart farmers throw the baby boys down the well, though.

1227
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,660
And then sell their girls into sex slavery.

1228
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,800
That's what it's coming down to.

1229
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,080
That's what it's all going to come down to.

1230
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:38,540
And you know why?

1231
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,600
Because pornography.

1232
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,460
Pornography on the internet.

1233
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,100
That's why.

1234
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,240
It's because of YouTube.

1235
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,700
Are you talking about any local incidences of...

1236
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,120
Of what?

1237
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,880
Or any of these news items?

1238
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,080
Because these things happen all the time.

1239
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,000
Even in small communities.

1240
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:04,180
Well, there are future news items in the future with future savings time.

1241
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,280
And speaking of future savings time,

1242
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:08,780
the show ends in five minutes,

1243
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,840
and I've got 30 more.

1244
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,980
I've got 30 seconds to get you off,

1245
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,440
because I want to play a song by mythical burrowing animals.

1246
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,100
Adroitly put, if you had one to put it in.

1247
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,100
And this is the Hour of Slack from subgenius.com,

1248
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,720
which is where you can learn everything about J.R. Bob Dobbs

1249
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,140
and the Church of the Subgenius and everything else,

1250
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,500
although we are broadcasting from WCSB at Cleveland State,

1251
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,700
which is a much bigger building than the subgenius.com server.

1252
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:39,880
Thank you.

1253
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,440
Suffering from much grander disillusionment.

1254
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,240
Right.

1255
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,620
And so there, I think I've said that stuff.

1256
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,180
I think you said it, too.

1257
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,320
Yeah, you said it, man.

1258
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,560
I don't think anybody could have really said it.

1259
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,660
You know, you did.

1260
00:54:58,820 --> 00:54:59,860
It's a mouthful.

1261
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,760
Okay, Dave, we're going to go to the news now.

1262
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,120
Thank you for sharing your body image problems with us.

1263
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,880
It's a hydroglyph.

1264
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,420
It's for as long as we can.

1265
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,160
Oh, no, no.

1266
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:12,900
No, you first.

1267
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:13,340
I insist.

1268
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:13,980
No, you.

1269
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,180
No, after you.

1270
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,280
No, I really insist.

1271
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm pointing to a modest Croatian ferry.

1272
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,700
PR News said Greece the ferry.

1273
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,460
In Britain, no sign of the Adriatic Sea.

1274
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,820
In the French Alps, American workers caught fire.

1275
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,380
White House economist Jason Furman surged in the last three years.

1276
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,060
And PR News.

1277
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,720
The Pentagon says the U.S. and NATO formally ended PR News in Washington.

1278
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,060
My every honor is a lie.

1279
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,200
Including this one you hear.

1280
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,760
I say, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1281
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,040
I got anything for a laugh, I say.

1282
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,920
I am.

1283
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,040
I am.

1284
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,120
The last reigning Homo correctus.

1285
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,860
I am the goddamn man of the future.

1286
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,940
I'll drive a mile so as not to walk on foot.

1287
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,080
I am a human being of the first goddamn order.

1288
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,000
I am too intense to die.

1289
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,380
For I speak only the fucking truth.

1290
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,900
The man of the man.

1291
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,720
The man of the man.

1292
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,700
The man of the man.

1293
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,520
The man of the man.

1294
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:51,460
Yes, I am.

1295
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:51,880
the man of the man.

1296
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,960
My imagination is a fucking cancer.

1297
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,480
And I'll park it before it parks me.

1298
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,900
I think.

1299
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:02,900
Backwards.

1300
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,500
I do it for fun.

1301
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,220
I coke and eat my dead.

1302
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,660
I swam over 그대로.

1303
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,040
I swim over metros.

1304
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,040


1305
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:14,000
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past

1306
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,860
I made time wait up for me I'll live forever and remember afterwards

1307
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:26,140
Yes, I am the purple flower of Hell County Give me wild birds

1308
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:47,800
They say a godzillion is the highest No there is, well by God I count to a godzillion and one

1309
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,520
I weigh six hundred and sixty-six pounds and zero gravity

1310
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,200
Come and get me

1311
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,740
I was told with Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my head

1312
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:20,020
I have my own personal saviors I change them every hour

1313
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,220
I don't give a fuck if there's life after death

1314
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,120
I wanna know if there's even any fucking sense

1315
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:26,120


1316
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,680
I'll give you slack after death I am a goddamn visionary

1317
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,800
I see the future and the past In comic books and wine bottles

1318
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,920
I paint my jeans I will of my DNA

1319
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,740
With the force of my mighty will I steer my own goddamn adventure

1320
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,760
Give me slack

1321
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,600
Give me slack

1322
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,500
Give me slack

1323
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:01,300
Give me slack

1324
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,460
Give me slack

1325
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,420
Give me slack

1326
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,260
Give me slack

1327
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:09,660
Give me slack

1328
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:10,100
Give me slack

1329
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,660
Give me slack

1330
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:11,720
Give me slack

1331
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,740
Give me slack

1332
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,480
Give me slack

1333
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:14,940
Give me slack

1334
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:15,340
Give me slack

1335
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:15,900
Give me slack

1336
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,800
All that stuff, it doesn't matter.

1337
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,780
These are just organizations of men.

1338
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,000
And all that stuff...

1339
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:34,500
That cool rake you just bought.

1340
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,160
Yeah, that what you bought?

1341
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,740
The cool rake.

1342
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,860
The rake.

1343
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,000
That garden rake that you have after all those years.

1344
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,760
You found a rake that works.

1345
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:43,300
Finally.

1346
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,080
Struggling for years to find a rake that works, that really fits your hand.

1347
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,600
Yeah, that gets just the right amount of leaves.

1348
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:53,080
Gets just the right amount of leaves.

1349
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,220
To pull toward you.

1350
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,160
And for what?

1351
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,580
All that work, all those years of thinking about it to get there.

1352
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,560
Yeah, do I get a rake that's got long tines or do I get a rake that has short tines?

1353
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,180
Or do I get a poo rake or do I get a metal rake?

1354
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:12,740
Do I want a little piece of wax around the handle to keep it from getting splinters in my hand?

1355
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,900
Or do I shut up my gloves to go with my rake?

1356
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,180
Those are the kind of things, those conundrums, those hard decisions.

1357
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,520
You won't have to make anymore.

1358
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,480
Gone in a minute.

1359
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:25,940
Yeah.

1360
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,640
Or a second or whatever you call time.

1361
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,200
Some kind of passage of time reckoning increment.

1362
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,880
Do you hear those sad, lone guys talking in the background?

1363
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:37,840
Yeah.

1364
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,700
That's Werner Herzog.

1365
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,740
We finally got him.

1366
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:41,200
He's back.

1367
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:41,780
Yeah.

1368
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,880
They just got here.

1369
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:44,940
Yeah.

1370
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:45,440
From there.

1371
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,240
Yeah.

1372
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,300
So you're going to be...

1373
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,500
He's going to be making a movie about how cool it is at the end of the world.

1374
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,440
You're going to be making a movie on the pleasure saucers, right?

1375
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,300
Star Fleet to Scout Ship.

1376
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,660
Please give your position.

1377
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,200
Over.

1378
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,600
I am in orbit around the third planet of Star Nona's son.

1379
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:07,200
Over.

1380
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,800
May this be Earth.

1381
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,340
Over.

1382
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:11,940
Positive.

1383
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,400
It is known to have some form of intelligent species.

1384
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,140
Over.

1385
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,300
I think we should take a look.

1386
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:21,880
Over.

1387
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,320
WCSB Cleveland.

1388
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,060
Radio for intelligent species.

1389
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,580
You're getting a little edge of me.
