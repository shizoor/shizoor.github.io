8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,260

you

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,080

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:18,880


48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Rorschach's Journal, October 12th, 1985.

49
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,380
Dog carcass in alley this morning.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
Tire tread on burst stomach.

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
This city is afraid of me.

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,900
I have seen its true face.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,820
Streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood.

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,420
And when the drains finally scab over all the vermin will drown.

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,880
The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waste.

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,600
And all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, save us.

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,440
And I'll look down and whisper, no.

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,060
Oh no, Adrian.

59
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,520
Looks like the Reds are polluting the city lake.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,020
What do we do?

61
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,340
We call the Watchmen.

62
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,260
Strong together, united forever.

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,480
They're the best of friends.

64
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,920
But when trouble's about, you'd best watch out for the Watchmen.

65
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,220
Now here's the leader and he loves to party down.

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,960
Rorschach's friends to the animals.

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,060
Yeah, when he's not clowning around.

68
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm not even...

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,140
Eat up some thugs.

70
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,120
Say no to drugs.

71
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,100
In bed by ten.

72
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,860
But if trouble's about, you'd best watch out for the Watchmen.

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,240
Spectre's a sensation.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,220
You should really never miss him.

75
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,580
The comedian's your biggest fan now.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,040
If I could only get that kiss.

77
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,800
Ozy and Puberty's a couple of crime-saving superstars.

78
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,600
John can give you cancer and they'll turn into a car.

79
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,560
Strong together, united forever.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,580
Come on.

81
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,780
Meet your friends.

82
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,300
Have no fear.

83
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,640
Time's up, time's here.

84
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,540
For the Watchmen.

85
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Watch out.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,760
Stood in firelight.

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,240
Sweltering bloodstain on chest like map of violent new continent.

88
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,740
Felt cleansed.

89
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,340
Felt dark planet turn under my feet and knew what cats know that...

90
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,540
Makes them scream like babies in the night.

91
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,140
The light of the sky through smoke heavy with human fat.

92
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,120
And God was not there.

93
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,800
The cold suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone.

94
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,340
This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces.

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,320
It's a dream.

96
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,320


97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,320


98
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,980
It is not God who kills the children.

99
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,880
Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs.

100
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,200
It's us.

101
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,540
Only us.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
Now, Soupman.

103
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,100
Tireless fighter for soup and justice.

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,280
Able to leap the weak and the oppressed at a single bound.

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,180
Soupman.

106
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,760
Up in the sky.

107
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,560
Look!

108
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,800
It's Soupman!

109
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,200
Good tickets dark.

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,220
Following instructions, Soupman sways and groans and yawns suddenly.

111
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,760
And remember, Soupman had just escaped from San Miguel prison.

112
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,540
Tune in next time.

113
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,660
Can the man of Soup hangs over the town of Soupville?

114
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,300
Be sure to tune in the next thrilling installment of the amazing transcription feature, Soupman.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,540
The guy in a white turban and some pants that looked like oversized diapers put his hand on a big curve knee.

116
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,680
He was wearing tennis shoes.

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,780
He looked happy, like a hobo in a Vaseline sandwich.

118
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,760
He had one arm around her shoulders.

119
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,060
Excuse us, please.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,100
I'll have to get rid of Bob and get some things done.

121
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,440
Get rid of Bob?

122
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,920
Yeah.

123
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,920
Yeah.

124
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,520
All right.

125
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,040
You know, we can't get rid of Bob because he's the greatest superhero of them all.

126
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,320
We just heard Soupman by Lee Murr.

127
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,520
And before that, that was Alan Moore reading from his book, Soupman.

128
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


129
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


130
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


131
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


133
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


134
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


135
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


136
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:44,520


137
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:55,420
And before that, a cartoon, the Saturday Morning Watchmen cartoon theme by Happy Harry.

138
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,680
And you can see that cartoon on like the internet, not YouTube, but somewhere out there.

139
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,740
Just do a search for Saturday Morning Watchmen or Happy Harry.

140
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:13,780
Not to be confused with Happy Harry Cox of the Fireside Theater's album or with Happy Harry Robbins of Ask Dr. Howell.

141
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah.

142
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:32,040
And the religion clip we heard of the kids discussing religion was from a really good movie called Bridge to Terabithia that kind of went under the bridge to Terabithia.

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,880
And speaking of good movies, they didn't screw up Watchmen in my opinion.

144
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,500
This is – I'm recording this on the weekend that the Watchmen –

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,500


146
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,180
Watchmen was released.

147
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,700
Of course, I ran to see it.

148
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
Of course, I'm a Watchmen geek.

149
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,800
I've read the book a hundred times.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,900
And as somebody who knows how hard it is to make a movie or adapt a book, I thought they did a great job.

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,060
And nobody paid me to say that.

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,420
I just wanted to mention it now.

153
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,780
Dave is calling.

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, Dave is calling.

155
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,920
Princess Wee says Dave has called in.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
I must weigh in on the book.

157
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,500


158
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,500


159
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,080
Watchmen.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,540
He wants to weigh – he's way in there now.

161
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,500
Yes, Dave, you're way in.

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,660
I'm in because I know of the movie, not because I was actually a part of it.

163
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,360
Well, you were a caped, masked crime fighter in your younger days, weren't you?

164
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,940
I was also – I was hospitalized for that and put in an institution for four and a half years.

165
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,300
You weren't –

166
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,820
It was the codpiece, dang it.

167
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,120
It stuck out real far of that blue and red uniform.

168
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,160
You were Mothman?

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,440
No, I was just –

170
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,220
Because he ended up – I assume that maybe you were Mothman because he was in a – finally ended up being put away.

171
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,800
Yeah, and he had a big codpiece on his blue and red uniform.

172
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,960
But I was a smiling, happy Uncle Dave that got me into some problems with minors.

173
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,740
Oh, you were a smiling, happy Dave.

174
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,420
Yeah.

175
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,280
The cartoon clown-masked crime fighter and criminal.

176
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,940
No, it was kind of a Superman-ish looking costume with a big codpiece.

177
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,320
That's the third time I'm going to say that.

178
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,540
Codpiece Dave.

179
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,300
And it –

180
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,580
The big blue codpiece is all anybody can talk about.

181
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,460
Anybody who saw it was reminded of fish and death, just like when they look at the face of Bob.

182
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,600
Oh, cod and the piece of death.

183
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,880
Well, fish is a –

184
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,700
And Bob is kind of skull-ish.

185
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,520
He's got that grin like a skull.

186
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,640
And you've even enhanced that with some of your amazing Electrolab stuff you have.

187
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,240
By the way, Dave, we got an interesting letter in the mail.

188
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,940
You're live.

189
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,620
You know, I'm going to share it with you because I think you'll find it.

190
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,780
I just got it a couple of days ago.

191
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm not going to give the email address of the person who sent it, but he said,

192
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,640
Hello.

193
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,100
My name is Bobby J. Dobbs, Jr.

194
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,520
Junior being J-R.

195
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,980
Bobby J. Dobbs, Jr.

196
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,860
I am tired of people thinking I am kidding or am impersonating your figurehead.

197
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,060
Could you please change his name to something else?

198
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,760
Thanks, Bobby Dobbs.

199
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,120
That was a real letter we got.

200
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,140
And –

201
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,180
Well, if anybody in this life would be surfing the luck plane and has all the slack he needs,

202
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,520
merely by the whispering of a few words, I would say that person is very ungrateful.

203
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,280
Well, we wrote him back.

204
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,800
Actually, our lawyer, New Monet, wrote him back and said,

205
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,120
Dear Sir, Madam,

206
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,800
This matter requires your immediate attention.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,220
We are the owners of a U.S. trademark registration for the trademark J.R. Bob Dobbs.

208
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,400
You are currently using this trademark name, specifically Bobby Dobbs.

209
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,880
A comparison of this use in our trademark reveals you're in violation of several provisions of the Federal Trademark Act 15-0-U.S.C.

210
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,820
We request that you immediately discontinue the use of our trademark name and close variations thereof

211
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,480
and take steps to adopt a new and legal name for personal and professional use that no longer represents an infringement on our trademark.

212
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,380
We sincerely hope that you use this opportunity to avoid any litigation that would devolve from your failure to comply with our request.

213
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,880
Please forward your notice of rejection or acceptance.

214
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:36,860
Yours truly, Snarf, Felcher & Sanchez, attorneys at law representing the Church of God.

215
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,920
The subgenius.

216
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,480
Well, thank you very much.

217
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,940
Now, when you wrote him back, what did him back feel like?

218
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,720
What, him neck?

219
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,940
Well, he did respond.

220
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,460
He did respond, and he, with one sentence, he said,

221
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,960
Damn you and your slack.

222
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,660
I think there's hope for Bobby Dobbs.

223
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:06,320
Now, strangely enough, we got an order for an ordainment from a Robert Dobbs last year.

224
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,760
But I think we bragged about that one enough.

225
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:17,760
Well, there are a lot of people going around making false claims and a lot of avaricious individuals who think they're going to cash in in some pecuniary way.

226
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,460
And there is no pecuniation going on here or in your domicile, as far as I heard from we.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,860
And I think what they ought to do is just take a flying leap in the direction of the nearest orbital planet, namely Saturn.

228
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,020
Because it's far.

229
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,320
There is peculiuration in our domicile, Dave.

230
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,320
I understand that the reason you're not here at the station is because there's some peculiuration in your domicile.

231
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:02,560
You're building an arc, I understand, because the flood of Noah has begun in Ashtabula.

232
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,320
I don't know if it's begun in Ashtabula.

233
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,300
But it's here.

234
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,080
It certainly appeared for a while, a knock on wood.

235
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,540
It was going to attack my domicile.

236
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,560
You can get wood?

237
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,920
Well, there's some floating line.

238
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,340
It's all plastic around here.

239
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,380
Just staying.

240
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,420
You live in a forest.

241
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,540
Oh, speaking of getting wood, we've got just the right background music going.

242
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,460
We really do.

243
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,960
And so, Dave, I want you, Princess Wee has a commercial break to read.

244
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,120
I'm going to pot you and me both.

245
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,300
Over there? Oh, I see.

246
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,440
I'll just sit down.

247
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,360
I won't say a damn word.

248
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,040
I'll just listen.

249
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah, just if you can.

250
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,660
And we'll proceed.

251
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,260
B-Rock Oboner Pills.

252
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,740
Getting your flagpole into her oval orifice is big business.

253
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,720
Give it the presidential treatment and erase the national debt in one firmly patriotic movement.

254
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,300
Speak softly and carry a big stick with B-Rock Oboner.

255
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,440
Once you go B-Rock, you'll never go back.

256
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,740
Never has stimulus been so stimulating.

257
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,980
Do it for your country, soldier.

258
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,220
Uncle Sam wants you all night long.

259
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,540
B-Rock Oboner Pills.

260
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,780
Get some and get some today.

261
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,080
Yes, you can.

262
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,120
Available where not available.

263
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,820
Only available where not available.

264
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:44,860
And thanks to Reverend Backett on Up for sponsoring the Hour of Slack.

265
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,500
In that peculiar, pecuniary way?

266
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,120
Yes.

267
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,860
Well, I would like to thank her, too, for reminding us that it's hard.

268
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,220
As George W. used to say, it's hard work being a soldier.

269
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,080
It's hard work being a president.

270
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,260
So let's be as hard as we can at all times.

271
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,280
And that's all I have to say on that.

272
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,420
You be a rock.

273
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,780
That's rather a wooden performance you just gave, Dave.

274
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,640
Yeah, well, one of your friends told me that rocks actually have personalities.

275
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,160
So don't blame me for not being able to get a B-Rock Oboner when the time comes,

276
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,700
because some of these people are actually metaphysical minerals and stuff.

277
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,080
That's what you got in your church right now.

278
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,520
A bunch of people that are like...

279
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,300
Rockheads.

280
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,220
Rockheads.

281
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,320
Stoneheads.

282
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,180
Stoners.

283
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

284
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,620
Boneheads.

285
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,260
But I'm not talking about that, Ken.

286
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm talking about actual minerals.

287
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,180
Richards.

288
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,040
Richardheads.

289
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,140
Ricky Rickheads.

290
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Rockheads.

291
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,220
Yeah.

292
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,880
Masons.

293
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,860
Stonecutters.

294
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,340
Aha!

295
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,740
Stapens.

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,500
Staplers.

297
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,340
Illuminati.

298
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,580
Hand-fleshers.

299
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,280
World conspiracies.

300
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,020
Four-fingered denizens of the dinosaur age.

301
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,940
Flesh-flippity-jerobiters.

302
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,160
Actual catacombs.

303
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


304
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


305
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


306
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


307
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


308
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


309
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,160


310
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,980
Home-dwelling monkeys.

311
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,480
And friends, you can learn about this with the Subgenius History class, starting April

312
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,980
16th and lasting eight weeks through May 31st.

313
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,680
Yes, 2009.

314
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,880
Once again, the Maybe Logic Academy, founded by Robert Anton Wilson, will be featuring

315
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,940
classes in how to be and not be a subgenius.

316
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,420
That's actually true.

317
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,260
I know.

318
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,500
Maybelogic.net.

319
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,620
And they also have released an Illuminatus audiobook.

320
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,780
So if you can't read, you can still pick up on the great insanity and wisdom of Robert

321
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,560
Wilson and Robert Shay's Illuminatus.

322
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,520
It's a 2-Bob book.

323
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,180
That was a 2-Bob job, you might say.

324
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:55,800
Yeah.

325
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,560
2-Bob.

326
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,300
Yeah.

327
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,320
Wasn't it?

328
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,200
Well, there was a pirate named 2-Bob, and there was also a character in Moby Dick, was

329
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,420
in there.

330
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,360
2-Bob on board who had, his eyelids were scratched or something like that.

331
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,360
He used to tell tales of these weird interterrestrial porcine beings, kind of like half pig, half

332
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,020
greys.

333
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,640
He was Queequeg's bunkmate.

334
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,920
Although I had 2-Bob confused with Queequeg, but 2-Bob, wasn't he in R2-Bob, stepped out

335
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,320
like, that's an actual pirate, isn't it?

336
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,620
Yeah.

337
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,440
Yeah.

338
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,620
Captain 2-Bob.

339
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,980
But, yeah, Queequeg was like a Polynesian dude or something.

340
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,240
Well, yeah.

341
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,240


342
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,340
He was...

343
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,340


344
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,340


345
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,600
He was...

346
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,740
He was old and who was the Indian guy?

347
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,760
The Native American?

348
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:35,840
That was Queequeg.

349
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,220
He was...

350
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,840
No, he wasn't a Native American.

351
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,440
He was Polynesian or something, I believe.

352
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,260
He was covered with tattoos, looked like a modern-day youth, but it was, you know, in

353
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,660
the days of Joseph Conrad and giant sperm whales.

354
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,800
Did you know that there was a lot of hidden meaning in that whole argument from Moby

355
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,020
Dick?

356
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,060
And from the very beginning, people had assumed that there were secret messages...

357
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,240
Yeah.

358
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,080
...and not just like on the Illuminati level, but more, you know, the psychosexual rapture

359
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,800
type of messages.

360
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,640
And that's why people read it in serial fashion from Boston to San Francisco, which wasn't

361
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,420
quite a city yet.

362
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,140
You're still speaking of the great literary classic Moby Dick?

363
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,120
Mm-hmm.

364
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,760
Uh-huh.

365
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,680
Uh-huh.

366
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,120
Uh-huh.

367
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,260
Uh-huh.

368
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,460
Uh-huh.

369
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,520
Uh-huh.

370
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:26,920
Uh-huh.

371
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,140


372
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,500
Uh-huh.

373
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,880
Uh-huh.

374
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,300
Uh-huh.

375
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,360


376
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,800
Mm-hmm.

377
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,820
Oh my God.

378
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:44,980
You get adults who have children's minds to feed, Dr. Stang and walks to the podium.

379
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,060
That's a Saitang, which you know, I had my name Americanized.

380
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:58,020
Now do you have an operating table with people, like, stacked up, like, cadavers all the way

381
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,920
up to the ceiling looking down at you

382
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,040
exhuming or post-cadavering

383
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,800
the remains of Bob. No, no, no. We don't keep

384
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,640
the physical shell. We just keep the

385
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,760
soul in a little

386
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
in these blue metal

387
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,540
cylinders. Now, do you

388
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,540
exhumate or in any way impale

389
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,640
the cylinders so as to check the cylinders

390
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,780
livers and kidney forms?

391
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,600
No, we check them for

392
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
leaks now and then

393
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
and I've got to admit there have been a couple

394
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,560
accidents but nobody who'd still

395
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,820
be alive probably.

396
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,180
So, they're not going to be

397
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,060
suing us. But yeah, your soul

398
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,280
every listener's soul is

399
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,180
in a carefully labeled

400
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,420
blue metal canister in my basement.

401
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,460
We joke a lot about how they're all rusty

402
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,240
and falling apart but that's actually

403
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,680
it's not that bad. We

404
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
dust them off every now and then.

405
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,280
You know how basements

406
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,240
in Cleveland's are. Dry,

407
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,460
safe, secure, perfectly

408
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,440
dehumidified

409
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
and so forth.

410
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,700
Hey, hey. Dave, it's a joke

411
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,820
listener friends because

412
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,600
both Dave and I have basements

413
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,640
and a river runs through it.

414
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,600
In my case, it's only a small

415
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,620
river but Dave has been fighting

416
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,700
Noah's flood

417
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,580
in his house.

418
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,460
Sting has just a, actually a

419
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,700
potable trinkle which he uses

420
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,600
rather than paying his damn water bills.

421
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,660
Just goes down there and scoops it up

422
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,620
and keeps the family happy and all those

423
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,660
little souls kept in all those little

424
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
jars down there. There's not

425
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,680
much to work with but there's not much to work

426
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,560
with. However, in my

427
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,940
case, I, yeah,

428
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,600
there's some actually drifting

429
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,280
going on

430
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,540
and I think I hear pirates in the basement

431
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:38,880
now.

432
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,340
I hear some funky

433
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,540
music in the background.

434
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,560
Me three. Maybe turn your radio up to see

435
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,800
if the pirates enjoy it.

436
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,980
Sounds like the man's on his way.

437
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,780
There's so many different kinds. Sounds like the man's on his way to your pad

438
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,300
for do you, dad.

439
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,640
The man's

440
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,480
doesn't even have to go to your pad.

441
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,760
He's done you the minute you're born.

442
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,260
When they

443
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,700
whack your butt to get you

444
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,900
screaming and yelling,

445
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,580
the minute you step out into the world,

446
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,400
that's where the man

447
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,220
starts in on you. That's where the conspiracy

448
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,300
begins. That's where they start

449
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,900
slapping your slack away.

450
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,580
Or trying to. They can't

451
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,600
if you're a subgenius.

452
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,460
The conspiracy is so

453
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,620
deep that they actually take the removed

454
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,100
parts,

455
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,260
of the little boy's

456
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,060
foreskins.

457
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Yeah, the hill of foreskins. That's in the Bible.

458
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,940
I'm not allowed. I'm feeling...

459
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,500
Okay, I'm going to say it anyway.

460
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,420
They take the material from the foreskin

461
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
and do DNA smears

462
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,120
and that's why there's

463
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,360
new shelves in the basement.

464
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,460
I'm glad I got that out.

465
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,100
I've been keeping it in for a long time.

466
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,480
Actually, I don't think you have.

467
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,360
I think we've discussed this on the show

468
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,460
many times, but then

469
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,100
the tape was erased,

470
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,080
you might say.

471
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,500
I don't think... Did the part about the foreskins

472
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,080
actually be used for DNA smudges?

473
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,140
I think it did,

474
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,880
actually. I think Bob

475
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,260
already punished you for it

476
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,900
by wiping your brain.

477
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,320
And he used really rough

478
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,840
toilet paper when he did that.

479
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,040
He used some kind of European

480
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,740
stuff.

481
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,320
I vaguely

482
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,460
remember some welts on my brain, but that's...

483
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,460
It's only if we've passed the threshold

484
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,620
threshold, the finality and the horizon

485
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,500
event, meaning that

486
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,340
we didn't talk about any of this before.

487
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,960
We just thought we did.

488
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,520
And we're punished by it. Somehow.

489
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,580
I think we may

490
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,520
have had this conversation before, but we're

491
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,380
not hurting anyone.

492
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,620
We're not hurting anyone.

493
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,500
Right. And that's not

494
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,060
to say no one is hurting us.

495
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,380
And to wit,

496
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
in effect, the economy

497
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,300
and the lack of material

498
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,120
goods and services going around.

499
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,540
Well, I was just telling

500
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,220
Charleston, the one good thing about the

501
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,300
economy now is that aside from the super

502
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,400
rich, everybody has to live like we've been

503
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,300
doing for years.

504
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,360
And that makes me happy

505
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,100
in a way.

506
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
You know, having to decide which

507
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,080
can of beans to buy, the

508
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,680
39-cent one or the 38-cent

509
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,160
one. I mean,

510
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,260
what am I saying?

511
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,180
The can of beans is more like

512
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,580
38 bucks now.

513
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,640
Like, yeah, $30,

514
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,000
$40, $50,

515
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,360
$60, $100

516
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,720
for a can of beans.

517
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,020
Maybe dollars.

518
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,500
We put the bread in a wheelbarrow

519
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,480
and put all our pennies in a huge

520
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,560
basket with an Easter bunny head in it.

521
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,660
Strew it into the store

522
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,780
and there was no one there.

523
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,540
There was a lady behind the cashier's desk

524
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,400
with a shotgun.

525
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,700
She looked mean. In fact,

526
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,480
she looked like Bob.

527
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,840
She is perfect.

528
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,460
She is perfect.

529
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:55,980
She is perfect.

530
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,240
It's me.

531
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,500
She is perfect.

532
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,940
I can't wait to get home and play the tape

533
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,560
back on my extra loud headphones

534
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,000
so I'll know what you said.

535
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,860
I bet it was really amazing.

536
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,780
Well, I know I was just, you know, trying to do

537
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,900
a different character thing by putting my fingers

538
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,780
in my foreskin and my nose hole

539
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,740
and piercing the top part

540
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,200
and, um,

541
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,520
making a probably sound.

542
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,160
But I don't know

543
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,120
if it came with too many phone lines.

544
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,380
The brain picture you made for us, Dave.

545
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,820
The brain picture?

546
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,160
Yeah, when you described how you made

547
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,420
that character voice,

548
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,760
it was scary in our brain.

549
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,380
Well, geez.

550
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,180
That's the nicest thing you ever said to me,

551
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,600
Purchase.

552
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,800
I got scared when I

553
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,920
imagined your foreskin

554
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,160
in your nose, Dave.

555
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,900
Oh, wow. I didn't know if I could

556
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,180
paint an illusion that well and that's all I needed

557
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,800
was just a few words of consideration

558
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,580
from you and us.

559
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,800
You did. You had me.

560
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm so scared.

561
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,140
Can he do that because he's really

562
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,040
limber and can bend over far

563
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,960
or is it for a different reason?

564
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,620
He's been doing yoga every day

565
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,320
of his scared life.

566
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,240
That's his yoga.

567
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,440
The yoga of fear.

568
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,000
The yoga of fear.

569
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,440
Actually, the friction of muscles, the graying of hair,

570
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,700
the palpable,

571
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,780
stinky,

572
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,540
aluminum-tasting

573
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,900
saliva, the actual

574
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,320
feeling.

575
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,980
The knowledge that things just aren't right

576
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
and they're not going to get any better.

577
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,660
They're just not going to get any better.

578
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,500
Well, you know, speaking of the economy

579
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,160
and things not getting better, somebody

580
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,480
really, really cruel gave me a

581
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,460
fridge magnet that showed the

582
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,240
prices of things

583
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,380
on the year that I was

584
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,600
born, which happened to be

585
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,640
1953.

586
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,780
You're supposed to say

587
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,240
23.

588
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,620
Yeah, I know, but

589
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,260
the

590
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,520
the

591
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,320
the

592
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,100
the

593
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:25,120


594
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:55,120


595
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:25,120


596
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:55,120


597
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:25,120


598
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:55,120


599
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:25,120


600
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:55,120


601
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:25,120


602
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:55,120


603
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:25,120


604
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:55,120


605
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:25,120


606
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:55,120


607
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:25,120


608
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:55,120


609
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:25,120


610
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:55,120


611
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:25,120


612
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:55,120


613
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:25,120


614
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:55,120


615
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:25,120


616
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:55,120


617
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:25,120


618
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:55,120


619
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:25,120


620
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:55,120


621
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:25,120


622
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:55,120


623
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:25,120


624
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:55,120


625
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:25,120


626
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:55,120


627
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:25,120


628
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:55,120


629
00:43:55,120 --> 00:44:25,120


630
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:55,120


631
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:25,120


632
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:55,120


633
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:25,120


634
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:55,120


635
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:25,120


636
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:55,120


637
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:25,120


638
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:55,120


639
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:25,120


640
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:55,120


641
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:25,120


642
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:55,120


643
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:25,120


644
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:55,120


645
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:25,120


646
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:55,120


647
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:25,120


648
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:55,120


649
00:53:55,120 --> 00:54:25,120


650
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:55,120


651
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:25,120


652
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:55,120


653
00:55:55,120 --> 00:56:25,120


654
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,340
I love you.

655
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,820
I love you.

656
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,580
I love you.

657
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,400
And, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um.

658
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,100
The laundry followed a 14-year-old boy.

659
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,840
There was a strange, unexplainable interest in the boy.

660
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,840
The laundry himself seemed to be so like the laundry that Tonto was amazed.

661
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,720
Yeah, I see what you mean.

662
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,940
Let's go to the house.

663
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,120
Here we are.

664
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,220
Let's go in.

665
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,320
Of course.

666
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:30,980
Yes.

667
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,400
These are mine.

668
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,760
I've never showed them to anyone before.

669
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,360
See?

670
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,540
I see.

671
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,980
Did you send for a doctor?

672
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:38,940
Well...

673
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,820
Tell us about it.

674
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,940
Transcribed story of the violence that moved west with young America.

675
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm that man, Matt Marshall.

676
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,020
Me left...

677
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,760
I'm cool.

678
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,020
And that enterpin-

679
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:00,980
Hill Extension...

680
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,700
Which means blow up the external neighbors.

681
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,620
Am additions with a drug,

682
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,400
where should he signed first?

683
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:06,760
And drugs.

684
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,320
I want out and kill all the parasites here you.

685
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,480
And now I'm make all theDrive felt walking to one.

686
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:09,840
Yeah.

687
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,280
Hлекalek...

688
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,400
Okay.

689
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,940
Now,

690
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,100
vaccine,

691
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,620
sure wasn't.

692
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,280
You'll stand back to back.

693
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,140
When I give the signal, you'll each

694
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,140
walk forward 15 paces, turn

695
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,300
and fire. Is that

696
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:33,520
clear?

697
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,120
You ready, mister?

698
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:51,720
Ready.

699
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,520
All right, let's go.

700
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,400
Ready.

701
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,280
One, three, five,

702
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,260
seven, thirteen.

703
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,340
Hold it!

704
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,420
There's something I have to tell you.

705
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,800
Killing a man is good, son.

706
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,540
You know that. Yes, sir.

707
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,940
When you kill a man, you kill a little bit of your dinner.

708
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,860
I've never heard it said better.

709
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,320
What

710
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,240
is it?

711
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,220
It is a very arrogant apology.

712
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,640
Goodbye, Fernando Nende.

713
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,660
Limor.
