1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
From PR News in Washington, I'm getting worse.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Doctors say they're basketball fans, and Michigan State battles with PR News.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,980
Lawyers say Bob had little chance of winning.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,760
Reverend Jesse Jackson climbed the side of the St. Peter's Dome before he killed nine people, then himself.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,520
Authorities demanded Pope John Paul start a lottery to help brain-damaged PR News, Washington.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,720
The Self-Genius Powerhouse.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,460
What are they trying to prove, anyway?

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,100
Beats me.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,400
Hello there, I'm George Putnam.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
I'd like to begin with a fact.

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
A simple yet shocking fact.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
It is this.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,420
A flood tide of filth is engulfing our country in the form of newsstand obscenity.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,980
It is threatening to pervert an entire generation of our...

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
American children.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,300
We know that once a person is perverted,

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,200
it is practically impossible for that person to adjust to normal attitudes in regard to sex.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,180
Yet, much of this material has been described as an illustrated, detailed course in perversion.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,860
Not theraum Empires, прос aime de粉 !

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,340
in f 여

21
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,340
H n o p

22
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:36,440
p

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,540
Of course.

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:38,620
Now, Stan.

25
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:58,080
I'm here for a reason, this, probably...

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,080


27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,820
What?

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
The answer to this question...

29
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,780
And here he is.

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,960
But not of an hour of slack.

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,880
Not even of a minute of slack.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:15,480
Nay, but rather of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse from WREK Atlanta.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:24,420
Actually, this is the Thanksgiving Subgenius Executive Banquet from the Pom Poms right here in downtown Berkeley.

34
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,940
And we aren't wherever he said at all.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
This is in Berkeley.

36
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,440
And not this time won by the good reverend Susie the Floozy.

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:48,040
But a mental classic by her co-pod was the Lymph Node Institute.

38
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,260
Toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot, toot.

39
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm Doc.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,840
And?

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,660
I'm Bugsy.

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:07,020
We're going to discuss the brain this evening in the interest of the magic dancing giants above us.

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,220
It's funny because your brain will fill in gaps as needed, especially when you're receiving everything through your ear holes.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,120
All of these can be prepared in the morning.

45
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,860
So if you hear any extra noises, it's just a...

46
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,300
It's always a help for the hostess on her own.

47
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,000
The subliminal dancing giant.

48
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,820
We're not really, as far as you know, hammering.

49
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,120
Anything into your brain.

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It's for your benefit.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,620
Let me get a visual here.

52
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,160
Yeah, Dobbs, this is...

53
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
You know who this is.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to get to the point.

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm going to get to the point right now.

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,340
You and me.

57
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,620
A.M. P.M.

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,800
Market Street.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,880
Be there.

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,540
Buy me a Frosty.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
Maybe a hot dog or a Tquito.

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,740
We'll sell this right now.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,900
We'll see who's doing some quote-unquote slacking, if you know what I mean.

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
What we want to do is...

65
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Talk about what happened.

66
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,580
Sure.

67
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,360
November 22nd, 1963.

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,740
I'll tell you what happened.

69
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,540
That's when a good old Walter Three Toes Johnson came in and pitched a perfect game.

70
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,180
You know what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,120
Yes, I do.

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:09,800
Good.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
Now let me get to the point once again.

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,500
Pizza Hut versus Domino's.

75
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,720
Go.

76
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,000
That's not the discussion of the year.

78
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes, it is.

79
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,480
I was there.

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:18,920
Wait.

81
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,320
Yes.

82
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:19,720
Okay.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm a new caller.

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I am a new caller.

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,860
He was here.

86
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,340
He was there.

87
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,080
Is Don Joyce there?

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,360
He has a very useful voice.

89
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,120
Not the prettiest sight.

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,080
Don?

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,020
The Nash Rambler's here.

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,800
Who's he?

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,460
Because he isn't, if you don't mind.

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,060
Okay.

95
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,220
Excuse me, Mr. Isn't.

96
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,680
Yes.

97
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,480
Question for you.

98
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:33,820
Yes.

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,340
Go ahead.

100
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,620
I've heard some past shows.

101
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,640
I think you sound like a young man.

102
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,360
You're doing well.

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,740
Are you doing some kind of herbal supplement?

104
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,980
Yeah, I am a young man.

105
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,560
Don?

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,100
And he's pulling the eyepiece over the rearmost position.

107
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,660
Okay.

108
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,300
I'm a very young man.

109
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,240
Adjusting opticular resolution.

110
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,220
Are you trying to say some pedophilia stuff there?

111
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,400
He's not trying.

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,120
He's not trying.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,340
No, no.

114
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
I'm just out of high school.

115
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,320
Don.

116
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,820
Don.

117
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,000
Don.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,220
You've got to be at least 62.

119
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,360
Let's just be honest here.

120
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,660
No.

121
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,660
I just graduated from high school.

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,000
Don.

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,040
Three, four years ago.

124
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,720
You sound like some sort of game show host, first of all.

125
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,540
As you know, traditionally, they usually range about 40 to 62.

126
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,740
All right.

127
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,860
Are these the types of callers you get on your show?

128
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,640
Yes, Mr. Dobbs.

129
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,300
Is this all there is?

130
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,380
Is this all there is?

131
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,020
We're ready to talk about the Kennedy assassination and the next day in the Church of the Sun.

132
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,540
Sorry.

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,120
You are incorrect.

134
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,680
Never in the history of the world have the merchants of obscenity, the teachers of unnatural

135
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,640
sexism...

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,180
...acted.

137
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,420
...had available to them the modern facilities for disseminating this filth.

138
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,600
And cheese.

139
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,460
And still more cheese.

140
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:48,060
High-speed presses, rapid transportation, mass distribution, all have combined to put

141
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,860
the vilest obscenity within reach of every man, woman, and child in the country.

142
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,460
And that fresh vegetable platter that looks like an artist's palate with its vigorous outdoor

143
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,060
color.

144
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,500
Your mixed salad.

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,000
So simple, apparently, but actually a combination of various shades of green and contrasting

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,380
textures.

147
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,320
Stuffing.

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,020
Yeah.

149
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,800
Stuffing.

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,380
Yeah.

151
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,540
Cram the stuff real tight.

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:12,980
Together.

153
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,020
It's paradise.

154
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,840
It's delicious.

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,560
This is the legal ID for the subgenius Thanksgiving.

156
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,280
No!

157
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,840
No.

158
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,320
89.3.

159
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,840
And did you know that we're also...

160
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,500
We're also carried in Alaska and London, England.

161
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,340
Wow.

162
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,180
I didn't know that.

163
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,800
Right now.

164
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,980
Amazing.

165
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,480
Do we know those numbers?

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,620
I don't have them right on the tip of my desk here.

167
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,080
Of course we can be found all the time at kpfa.org.

168
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,800
It's her uncle.

169
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:47,360
So remember, you have a lot of people in Alaska and England who have never heard of this group,

170
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,900
this cult, this organization, this foundation, this church, whatever the preferred term is.

171
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,100
What?

172
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,600
You've never heard of it?

173
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,020
That's right.

174
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,960
So you're speaking to...

175
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,420
What planet are they from?

176
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,300
You are hardly preaching to the choir here.

177
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
You are preaching to the completely ignorant.

178
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,500
That makes no difference.

179
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,100
I think Reb Stang has got to...

180
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, who are you going to take offense to there?

181
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,920
He's doing the spirit of...

182
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,140
All right.

183
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,520
Go ahead.

184
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,020
If the Holy Spirit is possessing Reb Stang, he has to try to tell the truth of that.

185
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,700
It's not a Holy Spirit at all.

186
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,280
It's nothing but the pressure from my flunads down below.

187
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,720
Well, the same thing.

188
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,000
It's my claim, crime, and urge that Bob Fried admits.

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,980
He said, Reverend Stang, take your pants off.

190
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,240
Go forth, stand on car hoods, and preach.

191
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
I didn't do it.

192
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah, have you not seen the tape of that on the Internet?

193
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,420
I remember him when he asked you that.

194
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,440
He said, you would be rich if you did that.

195
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:41,060
We put out an old video tape of Stang's pants leaving his body, and it's on the Internet.

196
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,440
It's been on there for like eight years.

197
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,660
Bob's been a good subgenius.

198
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,920
You know, subgenius was the second website ever.

199
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,560
You disobey Bob.

200
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh, you do?

201
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,600
Yeah, he says slack off, so you go to work.

202
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,560
Before there were webs or sites or any of that stuff,

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,560
people that were beginning that process came to the subgenius church and said,

204
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,360
can we borrow the word?

205
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,220
Because there was so much of the word.

206
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,720
And they said, you can be the content or content.

207
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,300
And also, if you want, you have to beg for it,

208
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,580
but I'll tell you the story of why Bob gets shot in the movie Fight Club.

209
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh, really?

210
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,060
Hyperimmunization, that's what we call it.

211
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,600
He was shot in 84 in the night of slack.

212
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,540
Yes, he was.

213
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
And Michael Pepe was there in a three-piece suit.

214
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,620
I was there.

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,300
And afterwards, the whole story was given to me under hypnosis

216
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,840
because I'm losing parts of that brain.

217
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,660
I think that's the kind of thing we only can talk about.

218
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm just trying to sort out all these voices.

219
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,400
This college radio stuff is just nonsense.

220
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,900
Right now, Reverend Stans, you are covering all of northern and central California.

221
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,320
All of Arnold Schwarzenegger's breadbasket.

222
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,960
Hey, there's a red-headed girl here in Palais.

223
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't even know about her.

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,680
I don't know about her.

225
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:52,980
I don't know about her.

226
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


227
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


228
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


229
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


230
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


231
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


232
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


233
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:52,980


234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,640
Girl in Galeo?

235
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,160
Girls?

236
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,840
So has Reverend Funny Name called in yet?

237
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,220
Yes.

238
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,660
Her name is Kim.

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,780
The caller?

240
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,420
Is that the caller?

241
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,860
Where is Dr. Howell?

242
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,060
Her name's Kim.

243
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,520
I hate sitting next to her.

244
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,940
I have her off.

245
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,480
Has anyone stopped to think about J.R. Bob Dobbs

246
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,500
and to thank him and give thanks on this day of thanks that has just been given?

247
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,380
Too late now.

248
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,740
He's not listening now.

249
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,300
Well, actually, he might be.

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,100
So bend over and pray to Bob Dobbs.

251
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,520
Well, look.

252
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,000
And the caller has bent over.

253
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,180
So, Bob, bend over and pray.

254
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,000
And display him whatever it was that you have to give thanks.

255
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,820
The most private part, his wallet.

256
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,620
Say, Bob, thanks for you.

257
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Hey, tell Kim to stay.

258
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,900
Thanks for being there, Bob.

259
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,300
And other insects.

260
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,860
Thanks for ignoring me, Bob.

261
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,120
Thanks for not torturing me as much as you could have.

262
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,380
And also, beautiful listening audience from over here.

263
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,440
What an amazing opportunity here to speak to the lowerarchy of the sub-genius church.

264
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,460
Think how great you have it compared to what it could be.

265
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,360
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim.

266
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,400
And so...

267
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,440
I only worry that I know too much.

268
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
I should know less, actually.

269
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,240
Oh, yeah.

270
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,420
You wish you knew.

271
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,600
They all say...

272
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
They all think they know too much.

273
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,120
If I could only...

274
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,040
You don't know nothing!

275
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,920
I know.

276
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
I know that very well.

277
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
Oh, if only we could know anything, though.

278
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,560
That is the goal of every true world religion, is to truly know nothing.

279
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,060
That's why I keep it here.

280
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,120
Because then you can initiate something.

281
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
In fact, you don't even need much.

282
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,880
Once you really know nothing, very little will get you off.

283
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,480
Yeah.

284
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,360
I try to know as little as possible.

285
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,860
Then every movie you haven't seen before, every book you haven't read before...

286
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,760
They're so good.

287
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,640
Everything is just...

288
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,980
Until you see what it is.

289
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,360
Yeah.

290
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,440
A number of doctors have worked there.

291
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,640
The scope slows down.

292
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,260
So try...

293
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,380
Even go out there and mess with that movie or that book.

294
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,740
Yeah.

295
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,220
Just...

296
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,460
If you can learn to get off on nothing, you've got it made!

297
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,620
That's right.

298
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,160
You don't have to go to the movies.

299
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,380
This is a picture of a major American...

300
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:51,940
problem.

301
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,000
An ugly sore eating away at the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall.

302
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,980
It's one of the commonest causes of death, pain, and unhappiness.

303
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,180
There's nothing too mysterious about it, really.

304
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,040
Work.

305
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,120
Such suffering needn't be.

306
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,100
As in this case of one man's fight, his fight against work.

307
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
What's the matter with you?

308
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,540
Why does a man act like this?

309
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:14,920
Boom!

310
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,300
Burn that day.

311
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,640
At the office?

312
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,900
Responsibility?

313
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,400
Boom!

314
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:20,900
Boom!

315
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,180
Doesn't look good.

316
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,900
The gnawing, the burning.

317
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,020
Various drugs.

318
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,680
Acid.

319
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
What you think has no bearing whatever on your condition.

320
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,320
The acid's working nice.

321
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,580
Go deeper.

322
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,540
You've got to face up to reality.

323
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,540
So you vomit.

324
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,840
That irregular bulge there.

325
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,460
Problem from work.

326
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,940
Get the kind of food and medication that helps relax it and takes the bite out of the acid.

327
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm talking about feelings, not thinking.

328
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,380
Not logic.

329
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,260
Emotions.

330
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,500
Now, wait a minute.

331
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,740
That still spells jerk to me and I don't like it.

332
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,020
Only a complete idiot would act that way.

333
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
A complete idiot.

334
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,500
I don't care about anything.

335
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,320
Don't ever let me forget that.

336
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,860
And I'm paying you for medicine, not a bunch of crazy theories.

337
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,280
Do something about it.

338
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,720
Does a man really have to buy love, pay cash for it, acting like a machine instead of a human being?

339
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,160
That's right.

340
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,080
Ball me.

341
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:21,760
Down.

342
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,860
Down.

343
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,920
Down.

344
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,100
Life can be worth living down at the office.

345
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,400
Yes, that's right.

346
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,460
How about it?

347
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,860
Are you crazy?

348
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm sorry.

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm sorry.

350
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,580
I'm sorry.

351
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm sorry.

352
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm sorry.

353
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm sorry.

354
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,760
I have a name tag that I wear to my job at the mall

355
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,220
It says, hello, my name is Paul

356
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,260
We have a chain store called Hot Topic

357
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,620
Next to the place that sells cheese pretzels

358
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,280
They sell alternative wear

359
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,580
I wanna work there

360
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,720
Cause I'm a sucker

361
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Sucker

362
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,400
Sucker

363
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,800
Hopelessly suburban

364
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,700
So many fat ladies with their babies

365
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,500
And their hairstyles from the 80s

366
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,260
I have to kiss their asses

367
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,300
If I wanna keep my job

368
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,580
See the youngsters, just like gangsters

369
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,760
Answering their pagers

370
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,860
When their mommies call

371
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,880
Let's do some shopping, get there early

372
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,380
Go downstairs and get a slurpee

373
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,320
So much to do here

374
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,480
In my special world

375
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,040
Sucker

376
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,800
Sucker

377
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,820
Sucker

378
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
Sucker

379
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,340
Sucker

380
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,920
Sucker

381
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,900
Sucker

382
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,560
Sucker

383
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:27,720
Sucker

384
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:27,780
Sucker

385
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,800
Sucker

386
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,220
Sucker

387
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,000
Sucker

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,680
Sucker

389
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,220
Sucker

390
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,520
Sucker

391
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,400
Sucker

392
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,660
Where do you want to be today?

393
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,740
I don't care just as long as it comes on a plastic train

394
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:04,040
I cruise around in my Japanese car with my butterball girlfriend

395
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,540
And a 40 answer

396
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:34,100
I have a name tag that I wear to my job at the mall

397
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,860
It says hello, my name is Paul

398
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,200
The Bean Weevils did that song, friends, from their one album

399
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,480
called The Bean Weevils.

400
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,480


401
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,780
The Bean Weevils, see beanweevils.com

402
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:57,600
Which we bought from Bean, the CD that is,

403
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,300
when we saw his band in San Francisco at the Ask Dr. Howell show

404
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,100
at Café du Monde just before we did this five hour Thanksgiving

405
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,560
subgenius business banquet on the Over the Edge and Puzzling Evidence shows

406
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680
on KPFA in Berkeley.

407
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
With Don Joyce of Negative Land and Doug Wellman, Puzzling Evidence,

408
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:28,360
mixing up us guests, Dr. Philo Drummond, the original Overman,

409
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,620
Pope Michael Pepe, Dr. Howell Robbins, Princess Wee Argo,

410
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,940
and the callers, and yours, truly Reverend Ivan Stang,

411
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,260
and that's mostly what this particular hour of slack

412
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,160
and several future ones will be.

413
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,240
Except for all of the remixed collage musical cut-ups

414
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,040
by Reverend Norell Preff,

415
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,660
which is most of the collages in this show

416
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,540
that are longer than 33 seconds.

417
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,640
And for the PR news,

418
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,120
and the collages shorter than or equal to 33 seconds,

419
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,840
which are mostly by Mr. Fernanda Ndele Mer.

420
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,760
Friends, the background music is by the Flyin' Ryan Brothers

421
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,980
from Blue Marble right now.

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,560
That's their CD.

423
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,780
That's Ryanetics.com.

424
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Praise the guitar tech skills of Reverend Jimmy Ryan

425
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,060
and his brother, Johnny.

426
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,060
You don't need money.

427
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,920
Well, a little bit.

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,380
Well, you need to stay awake.

429
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,520
Send in the money to Bob.

430
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,580
J.R. Bob Dobbs, that is.

431
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,060
Not one of these false bobs.

432
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,360
There's a lot of false bobs running around.

433
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:43,880
False bobs.

434
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,900
As was predicted.

435
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,500
In Book of the Subjeans.

436
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,120
He said, didn't he?

437
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,240
He said, there shall come many like unto me.

438
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,120
But if they froppeth not,

439
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,600
and die.

440
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,660
That's what I was thinking.

441
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,740
And if they have not the verticulitis of me,

442
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,660
then there are false bobs.

443
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,120
And he said, kill him.

444
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,680
Because if it ain't,

445
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,920
if it ain't really Bob,

446
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,780
then they deserve to die.

447
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,660
Then he can't die.

448
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,160
Right.

449
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,900
But he was killed anyway.

450
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,900
He was killed for you.

451
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,800
He couldn't, yeah.

452
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,620
No, he was killed by.

453
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,340
He didn't die for you,

454
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,980
but he was killed for you.

455
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,260
By puzzling evidence.

456
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,600
Puzzling evidence killed him for you.

457
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,440
Yeah, I know.

458
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,860
He did it for you.

459
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,120
And yet you just walk about your daily life

460
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,320
just thinking, oh, well,

461
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,440
I'll just buy this stuff and work this job.

462
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,820
They don't stop and think,

463
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,360
puzzling evidence killed Bob for me.

464
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,340
Reverend Stang, when you think about that,

465
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
you cause yourself,

466
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,080
you cause yourself to black out.

467
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
So most people can't think of that.

468
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,940
We ask them not to think of that.

469
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,460
Certainly not right now.

470
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,920
It's too big.

471
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,440
At 1.15 in the morning.

472
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,280
It's too big for 1.15 in the morning.

473
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,860
It's too big for most people's hearts to take.

474
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
Or their minds.

475
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,340
It's too big for my mind.

476
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,760
I just shut it down.

477
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
It's like the whole universe.

478
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,220
It's such a huge idea of slack.

479
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,000
I mean, it just takes in,

480
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,880
it makes the rest of the world go,

481
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,800
the rest of the world seem like Bambi.

482
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,500
The rest of the world is Bambi.

483
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,140
A cute little doe.

484
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,100
A beautiful doe.

485
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,120
Compared to the,

486
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,080
a weird doe.

487
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,080
A weeeearrrr doe.

488
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,040
It's the abnormalities are corrupting.

489
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,120
Also, didn't Bob say,

490
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,480
let there be frop?

491
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,740
That was another thing.

492
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,160
Oh, wait a minute.

493
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,620
Reverend Stang, I'm going to take,

494
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,040
I'll have a frop Zip-de-lops.

495
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
Quick, run over there and grab,

496
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,580
I need some more of a sanctity.

497
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,820
Don't get your lips close to it.

498
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,800
Do it twice.

499
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,780
Okay.

500
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,600
Okay, Reverend Stang,

501
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,480
now you and I can talk at a more reasonable pace.

502
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,060
This is something I enjoy in the show.

503
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,280
The rhythms of the show always give you a better opportunity

504
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,440
to have more.

505
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,820
This show is great.

506
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,560
It's a really good show.

507
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,520
You want to hit a show, man.

508
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,120
Take it more.

509
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,420
More.

510
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:13,880
Yeah.

511
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,300
I can't get enough.

512
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,220
This stuff is great.

513
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,820
You know, I got some new CD from Negative Lands.

514
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,540
All right, so I just want to talk about the church

515
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,860
and JFK's murder and the great city of Dallas.

516
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,700
Kennedy Day went right by and I hardly even noticed.

517
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,920
I was shooting at turkeys.

518
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,440
Weren't we all.

519
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,860
The thing is, when you start studying the documents,

520
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:44,860


521
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:44,860


522
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,580
you start to think about Bob's assassination.

523
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,820
It opens up such a huge can of worms.

524
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:55,400
The next thing you know, you're studying pornography and drugs

525
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,460
and all kinds of terrible criminal activities.

526
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,060
I have for years asked that people not give a hoot about who killed Bob.

527
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,240
It just doesn't matter for us.

528
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,200
Get a life.

529
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:05,840
Move on.

530
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,040
What?

531
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,440
Bob's dead?

532
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,340
Nothing.

533
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
We all killed Bob.

534
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,260
Why not?

535
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,400
No.

536
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,740
Why?

537
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,860
After all, it was you and me.

538
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,040
That's it.

539
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
That's what Bob or somebody said.

540
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,780
Let me please introduce myself.

541
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,880
So we were trying to tie in the 60s to Bob's death.

542
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,800
At least I was in my mind when I stood up too quickly there.

543
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,640
Nothing, of course, was done.

544
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,760
Princess We Are Doe is here in the studio tonight.

545
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,720
She is a descendant from her spaceship.

546
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,300
Wow.

547
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,060
She is the queen of all the unidentified flying objects,

548
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,120
which unfortunately doesn't do us a whole lot of good.

549
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,300
We can't identify them.

550
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,620
And you must remember, comrade, proteins are weapons too.

551
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,480
Yes, comrade.

552
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,760
I must have taken that to Doc's office.

553
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,860
Must be suspicious.

554
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,220
Yeah, we will cover the pool of blood, but not right now.

555
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,320
Yeah, leave it uncovered.

556
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
And take that salty soup.

557
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,940
You want to give a plug for your show?

558
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,900
Yeah, you should give a plug for your show on your college station.

559
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,940
Well, the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack originates in the heads of the subgeniuses

560
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,980
and then makes its way onto several stations, all of them found at www.subgenius.com.

561
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,760
There are the one-eyed ogvorbis shows.

562
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,700
Ew.

563
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:47,140
The scurrying mp3 shows with a million legs that run right up your pants leg and bite you.

564
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,980
Is that Slack?

565
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,800
Perhaps it could be for you.

566
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,240
You won't know until you try.

567
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,040
Now, will you?

568
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,440
Or are you chicken?

569
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,820
We've got you coming and going.

570
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,200
We assault you with so many contradictory messages.

571
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,160
That sooner or later, your brain breaks open wide and you say, okay, just shut up.

572
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,220
That's how it worked in those days.

573
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,840
But the way this show works is we have to walk up these spooky 13-step stairs.

574
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,860
I have to go check the tape.

575
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,280
The tape?

576
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,800
Really?

577
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,740
The tape?

578
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,640
Violin and bird guitar.

579
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,480
What?

580
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,120
Well, you fellas better go on up and get completely wasted.

581
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,080
Thanks, Dad.

582
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:29,820
Mm-hmm.

583
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,060
Come on, Wally.

584
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,160
Warren, I don't think at all.

585
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,140
Mom and Dad putting me down because I'm a little bit too old.

586
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,140


587
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,140


588
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,140


589
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,140


590
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,140


591
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,140


592
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,440
I must.

593
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:38,820
Well?

594
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,400
Well?

595
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,620
Mom and Dad.

596
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,900
Weirdos.

597
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,680
Pot smokers and speed freaks.

598
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,480
Phonies.

599
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,300
You don't understand.

600
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,200
Don't be weirdos.

601
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,280
We knew you were something aimless and unreal.

602
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,740
I wasn't.

603
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,560
Come back.

604
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,900
Come back aimless and unreal.

605
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,220
I've tried many times.

606
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,380
My first dream.

607
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,740
Split each other.

608
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,880
So that each may find his own thing.

609
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,000
And I didn't.

610
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,400
Well, where is this thing?

611
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,840
Down.

612
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm sorry.

613
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


614
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


615
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


616
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


617
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


618
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


619
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


620
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,120


621
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,540
Mother has remained behind me.

622
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,920
Second ago, she gently touched my thing.

623
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,440
Sex on the streets in every major city from coast to coast.

624
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,840
And get ready for a shock.

625
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,100


626
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:20,280


627
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:20,440


628
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:20,700


629
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:20,820


630
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,320
Planning to use.

631
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,360
Planning to use.

632
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,800
Rotten, filthy, lascivious junk.

633
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,500
Junk.

634
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,740
Junk.

635
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,140
Junk.

636
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,560
Junk.

637
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:28,840
Rock.

638
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,180
Rock.

639
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:29,460
Rock.

640
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,700
Rock.

641
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,000
Rock.

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,280
Rock.

643
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,420
Rock.

644
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:30,640
Rock.

645
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:30,820
Rock.

646
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,140
Rock.

647
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,160
Rock.

648
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,860
Bien le malo.

649
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,880
Yes I love it.

650
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,640
You do.

651
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,420
At least you've seen enough audition films.

652
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,800
Do it.

653
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,540
The right thing.

654
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,440
But if you look.

655
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:59,720
If that is the case.

656
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:08,340
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B

657
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,500
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B

658
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,480
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B

659
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,380
Sex on the streets.

660
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,800
Norlpreff, friends.

661
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,740
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W.heavyconfetti.com

662
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,060
From PR News in Washington,

663
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,160
ongoing public with a terrorist threat

664
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,700
to New York's subway system.

665
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,300
Economists expected labor because of labor.

666
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,380
It does suggest workers, even though those workers did not work.

667
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,480
Economists expected PR news.

668
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:45,100
On Wall Street 51022, the House of Representatives has narrowly approved six new PR news in Washington.

669
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,820
The Warren Commission met. They never even called.

670
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,660
So did you guys go do it? Did you guys do what you had to do?

671
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,520
I did.

672
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,860
I just went to the mall.

673
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,380
And so in 1965, Garrison was the president of the D.C.

674
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,740
That's the way the show is sometimes, folks. You have to do it by yourself.

675
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,340
You're sitting there listening, and you're thinking, these guys just don't do it for me.

676
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,320
I mean, these guys just talk and talk and talk. That's all they do.

677
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,980
Who the hell cares? It's like six, ten, eighteen guys talking.

678
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,440
Who the hell cares?

679
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,640
Sometimes a female.

680
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,560
Well, and then, of course, the callers fly or the phones fly.

681
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,180
And Hale Boggs tossed out of school.

682
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,680
And he was left out.

683
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,660
Left out in the Alaskan wilderness by himself as his plane's motor failed.

684
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,300
He told the people on the Warren Commission not to talk about what they heard in the closed session.

685
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,720
And he said, in this wonderful shot where the cameraman dropped his camera and shot up

686
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,420
and caught Alan Dulles with a six-floor window in the background saying,

687
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,300
you'll probably not know what happened here in your lifetime.

688
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,880
It was like a setup.

689
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,560
Yeah, the JFK thing is wonderful.

690
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,180
And now it's passed from history into myth.

691
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,960
There is no truth anymore.

692
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,840
There was once.

693
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,960
Something happened in that place.

694
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
But there's no sense looking for it now.

695
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,260
You're crazy out of your mind.

696
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,380
You don't know if anything is real.

697
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,540
Anything.

698
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,560
The reality of reality is not reality.

699
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,180
It's just too much.

700
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,820
What's real? What's not?

701
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,240
When you stand out in Healy Plaza and there's...

702
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,780
Robert Groden.

703
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
Selling his little books like...

704
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,260
What does he sell?

705
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,920
Oh, like that one?

706
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,120
The one underneath the book of the Sentinel.

707
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,700
The one underneath there is like a Robert Groden book.

708
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,720
It costs nothing.

709
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,040
Big old table...

710
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,440
What is it?

711
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,460
Coffee table pictures of Bob Depp.

712
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,340
And properly used, they create an odor.

713
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,860
That's the first book of the Sentinel.

714
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,360
Brought too many times, please.

715
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,700
Real onion odor.

716
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm the strongest in South Asia in a hundred years.

717
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,460
The Bush administration is releasing its flu pandemic.

718
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,560
Workers who actually produced the vaccine would be hospitalized with the illness.

719
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,380
Former President Jimmy Carter says faulty Democrats circulated in the past year and a half.

720
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,960
About 1,500 union machinists broke down early today.

721
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,900
Machinists in Los Angeles.

722
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,600
Tens of thousands of machinists trapped in the mountainous region of Los Angeles.

723
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,680
In fact, for PR News...

724
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm already in Los Angeles.

725
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,240
Thousands of machinists in Florida.

726
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,720
On Wall Street 6, 10, 6, 3, 5, 5, 8.

727
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,040
U.S. military officials say at least PR News died in Washington.

728
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,100
Now turn that thing on.

729
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,760
You can do this five hour show.

730
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,860
I'll tell ya, I knew Bob for what he was.

731
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,240
I knew in South Phoenix for what they were.

732
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,120
And I'm repeating myself.

733
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,680
Then you are to pull the trigger.

734
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:57,680


735
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:57,680


736
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:57,680


737
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,840
You are only supposed to keep mapping the space map.

738
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,460
This one's closer but I don't know if it's that better.

739
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,940
No, we are only supposed to kill it.

740
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,360
Kill the space map.

741
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,020
And every other kind of demon.

742
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:14,280
Friend, you know Bob's promise says that on July 5th, 1998, when that day finally comes,

743
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:20,100
that you, the subgenius, will be given great power over the pinks and normals.

744
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,740
What will you choose to do with that power, friend?

745
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,220
Will you choose to...

746
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,040
To just wantonly slay the normals?

747
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,720
Your old fifth grade teacher who embarrassed you that one time?

748
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,300
Are you going to kill her?

749
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,720
Are you going to torture her for years?

750
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,260
Set up a robo-beast that will terrorize her crippled body forever?

751
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,960
Friend, are you going to think twice and think how these creatures can be used?

752
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,140
Don't waste your slack.

753
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,420
Don't waste your slack on vengeance for years.

754
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,420
Are you renting out these subgenius hideous creatures?

755
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,940
You know, the hideous creature depends on what your dreams are, my friend.

756
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,980
If you have hideous dreams, then that's what your creature will be like.

757
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:19,560
If you have pretty dreams, then you'll have that sex goddess or whatever it was that you got in mind.

758
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,020
Yeah.

759
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,000
So, you better hope that you have pure thoughts.

760
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,100
Suddenly, after my pure thoughts, there I was.

761
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,000
Are you going to be asleep when next day suddenly comes upon you?

762
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,140
Sitting next to JFK.

763
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,360
Like a thief in the night or in the middle of your day?

764
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,720
It's November 22nd, 12, 20 in the afternoon.

765
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:35,860
Are you going to be ready?

766
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,860
Are you going to be thinking about some monster movie you saw?

767
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,660
JFK, Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy, and I are heading down a long, full ride.

768
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:47,160
And then forever you'll be trapped in the world of that monster movie or that bad commercial or that bad date you were on.

769
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,720
Instead, when you should have been at church, weren't you fed by?

770
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,060
Bob!

771
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,460
Which, by the way, can happen in a bar.

772
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,560
Is that a one little mob sound guy?

773
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,500
Sounds like a one-man army.

774
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,360
That's that pull-my-finger guy.

775
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,000
Oh, that's the governor.

776
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,700
Oh, man, it's the pull-my-finger guy!

777
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,120
This week's great, hilarious, new, trendy...

778
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,980
Your comrade?

779
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,280
The pull-my-finger guy.

780
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,760
See if that makes any difference.

781
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,920
Okay, that one's over.

782
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,060
Next.

783
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,280
300,000 volts of electricity.

784
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,640
Get it up, fool it around.

785
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,020
And give it up!

786
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,940
Living hell of another world.

787
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,840
The banging it.

788
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,140
Earth is always painting.

789
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,680
Break it down.

790
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,140
Break down.

791
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
Burst into flame.

792
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,320
Come up, hit another jack.

793
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,880
Freaky boys jamming.

794
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,780
Free me, God.

795
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,500
Here come the funk.

796
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,580
Horrible monster.

797
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,880
Insolent, ungodly monster.

798
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,160
She ready?

799
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,300
Isn't he handsome?

800
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,520
It was all in your mind.

801
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,280
Let me out, Ed.

802
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,320
Must let it grow.

803
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,620
Only thus can the whole evil be destroyed.

804
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,640
Give me my toys.

805
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,460
Power.

806
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,200
Productive.

807
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,460
Programmed your brain.

808
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,500
We pump it up.

809
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,260
Release her.

810
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,560
Romantic, isn't it?

811
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,360
Shut up and sit down.

812
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,460
Skin.

813
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,260
Sublimation.

814
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,620
Hated.

815
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,060
Hated.

816
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,700
Outside.

817
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,700
Take your, take your, take your.

818
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,720
Take your.

819
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,840
That was interesting.

820
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,460
Time to rock.

821
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,500
Wonderful.

822
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,180
You do not respond.

823
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,460
Must learn to obey.

824
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,320
You.

825
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,540
They will like to make love to me.

826
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,540
Young and beautiful.

827
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,620
Noral prep.

828
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm beating cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev following the weekend's

829
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,240
massive PR news.

830
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,260
In India, the prime minister says more than $110 a day is a big deal.

831
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,720
The president has been in federal aid for victims in India, killing 30.

832
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,480
No.

833
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,960
President Bush caused hundreds of deaths.

834
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,520
And, uh...

835
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,800
The president will be on hand for today's reopening of PR News in Washington.

836
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,580
I believe that this nation should commit itself.

837
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,940
Shot and killed.

838
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,040
Enjoy the smell of tear gas.

839
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,720
Heavy.

840
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,080
Definitely heavy.

841
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,120
Anything with monosodium glutamate.

842
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,980
Oh.

843
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,900
I can't talk.

844
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,600
I'm stark naked.

845
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,400
Tricky dicky.

846
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,540
I met the Kray twins once.

847
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,580
Compared to most successful politicians, and I've come across a few in my time, they were

848
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,440
rank amateurs.

849
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,380
I'll give you an aphorism.

850
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,320
Politics is legalized crime.

851
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,840
Or crime by consent.

852
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,640
You're dripping ice cream on your suit, sir.

853
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,660
Oh, yes, damn.

854
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,620
I've discovered I'm a psychopath.

855
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,560
Rubbish.

856
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm a psychopath.

857
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:44,940
I'm a psychopath.

858
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,540
I'm a psychopath.

859
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:45,820
I'm a psychopath.

860
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,140
I'm a psychopath.

861
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,140


862
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,520
Caught with their pants down.

863
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,720
America means business.

864
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,320
Think about it.

865
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:01,180
When doors are opened and closed in the world today, the orders come from Washington.

866
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,820
The watchman watches in vain, unless the lord guards the city.

867
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,520
It's attributed to Saint Francis de Sales, but of course it comes from Psalm 127.

868
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,620
Kind!

869
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:15,800
Thank you.

870
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,580
An interesting quotation.

871
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,100
Kennedy put it into the speech he was going to deliver in Dallas

872
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,280
the day he was hit in the head by a bullet.

873
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,120
Half his brain blown across the street.

874
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,940
That's America.

875
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,400
Temptation Island.

876
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,900
Temptation Island.

877
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,920
Everybody has been burned before.

878
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,120
Plastic Assassin.

879
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,220
I'm not too fond of the Americans lately.

880
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,600
The Americans are like the ancient Romans.

881
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,780
They have exactly the same kind of bad taste.

882
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,840
They see nothing unethical in wishing to dominate the world.

883
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,660
Kennedy wanted to go to the moon.

884
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,120
Because he was an idealist.

885
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,300
Johnson wants to go because he's a vengeful bastard.

886
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,240
Why didn't somebody shoot that great big cow-punching Texan slob instead?

887
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,760
I've got a good face, a good bum, and that's it.

888
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,700
I work for the government.

889
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,240
I kill people.

890
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,020
I'm an assassin.

891
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,360
Come on.

892
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,320
Love my good love.

893
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,800
Come on.

894
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,820
Love my good love.

895
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,720
I guess it just doesn't...

896
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,260
feel right.

897
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,600
Everybody can justify murder.

898
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,660
The other fellow's on the other side, and the other fellow's holding a gun.

899
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,840
The other fellow's going to kill us if we don't kill him first.

900
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,260
I need to go to the bathroom.

901
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,780
I need to go to the bathroom.

902
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,080
Jerusalem, 1961.

903
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,780
The state of Israel put Adolf Eichmann on trial for war crimes.

904
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,660
He was convicted, then executed.

905
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,580
I thought Eichmann's defense was actually a pretty good one.

906
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,120
I was obeying orders.

907
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,980
What are you people trying to do to me?

908
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,900
Who the hell are you people?

909
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,880
I knew perfectly well what the bomb was for.

910
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,020
It wasn't to finish the war.

911
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,220
The war was as good as over.

912
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,500
It was to keep the Russians in their corner.

913
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,300
To make sure the USA came out on top.

914
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,820
Everyone understood it.

915
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,700
J. Robert Oppenheimer especially.

916
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,200
Sheer arrogance.

917
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,860
Oh, my dear fellow.

918
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,600
Temptation Island

919
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,560
I tried to find my own Nirvana by gazing at the constellations

920
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,360
He's paranoid

921
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,420
It's just

922
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,680
Very sad

923
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,900
Norrell Preff, friends

924
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,100
Speaking of the Kennedy assassination, friends

925
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,340
The ultimate sacrifice

926
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,000
Can now be yours

927
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,640
Actually, the book

928
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,660
Ultimate Sacrifice

929
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,080
By Lamar Waldron and Tom Hartman

930
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,700
Is out now

931
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,320
And I have been waiting for this book

932
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,200
For

933
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,320
Well, I've known Lamar Waldron for about 17 years

934
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,720
And that's how long he's been working on Ultimate Sacrifice

935
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,400
It was finally published in hardback

936
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,640
By Carroll and Graff publishers

937
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,920
And you can

938
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,360
Find it all

939
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,620
You need to

940
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,620


941
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,880
At a website called

942
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,580
UltimateSacrificeTheBook.com

943
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,460
One word

944
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,220
Ultimate Sacrifice The Book

945
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,440
Ultimate Sacrifice

946
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,780
John and Robert Kennedy

947
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,400
The plan for a coup in Cuba

948
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,620
And the murder of JFK

949
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,840
Friends, it's a whole different look

950
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
At the Kennedy assassination

951
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,960
Than what you may be used to

952
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,620
I can't even be sure

953
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,300
I can't even be sure

954
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:07,300


955
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,080
So we're going to begin to go into the depths of the research and all of that

956
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,420
Because this is the hour of slack

957
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,360
And the Kennedy assassination isn't slackful for everybody

958
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:21,520
But I've been around it for a long time

959
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,660
And this is, you know, if you're really seriously looking for answers

960
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,080
You should definitely check out

961
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,100
Ultimate Sacrifice

962
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,520
The case is

963
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,040
It's not closed, but this one comes close.

964
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,720
Ultimatesacrificethebook.com

965
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,980
by the good Lamar Waldron and Thomas Hartman.

966
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,020
Praise God.

967
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,500
Wherever you are, however you are, this is the BBBB.

968
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,860
Today, the US Senate have been torturing prisoners.

969
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,620
BBBBB news.

970
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,540
The United States has said that it's bad.

971
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:19,840
An Iraqi deputy interior minister had been paralyzed by three people in Hunan province.

972
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,780
Others had had their skin peeled off during the BBBBB.

973
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,640
The French parliament has approved violent unrest in a number of French cities and towns.

974
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:34,140
The interior minister told parliament that he was beaten and stabbed in the capital, Tunis.

975
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,280
The Tunisian government has denied.

976
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,800
That it was behind the organized United Nations attack on Wednesday.

977
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,180
China says it's producing more than 100 million doses of bird flu.

978
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,360
And is producing more than 14 billion human deaths from bird flu in a day.

979
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,360
The US government's announced it intends to take the grisly interior secretary, Gal Norton,

980
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,660
off its list of endangered secretaries.

981
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,520
There is no Bob.

982
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,680
Or it's more like, there is no Bob.

983
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,860
Sure they wish.

984
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:05,940
Sometimes.

985
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,360
Sometimes.

986
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,740
I wish that it was all just a made up joke.

987
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,920
Sometimes I wish there was no Bob.

988
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,480
God, that would sure make life easier.

989
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,520
I could just plan to die like everybody else.

990
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,600
Oh, but this way it's like I've got a challenge.

991
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,360
Which kind of heaven I want to get back forever.

992
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,760
Decisions, decisions, decisions.

993
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,380
But, but, but.

994
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,660
One of the last remaining uneaten helper monkeys.

995
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,380
Monkeys, monkeys.

996
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,420
What about one half strip of bacon?

997
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,680
Monkeys fly out of my butt.

998
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,960
Rabbit, eat scrap.

999
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,880
Reminded me of some damn funding technicality.

1000
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,700
That figures.

1001
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,000
Community outreach bull-tish.

1002
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,280
So.

1003
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,240
Bull-tish.

1004
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,460
What language was that in?

1005
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,060
Friends and you shall be just too full of bull-tish.

1006
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,040
Just left my office.

1007
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,900
Bull-tish?

1008
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,580
Have you just had it with all the bull-tish?

1009
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,660
The military capital of the country.

1010
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,960
Bull-tish.

1011
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,160
Do you feel?

1012
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,700
You don't look bull-tish.

1013
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,520
I mean, it's not bull-tish.

1014
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,680
... civic and religious organization.

1015
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,840
Yes.

1016
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,620
The juvenile court judges.

1017
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:20,660
Sometimes I have to go through these things and reverse the reverse cuss words so that

1018
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,740
they'll be suitable for the internet X-rated version.

1019
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:24,980
Innumerable...

1020
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,840
Yeah, but nobody...

1021
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,540
See, this show comes pre-cleaned.

1022
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,300
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1023
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,680
If you just talk about the bull-tish...

1024
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,600
Paralyzed for your protection.

1025
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,460
You have to go through and reverse that tinge sale.

1026
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,440
... produce the moral decay among all our citizens.

1027
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:35,640
So it doesn't work.

1028
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,300
The goal is to make it suitable for the internet.

1029
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,080
Are you saying you want to listen to John Tish or...

1030
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
No, no, no, no, no.

1031
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,920
It's a reverse psychology is what I was trying to use and get some...

1032
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,940
But out here in Dealey Plaza, the dew is forming.

1033
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,240
It's six in the morning.

1034
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,420
I began writing a biography...

1035
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,420
Dealey Plaza?

1036
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,540
I thought this was...

1037
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,800
Well, that's where we're shooting from today.

1038
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,140
Oh, Dealey Playa.

1039
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:56,780
Oh, you're right.

1040
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,380
Oh, geez.

1041
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,380
Oh, I'm trying to...

1042
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,840
I just, in my mind, I...

1043
00:41:59,840 --> 00:41:59,960
... get so enthusing.

1044
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,920
Yeah, I know.

1045
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,380
There are all these different crossovers of subgenius and mind.

1046
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,340
It really is not to write a biography of...

1047
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,540
My mind is not my mind.

1048
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,620
... a subgenius.

1049
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,080
No.

1050
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,440
My mind is not my mind.

1051
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:07,740
No.

1052
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,380
My mind is not my mind.

1053
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,700
Oh, and look at the little minds dancing now.

1054
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,040
Step to your left and move towards the black freestanding panel directly in front of you.

1055
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,820
And they are looking in the little...

1056
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:17,820
Right there, right in front of you.

1057
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,360
... they're using the mind mirror...

1058
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:18,780
Here we are.

1059
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,220
... to see themselves dancing.

1060
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,680
... at or around the point.

1061
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And now up.

1062
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,560
There we go.

1063
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,680
Now they're just hitting the roof.

1064
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,040
Oh.

1065
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,260
Oh, that's got to hurt.

1066
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,220
Low-hanging stalactites.

1067
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Too many thoughts about...

1068
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,820
Now more than ever...

1069
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,800
Put your head down, Governor.

1070
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,380
Your mind is...

1071
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh, Doug.

1072
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:35,620
... down.

1073
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:35,620


1074
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,600
... a battleground.

1075
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,540
... and continue with the stills from a home movie taken by Dallas businessman Abraham

1076
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,140
Secreter.

1077
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,760
The invading armies of normalcy have already dug in on the beachhead of your desire for

1078
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,280
acceptance.

1079
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,300
And before I was done, after the seven years of work on this project, now we're in our

1080
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,320
eighth year...

1081
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,620
... and secure with food bank.

1082
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,260
I was doing my own investigation based on all the new documents.

1083
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,460
... as the president was shot.

1084
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,300
I was standing across the street from Secreter in Daly Plaza.

1085
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:05,600
... and I was standing across the street from Secreter in Daly Plaza.

1086
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,300
I was down on the halfway of my back.

1087
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,300


1088
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,300


1089
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,300


1090
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,300


1091
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,300


1092
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,760
Yes, you too can learn to edit without splicingó

1093
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,640
... which is, not coincidentally, perilously close to your slack reservesó

1094
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,560
Fabian, did you hear that?

1095
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,840
... bend over and empty out those slack reserves, kid...

1096
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,200
Nope.

1097
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,720
... Bob's here!

1098
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,180
... these are the wastrels right over me API

1099
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,440
TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY TODAY.

1100
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:28,440


1101
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,740
Stock at the University on Science Facebook

1102
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,660
Bohel.

1103
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:31,660


1104
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,920
It's a mob show, kids.

1105
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,040
Fabian.

1106
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:35,800
Bob.

1107
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,960
Can you hear me over the microphone?

1108
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,700
Bob.

1109
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,020
Bob.

1110
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:40,660
Bob.

1111
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,840
They all ask whether you can hear them over the microphone, and you can't, but you always say you can.

1112
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,160
This is moral decay.

1113
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,220
Yeah, sure, we can hear you.

1114
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:48,740
Moral decay.

1115
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,240
So then you'll chop this show up and play it on your show, huh?

1116
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,560
Oh, just like a chop shop.

1117
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,840
Well, there was one cut.

1118
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,780
My dear friend and our great leader, Bob.

1119
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,100
My dear friend and our great leader, Bob.

1120
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,740
My dear friend and our great leader, Bob.

1121
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,040
My dear friend and our great leader, Bob.

1122
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:23,860
My dear friend and our great leader, Bob.

1123
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,980
This is a piece of shit.

1124
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,240
This is a piece.

1125
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,940
This is a piece.

1126
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm treating prisoners humanely.

1127
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,040
This is just the first step in the development of inhumane treatment of prisoners.

1128
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,620
They're expected to adhere to the president for quite some time.

1129
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,920
On Wall Street 610-514-624-1218, this is PR.

1130
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:42,860
A white spokesman says today's attack on lawyers could imperil efforts to protect the U.S. from PR News in Washington.

1131
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:46,740
Warren?

1132
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,860
Honey, I've been thinking.

1133
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,720
Oh, June, you just don't do things like that.

1134
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,900
Well, I don't think.

1135
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,340
Oh, June, just don't throw wet towels.

1136
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,780
Osteoporosis.

1137
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,680
Why wait?

1138
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,300
Why wait?

1139
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,340
Fortunately, bone loss can be osteoporosis.

1140
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,840
Osteoporosis proven to help bone loss and fractures of the spine.

1141
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,580
Why wait?

1142
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,240
Okay, and track 14.

1143
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
Now we're advancing into the Christmas part of the show.

1144
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,480
Tubular bells.

1145
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,040
Yeah.

1146
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,780
Carry on, gentlemen.

1147
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,040
I have to take a pee.

1148
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,120
Pee on.

1149
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,000
Pee on.

1150
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:26,860
I tried to quit peeing years ago and became a breath.

1151
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,300
You know, I must have tried 150 times and it just always gets the best of me.

1152
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,520
I always end up falling back, you know.

1153
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:39,740
Just, uh.

1154
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,440
It doesn't make any sense.

1155
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,480
I just can't seem to stop.

1156
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,360
Penis.

1157
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,260
It's like it's got this.

1158
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,600
He is such a peer.

1159
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,200
It's got this hold on me.

1160
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,240
He pees every day.

1161
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,180
It's got a mind of its own.

1162
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,060
Bob, can't you free me from peeing?

1163
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,300
Yeah.

1164
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,860
I suppose.

1165
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,860
I suppose that could happen.

1166
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,360
But why would you want to?

1167
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:08,180
Because, really, is that time not what's perhaps one of the most relaxing times you have during

1168
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,520
your pathetic, hairy day?

1169
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,140
Oh, friend.

1170
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,720
Oh, working friend.

1171
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,440
Just a moment of serenity.

1172
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,520
I've had better.

1173
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,780
From PR News in Washington, I'm to face charges of treason.

1174
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,860
The White House's current chief economic advisor has agreed to acquire 21 and a half

1175
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,220
billion dollars in cash for about $63.08.

1176
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:35,300
The federal agency says it has a huge annual financial report today.

1177
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,560
Uganda's main opposition leader pledged he would be Alan Greenspan.

1178
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,080
And will be guided solely by the political influences.

1179
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,140
Greenspan gives Palestinians medical B.O. in Newark.

1180
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,060
His arrest comes after more than three weeks in the job.

1181
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,360
If convicted, Greenspan could face the PR penalty.

1182
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,960
On Wall Street.

1183
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,720
4-2-10-7-2-2-0-3-3-12.

1184
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:57,260
6.

1185
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,900
The Senate has rejected PR News in Washington.

1186
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,840
March of premature babies.

1187
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,320
March of premature babies.

1188
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,540
But still, no one knows premature babies.

1189
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,540
Let's find the premature baby together.

1190
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,940
For information, visit prematurebabies.com.

1191
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,540
Peace in the Pacific.

1192
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,020
Oh, I'm freeing that from input.

1193
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,120
And then they stole that idea from the last action hero.

1194
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,100
The whole thing went down the tube.

1195
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,200
This guy has been overcome by the mushrooms of President.

1196
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,480
Is that like the O.E.A. guy?

1197
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,060
Yeah.

1198
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,740
This guy lives eight blocks from the guy that stole the lectern.

1199
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,120
What?

1200
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,080
Victor Cantu, that son of a...

1201
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,480
That pink, pink conspiracy duke.

1202
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,220
False subgenius.

1203
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,120
This jackass!

Copyright 2005.

1205
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,860
Remember this guy.

1206
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,120
Boobs.

1207
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:01,640
Oh, shit.

1208
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,480
Shit.

1209
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,680
You're a dumb fucker.

1210
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,680
Is there a better idea?

1211
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,380
I don't think so.

1212
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:05,920
But...

1213
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,400
Who's Bob?

1214
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:07,700
Bob?

1215
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,080
Bob?

1216
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,840
Hey, hey.

1217
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,120
Bob is Phil in the black.

1218
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,260
No, no, no.

1219
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:13,780
Skip him down.

1220
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:14,560
Who's Bob?

1221
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,460
What is Bob?

1222
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,040
Bob.

1223
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,700
Who's Bob?

1224
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,500
How about Frank?

1225
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,000
Yes.

1226
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,320
Is he there?

1227
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,680
What's the answer to that question?

1228
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,920
You'll be in extreme danger every minute.

1229
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,900
And loving it.

1230
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,200
And loving it.

1231
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:26,200


1232
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,160
I don't know what you record this under.

1233
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,340
I don't want to fill up surveillance against you.

1234
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,100
Pablo Finn did the same thing.

1235
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,100


1236
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,380
He did.

1237
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:41,500
It was actually really scary.

1238
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:41,520
aponman cried the whole time.

1239
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:41,520


1240
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:41,520


1241
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,420
You're wrong.

1242
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:43,580
naar

1243
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:48,580
I am, I am.

1244
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,040
I am camellian but I am very calm and I am not a tall, thin flick of the God of the

1245
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:51,400
increased.....

1246
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:51,640
ah, yes, in my other bird...

1247
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,100
What you believe?

1248
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,520
The authors of Mindscape and Grindhouse have triumphed over the authors of Evil and Run.

1249
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,420
Norrell Preff, friends.

1250
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,440
www.heavyconfetti.com

1251
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,260
On PR News in Washington, I'm taking the pain-killing drug.

1252
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,160
Germany's new foreign minister has been pounding Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice today

1253
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,580
to improve relations between Germany and the United States.

1254
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,380
Be quiet!

1255
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,160
Federal prosecutors have wrapped up shopping this holiday season.

1256
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,620
President Bush will be shutting down South Dakota's state government

1257
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,960
to try to build momentum for his PR news.

1258
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,680
Mr. Bush says he wants temporary legal working status.

1259
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,140
The president says Internet shopping may help reverse the gay culture in some American seminaries

1260
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,880
and lead to an even greater PR news in Washington.

1261
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,920
Here's a PR news program.

1262
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,140
The PR Corporation created Congress more than 30 years ago.

1263
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,120
The idea was Congress doles out money to PR radio stations.

1264
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,540
PR's broadcaster has the story.

1265
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,320
Many conservatives have a liberal bias, especially in their PR news shows.

1266
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,120
For example, executives at PR are bent.

1267
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,120
I think that that is that from that.

1268
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,820
And they point to strong Americans.

1269
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,700
PR officials note its weak audience has BS and PR.

1270
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,600
We are constantly confused.

1271
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,680
PR, it's fun.

1272
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,940
If it's not, it should be.

1273
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,520
Crazy.

1274
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,540
You can say that.

1275
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,480
Guys are crazy.

1276
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,900
And that guy in there is a...

1277
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,700
Guys keep doing that stuff. It's crazy.

1278
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:48,980
...vital ass attack.

1279
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,680
Hi.

1280
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,020
Stay.

1281
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:53,520
I see you outside the ship.

1282
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,160
What's wrong?

1283
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,200
I keep...

1284
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,380
I could swear I hear the ghost of Michael Pepe chattering.

1285
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,460
Don't worry about it.

1286
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,720
It's just an illusion.

1287
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:02,920
It's freaking me out.

1288
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,520
This is just...

1289
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,380
Does that happen to everybody?

1290
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,300
...the Pepe that was killed...

1291
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:06,700
Yeah.

1292
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,340
...the gay...

1293
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:07,940
Exactly.

1294
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:08,860
...spice...

1295
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:14,960
As the ship turns, as we leave the atmosphere, you'll appear to see Michael Pepe near you.

1296
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:15,740
Oh, that's...

1297
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,540
That's gross.

1298
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,700
...not coming...

1299
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:17,940
Hello?

1300
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,120
Is that what they call space puny?

1301
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:19,340
...because they broke my...

1302
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:19,880
Is that what they call space puny?

1303
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:19,980
...because they broke my...

1304
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:19,980


1305
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:19,980


1306
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:19,980


1307
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,000
...because they broke my...

1308
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,240
...me.

1309
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:20,420
...me.

1310
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,220
I've heard of that.

1311
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:21,440
Yeah.

1312
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:21,960
Hey, hey.

1313
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,400
Hold on.

1314
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:22,680


1315
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,300
Hold on.

1316
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:23,680
Hold on.

1317
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,180
Hold on.

1318
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:24,800
Six seconds.

1319
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,100
Hit my knee with a hammer.

1320
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,320
The caller is feeling that right now, too.

1321
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:28,680
Get to the ship.

1322
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,300
I just got out of rehab.

1323
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:29,920
I'm here.

1324
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,620
I'm getting drunk.

1325
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,140
It's like...

1326
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,420
No, there's no rehab, caller.

1327
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,740
It simply has to wear off.

1328
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,820
Caller, is that you?

1329
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,780
Diesel, um...

1330
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,420
I'm Carl.

1331
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,140
No, that's not him.

1332
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,780
I just want to...

1333
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,040
All I...

1334
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
I just want to...

1335
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
Hey, caller, we thought you were the caller for a minute.

1336
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,680
Caller, oh.

1337
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,840
Caller, I am the caller.

1338
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,300
Is that caller?

1339
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,440
Is that caller?

1340
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,560
I just have an unusually good quality phone.

1341
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,160
Where can people get information on this reference thing?

1342
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,940
It's a little something just called Tom.

1343
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,540
Of course, the Subgenius website.

1344
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,500
Subgenius.com.

1345
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,180
Subgenius.com.

1346
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,460
Yeah, man.

1347
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:09,740
Now, we're sitting here in Dobbs Town, waiting for the Kool-Aid to come.

1348
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,960
Well, I'm sitting here in Thumbstown, waiting for the Kool-Aid to come.

1349
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:30,100
Well, it's a great episode, but you know the pamphlet will keep them deaf and dumb.

1350
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,580
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

1351
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,940
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

1352
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,400
I'm sitting here.

1353
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:41,660
You can see my long hair and my rusted very hair hovering everywhere.

1354
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,600
Is that Rust?

1355
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,180
Yes.

1356
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,540
Rust-a-very number five you're wearing?

1357
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1358
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:47,680
I love it.

1359
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,480
It's not the ganja weed.

1360
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,820
Oh, it's prop man.

1361
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,540
And we have no need for all his squares.

1362
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,340
Prop man.

1363
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,500
Prop man, yeah.

1364
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,360
Yeah, smoky prop.

1365
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,400
So I'm putting up resistance.

1366
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,720
No, Bob Dobbs has got no stairs.

1367
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, man.

1368
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:05,840
It's a hit.

1369
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,700
I know it's a hit.

1370
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,580
Yeah, it's a hit, man.

1371
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,300
I'm sitting here in Thumbstown.

1372
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,000
Waiting for the Bob to come.

1373
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,660
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm doing, man.

1374
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,300
I'm sitting here in Thumbstown.

1375
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,780
Waiting for the Bob to come.

1376
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,060
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

1377
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,340
Where is the Bob now?

1378
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,080
Where is the Bob now?

1379
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,160
Ah, see the Bob now.

1380
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:28,800
Yeah, yeah.

1381
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,460
Putting up resistance.

1382
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,920
But I know he's going to leave me deaf and dumb.

1383
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:34,700
Deaf and dumb.

1384
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,360
That's right.

1385
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,520
When the Bob comes, he leaves me deaf and dumb.

1386
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,800
I feel so good all over.

1387
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,060

Oh, he won't give a shit, man.

1392
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,660
He's with Bob smoking the ganja from.

1393
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,020
Yeah, yeah.

1394
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,720

President Bush has departed from the White House.

The U.S. military says thatматum is inserted on the Internet if they cannot altijd

1430

00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,420
Just like Ma used to make

1459
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,680
down south the old day.

1460
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,180
We're hearing you. We hear everything.

1461
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,940
It's just that we can't talk to everybody.

1462
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,400
Reverend Stans made her hang up.

1463
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,280
It's your fault.

1464
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,640
He's not paying attention.

1465
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,360
Who? What?

1466
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,360
Never mind. Go on with your diatribe.

1467
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,860
Somebody said something about...

1468
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,320
It's just...

1469
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,600
Is anybody listening?

1470
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,280
Yes, we had a delicate female caller

1471
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,860
trying to get through. They're so rare.

1472
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,360
So rare.

1473
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,160
So rare.

1474
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,740
And we just ignored her, basically.

1475
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,060
The good.

1476
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,200
But then again, she probably wasn't...

1477
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,940
You gotta speak up.

1478
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,020
Maybe we... Yeah, and also maybe we should just let

1479
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,320
Queen of UFOs speak to her when she comes back.

1480
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,920
I don't think she was part of the cult.

1481
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,740
And call 8484425.

1482
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,500
All the better.

1483
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,960
Please do call back, dear.

1484
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,860
I hope that she's not part of the cult.

1485
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,100
I would much rather speak to people who are not.

1486
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,660
We'd like to have you.

1487
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,060
Like me.

1488
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,440
I don't want you.

1489
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,800
People are a part of the cult.

1490
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,340
The cult have already sent him.

1491
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,460
That's singing to the choir, babe.

1492
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,400
They're used up. They're burned out.

1493
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,400
Their old flash...

1494
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,600
Their little souls are inside these aluminum containers

1495
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,380
inside the rocket ship, ready to go.

1496
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,020
You have to go to the children.

1497
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,280
Well, actually, they're still in my basement.

1498
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm sorry.

1499
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,440
We heard this before.

1500
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,720
I was trying to make it sound a little more exciting.

1501
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,660
Yeah, go ahead, please, and join us

1502
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,920
as we dance around the radio show floor.

1503
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,040
From PR News in Washington,

1504
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,940
I'm developing nuclear weapons

1505
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,780
in a facility in Russia.

1506
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:12,580
The White House has fired explosives

1507
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,660
at Congressman John Murtha

1508
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,700
after the Pennsylvania Democrats

1509
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,000
blew themselves up.

1510
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,940
A U.S. commander says another two turds

1511
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,140
failed to break through a bag

1512
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,240
on Wall Street.

1513
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,380
8, 10, 7, 12, 1, 2, 2.

1514
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,960
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan

1515
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,460
says this is PR.

1516
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,660
Steve reports on the effort

1517
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,920
to fund preschool for all Democrats.

1518
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,840
He's gathered a million billion

1519
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,720
proposed poor preschool programs.

1520
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,620
President Bush says he supports

1521
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,540
Russia's proposal aimed at keeping Iran in Russia.

1522
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,160
Today, directivist Rob Reiner,

1523
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,360
strapped with explosives,

1524
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,680
continues asking for more than $5

1525
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,780
at two Shiite mosques in Cuba.

1526
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,600
Human rights experts with the United Nations

1527
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,940
say they will not visit PR News in Russia.

1528
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,300
Help me out!

1529
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,620
Help me out!

1530
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,040
Help me out!

1531
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:22,400
Hello, everyone.

1532
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,580
Hello, everyone.

1533
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,340
Hello, everyone.

1534
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:24,620
Hello, everyone.

1535
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,720
Hello, everyone.

1536
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,100
Hello, everyone.

1537
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,140
Hello, everyone.
