Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again.
But you'll be glad to know that we're not going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show.
No, except that actually it's not the whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays and holy days and the hole in head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.
Selling, yes.
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalog.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmas and Guitar Axmas.
It's cool, man, cool.
And praise Bob and her.
Oh, oh, oh.
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.





Oh, no!
Who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who stubbed the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop?
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip?
Who was that man?
He shoved it up my can
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
When this angel heard
Chop-a-pop-a-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine tree needles sting me
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-nam-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much that smarts
You're so...
Who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who stubbed the wood where I poop-she-poop-she-poop?
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip?
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush?
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
I might squeeze him too tight
It's that psychedelic time of the year
Do you know where your brain...
Brain cells are?
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him.
Don't go walking down to the bar
because old Frankie died last night in the backyard.
I mean, I'm not parking this car.
And to the right.
Paul, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed
and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday.
Hey.
You boys be good,
and I'll give you some of this here apple mango pie.
He ain't no good of a child.
That dog's running off with them brain cells.
Can you do something about that boy?
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...


I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to...
Was he screwed on just right?
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun.
The fate of a child.
Spend all the money you've got.
Spend all the money you've got.
The Christmas trough.
I've lost my freaking mind.
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.
He's like a cowboy Santa.
How jolly.
Oh, Jazz is giving Dave the show pills.
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit?
I need the show bath.
The show de-lousing.
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.
That's enough of that.
Oh, he's got headphones.
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size to...
Oh, your pancreas looks...
Lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.
I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.
I'm shocked by...
The red pills are really good.
I like to take the red one and the blue.
The red one and the blue one.
At the same time.
That way you go in and out.
The warp makes it easy.
It's so high, you can't go over it.
Angels we have heard on high
Singing about mountain dew
And those mountains in reply
Saying we wish we had some too
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley
Once upon a time
There was the baby
baby Jesus, and he had two eyes made out of coal, and he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree,
and he wanted his two front teeth, and he got McDonald's gift certificates,
and he had a dog named Santa's little helper, and he took all the presents from Whoville,
and his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys,
and he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy, but he couldn't.
He wanted 10s and 20s, 10s and 20s, and he got McDonald's gift certificates,
and he got Zuzu's pedals, and that's the real story of Christmas.
We'll be right back.
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.
He wanted an electric train.
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.
He had a picture of the whole thing, and he would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars,
the station and the gateman,
the mortar tower, and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think Tommy was wishing for something that just didn't exist.
And he was right.


And Tommy knew exactly what he was wishing for.
So separately, so separately, so separately, you from Tolga.
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.
Shut up, pink boy!
No way. I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.
Taste a little of my rock.
Rocket Pipe Alien Tool.
Bob Dodds comes with Rocket Pipe, Head Launcher, Janger Device,
All-Yakitism, Fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.
Some assembly required, batteries not included.
This toy falls apart in three days.
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe.
Too much is always better than not enough.
From Bob Dodds.
Gorgeous.
Eaglets can blow from head to toe.
Drawing everything you see here.
Ken Dowd sold separately.
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe will be back after this message.
Santa Claus.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell.
The end of the year sale.
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the present subgenie.
We're trying to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.
Oh, yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
But before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.
But I think they started to war over it.
Yeah.


I think it was the."
Were you just a ho?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Friends, try to imagine
somewhere in the snowy north
the Santee
Bob trudging mindlessly
through the Himalayan snows
driven by strange
forces to complete
his nameless errand
and he may show up
at your house, my friend.
If you've been a bad subgenius
or a halfway subgenius
or if we keep getting
tangled up in these other shows
and having strange microphones.
How did that
paternity suit ever turn out
between Dobbs and
Santa?
And who?
His dad.
Santa dog.
I don't know.
You know, and I don't think
it was a single result.
Yes, but St. Nicholas,
this is fact,
St. Nicholas punched
another bishop
in the nose
and bloodied his nose.
And sucked him.
Really?
The historical site
of a dispute
over the trinity
of God.
The original site
of God.
I swear to God.
I swear upon Bob
and his three hearts.
Who the hell is God?
Yeah.
His heart.
Part of the country.
I can tell him
he said God.
Who the hell is God?
Who the hell is God?
Ask Dobbs one day.
That's the question
we should be asking.
Suddenly,
a lightning bolt
struck from nowhere
on that bright sunny day.
Bob did a backflip
and from that day on,
he too was a believer.
And from the snow
and the sun,
a little child
bearing flowers emerged.
Chip, Chip,
what else was on the table?
Each one a dirty flower.
St. Nicholas.
Holy.
Sip, Sip,
The historical Santa Claus
is originally lived
as the caller knows
as a bishop in,
was it Constantinople?
Yeah, like one of those.
It was an ancient Byzantium.
Yeah, Asia Minor in general.
Yes, he was known
for sneaking into the rooms
of young women
and leaving.
Hmm, hmm, gifts.
Light-sized lumps of coal
complete with a fake beard
and a CIA Wall Street credit card.
A saint he was,
the girl said.
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.
That's good.
You got it, brother.
Stuck into people's houses
through the chimney.
You got it, brother.
They knew when they were sleeping.
They knew when they were awake.
You got it, brother.
But like the CIA,
he was protecting them.
St. Nicholas was a creeping,
stinking spy.
What?
He knows when you've been sleeping,
he knows what you've been eating.
Hey, man, my kids still believe
in St. Nicholas.
And who keeps that belief alive
in their fevered, sick little brain?
Madison Avenue, of course.
No, the surveillance community
is under your direction.
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Miller Beer, you know.
If you're bad, he punishes you.
If you're good, he rewards you.
He's probably the closest thing
to Jesus walking the earth.
He's the closest thing
to Big Brother there is.
He rewards those who knows
when they are smiling
when they're awake.
I think, I think really
if you want to make a deal,
you have to do it with, you know.
Could Dr. Claus in fact be
the wandering, quote, milkman
rumored to have fathered
our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?
Well, we find it a very likely possibility
from the falsified documents
we have here.
And also the fluffy beard
that often grew on Bob's feet.
You better watch out.
You better not.
You better not.
And I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
He's making a list.
Checking it twice.
Gonna find out who's no good enough.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
He knows when you're away.
He knows when you're in bad or good.
So be goodness, goodness sake.
Oh, you better watch out.
You better not cry.
You're gonna pay him anyway.
Santa Claus is coming today.
Do you think I'm psycho mama?
I've seen my ex last night.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mama?
We all saw Ex-Max last night.
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in stank's head.
It would not live for a little chic or plums.
and berries drop in toxic things.
This little show, Mom,
saw there was a reason that
the poison in the plants.
Material plants?
Biological agents
who only take 15%?
It came with our
plastic boxes of bags.
And now,
hold on,
here we go.
And now,
hold on,
here we go.
Oh, it's a great day,
all right.
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. American.
Shop as usual.
Shop as usual.
Shop as usual.
And avoid panic buying.
It's two days old Christmas,
a million things to do.
Clean the house, put on tea,

Where are my relatives?
Why haven't they showed up?
I bet they're at the airport,
I forgot to pick them up.

Yes, the birth of the baby Satan on July 4th.

The birth of our baby Satan as told by various authors.
Authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

Before that, some year-old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.
I'm playing a lot from that.
So check out www.triage.com for that one also.
The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.
And now, the Jethro's.

Oh, yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
Coming on Red Room Stang.
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous...
errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa
Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
They asked...
The kids were asking if their parents...
If...
Maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

Now you're blaming Jesus, you're blaming our Lord.
I sort of understand, because
I understood
the way any old fool
would understand. There was
no Jesus,
no flatulent old woman waving her
panties on the hill. It's not that
you don't want to,
it's that they won't let you. No,
there's just a crying
wilderness and the hot pursuit
of wolves everywhere
in the background. I'm ashamed of
them.
It's cold.
I'm leaving that
city life behind and radio
people are crazy.
I can't get my noodle
back in the pan, Jeth.
Come on, cowboy.
No, man, I was trying to hear you again. Let's go.
I'm going to go to the tree.
It's starting to whisper into me, man.
You've been drinking.
There's the face of the Madonna right up there.
There's the face of the Virgin Mary.
I swear to God, look at it.
What?
It's your Christmas witch coming true.
A Christmas witch?
I'll be horny, Uncle.
She's beautiful.
Her breasts are so cold.
I know she must be a true witch.
I guess you could call her that
if that's what she's packing out of these for real.
She's surrounded by hovering Christmas ornaments.
It looks like a radar device.
What? Yo.
It's her. What up?
What's up?
What a deep voice.
What's up?
Witch.
What's up?
What's up?
She's a witch.

I'm going to go to the tree.
You're going to the tree.

Where?
Where?
Where?
I'm going to go to the tree.
Where?
Where?
Thank you.
Bye.
Right on, right on, right on, right on.
Right on.
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece.
And the health department made us take them down.
I remember my father well, you know.
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?
He used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.
So, Daddy.
Took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister?
Who created the conspiracy?
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.
Yes.
The pilgrims forbade it.
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.
It was a...
When your little brother...
Fell through a hole in the ice sling.
And you went and saved him.
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.
It was a wonderful life back then.
I heard little jokes about him waking up.
And then we'd put candles.
Like most people have.
He would have that smile on his face.
But today, Christmas is lost.
It's me.
He just beat the crap out of Santa Claus.
Scott.
You made your choice.
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul.
You have found that only could you afford to give to God that which was his.
But you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate still stands.
In the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.
I don't want to go to hell, sir.
Sir, no.
I don't want to go to hell.
No.
No.
No.

As alive as he could be.
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same.
New and mean.
The tale bearer will be at the judgment.
We want to love and the class begins.

The call of Catalina.

I was learning that the soul was in trouble with the princess.

Yes, definitely.

The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Well the workshop is gone now
He decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers
And he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got dancer in Prancer
With an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower
And he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a bite of his pizza
And he got a big bite
And said it tastes just like chicken
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts
There's a National Guard and the FBI
There's a van from the Eyewitness News

Who's Santa why

We wonder where you've gone

Deep to the desert
You know Santa's got a Grigori

But now...
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?
Who made him talk in funny riddles
so that we cannot understand?
And who made him so succinct and blind
that he is actually blind?
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.
The time of the Lord,
of the fact that...
How many before you reach your limit?
How many do you get?
Jesuses?
Yeah, how many can you bag?
How many Messiahs can you bag?
Hail Jesuses.
If you're doing it in season,
if you're doing it out of season,
you need a special permit.
Oh, you never do.
And you can only take one.
You never bag the Lord in C.
You bag the Lord in B flat
so you get that kind of rough sound.
But when they're in season,
it's every God for himself.
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.
Obviously.
We are between a rock and a hard place.
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea
in the old age
and he got a very, very hard foot
and he got elfin tashes of the rectum?
You know, it's not something well-known
by many Christian scholars.
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was
chlam chashash chaman chashash.
I kind of like those stories
where the Lord dies
and the Lord dies.

and settles, you know,

Jesus fought for the Confederate Army.
The Ranger.
I like the Texas Ranger.
Jesus, Texas Ranger.
Johnny Rebel was a Jesus.
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police,
for maybe the Hopi police force.
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.
He was the white brother
who came to instruct the Indians
how to be liberal.
Well, what about old Peacemaker,
the Jesus of the Iroquois
who was actually Huron?
A Huron.
You didn't know that, did you?
See, I got you.
Thin Ron.
Jesus.
El Ron.
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus
you've ever seen.
Oh, it tastes like butter.
A new Jesus.
A different Jesus.
It tastes like crappin' pie, children.
It melts in your mind.
Smokin' Jesus.
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.
Go kick that window open.
I already kicked it.
I'll kick it again, though.
Kick it good this time.
We don't mean nothing
by this Jesus and God.
We thank you for all the nice things
that you've done for us
this Thanksgiving.
We appreciate all that.
We're just trying to insult your fan club.
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.
But we knew that you knew that
because you're in all things
and everything, right, Jesus?
Right, I could hear him say that.
Praise God and Bob

And God.

The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey, James Kochalka, Superstar.
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith
that he not only can accept somebody's love,
but he can also be making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob.
He'll do it himself.
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgeni may be bad,
but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so-
not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc. in general,
all of them, are evil.
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say, are old drinking buddies.
Got nothing against Jesus.
It's just his fan club.
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.
He doesn't even sneeze.
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.
Oh, and he's male.
But he doesn't exclude us.
We don't scrape juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do,
because we sinned.
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.
We're bad.
We're worthless.
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.
We turn.
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.
This wasn't meant to be.
Jim and Isabel will be visiting California State University tomorrow at 1 a.m.
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Friday.

just because he had a bad life.

A book of ancient gods penned
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the trees are small
And the children are safe
And I dance in the snow
I'm dreaming of a book of ancient gods penned
Where everyone can come back right
And your days will be
Shhh
And short
And may all your gods
Pen be right
Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay, long lay the world
In different finding
The pit and the stone found its rest
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
The young are praised
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night, oh night divine
Tell yourselves
Oh night, oh night divine

A groovy little solstice

Mithras won his fight
Alright guys, we're just about to solve this one.

Well, friends, what do you think?
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus
that we're trying to celebrate here?
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob,
the Santai Bob,
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?
The Jethro's, friends.
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's.
They're at...
They did that Wreck the Halls
and so many other versions we've been playing.
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller,
Avenue.
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue,
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
Portsmouth, N-H-O-3-8-O-1.

It's all Christmassy right now.
There's a bright green bob in the window
and Christmassy lights.
Is there a light out there?
A DJA? Is a DJA out there?
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.
No, that's something just left for a DJA.
It's all Christmassy.
It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present
under the tree.
Smell that cinnamon.
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.
And those sugar plums.
Something's up the chimney hole in sight.
Mrs. Mack.
Yeah.
A Santa, I mean.
Otherwise, gosh.
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.
Oh, beloved Santa.
I have wanted to...
Put your bag down for a minute.
This side is always so ready to learn.
Big red sack.
What?
For so long.
Hi, Bob and Mary X-Men!
You know that?
A little.
Like that.
I will, tomorrow.
OK.

Lone Cow Dave.
Don't you know what they're doing to you?
yourself?
Don't go there,
Uncle,
dear.
No,
no,
no,
no.
It was the night
before Christmas
and all through
the house
not a creature
was stirring
not even a mouse
the stockings
were hung
by the tree
