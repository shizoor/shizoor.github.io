1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,660
Talk to your doctor and find out if it's time for plaque buildup.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,560
He prescribed the buildup of plaque.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,400
Along with bad cholesterol and the progression of atherosclerosis.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,620
Ask your doctor.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,540
Liver disease isn't for everyone.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,520
Ask your doctor about severe lung disease, vomiting, and fatalities.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm ready.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm ready.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm ready.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,820
Call your doctor and request the self-genius Powerball Squash.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,660
Some serious side effects may occur, such as inflammation of the flatulence.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,980
And thank you, Lemur.

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,300
Friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1158.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,440
Only it isn't, really.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:55,520
It's mostly Reverend Susie the Floozy's disease and anthrax special episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,800
from wonderful.com.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,940
W-R-E-K in Atlanta.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,460
And we're rerunning it because it's great.

19
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,780
And because the world ends any minute now.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,000
X days practically here.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,520
And when that happens, we take the path of least resistance.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,860
And put on this background music by the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,800
And let somebody else do the show.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Here then, now, is the work of Reverend Susie the Floozy.

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,140
And we're going to hear the story of the

26
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,140


27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,880
The program you are about to listen to is a true story.

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,560
It contains some of the most terrifying material I've ever encountered.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,260
So often in a case like this, it's hard to pin down the details.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,360
In the autumn of 1989, a company called Hazelton Research Products was using a one-story building

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,200
in the business park as a monkey house.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,800
Hazelton Research Products is a division of Corning Incorporated, the company that makes

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:56,800


34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:56,800


35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:56,800


36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,140
Pyrex glass cookware.

37
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:04,040
Corning's Hazelton unit is involved with the importation and sale of laboratory animals.

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,820
Each year, about 16,000 wild monkeys are imported into the United States from the tropical regions

39
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,440
of the earth, including humans.

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,900
Hello.

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Welcome, gentle sunlight.

42
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,940
Welcome to the castle Amtrak.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,320
The castle Amtrak?

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,420
Yes.

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,220
It's not a very good name, is it?

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,780
I hear about some animals.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,080
I hear about some monkeys.

48
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,660
Monkeys?

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,720
Monkeys.

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,400
Yes.

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,820
Twelve of them.

52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,220
He claimed that he had come from the future.

53
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,160
That he was looking for a pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,360
earth starting the year 1996.

55
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,840
Hear him!

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm mad about myself.

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
And I think you've got the mad scientist.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,580
Mahmoud, you are acquainted with the role that Balib was to have played in the second

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,520
phase of our operation.

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,100
I am so.

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,640
We should be in Oklahoma City tomorrow.

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,940
If this car rolls out, if the two attacks come right on top of each other, the TV will

63
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,380
go nuts.

64
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,980
And the letters are ready.

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
We had to set a tone.

66
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,560
We had to make it a war.

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,080
We can't just have a couple of assassinations.

68
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,960
We have to make the media think war.

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,740
It has to be big.

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:23,980
If we want to get the great Satan, Sam snorted, it'll be for nothing if we can't get him out

71
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,240
here.

72
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm mad about myself.

73
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


74
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


77
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


78
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


79
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


81
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


82
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,500


83
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,900
I'm mad about the rest of us.

84
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


85
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


86
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


87
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


88
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


89
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


90
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


91
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


92
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


93
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:26,900


94
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,040
In the world I see, they're stalking elk through the damn canyon forest around the

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,380
ruins of Rockefeller Center.

96
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,300
Oh you, you keep your head in the round and round and round.

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,060
Oh you, you've got your children knocked down.

98
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,960
You were nobody before.

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,460
I've since delighted with war.

100
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,260
I've since delighted with war.

101
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,260


102
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,440
I've seen who we are.

103
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,500
I've seen who we are.

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,400
I had a dream to you last night

105
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,180
At the end of the world

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,560
It's just like my dream.

107
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,860
That was terrible.

108
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,760
I'll just sprinkle you all with some amnesia dust.

109
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,040
A micro-break of a rainforest virus

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,260
with unknown potential to start an explosive chain

111
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,660
of lethal transmission in the human race

112
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,320
emerges in a cold geometry of clinical fact

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,940
mixed with flashes of horror so brilliant and disturbing

114
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,960
that we draw back and blink

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,920
as if we are staring into a discolored alien sun.

116
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,920
Oh, who left those freaking blinds open?

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,580
Ow, my eyes.

118
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,020
Oh, my friends.

119
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,260
Oh, my chest.

120
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,340
I mean, besides the obvious.

121
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,640
I don't think I'm doing too good.

122
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh, great.

123
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
What have I started?

124
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,120
That's crazy.

125
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,300
That's nuts.

126
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,020
It's like someone who doesn't...

127
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
doesn't know us.

128
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,080
Not at all.

129
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,880
He said it happens all the time

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,320
that we can even get grenades in mines.

131
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah, these things have happened before

132
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,200
except when grown-ups do it.

133
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,220
They call it war.

134
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,420
So I said I wish you all would stop your groaning

135
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,760
stop cussing and cranking and shucking and moaning.

136
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,000
I wonder what would happen if you tell Jimmy

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,500
how far are you hitting and if he hits 10 in it

138
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,580
that Timmy would go and take Billy's hand

139
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,800
and hopefully someday they'll understand.

140
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,020
Cause what's gonna happen if you don't do this?

141
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,580
That will be Johnny and Frank are gonna wanna get your back.

142
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,820
And you and Timmy will go beat up Bill

143
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,120
who'll turn around tomorrow and wanna kill

144
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,500
you and him and Steven and Johnny and Jack

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,920
and one day one of you will try and get him back.

146
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,260
They call it Timmy, get Billy, who punched out Steve

147
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,360
when Steve hit Laura after Jack and Johnny hit Tommy

148
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
and Richard hit Emily

149
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,520
who accidentally pushed Debbie with a toothy sniff.

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
Billy fumped that over for a moment or two

151
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,900
and then he said, I bet I can beat up you.

152
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,240
So how do you feel?

153
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,280
Not too bad.

154
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,020
As long as I don't laugh or sneeze.

155
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,960
I don't feel so good.

156
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,680
Ah, Memorial Day.

157
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
A day when our war heroes are honored

158
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,180
by even the most liberal of media.

159
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,180
Not anymore.

160
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,840
Naturally we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops.

161
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,000
We now return you to the President's address already in progress.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,220
Splash, ladies and gentlemen.

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
The President threw up this afternoon

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,100
on the steps of the Kremlin just prior to Keats' death.

165
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,200
He was heard to mumble something about Borscht

166
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
and was suddenly on his knees.

167
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,500
Before his bodyguards could assist him,

168
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,620
five or six peasants of undetermined origin

169
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,760
stuck several small protest signs on the President

170
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,560
which Scott taped.

171
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,300
Douche.

172
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,300
Douche.

173
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,180
That's my sound effect.

174
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,440
Douche.

175
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,160
Okay.

176
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,860
Douche.

177
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,900
Mr. President!

178
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,300
He leans over, head on his knees,

179
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,980
and brings up an incredible story.

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,720
He takes an incredible quantity of blood from his stomach

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,600
and spills it onto the floor with a gasping groan.

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,380
He loses consciousness and pitches forward onto the floor.

183
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,120
Then comes a sound like a bed sheet being torn in half,

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
which is the sound of his bowels opening as a sphincter

185
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
and drinking blood.

186
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,720
The blood is mixed with intestinal linings.

187
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,540
He has blocked his gut.

188
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,340
The linings of his intestines have come off

189
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,420
and are being expelled along with huge amounts of blood.

190
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,080
Brain damage.

191
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
Nobody home.

192
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,860
Now you don't see that every day.

193
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,420
What's the altimeter?

194
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,100
It's impossible!

195
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,720
My God, there's been an exposure!

196
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,580
The next day, a few bits of frozen meat from monkey 053

197
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,440
arrived at the institute, brought by courier.

198
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,380
And I, I did open that letter in my backyard with rubber gloves.

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,560
Um, before I get any of that on your hands,

200
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,060
I want to thank you for your support.

201
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


202
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


203
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


204
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


205
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


206
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


207
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,060


208
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,240
All right.

209
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,120
Monkey 2, 730 or anything.

210
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,000
Ah, you said it a bit.

211
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,620
What annoyed him was the fact that the bits of meat

212
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,320
were wrapped in aluminum foil,

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,400
like pieces of leftover hot dogs.

214
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,520
Like the kind of mystery meat you get in a school lunchroom.

215
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,200
That's nice.

216
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,380
Uh, uh...

217
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm making my lunch!

218
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,360
Now I don't have to tell you all

219
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,320
that the dangers of science are a time-worn threat.

220
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,460
From Prometheus,

221
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,020
stealing fire from the gods,

222
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,340
the Cold War era of the Doctor Strangelove terror.

223
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,260
But never before!

224
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
We're gonna whip it out,

225
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,040
lube it up,

226
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,600
and wank it!

227
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,540
People who knew him recalled that he was affectionate with wild monkeys.

228
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,560
That he had a special way with them.

229
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,820
You know me?

230
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,120
And about your work?

231
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,140
My work?

232
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,340
Bioware, pathology, parameters in urban and semi-urban environments.

233
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,280
General Military Medicine, June, 1971.

234
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,740
Incremental effects, countermeasures to toxic agents in liquid systems delivery.

235
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,380
Microbiological letters, January, 1975. Remember?

236
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,940
The doctors remember the clinical signs.

237
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,680
Because no one who has seen the effects of a biosafety level 4 hot agent

238
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,080
on a human being can ever forget them.

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,300
Whoa! Ho! Ho!

240
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,800
I think the survivors would envy the dead!

241
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,360
I was a very peculiar doctor in those days.

242
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
Trying to find treatments for diseases that hadn't existed.

243
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,440
Tell all that to me.

244
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,400
The doctors invented them.

245
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,320
Now I'm the only game in town.

246
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,160
I was a military senior when they scratched the world.

247
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,600
As a matter of fact, I was gonna apply to Bioware lab for my postdoc, but...

248
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,640
The next turn never came.

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,820
You know that big dude?

250
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,460
He threw up because he got so agitated.

251
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,560
And if he'd known about our masturbation...

252
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,760
He got so worked up, he had to puke.

253
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,080
Yeah.

254
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,940
That's wrong.

255
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,800
He got a big ashtray up front.

256
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,380
I don't think...

257
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,540
A big ashtray that people had to empty.

258
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,760
The worst of them was Ebola Zaire.

259
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,240
The kill rate in humans infected with Ebola Zaire is nine out of ten.

260
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,600
Ebola Zaire is a slate wiper in humans.

261
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,360
That's nice.

262
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:42,900
Mm-hmm.

263
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,200
Ebola Zaire is the most feared agent at the institute.

264
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,120
Those people who work with Ebola are crazy.

265
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
To mess around with Ebola was an easy way to die.

266
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,420
But it was a very difficult task.

267
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,200
Better to work with something safer, such as anthrax.

268
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,020
Ebola was unpredictable.

269
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,020
A virus is a small capsule made of membranes and proteins.

270
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:14,080
The capsule contains one or more strands of DNA or RNA, which are long molecules that contain the software program for making a copy of the virus.

271
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,740
A virus is a parasite.

272
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,480
It can't live on its own.

273
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,420
It uses the energy and material in the cell to survive.

274
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,160
By attaching to the cell membrane, causing cell surface alteration.

275
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:35,720
It makes copies of itself inside a cell until eventually the cell gets pigged with virus and pops, and the viruses spill out of the broken cell.

276
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,600
They replicate in large numbers, mature, and release their massive battalions by blowing up cells.

277
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,260
Oh my God!

278
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,200
That was when I knew that Ebola can travel through the air.

279
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,540
Hold up!

280
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,400
We need to go!

281
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:58,020
It's a big laser, because there's something in the air.

282
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,940
It probably travelled through the air in aerosolized secretions, like drips coming out of a faucet.

283
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,500
Drip, drip, drip, copy, copy, copy.

284
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,140
Oh Jesus.

285
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,220
The faucet runs and runs until the cell is exhausted, consumed, and destroyed.

286
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:21,420
The viruses scatter, besieging more cells, and the infection spreads as the viruses increase in strength and number at a staggering rate.

287
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,660
Ebola virus destroyed an animal's internal organs

288
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,020
and the carcass deteriorated abruptly after death.

289
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,560
It softened and the tissues turned to jelly,

290
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,460
even if you put it in a refrigerator to keep it cold.

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,360
You wanted to dissect the animals quickly

292
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,160
before the spontaneous liquefaction began

293
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,080
because you can't dissect gumbo.

294
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,680
Is that...

295
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,000
Nothing we should mention.

296
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
No, that's the dissolution of...

297
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,060
Monkeys spit and throw stuff.

298
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,580
Monkeys spit and throw stuff.

299
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:53,640
Yeah.

300
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,160
Yeah.

301
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,900
I can make toxins from both of these.

302
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,260
An airborne strain of Ebola could emerge and circle the world

303
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,580
in about six weeks, like the flu,

304
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,480
killing large numbers of people.

305
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,280
Or it might forever remain a secret feeder at the margins,

306
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,880
taking down humans a few at a time.

307
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,040
But unlike HIV,

308
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,180
the attack by Ebola is swift and explosive.

309
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,080
Ebola does in ten days

310
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,820
what it takes AIDS ten years to accomplish.

311
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,820
Christ.

312
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,140
It's great.

313
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Just great.

314
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,660
He's complicated, Doctor.

315
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,160
He had slumped to his knees, almost paralyzed,

316
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,480
clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand.

317
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,980
Everything had exploded into yellow light.

318
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,320
Inconceivable, inconceivable

319
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,340
that one blow could cause such pain.

320
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,860
The lights cleared,

321
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,060
and he could see the other two looking down at him.

322
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,020
The guard was laughing at his contortions.

323
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,960
He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed,

324
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,260
except that it was higher off the ground

325
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,140
and that he was fixed down in some way

326
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,160
so that he could not move.

327
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,200
Light that seemed stronger than usual

328
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
was falling on his face.

329
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,800
O'Brien was standing at his side,

330
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,120
looking down at him intently.

331
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,100
At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat

332
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,700
holding a hypodermic syringe.

333
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,440
Even after his eyes were open,

334
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,440
he took in his surroundings,

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,160
only gradually.

336
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,140
He had the impression of swimming up into this room

337
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,980
from some quite different world,

338
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,980
a sort of underwater world,

339
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,240
far beneath it.

340
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,360
I looked at these doctors.

341
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,160
I said, Bob, what in the world is all that?

342
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,780
I need a man who has dealt with the Americans and their vans.

343
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,260
Over to his left,

344
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,860
Winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampule

345
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,700
and draw back the plunger of a syringe.

346
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
He raised a finger to the man in the white coat.

347
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,900
Three thousand, he said,

348
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,420
speaking over Winston's head to the man in the white coat.

349
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,800
Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist,

350
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:51,140
clamped themselves against Winston's temples.

351
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,040
He quailed.

352
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,700
There was a pain coming,

353
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,380
a new kind of pain.

354
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,960
O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly,

355
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,280
almost kindly, on his.

356
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,680
This time it will not hurt, he said.

357
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,700
Keep your eyes fixed on mine.

358
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,560
At this moment there was a devastating explosion.

359
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,620
Uh, and yeah, that was what it sounded like.

360
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,300
It was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light.

361
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,180
Winston was not hurt, only prostrated.

362
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,340
Although he had already been lying on his back

363
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,260
when the thing happened,

364
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,120
he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position.

365
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,900
A terrific, painless blow had flattened him out.

366
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,120
Also, something had happened inside his head.

367
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,820
Now I am a monkey,

368
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,340
a monkey, monkey,

369
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,060
monkey, monkey,

370
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,720
and I am a monkey, too.

371
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,640
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

372
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,920
Space monkey.

373
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,260
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.

374
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,600
That's nice.

375
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,220
No one else wanted to do it.

376
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,360
Doc pulled on a pair of tight-fitting rubber surgical gloves.

377
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,460
Then, carefully, he used a sterile insulin syringe he'd bought,

378
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,400
removed a quarter of a cubic centimeter of blood,

379
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,920
and injected it into a soft gelatin cap.

380
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,260
Look at him jiggle.

381
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,200
Uh-huh.

382
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,440
Quivers. Yeah. Yeah.

383
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,320
Awesome.

384
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,080
Then he enclosed the gel cap inside a two-part,

385
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,840
coated, non-soluble plastic capsule

386
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,440
that I could carry in my mouth.

387
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
My mouth? Absolutely, tadpole.

388
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,700
When you're searched, people may be perfectly willing to stick their fingers up your

389
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:37,920
mob,

390
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,220
but they seldom want to run them inside your mouth.

391
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,500
Mop. Yuck.

392
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,400
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

393
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,220
I've got the strength to stop them.

394
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,620
Because there's nothing can beat it.

395
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,880
Keep holding.

396
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,120
Because you can't get up from the place above.

397
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,100
It's just a revolution.

398
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,880
And you know it's right.

399
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,840
You know it's right.

400
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,700
You know it's right.

401
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,260
You know it's right.

402
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,760
You know it's right.

403
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,040
You know it's right.

404
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,780
You know it's right.

405
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:16,780


406
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,120
We have got to get it together!

407
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,200
We have got to get it together!

408
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,640
You won't feel a thing till I jam this down your throat.

409
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,580
You got it, Pop.

410
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,980
Just let me run a few prints through it first.

411
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,840
I dried everything in his shells on him.

412
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,760
Join me.

413
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,380
Sweet!

414
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,860
Squeezing taste? Some monsterism.

415
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,980
A needle jerked into Winston's arm.

416
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,240
But somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.

417
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,500
We got him, we got him!

418
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,760
And utterly weak, and his spine goes limp and nerve-less.

419
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,800
He is going into shock. He is cracking. He can't talk.

420
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,320
Viruses.

421
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,680
Are molecular sharks.

422
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
Emotive without a mind.

423
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,960
They had been injected with the hottest type of Ebola known to the world.

424
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,020
You did what?

425
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,360
It was the Myinga strain of Ebola Zaire.

426
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:27,740
Oh.

427
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
This strain had come from a young nurse named Myinga N.

428
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,340
Who died of the virus on October 19th, 1976.

429
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,720
Some of her blood had ended up in the United States.

430
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,600
Kept in super freezers at the institute at the temperature of liquid nitrogen.

431
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,300
Man, woman, child, woman.

432
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,660
All is up against the wall of science.

433
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,500
We have got to get it together now!

434
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,980
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...

435
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,600
If only I had a little pink button to push that could wipe out this town.

436
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,320
You hold the power of the magic figure-acer.

437
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,280
And it's yours right now.

438
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,300
You will be the first.

439
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,560
The miracle.

440
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,460
Tell me.

441
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,660
Is it possible to get me a hydrogen bomb?

442
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,460
I doubt it, your majesty.

443
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,560
How about germ warfare?

444
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,840
Do you know anything about that?

445
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,860
You mean poisoning the population?

446
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,200
Yes, that sounds like a fun project.

447
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,320
How about rabies?

448
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,800
Could we spread that disease inexpensively?

449
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
I think so, your majesty.

450
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,300
All we need is some rabbit bat pups to make a serum.

451
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,300


452
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,640
Fine, let's try it.

453
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,320
Rabbit bat pups?

454
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,520
And let's put in a little rat piff for good luck.

455
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,600
You are a genius, your majesty.

456
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,840
I know, I know.

457
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,680
The next day.

458
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,040
The next day.

459
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,120
The next day.

460
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,620
The next day.

461
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,000
The next day.

462
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,420
The next day.

463
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,680
The next day.

464
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,540
The next day.

465
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,200
Let's send the next thing off.

466
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,900
It's all wrapped up in one big beautiful pink package.

467
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,260
And if you could put a stamp on it

468
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,140
and mail it to Washington to the your favourite senator,

469
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,680
you might get in a few good licks for the human race.

470
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,080
What did he mean by that?

471
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:27,980
I don't know.

472
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,560
I would have a little peace and quiet for a while.

473
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,340
Come on.

474
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,380
Dad.

475
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,980
I don't bring you peace and love.

476
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,720
I bring you fear, famine, pestilence...

477
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,580
Dad, he's got a letter from the city of New York.

478
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Throw it away.

479
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,220
Nothing good has ever come out of New York City.

480
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,300
approximately 11 40 this morning we got a call from the staff of senator tom dashiell that they'd

481
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,580
received a suspicious letter inside the suite in the capitol building room s 220 uh u.s capitol

482
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,780
police officers responded to the scene we secured the area and uh didn't allow anybody in didn't

483
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,120
allow anybody out all our hazardous devices unit responded uh they suited up and went in

484
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,360
and when they conducted an analysis of the substance they found a letter that had a

485
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,540
threatening note inside and a powdery substance inside of the letter stupid mailman squeal on me

486
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,320
they conducted an analysis of the substance with bio tickets both of those tickets came back

487
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,660
negative now who's being naive and the shepherd's boy cried

488
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:39,700
his neighbors supposing him to be playing his old game

489
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,860
paid

490
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,020
you

491
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,360
,

492
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,740
and devoured as many sheep as he wanted

493
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,460
thus the shepherd's boy learned that liars are not believed even when they tell the truth

494
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:04,720
and then and all of us understand that we will develop the truth over time because there's not

495
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,740
a desire to hide it yeah right me too

496
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,100
you

497
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,860
that was terrible i'll just sprinkle you all with some amnesia dust

498
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,340
i say live it or live with it

499
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,720
we're not that far gone but we're on the road the yellow brick road we're off to see the wizard

500
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,480
pay no attention to that man behind the curtain this interview is over

501
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,020
wash wash wash

502
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,100
wash your...

503
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,200
hands before doing anything that has to do with food.

504
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:50,280
Senator, what about the rumors that a biological weapon has been stolen and smuggled out of

505
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,540
the country during this conference?

506
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Senator.

507
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
Watch, watch, watch.

508
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,760
Be a germ fighter with me.

509
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,800
Watch, watch, watch.

510
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,300
Watch, watch, watch.

511
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,780
Watch, watch, watch.

512
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,140
You can better communicate.

513
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,840
As a result of hardening the homeland against a virus attack with first-time responders,

514
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,980
our neighborhoods will be ultimately safer for crime.

515
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,120
It's funny because it's true.

516
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,820
Our response has been to weave a web of terrorism prevention and is the linchpin of all of our

517
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,380
efforts to protect terrorism.

518
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,560
Well observed.

519
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,980
Homeland security will make America not only stronger.

520
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,140
But in many ways better.

521
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,700
Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health.

522
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,180
We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases.

523
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,020
Naturally, we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops.

524
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,640
We don't know exactly what the substance is.

525
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,720
What we do know is, according to our protocols, we've notified the FBI.

526
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,340
The FBI is on scene now.

527
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,300
This is now going to be a matter of a criminal investigation conducted by the FBI in conjunction

528
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,780
with the United States Capitol Police.

529
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
FBI, good morning.

530
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,000
FBI.

531
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,220
Yes, good morning, sir.

532
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,360
FBI, I found a terrorist in the hospital.

533
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,900
I know who did this.

534
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,580
It was those bullies at Tom and his Martin High School.

535
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:21,980
That's who.

536
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,480
Whoa.

537
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,780
There are now approximately 150 guerrilla groups planning a revolution.

538
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,780
The Church of Jesus Christ.

539
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,500
It'll never happen in my life.

540
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,960
I have nothing over which to get concerned.

541
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,120
Who are they?

542
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,220
First, we have the white.

543
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,920
A, 18 active type Ku Klux Klan groups.

544
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,860
B, the National States Rights Party.

545
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,480
C, the Nationalist Socialist White People's Party.

546
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,480
American Nazi Party.

547
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,640
D, the Minutemen.

548
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,740
E, the Christian Nationalist Crusade.

549
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,300
Anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish.

550
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,780
F, the White Panthers headquarters in Ann Arbor.

551
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,840
You'll hear much about them in a minute.

552
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,560
Secondly, you have the blacks.

553
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,740
Over 100 different groups.

554
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,820
A, Black Panthers.

555
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,340
B, Islam.

556
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,000
The fruit of Islam.

557
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,000
C, the Republic of New Africa.

558
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,380
Hey, what's she talking about?

559
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,560
I...

560
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,040
You know that hassle last summer between the bikers and the Indian people out in the Black Hills?

561
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,380
There was a bunch of cops and a bunch of bikers and the Indian medicine people.

562
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:11,960
It's not bad.

563
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,020
I fear for what we did to that boy.

564
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
It wasn't quite right, you know.

565
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,740
I think we made a crazy man.

566
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,880
You're calling me crazy, but I got a bad feeling about this guy.

567
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,180
All right, then. Let's do it.

568
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,460
Okay.

569
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,000
Look at this.

570
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,820
DJ, run it back.

571
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:24,760
Freeze.

572
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,720
Don't move.

573
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,620
Drop that ax.

574
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,700
I have to put the ax down?

575
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,540
This man.

576
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,640
The FBI believes we've evolved in nefarious activity.

577
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,960
What was the evidence?

578
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,720
Well, the man was seen walking into his home one day with a large pot.

579
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,900
And he was later seen dumping some liquid out his back door.

580
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,820
Oh, my God.

581
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,360
Oh, man.

582
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,260
That's ugly.

583
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:52,720
Well, it turns out that the large pot that he was carrying into his house was for his wife's favorite chicken and rice dish.

584
00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:00,740
And it just turns out that the liquid that he was dumping out his back door was soap water that had come from a backed-up dishwasher.

585
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,840
Yeah, right.

586
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,860
Me too.

587
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,140
It's hard for me to clean this giant pot when it keeps throwing meat tenderizer all over me.

588
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,580
Oh, great.

589
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,820
Now I gotta work in the dark.

590
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,000
And Brax thought the FBI?

591
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,420
Who knows what?

592
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:33,540
Well, before he knows what's happening, in broad daylight, with TV cameras rolling, neighbors gawking, the FBI breaks down this man's door, holds him at gunpoint, with his wife and himself sitting on a couch, and says,

593
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:42,100
holding him at gunpoint, and interrogates them for hours before they're finally convinced that these people are involved in cooking a chicken and rice dish.

594
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:53,080
Now, what's particularly sad and troubling about this incident is not even those blatantly unconstitutional measures that the FBI took, although they're disturbing.

595
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,740
What is particularly sad about this incident is that when later asked about his reaction, this man said,

596
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,520
The FBI can come into my home whenever they want.

597
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,320
I'm not complaining.

598
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:14,920
It's not particularly easy, scientifically, to figure out that this particular strain of anthrax came from this particular place or person.

599
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,080
It's pretty hard to figure out.

600
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:26,640
I think the FBI is doing its best, and the Center for Disease Control is doing its best to try to get to the bottom of who caused the anthrax attack.

601
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,420
Not me. I'm more of a male tamper.

602
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,300
Yes?

603
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,020
Boss, we've got a problem.

604
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,520
International Health Organization.

605
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,040
Authorities were urgently concerned to find the exact source of the infected monkeys.

606
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,200
Well, you know, $29.95, I mean, it's not that big a deal.

607
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:41,860
What?

608
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,580
It's double the price on me.

609
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,260
Now, that's a friend rate.

610
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,820
$29.95 is a friend rate.

611
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,420
Trust me.

612
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,220
You go out on the internet.

613
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,080
Well, we don't have time for all this capitalist rambling.

614
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
Money, when it was needed.

615
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,260
When the scandal hit the FBI, kickbacks in an insider trading investigation, the administration knew where to go.

616
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,320
The boy from Phoenix had a reputation.

617
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,480
He cleaned up the Phoenix force, and he'd clean up the FBI.

618
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,500
But he wouldn't try too hard.

619
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,520
Not many people remember his early days in Phoenix.

620
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,840
The night spent hunting drunk Indian chicks.

621
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,480
And, uh, I'm sorry that these discoveries have been made.

622
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,360
With that in mind, do you have any concern about the FBI investigation?

623
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,340
I say to myself, not bad.

624
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,300
And pull out your booze-soaked sniveling rumpak.

625
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,660
That's all I'm taking from you.

626
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,800
Get back here, you jerk!

627
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,500
Let him finish.

628
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:31,740
Let him finish.

629
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,520
We've changed the attitude of the FBI.

630
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,240
I mean, we're not, we're interested in spies.

631
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,060
We're on the hunt.

632
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:47,960
Major cities in all parts of the country, New York, Los Angeles, report plague victims falling dead in the streets, in their home, at their work.

633
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,700
The first symptom appears to be severe choking, followed by immediate unconsciousness.

634
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,460
Death occurs within minutes.

635
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

636
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:02,660
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

637
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,460
You're a moron.

638
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,840
You're a moron.

639
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:05,840


640
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:05,840


641
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,700
We hit the older people.

642
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,380
Either died outright or went to the third stage pretty fast.

643
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,700
Well, you know, Linus and Mike, albinism, psychotic illusions, occasional stages of torture, like in King's Outlaw.

644
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,500
I've eaten everything from the roach baits, severe old cakes, and I still feel like crap.

645
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,640
It's me.

646
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,840
Turn on the TV.

647
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:33,520
Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain, and civil defense authorities state the situation is much the same across the country.

648
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:40,220
the entire country. Martial law is now nationwide. We have in this country a tradition of evoking

649
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,260
martial law only when the most dire of circumstances require it. But at what cost?

650
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,080
All eyes now turn to New York City to see if martial law will bring the terror to an end.

651
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,060
Good morning. Today, with the invocation of the War Powers Act by the president,

652
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,400
I am declaring a state of martial law in this city. To the best of our knowledge,

653
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,920
we are opposed by no more than 20 of the enemy. He's hiding among a population of roughly 2

654
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,260
million. Intelligence tells us that he is most likely Arab-speaking, between the age of 14 and

655
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,920
30, narrowing the target to 15,000 suspects. We can further reduce that number down to those

656
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,100
that have been in this country less than six months. Now you have 20 hiding among 2,000.

657
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,500
If you are one of these 20 young men, you can hide among a population of similar ethnic

658
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,200
backgrounds. Unfortunately for you, you can only hide there.

659
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,680
The population in a classic immigration pattern is concentrated right here in Brooklyn.

660
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,620
We intend to seal off this borough. Then we intend to squeeze it.

661
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,380
This is a land of opportunity, gentlemen. The opportunity to turn yourselves in.

662
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,000
After sundown tonight, any young man fitting the profile I described who has not cooperated

663
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
will be arrested and detained. There is historically nothing more corrosive to the

664
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,660
morale of a population than policing its own citizens. But the enemy would be sadly mistaken

665
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,840
if they were to doubt our resolve.

666
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,860
They are now face to face with the most fearsome military machine in the history of man. And

667
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,280
I intend to use it to be back on base in time for the playoffs. Thank you for your time.

668
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,840
Boring.

669
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,900
We will have more on this story as soon as it develops.

670
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,440
You better see a doctor.

671
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,800
A tiny core of doggy doctors. They take care of the Army's guard dogs, as well as Army

672
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:29,360
horses, Army cows, Army sheep, Army pigs, Army mules, Army rabbits, Army mice, and Army

673
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,380
dogs.

674
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,380


675
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,700
I'm sorry.

676
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,120
Plus, it's 12 o'clock.

677
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,960
No, no, I don't want to talk about a monkey on a baby's doctor.

678
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,560
Hello?

679
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
This is the solar process.

680
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,600
Wow, it's been a long time since you've been to consult me.

681
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,260
It still allows you.

682
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,740
I think it works for a while. It makes me feel better.

683
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,360
What you say, huh?

684
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


685
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


686
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


687
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


688
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


689
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


690
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


691
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


692
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


693
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


694
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


695
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


696
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


697
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


698
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


699
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


700
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,360


701
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,480
What's your question again? I want to listen in.

702
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,040
I don't want to hear it now. Let me just show up, okay?

703
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,000
Oh, man.

704
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,240
Oh, God.

705
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,980
At the Institute,

706
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,740
Welcome to the Consulate, Chief.

707
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,480
the seats are narrow and jammed together, and you notice everything that is happening

708
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,580
inside the cabin. You would not have been able to ignore the man who was getting sick.

709
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,360
He was holding an air sickness bag over his mouth. He coughed and then he was able to

710
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,360


711
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,160
breathe. He coughed a deep cough and regurgitated something into the bag. He opened his mouth

712
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:40,680
and gasped into the bag. The vomiting goes on endlessly. The air sickness bag fills up

713
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,060
to the brim with a substance known as the vomito negro, or the black vomit, a stew of

714
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:51,900
tarry granules mixed with fresh red arterial blood. It is hemorrhage, and it smells like

715
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:59,320
a slaughterhouse. The black vomit is loaded with virus. It is highly infective. We need

716
00:32:59,320 --> 00:32:59,620
to get rid of it.

717
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,740
The bag is increasingly hot, a liquid that would scare the daylights out of a military

718
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,780
biohazard specialist.

719
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,640
Son, I think I can safely say,

720
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:12,460
The bag is bulging and softening, threatening to leak, and he hands it to a flight attendant.

721
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,360
Hmph. Wise guy. You better see a doctor.

722
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,200
Our medical logic seems to be shooting out of his ears.

723
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,900
His ears are for a lot of...

724
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,720
When a hot virus multiplies in a host, it can saturate the body with virus particles,

725
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,440
from the brain to the skin.

726
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,420
The military experts say, then, that the virus has undergone extreme amplification.

727
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,820
During this process, the body is partly transformed into virus particles. The end result is a

728
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,000
great deal of liquefying flesh mixed with virus. His personality is being wiped away

729
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,520
by brain damage. Tiny spots in his brain are liquefying. The higher functions of consciousness

730
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,140
are winking out. The human virus bomb explodes.

731
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,500
He's rupturing, Captain. Pressure sense.

732
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,760
Readings confirmed. He blew a left testicle.

733
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,080
Military biohazard specialists have ways of describing this occurrence.

734
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,320
They say that the victim crashed and bled out. Or more politely, they say that the victim went down.

735
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,920
Is anyone here not a downer?

736
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,460
That's nice. Some of the men suffered from blown up, semi-rotten testicles.

737
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,940
Sure, sure. Who hasn't?

738
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,220
More testicles mean more iron.

739
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,520
Uh-huh.

740
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,300
Uh, that's nice.

741
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,840
Mm-hmm.

742
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:35,940
All of us want to know, just as much as I want to know, who's responsible.

743
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:43,280
All I bear to you two, and ten minutes later every cop in the state will be after us, plus the FBI.

744
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:54,940
Must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world.

745
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:04,660
The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade.

746
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:10,480
This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens.

747
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,120
Fools of old! Poison gas!

748
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,460
And obsolete germ bombs!

749
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Just as a freak tornado cruised through!

750
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,560
Sucking up two-thirds of it!

751
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,200
Suck, suck, suck!

752
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,540
For untimely dispersal over vast stretches of...

753
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,540
What?!

754
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,680
The wasteland. I wonder if it comforts him.

755
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,880
I wonder if I'll ever see a stream full of fish again.

756
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,180
Where'd you ever see a stream full of fish in Harlem?

757
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,700
You crazy bitch!

758
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,680
At the movies.

759
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:02,160
As a result of hardening the homeland against a virus attack with first-time responders...

760
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,880
What?!

761
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,520
...to detect biological and chemical weapons and agents, we're gonna have an even swifter response to food contamination.

762
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,680
That's my boy!

763
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,680
It was O'Brien who was directing everything.

764
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,600
It was he who set the guards onto Winston and who prevented them from killing him.

765
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:32,240
It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drug should be pumped into his arm.

766
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,280
It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers.

767
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,420
He was the tormentor. He was the protector. He was the inquisitor. He was the friend.

768
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,660
I guess what I want you to know as a father is...

769
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,320
You're no son of mine! You don't...

770
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,380
He paused and signed to the man in the white coat.

771
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,400
Good news, boys!

772
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,840
I found a pharmacy that carries leeches!

773
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,100
Well, it wasn't exactly a pharmacy. More of a bait shop!

774
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,940
Well, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies.

775
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,640
Or a thermometer, my eye!

776
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,080
Think warm touch, boy, cause this is mighty cold!

777
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,580
You gotta pay the towel!

778
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,720
This is infectious diarrhea. Always precede lunch time.

779
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,820
Can I have the first line, please?

780
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,320
Oh, shit!

781
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,220
I think I'm gonna be sick!

782
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,160
Uh, the etiologic agent that causes infectious diarrhea

783
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,500
usually can be divided into three large groups.

784
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,140
Bacterial, viral, and parasitic.

785
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,780
And eliminate the terrorist parasites.

786
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,480
Actually, it doesn't necessarily cause diarrhea per se.

787
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,620
It penetrates through the intestinal mucosa to the mesenteric lymph node

788
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,360
and then to the bloodstream and causes enteric fever.

789
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:44,840
Oh!

790
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,760
And the most frequent major symptoms here...

791
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,780
Nausea,

792
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,640
vomiting,

793
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,180
abdominal cramps,

794
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,100
infectious diarrhea...

795
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,640
Yes!

796
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Space monkey.

797
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,540
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.

798
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,920
Sacrifice? Nonsense.

799
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,320
Doctor, what can I do?

800
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,900
The cough wracks his body day and night.

801
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,160
Let them take this man of yours up into the hills,

802
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,720
where his cough-torn lungs can breathe clean, fresh air.

803
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,360
But he perishes because the gods are angry.

804
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,520
He perishes because we live in a world full of superstitious fools.

805
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,900
It isn't the gods that make a man sick or well.

806
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,440
The gods could strike you dead for saying that.

807
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,300
Perhaps they will.

808
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,040
But I'm sure they won't strike me with a bellyache.

809
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,120
That's heresy.

810
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,840
Nature follows certain definite laws, which can be observed.

811
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,140
And the course of a disease may be more or less predicted.

812
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,760
And don't forget, in any population,

813
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,680
there's always the so-called background diarrhea level of 2 to 5%.

814
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,200
So, the use of diarrhea may not be due to the...

815
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,960
the foreign country, maybe due to yourself,

816
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,980
because there is such a thing as a background diarrhea rate.

817
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,400
He looks pretty sick to me.

818
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,960
Hey, I think he's coming around.

819
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,740
He's coming around, folks.

820
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,560
He's gonna be okay and ready to play Symptom 6 of Beat the Reaper.

821
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,940
Last week, our patients successfully survived the common cold,

822
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,840
measles, pneumonia, dengue fever, and the yawns.

823
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,840
And now, the big question.

824
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,280
Are you ready to go off?

825
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:22,940
Well...

826
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,460
He's ready!

827
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,880
Now, our countless nurse Judy is wheeling our patient into the isolation ward.

828
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,640
Well, let's try the test vaccine, uh, 93B71.

829
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,980
Can you hear me in there?

830
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,320
How the hell do I know?

831
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,940
Okay. Let's shoot him up.

832
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,480
Now, patient, you have 10 seconds to tell us

833
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,440
what you've got and beat the Reaper!

834
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,280
Uh...

835
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Uh...

836
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,680
Uh...

837
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,160
I'm shaking.

838
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,080
I'm shaking.

839
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,340
My hands are all...

840
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,820
I'm turning yellow.

841
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,160
My...

842
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,160
My god, I've got jaundice!

843
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,280
Jaundice it is!

844
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:04,720
Give him...

845
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,440
Well, that's Symptom 6.

846
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,240
And now, you've reached the final threshold.

847
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,820
Here's the question.

848
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,720
Are you ready for symptom number seven,

849
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,460
longer than any patient has ever survived?

850
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,520
I want to go home.

851
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,420
Only one way to do that.

852
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,460
Doctor, bring in the super shot!

853
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,440
Now, for the first time on Beat the Reaper,

854
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,600
we're going for the big disease.

855
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,760
The icebox is being unlocked by the president of the Armenian Medical Association,

856
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,180
under whose strict supervision these toxins are being administered.

857
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,060
Uh...

858
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,420
This is it.

859
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Doctor, give him that really big disease!

860
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,860
Now, patient, can you hear me?

861
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,420
You've got ten seconds to tell us what you've got.

862
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,740
And for the last time, beat the Reaper!

863
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,860
I feel...

864
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,860
I think I feel...

865
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,240
I don't know, whatever...

866
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
Whatever it is, I...

867
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,120
I want to die!

868
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,100
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

869
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,540
That's not correct.

870
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,740
You didn't beat the Reaper.

871
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,860
Ah!

872
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,640
Ah!

873
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,100
Ah!

874
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,320
Ah!

875
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,700
According to my careful prosthesis,

876
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,080
this man has...

877
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,100
the plague.

878
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,480
Thank you, Doctor.

879
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,420
You're welcome.

880
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,300
You've got the plague.

881
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,540
Well, isn't he a good sport, folks?

882
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,300
We'll be back in just a moment with our next patient,

883
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,720
but first...

884
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,480
Pulling off the towel,

885
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,200
he revealed an unmarked cardboard box,

886
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,720
wound heavily with tape,

887
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,360
put it in the trunk of his car,

888
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,880
and drove to the Institute.

889
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,760
And, uh, the jars of urine?

890
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,420
Ooh, we'll hang on to those.

891
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,360
Ah, these Laramie cigarettes

892
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,820
give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.

893
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,300
You're a pretty active man.

894
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,720
Shut up!

895
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,340
A massive traffic tie-up

896
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,960
as the death rate continues to soar.

897
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,820
Now, let's go to the river's edge

898
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,700
and Charles B. Smith.

899
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,540
Torches blazing

900
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,340
as the long line of shrouded funeral rafts

901
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,840
drift lazily into view.

902
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,420
Great black candles flickering

903
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,500
as hell turns.

904
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,420
The excitement is contagious,

905
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,860
and so are the Black Cross volunteers

906
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,900
as they pass from family to family,

907
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,320
pausing now and again

908
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,700
to touch a child's head.

909
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,160
I wish I could,

910
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,140
but I can't.

911
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,500
Ah!

912
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,400
I know they're gonna do everything they can

913
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,680
to protect you.

914
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,900
Safeguard the labs and other federal facilities

915
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,720
from being infected by these spores

916
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,580
and this material.

917
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,900
And that's angry swimmers here!

918
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,320
Get your germ lab out of here!

919
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,980
At the Institute,

920
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,480
he saw that they were bursting and dying.

921
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,620
They were infected with something,

922
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,940
and it killed them fast.

923
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,940
It killed them like flies.

924
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,000
It could multiply in many different kinds of meat.

925
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,680
It did not know that they were dead.

926
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,060
It could not know boundaries.

927
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,340
It was an invasive life form,

928
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,440
devastating and promiscuous.

929
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,020
It showed the kind of obscenity

930
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,160
you see only in nature,

931
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,180
an obscenity so extreme

932
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,720
that it dissolved imperceptibly into beauty.

933
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
Oh, ordinarily,

934
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,640
I take advantage of an introduction like that.

935
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,240
I am so damn sick.

936
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,140
Uh, I'm evil Susie.

937
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,260
I had an appointment.

938
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,880
And, uh,

939
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,220
yeah, just for your own,

940
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,320
uh, information.

941
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,420
I'm much more tractable

942
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,180
if you get as many pills down me as you can

943
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,000
in the first few minutes of the consultation, okay?

944
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,880
Ah, ah, ah.

945
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:53,820
Aspirin.

946
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,020
Are you 46?

947
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,100
Oh, yeah.

948
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,740
Ow!

949
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,660
Ow, wouldn't you give me that?

950
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,920
It's strong antitoxins.

951
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,420
It's not bacteria than viral, Ruth.

952
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,280
24 hours.

953
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,600
Oh, I guess it'll help.

954
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,740
Ah, ah, ah.

955
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,080
So damn sick.

956
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,440
Milwaukee Pest Control.

957
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:11,980
Shh.

958
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,740
Ah, ah, ah.

959
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,660
Yeah, I really love you.

960
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,060
Lucky to be ambulatory.

961
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,820
Ow!

962
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,980
A gallbladder attack or a liver abscess

963
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,700
could cause fever and jaundice

964
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,060
and abdominal pain.

965
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,940
The red eyes she could not explain.

966
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,180
Oh, yeah, that was, uh, uh,

967
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,680
nice decor, though.

968
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,580
What is this, a big cage?

969
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,100
This was a room known as the staging area.

970
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,420
Oh, that's good.

971
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,900
She found a box of latex rubber surgical gloves.

972
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,780
Everybody's feeling gay.

973
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,300
Hey!

974
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

975
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,820
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

976
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,080
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

977
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,660
Who the hell are you?

978
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,700
We're the lymph node institute.

979
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,580
I'm Dr. Bug Bladder.

980
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,460
I'm Doc Ellis.

981
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,240
I'm Dr. T-Nut.

982
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,220
Whatever works for you.

983
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,340
I'm evil Susie.

984
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,780
This is a soap opera.

985
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,460
You know Susie.

986
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,620
Like I know Susie.

987
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,760
You're not being Susie.

988
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,260
I don't know her in the...

989
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,520
Biblical sense?

990
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,160
...church way.

991
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,140
Oh, yeah.

992
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,400
Boy, what that is a good kiss.

993
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,540
That's on our face.

994
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:10,400
Ooh, there.

995
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,860
That's a dick.

996
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:12,820
Yeah.

997
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:12,820


998
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,440
Yeah.

999
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,180
She leaned forward and vomited copiously on the floor.

1000
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:17,720
Yeah.

1001
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,420
That was what it sounded like.

1002
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,980
Oh.

1003
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:21,360
Oh.

1004
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,020
That's better, she said, leaning back with closed eyes.

1005
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,660
Never keep it down, that's what I say.

1006
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,280
Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach like.

1007
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,540
She revived, turned to have another look at Winston,

1008
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,280
and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him.

1009
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,460
She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him toward him,

1010
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,680
breathing beer and vomit into his face.

1011
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,840
So, you're cute.

1012
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,240
Yeah.

1013
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,860
Because you're often...

1014
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,240
Um.

1015
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,920
...want to...

1016
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,340
Uh.

1017
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,580
Oh, Grandpa.

1018
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,100
I want you to drink some.

1019
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,880
You guys are fun.

1020
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,460
She was eager to prove herself, especially since some people around me were skeptical

1021
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,160
of her ability to work in a space suit in Level 4.

1022
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,220
Hey, look, guys.

1023
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,700
I'm with Pantyhose.

1024
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,400
He can't get much safer than that.

1025
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:11,740
I'm with Pantyhose.

1026
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1027
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1028
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1029
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1030
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1031
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1032
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1033
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,740


1034
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,900
Uh-huh.

1035
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,140
He quivers.

1036
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:13,500
Yeah.

1037
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,140
Yeah.

1038
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,000
Awesome.

1039
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:22,080
They put on white coats and surgical masks, and the two men walked down a large,

1040
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,060
cinder-block corridor, lined on both sides with steel doors leading into Monkey Room.

1041
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,900
Through windows and the doors, there could be hundreds of monkey eyes looking at them

1042
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,420
as they passed.

1043
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,820
So then I'd sit back up and ask for my $10 back.

1044
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,300
Oh!

1045
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,020
He got it, too.

1046
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,720
I'll get that back.

1047
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:41,720


1048
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:41,720


1049
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,280
So that's how we met, Susie.

1050
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah.

1051
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,420
And then we...

1052
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,420
Uh...

1053
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,480
Uh...

1054
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,460
I remember that.

1055
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,060
Me, too.

1056
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,900
That's nice.

1057
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,420
Mm-hmm.

1058
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,920
This was long before Anthrax, any of that.

1059
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:55,600
They were around.

1060
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,060
They were on.

1061
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,360
And, uh...

1062
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,700
Remember that time we partied with Anthrax?

1063
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,200
Yeah.

1064
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,380
We were cool.

1065
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,380
Oh, my God.

1066
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:11,700
It's so funny.

1067
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1068
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1069
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1070
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1071
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1072
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1073
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1074
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1075
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1076
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1077
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1078
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:11,700


1079
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:11,900
I'll show you the picture.

1080
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:11,900


1081
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:11,900


1082
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:11,900


1083
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:11,900


1084
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,400
Red light!

1085
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:12,800
Red light!

1086
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,460
At the Institute, there is a level four containment hospital called the Slammer, where a patient

1087
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,120
can be treated by doctors and nurses wearing spacesuits.

1088
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,680
If you are exposed to a hot agent and you go into the Slammer and fail to come out alive,

1089
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:32,260
then your body is taken to a nearby level four containment morgue known as the Submarine.

1090
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,260
What's up with that?

1091
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,140
Nothing you should mention.

1092
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:39,280
If enough cells are destroyed, the host dies.

1093
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,700
A virus does not want to kill.

1094
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:41,700


1095
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:41,700


1096
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:41,700


1097
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:41,700


1098
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:48,700
That is not in the best interest of the virus, because then the virus may also die, unless

1099
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,320
it can jump fast enough out of the dying host into a new host.

1100
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:05,620
They did not care to do research on Ebola, because they did not want Ebola to do research

1101
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,060
on them.

1102
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,560
No one else wanted to do it.

1103
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,740
Wanted to do what?

1104
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:10,880
Do it.

1105
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,580
Okay.

1106
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:11,680
I'm going to do it.

1107
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:11,680


1108
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:11,680


1109
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:11,680


1110
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:11,680


1111
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:11,680


1112
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,120
A new variant of Ebola.

1113
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,960
The

1114
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,720
P عن

1115
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
not

1116
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,180
di

1117
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:24,320
z

1118
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,700
the

1119
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:33,960
p

1120
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,680
up front, waiting for someone to come through the door.

1121
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,100
And I just scooped them up and put them in that big, decorative, you know,

1122
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,780
immovable trough thing that you guys have.

1123
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,040
That's wrong. In the ashtray, that's wrong.

1124
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,700
In the ashtray, a big ashtray that people had to empty.

1125
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,100
Well, it wasn't like I was the first.

1126
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,720
There was a big guy.

1127
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,160
Hey, it's just a throw up.

1128
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,640
The Level 4 airlock is a gray area,

1129
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,540
a place where two worlds meet,

1130
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,660
where the hot zone touches the normal world.

1131
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,160
A great deal of blood waited on the other side.

1132
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,520
She would be handling the blood, getting it all over herself.

1133
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,280
And the blood was saturated with Ebola virus.

1134
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,000
The blood was radiantly hot.

1135
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,560
Is it just me, or is it getting deadly right here?

1136
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,580
Yes, but the show is engorged with blood now.

1137
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,620
Okay.

1138
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,060
Good boy.

1139
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,820
She handed her a pack of deception tools,

1140
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,080
and they turned and faced the stainless steel door together.

1141
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,100
The door led into an airlock and Level 4.

1142
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,760
The door was plastered with a biohazard symbol and warning.

1143
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,960
You know, I still call that idiot, and I don't...

1144
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,420
Hey!

1145
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,140
Hey, where are you guys going?

1146
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,180
I thought you were going to go with me.

1147
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,540
I'm making my lunch.

1148
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:01,620
I'm making my lunch.

1149
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:01,620


1150
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,660
You lousy bastard!

1151
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,640
I know how high-tech nerds like you operate.

1152
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,300
I know you got a view scope around here.

1153
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,500
You enjoy your lunch after you see this.

1154
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,500
Don't!

1155
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,180
My God, there's been an exposure.

1156
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,400
I can't entertain myself, let alone this hospital.

1157
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,040
I wonder what this little pink button's for.

1158
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,320
Daddy!

1159
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,420
Abort firings! Abort firings!

1160
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,080
Interception will fragment bacilli-carrying missiles.

1161
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,760
Repeat, abort firings!

1162
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,940
To send it to Jesus, uh, here is the Pentagon.

1163
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,060
A warning, Judgement.

1164
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,420
Well, here it is.

1165
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,260
Here.

1166
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,800
Now.

1167
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,000
In the form of billions of microscopic bacilli.

1168
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,780
This is the end.

1169
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:06,200
20, 30, 40 percent among the 18 to 55 year old segments of their populations.

1170
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:06,660


1171
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,420
And yes, these numbers are accurate.

1172
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,800
Boo! No way!

1173
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,920
It is not difficult to imagine the substantial depopulation of large areas.

1174
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,660
Are you out of your mind? Come on!

1175
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,260
I wish it were possible to do everything at once.

1176
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,440
And you better believe it.

1177
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,500
Give it to me straight.

1178
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,760
And not hang around any longer.

1179
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,880
And not hurt anybody that doesn't believe it.

1180
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,760
I can take it.

1181
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,640
You get their plague.

1182
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,560
Oh, man.

1183
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,500
Some of you already have been bit by it.

1184
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,660
Oh, he bit me with my own teeth!

1185
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,340
Your risk of getting these diseases begins to decrease.

1186
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, I'm quitting for my health, too.

1187
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,520
Psychosomatic.

1188
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,960
Does that mean you're crazy?

1189
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,740
No, that means he was faking it.

1190
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,460
No, actually, it was a little of both.

1191
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,680
Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and on all the news,

1192
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,860
it's only natural that you think you have it.

1193
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,920
It was brought home to me how Americans are already answering that call.

1194
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:08,380
Hello?

1195
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,560
Oh, I'm nuts.

1196
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,860
When I spoke to a friend of mine who's the head of a postal union,

1197
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,700
shortly after we learned of the anthrax threat,

1198
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,720
I asked him how he was doing.

1199
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,600
Not well, he said.

1200
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,320
We've lost two workers in Somerset.

1201
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,660
He said, I went to New Jersey where they had some of the most dangerous diseases.

1202
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,500
They were the biggest problem.

1203
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,500
Because of anthrax, all the workers were working in a tent,

1204
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,380
exposed to the cold,

1205
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,100
hand-sorting the mail.

1206
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,500
He said, I thought I was going to get an earful.

1207
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,520
But when I asked for questions,

1208
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,680
a man stood up and said,

1209
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,860
I've been a postal worker for 30 years.

1210
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,320
We're here.

1211
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,120
We're here!

1212
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,120
The punishment was you and those like you brought upon us.

1213
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,700
You taught them how to make bombs.

1214
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,820
That's why you were looking for the wiring signatures on that blue bus.

1215
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,020
Now they're here,

1216
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,320
doing what you taught them how to do.

1217
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,780
There's no probe here.

1218
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:18,900
Find one.

1219
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:19,500
Yes, sir.

1220
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,760
This place is dirty, Doctor.

1221
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,320
Doctor, these animals are dirty.

1222
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,480
They stink.

1223
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,980
They carry communicable diseases.

1224
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,780
Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?

1225
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,660
You don't sound happy in your words.

1226
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,140
There's little more than a vet in this laboratory.

1227
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,160
Thanks, Dorothy.

1228
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,180
I'm just passing through.

1229
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,400
She unplugged her air hose and unlatched the steel door

1230
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,860
and entered an airlock.

1231
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,760
The airlock was made entirely of stainless steel,

1232
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,460
and it was lined with nozzles for spraying water and chemicals.

1233
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,800
This was the decon shower.

1234
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,300
The decon shower.

1235
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,160
A contamination shower.

1236
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,600
The door closed behind them,

1237
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,720
and they crossed over to the hot side.

1238
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,900
One side keeps the other side going.

1239
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,120
I hear about some monkeys.

1240
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,700
Hey, who is it?

1241
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:14,880
You gotta get right behind this alien, Bimbo, though.

1242
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,260
They unplugged their air hoses and proceeded down the hallway

1243
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,780
and entered the monkey room.

1244
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,200
The healthy monkeys went nuts.

1245
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,060
Humans and spaces make monkeys nervous.

1246
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,160
All the monkeys in those cages were infected with Ebola virus.

1247
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,760
Their immune system had failed or gone haywire.

1248
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,860
They sat almost motionless in their cages,

1249
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,080
watching the two officers with expressionless faces.

1250
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,940
They had been injected with the hottest type of Ebola known to the world.

1251
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,420
It was the myelitis strain of Ebola Zaini.

1252
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,960
I love Ebola Zaini.

1253
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,080
I love Ebola Zaini.

1254
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,120
I just can't be feeling for a little bit.

1255
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:04,140
Oh, you are sad and foamy.

1256
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,800
I don't want to cheer you in by a lot.

1257
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,100
Come on.

1258
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,360
Let's take a walk.

1259
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,020
Come on.

1260
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:11,620
Come on.

1261
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:18,040
Take from flies when you eat outside.

1262
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,140
Remember, flies carry dangerous germs on their feet.

1263
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,160
Get up already with the germ!

1264
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,900
I don't care!

1265
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,480
Find a sign.

1266
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,240
In the morning, the near traffic this morning is as bad as it gets.

1267
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:34,240
Due to a fire at the army testing lab, a bunch of escape-infected monkeys are roaming the expressway.

1268
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:40,340
Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows because those monkeys seem confused and cannibal.

1269
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,220
I'm ready to take you home and you can inverter me back here with the load of wood.

1270
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,580
We're in place.

1271
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,680
We're in place.

1272
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,220
The army is reporting the ape's position.

1273
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,200
General Sutton clearly favors a capture and not a kill.

1274
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:05,400
Units under Colonel Nevin have left their headquarters to block the male gorilla and divert him to where he can be apprehended.

1275
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,540
Oh no! My dad's gonna kill me!

1276
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,740
The virus absolutely nuked the monkeys. It was a complete slate wiper.

1277
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,920
Is there anything you can do, doctor?

1278
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,980
I mean, seeing how you've lost over 200 million patients.

1279
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,620
You seem like a nice lady.

1280
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,700
Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare back 30 years.

1281
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,320
We're only now finally caught up.

1282
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,200
Hey.

1283
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,320
You know, I'm starting to feel a lot better.

1284
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,680
Maybe there's something to this medical science racket.

1285
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,100
Sister, you're healed. You can get out of that bed.

1286
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,320
I don't know about that.

1287
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:03,340
Now he gets the house, there's a whole bunch of them in there going crazy.

1288
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,020
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1289
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,460
It's so bad, isn't it?

1290
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,800
Jesus, you should have been here quicker.

1291
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,360
If Jesus doesn't come quick enough, do you give up?

1292
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:17,660
Hmm?

1293
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,780
You've got Groningsen's disease. I can see ten clear symptoms on your flesh.

1294
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,400
You're gonna be dead in two weeks.

1295
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,540
And I became convinced I had the disease.

1296
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,960
The symptoms were so evident and said,

1297
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,960
Oh, what should I do?

1298
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:29,720
And then you said,

1299
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,060
Don't worry. This is a cure to Groningsen's disease.

1300
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,880
I sold my house to raise the money to get it to you.

1301
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,300
I've given it to you as a free gift.

1302
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,120
I'm not gonna despise your sacrifice.

1303
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,920
I'm gonna appreciate it.

1304
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,460
And I'm gonna appropriate it. Why?

1305
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,040
Because I've seen the disease.

1306
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,780
But I might appreciate the cure.

1307
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,920
And sadly, what's happened in the U.S. and the Western world has followed,

1308
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,060
is that we have preached the cure without first convincing the disease.

1309
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,980
My brethren, our task is nearly complete.

1310
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,340
He was the last of those who brought the punishment to us.

1311
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,240
We have cleansed and purged his world.

1312
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,300
I don't have it.

1313
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,840
How's what?

1314
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,120
It's plague. I'm immune.

1315
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,820
Everybody has it.

1316
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,440
Everybody but me.

1317
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah!

1318
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,060
Hey!

1319
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:15,780
Yeah!

1320
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,220
Yeah!

1321
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:16,580
Yeah!

1322
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,300
Ten days after he fell sick, the doctors noticed a change for the better.

1323
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,640
His fever subsided and his eyes cleared.

1324
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,740
His mind and personality came back.

1325
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,960
And he recovered slowly but completely.

1326
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,580
He was released from the hospital.

1327
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,080
And then, right after that, he died.

1328
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,060
And I kind of see there's something not quite right about that.

1329
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,820
He did it a little odd.

1330
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,080
Not the way he died.

1331
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,640
It's, uh, I kind of question it.

1332
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,740
There seems to be some, a lot of unanswered questions.

1333
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,260
Food for this blood went to laboratories around the world.

1334
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,300
Some of it ended up in glass bottles.

1335
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,100
Oh, no!

1336
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,900
And freezes owned by the government. Oh, no!

1337
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:47,900


1338
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,860
And freezes owned by the United States Army.

1339
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,920
Where it is kept immortal in a zoo of hot ages.

1340
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,500
Blech!

1341
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,460
Blech!

1342
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:56,700
Blech!

1343
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,080
It was a complete slate labor.

1344
00:58:59,460 --> 00:58:59,560
Shhh!

1345
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:00,220
Shhh!

1346
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,180
Ahaha!

1347
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,660
Well, after that, all I've got to say.

1348
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,880
You want to know what's going on?

1349
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,040
Subgenius.com

1350
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:10,740
Ahaha!

1351
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,860
If you want to get more information.

1352
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:13,800
Ahaha!

1353
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:14,620
Ah!

1354
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:19,820
Subgenius.com

1355
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:19,820


1356
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,240
Oh, Susie!

1357
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,100
Cover your mouth when you do that, would you?

1358
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:30,520
I'm staying here, um, March 16th of so-called 2020.

1359
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,360
Uh, I might as well tack some extra news and stuff on here.

1360
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,480
As you might have guessed, we here at Subgenius Foundation started hoarding early.

1361
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,520
So, we have lots of corn cobs and goosenecks and ammo.

1362
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,640
And I suppose...

1363
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:47,880
Subgenius.com

1364
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,780
Uh, we started that straw bale veggie garden just in time, too.

1365
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:01,120
Uh, until that starts growing, we have plenty of ingredients for goat and prickly pear cactus stew.

1366
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:05,480
And, uh, disinfectant wipes soup.

1367
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,060
I have a cough, but I think it's just cedar allergies from living in a forest.

1368
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,100
Not the Covfef-19 virus.

1369
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,880
Even here in the Texas boonies, the store shop...

1370
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,080
Our shelves are empty, so we've been buying lots of shelves.

1371
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:29,920
As Onan pointed out, in about three weeks, the cuisine will be whatever the neighbors without guns have.

1372
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,460
Anyway, we have some good news.

1373
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:37,820
The Subgenius documentary movie by Sandy Boone got a distributor, finally.

1374
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:47,360
And, they will, of course, be pushing it into your local art theater and universities and onto Netflix or Amazon Prime or something.

1375
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:47,860
And, they will, of course, be pushing it into your local art theater and universities and onto Netflix or Amazon Prime or something.

1376
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,120
As soon as possible.

1377
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,700
As soon as possible.

1378
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:59,860
But, the bad news is the DVDs that are owed to all the Kickstarter contributors, like me, can't be released until after those commercial showings happen.

1379
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:06,800
Uh, lest you Subgenius scallywags mass bootleg it to each other on account of it's so good.

1380
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:07,740
It really is.

1381
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,080
But, that probably won't happen for a few months.

1382
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,540
The bad news is, other bad news, our Cleveland house has been bought twice, almost.

1383
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:22,820
most, but fell through each time because the would-be buyer didn't actually have the money.

1384
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:28,540
So we're broker than ever, and yet at the same time I need to raise a thousand bucks as soon as I can

1385
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:36,360
to get a parole attorney for my little sister. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but it is now.

1386
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:43,980
So you know what to do at subgenius.com. Go there and look at the thousand years of subgenius

1387
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:50,980
artwork and writings for free. But at some point remember the lovely yellow donations button.

1388
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,840
And don't all your loved ones deserve to have subgenius membership packs before they all die

1389
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:05,440
so that they won't really die? Or about 10 of those nifty little metal Dobbs head pins? Or the

1390
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:12,020
Bob shirts? Or the coffee mugs and face masks and disinfectant packs with Dobbs heads on them?

1391
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:13,960
So,

1392
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:22,440
okay, slack, slack, I'll stop my begging and leave you with one last PSA that's sure to tickle

1393
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:28,920
your funny boner. I found this on something called Democratic Underground, but it's a government

1394
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:36,160
public service announcement about the Covtheft-19 ultra virus. I can't play this on broadcast radio

1395
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:43,260
stations, but then most of the ones we're on are college stations, and I think they all just shut

1396
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:43,640
down.

1397
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,140
Yesterday.

1398
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:51,460
Hello, I'm from the government with an urgent message about the coronavirus. We know many of

1399
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:56,900
you are confused. Some say it's no big deal. Italians are freaking out. The Chinese are

1400
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:03,200
hiding out. And Aussies seem to think the virus attacks your butthole. Medical experts have coined

1401
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:08,880
a scientific term to describe the situation we're now facing, a shit show. It's important to note

1402
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,100
that the shit show isn't caused by the virus itself, which we can manage.

1403
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:19,520
Rather, by dangerous levels of egregious dumb fuckery spreading about the virus. Through forensic

1404
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,200
analysis, experts have traced the path of the dumb fuckery back to this malignant shit funnel,

1405
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:29,460
who said he's not worried about corona since it's no worse than the flu. One of the symptoms of dumb

1406
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:34,640
fuckery includes not understanding simple math, leading many to laugh off this virus for only

1407
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:40,460
having a death rate of about 2%. Since experts say the US alone could have 96 million cases,

1408
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,080
2% of that comes to approximately...

1409
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:59,140
A lot of fucking dead people. Of course, the death rate is much higher among older people. This has been largely dismissed due to another symptom of dumb fuckery, not caring about the elderly, or as experts call it, being an asshole. If left unchecked, this shit show can drastically

1410
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:13,560
worsen the impact of coronavirus by overwhelming a country's healthcare services. For example, the US only has 1 million hospital beds. Oh, and face masks will probably run out too. So as doctors and nurses get infected, there could also be a shortage of

1411
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:43,440
them. When you combine all that with a government that has no regard for science, a vastly uninsured workforce without sick leave, and millions of guns, you get what experts call a munted shit show. To avoid a munted shit show in your country, experts are now advising governments worldwide to be the exact opposite of America. If you're not already infected by dumb fuckery, we ask you to spread this graph among your friends and family instead of bullshit memes. It shows how by flattening the contagion curve, we can slow down the spread of the virus.

1412
01:04:43,560 --> 01:05:13,380
So our hospitals and carers can cope. You can help flatten the curve by practicing hand hygiene, avoiding large gatherings, and phoning your doctor if you develop symptoms. Delaying the spread even by a month could prevent thousands of deaths, and not just corona deaths. It also means fewer deaths due to any emergencies requiring hospital care, which could mean you or your loved ones. And remember, if you do run out of toilet paper, Rupert Murdoch produces a wide range of bog roll replacements worldwide. This has been a message from your local government franchise.

1413
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,320
Goodbye.
