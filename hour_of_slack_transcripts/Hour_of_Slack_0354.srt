1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,060
In these ceremonies attended by many Lebanese Muslims, one of the Lebanese Muslim clerics

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:16,260
said the Iranian Muslim nation, with its reliance upon God and self-confidence, was capable

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,560
of cutting off the hands of the Na'ata and the Soviet Union from that country.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,840
The Lebanese Muslim revolutionaries this morning, by detonating a bomb in the Adelun area in

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,680
South Beirut while demolishing an automobile belonging to one of the Zionist elements,

6
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,420
killed one of the mercenaries of that regime and wounded another one.

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,500
You really hate the church, you're so genius.

8
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,040
I really hate the church.

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:29,820
I really hate the church.

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,080
I really hate the church.

11
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,660
It's time, America.

12
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,440
Oh, you magic twanger, froggy.

13
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:49,960
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

14
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,500
power of what?

15
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,860
Blast off.

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
I'll be on the ground in just 30 seconds with this week's exciting adventure.

17
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,900
So, stand by.

18
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,200
Stand by for...

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,540
Subgenius Radio Ministry.

20
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,240
Hour of Flash.

21
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,040
Okay, everybody go on party.

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,520
8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,780
It's been a while since we've been here, haven't we?

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,040
I meant to say, clear the launch pad, sorry.

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,080
No problem.

26
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,160
Bob is with us.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,960
Hope-a, Hope-a, Hope-a, Hope-a.

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,520
Bob is everywhere.

29
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,860
Hope-a, Hope-a.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,940
In touch with God, turn your radio on.

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Turn your radio on.

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,180
Oh, yes, turn your radio on.

33
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,740
And listen to the music.

34
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,340
The music is the end.

35
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,220
Turn your radio on.

36
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,920
It's sounding on its shrimp of the ship.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,720
turn your lights now low.

38
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,000
It's turned your lights And listen to the master's radio.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Now listen to the sun and the star in the tree.

40
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,080
It's what we want.

41
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,140
Put it down.

42
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:24,820
It's what we want.

43
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:24,860
Captain, when the sun comes down.

44
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Now, if there's a fire using the engine, the mic away from you.

45
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,580
concentrates the back of the car, but it's not going to separate you.

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,620
I would like to welcome and exploit the angelic host from Planet Earth.

47
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,600
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

48
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,960
You cannot afford to buy your way into his country club.

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,580
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,860
Freedom without structure is anarchy.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,980
Show without meanness.

52
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,400
Structure without freedom is fascism.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,260
Here comes Hal on the show.

54
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,760
And here comes Reverend Stein.

55
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,560
And we have the Inglis system is now turned off.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,720
All right, we're going to take a phone call.

57
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,080
This is the sentence of the new face.

58
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,640
You're on the air.

59
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,560
Father Gray?

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,640
Yes, my child.

61
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,440
I want to die.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,660
I want to kill myself.

63
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,480
The cause of debauchery.

64
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,480
The term of duty is a depravity.

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,040
You cannot kill yourself.

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
The wickedness.

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,460
He put his mouth around his gun.

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,760
Oh, swine of me.

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,100
Wanton sex and greed.

70
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,480
Sins of the ignorant man.

71
00:04:59,740 --> 00:04:59,840
He says.

72
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,900
You have paid you God for giving you.

73
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,980
You have paid me.

74
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,500
You have paid me.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,320
Oh, the unhealed ceremonies of the flesh.

76
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,320
And I'm with the next.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,440
Child of the devil, my child.

78
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,220
Too much depravity.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,640
And I heard Father know.

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,440
God forgive you, wretchedness.

81
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,900
And he saved me.

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,140
And I know now that I am wretched and I'm meek.

83
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,780
Thank you, Father.

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,720
You are the child of the devil.

85
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,560
You have no right to kill yourself.

86
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,500
Only God can kill you, you wretched heathen, little mongering slut-whore Jezebel.

87
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,420
Oh, my God.

88
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,520
Jesus, God.

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,140
You have a woman here that wants to kill herself.

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,720
And only God has the right to stamp out the life of human beings.

91
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,260
No man can kill another man, nor can he kill himself.

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,320
Only God has that privilege.

93
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,900
The Senate still stands.

94
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,180
Cast the unpopular servant into outer darkness.

95
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,960
Where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,800
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,980
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

98
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,100
Sir, no, no.

99
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,680
I don't want to go to hell.

100
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,560
No!

101
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,520
Too bad, kid.

102
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,980
That's what happens to those who don't have faith enough.

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,860
Bob, because you see, entities are situated at different density levels.

104
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,340
The density level reflects the generalized state of awareness of the listener,

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:50,160
of consciousness and the ability of that listener to manipulate space, time, matter, and energy,

106
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:57,200
which are all transformative elements of the one universal subgenius intelligence

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,420
of the universe.

108
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,680
Intelligence.

109
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,740
Yaka-tees-mic.

110
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,420
Matrix.

111
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:07,700
Of which the entire universe, on all resonant levels and frequencies, is broadcast.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,700
Ah, yes, dear, dear friends.

113
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,160
Ah, and it's so good to be back on the air with this show.

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,960
This show that needs a lawyer.

115
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,760
Is there a lawyer in the house?

116
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,800
We have evildoers to seek out and sue.

117
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,760
We need a religion.

118
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,680
We need a religious lawyer in our church.

119
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,860
Ah, now, you know, I'm getting excited, dear friends.

120
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,840
I hope, uh, I hope there's time for you to hear this in time.

121
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:53,440
But I'm looking forward to the 1992 Intergalactic Subgenius Convention and Gut Blowout in Chicago

122
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,820
on Labor Day weekend, September 4th through 6th.

123
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,740
That's where it's gonna be.

124
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:09,240
It's gonna be at September 4th through 6th, uh, in Chicago, Illinois.

125
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,540
Ah, yes, and I'm gonna give you information to write to about that.

126
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,520
Of course, you can always write to the church here for free information.

127
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,460
Just throw in that self-addressed stamped envelope and write to us.

128
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,820
Or Bob at the hour of slack.

129
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,460
Post office box 140.

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,520
306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

131
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,800
But we'll be giving that number again.

132
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,620
Ah, yes, at the end of the broadcast.

133
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,420
And boy, I'm looking forward to that Chicago Subgenius Convention.

134
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,700
We haven't had a real convention in, why, nigh on to almost 10 years.

135
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:54,180
But, uh, this time the special guests will include such luminaries as, uh,

136
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,580
the Swinging Love Corpses.

137
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,940
Yes, the Swinging Love Corpses.

138
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,200
That.

139
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,900
That.

140
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


142
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


143
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


145
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


146
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:58,960


147
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,000
The Slave Band from St. Louis will be at the Subcon.

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,060
G. Gordon Gordon will be lecturing.

149
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,060
Myself, Reverend Ivan Stang, of course.

150
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,060
Sister Mary Squared, au contraire.

151
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,520
Coming all the way up from Cleveland to preach her pants off.

152
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,840
And Sister Velveteen Sly will be there to preach your pants off.

153
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,080
And the Devil, the Devil Biker Bunnies.

154
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
That's hard to say.

155
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,800
Devil.

156
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:28,960
Devil.

157
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
Biker Bunny Girls.

158
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,940
Uh, and Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs down on your knees, boy.

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,040
Uh, the Betty Page story will be presented with the, uh, Betty Page lookalikes.

160
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,620
And Robert Shea, author of Illuminatus, will be there.

161
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,940
But that's just the stuff you would recognize.

162
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,160
It's the stuff you wouldn't recognize that makes this church, ah, so wonderful.

163
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,760
And that reminds me of a wonderful story that my,

164
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:04,660
my good, good prayer partner, Palmer Vredes of the Lies Company,

165
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,280
uh, mentioned to me the other day.

166
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,480
A story about what had happened to the daughter of one of his friends.

167
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,400
Now, this daughter was helping to defend an abortion clinic in New York, uh, state

168
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,820
against Operation Rescue protesters.

169
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,420
And those maniacal, uh, uh, how shall I put this?

170
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:28,800
Politely.

171
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,740
Religious nuts.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,220
Uh, were doing their usual harassing and hideous, hateful bullying and screaming and throwing

173
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,900
their kids in front of cars and so forth.

174
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,040
But in New York state, it is legal, my friend, for women to go bare-chested in public.

175
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,800
Because men can.

176
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:54,500
And so some of the women defending this abortion clinic bared their breasts.

177
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,920
They took off their shirts and bras and...

178
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:09,280
My friends, hehehehe, uh, those Operation Rescue geeks covered their eyes and ran away.

179
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,320
Huh?

180
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,380
Yeah, the, they fled from the sight of that which to the rest of us is lovely and good.

181
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,760
The human body in all its glory.

182
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,620
They fled from the sight of, uh, women's breasts.

183
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,680
Now I ask you.

184
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,020
Uh, the devil is obviously.

185
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,020
In possession of, uh, one of those sides in the abortion battle.

186
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:38,020
Now which sounds to you, which one sounds most sick and depraved and perverted?

187
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:47,520
The topless gals or those who felt that to gaze upon human skin was the ultimate horror?

188
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,800
So, the moral of the story, I suppose, may be, as Palmer Vredes told me, is this.

189
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,580
That, uh, and you'll pardon me.

190
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,260
Uh.

191
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,880
The breast defense is a good offense.

192
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:13,760
Uh, yes, and, uh, before I go on with the tapes, I did want to pause and inform you of a publication that I have discovered a new use for.

193
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:24,220
You know, there's a lot of stuff on TV and, and you, you, you don't know how, sometimes whether one show might be good or bad.

194
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,380
But I've, we've started getting this journal of the...

195
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,300
The American Family Association.

196
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,820
At the subgenius post office box.

197
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,520
Uh, actually we've been getting it for many years.

198
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,620
It's edited by Dr. Donald Wildmon.

199
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,900
And, uh, if, if you've been reading your newspaper, you'll know that he's a fella who stirs up a lot of trouble.

200
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:58,400
For, uh, oh those who would promote, uh, pornographic, anti-Christian, pro-homosexual, uh, materialism.

201
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,400


202
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,400


203
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,400


204
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,400


205
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,860
Uh, material, such as Playboy.

206
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,400
Uh-huh.

207
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,240
But, um, and a lot of this magazine from the American Family Association.

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:15,460
It's what you might call the Citizens for Normalcy or the, uh, oops, oops, don't want to destroy my Planet of the Apes record back there.

209
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,680
Gotta have proper, uh, background music at all times.

210
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,020
Actually, I'm getting tired of this.

211
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,480
That, I'm gonna put on some kind of, uh, something more rantful here.

212
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,660
To explain to you that, um.

213
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,020
in the lovely journal of the American Family Association,

214
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,580
you can find out which TV shows are good.

215
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:45,520
For instance, it says here that Nabisco ridicules the Christian faith on the Carol Burnett show

216
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,660
because they had a skit about a fictitional hallelujah shopping network

217
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,960
hosted by the Sisters of Salvation, Lola and Rhonda,

218
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,740
who declared that the redemption of man can be achieved through shopping.

219
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,360
Silly TV comedy.

220
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:11,020
And the preacher women had to leave the stage in mid-broadcast in an attempt to escape the IRS.

221
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,100
Well, see, there's some ridiculing of the Christian faith you can watch.

222
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,480
And here, let's see.

223
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,940
Oh boy, ABC offers perverse sex, profanity and an anti-Christian thing.

224
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,460
The dialogue in ABC's Good and Evil show,

225
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,740
it's a good, good and evil,

226
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,240
used profanity about once a minute.

227
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:40,180
Add a liberal dose of perverse and vulgar jokes about bondage, cross-dressing, tampons, condoms,

228
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,040
and it's a typical episode.

229
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,820
In this one, the writers add an extra element.

230
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,660
A priest used profanity, laughed at adultery and made a mockery of the wedding ceremony.

231
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,940
And the advertisers who brought this profanity,

232
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,900
aversion to family time, included

233
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
BC Headache Powder.

234
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,880
That's before Christ, Headache Powder, friends.

235
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,860
You want to get rid of that headache before the time of Christ.

236
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,620
Not now, not five minutes ago, but before the time of Christ.

237
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,300
And Nital Sleep Aid tablets and Polydent Denture Cleaners.

238
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,580
They brought you that perverse sex and profanity,

239
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,760
which you can catch on television here.

240
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,060
It says ABC's Good and Evil.

241
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,520
Now, for pro-homosexual,

242
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,380
uh,

243
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,480
sermons,

244
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,060
you would want to watch,

245
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,400
um,

246
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:29,680
Coach.

247
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,260
That show Coach,

248
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,040
who discovers that one of his gridiron stars is homosexual.

249
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:36,680
Uh,

250
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,460
and he freaks out at first.

251
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,780
But Coach comes around,

252
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,580
follows Terry to a homosexual hangout,

253
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
discovers former team members there,

254
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,220
and decides that homosexuality is, after all,

255
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,900
normal.

256
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,260
Uh,

257
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,240
Coach's soul-searching occurs in a lengthy scene,

258
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,760
as,

259
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,760
all male couples slow dance in the background,

260
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,560
enjoy dinner at tables,

261
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,380
drinks at the bar,

262
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,440
et cetera.

263
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,320
His homophobia, quote,

264
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,260
cured, unquote.

265
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,560
Coach talks Terry into rejoining the team.

266
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,060
And, uh,

267
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,380
uh,

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,860
and another character babbling incoherently about a broken love affair remarks,

269
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,140
sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

270
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,560
Well, you can watch Catch the Pro-Homosexual Show Coach

271
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,940
on, uh,

272
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,360
ABC.

273
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,880
L.A. Law,

274
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,600
according to the Federation of Decency here,

275
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
has profanity,

276
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,560
illicit sex,

277
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,400
blasphemy.

278
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:33,900
Uh,

279
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,420
at one point,

280
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,660
in one plot,

281
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,180
David,

282
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,620
a convicted murderer,

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
enters the courtroom in chains.

284
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
Clearly deranged,

285
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,720
he sings,

286
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,280
what a friend we have in Jesus.

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,640
Uh,

288
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,960
he alternates various hymns,

289
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,300
saying,

290
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,840
I am the power and the glory.

291
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,820
I am Satan.

292
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
I serve,

293
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,540
the demons,

294
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,080
and the demons serve me.

295
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,680
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

296
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,060
It is implied that David liked to go to church.

297
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,980
And, uh,

298
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,600
and when those little, uh,

299
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,400
do you remember a house across the street from a church where the lambs lived?

300
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,680
The lambs were four-year-old and six-year-old sisters.

301
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,220
They were asleep in their bedroom when you strangled them with a wire.

302
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,120
Then you beat, raped, and killed their mother.

303
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,200
But they were lambs at the foot of God.

304
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,060
The demons told me to kill them.

305
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,580
I'll die for killing them.

306
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,620
An eye for an eye.

307
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,940
But before I die,

308
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,580
the demons will take me to heaven.

309
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,660
God, this,

310
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,200
so LA Law has characters that sound just like our favorite preacher's Church of the New Faith,

311
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,880
which are be coming up.

312
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,100
And, um,

313
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,300
ABC promotes MTV crudities.

314
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,660
Um,

315
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
Michael Jackson grabbing his crotch.

316
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,100
Madonna's blood.

317
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,560
Blasphemous songs.

318
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,480
Uh, bare-buttock dancers cavort across the screen with people caressing breasts and buttocks.

319
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,180
Madonna is in her glory in a sequence in which she spits, belches, and worse,

320
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,960
and makes thinly-veiled crude sex jokes.

321
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,580
In the same sequence, Madonna spews out the line,

322
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm your mother, brother, sister, lover, daughter, auntie, uncle, grandma, grandpa, little baby Jesus.

323
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,080
And, uh, many cologne companies supported this blasphemy, and MTV, and, uh,

324
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,860
MTV crudity on this, uh, MTV anniversary special on ABC.

325
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:38,540
So, see, friends, you can use this, uh, Legion of Decency American Journal of the, uh, American Family Association to,

326
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,520
and sort of in lieu of your TV guide, or TV God, as we call it over at my house.

327
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,780
And, uh, but, if you're gonna do that to friends, you sure better be hoping that them Baptists ain't right.

328
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,080
Because if they do that, you're gonna be a fucking loser.

329
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,860
If they are, it's gonna be the judgment for you and me both.

330
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,660
You, just for hearing this show, just for listening to it, just for, even if you, even if you believed in Jesus,

331
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,860
you Christians out there, I'm warning you, just for listening to this show,

332
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:17,460
uh, you can be damned to hell, forever and ever and ever.

333
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,660
For lo, the innocent too shall be fried.

334
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,880
Yeah!

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,680
Bob is with us.

336
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,360
A light blow or tap.

337
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,440
The ball of the pendulum.

338
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,000
A mode of ringing bells.

339
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,240
A bob of bells.

340
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,660
A woman's short haircut.

341
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,340
Uh, Bob, did you get your hair bobbed?

342
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,980
Bob is there.

343
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,220
A horse's docked tail.

344
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
A bobbed tail.

345
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,600
A float to show when a fish bites.

346
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,040
A bobber.

347
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,740
A leather tool used for polishing spoons.

348
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,360
A bob.

349
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,500
Bob is there.

350
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,440
The working beam of a steam engine.

351
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,760
The bob of an engine.

352
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

353
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,180
I can't hear you.

354
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,540
Oh, no.

355
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,300
Go pull some teeth out of an unconscious sternobomb, buddy.

356
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,620
That dry and direct doesn't make a difference.

357
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,320
But the fists of dark sterility.

358
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,540
We should cast off those slutty weasels that listen to this show

359
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,660
and learn how to offer yourself to the goodness or the frankness of the bestial trepidation that you fear.

360
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,140
As the spider sloughs off its exoskeleton.

361
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,960
It's a size of that thing.

362
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,780
Oh, a web of intrigue.

363
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,580
And the snake sheds its skin in order for growth to take place.

364
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,900
Yeah, but what I really wanted...

365
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,880
The shell casts off its unnecessary colors.

366
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,200
This is the universe dreaming itself.

367
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,060
On our radio beacon, adding signal to noise.

368
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,640
Filling in the blanks.

369
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,840
Painting in the numbered lines, numbered areas, connecting the dots, putting the pieces together.

370
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,800
And enjoying a large glistening serving of Dr. Lindo's...

371
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:21,960
Dr. Lindo's...

372
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:21,960


373
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:29,700
Sinfully delicious, crunched up rain chorus, frailing pecan, prune preserves, special reserve ice milk.

374
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,040
Yeah, um, yeah.

375
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,600
A suckling calf.

376
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,680
A calf.

377
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,100
A bob.

378
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,040
A type of Scottish dance.

379
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,740
A quick curtsy.

380
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,840
A bob.

381
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,800
A curtsy.

382
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,100
A bob.

383
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,640
Amen, Bob.

384
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,800
It's all...

385
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,560
Bobbery!

386
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,900
A noisy disturbance or a quarrel.

387
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,160
A bobbin!

388
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,220
A bobbin used in spinning, weaving, and sewing.

389
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,540
Bob is with us!

390
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,320
A bo-re-ma!

391
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,300
Bobbin!

392
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,600
But this is worst of all.

393
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,500
It makes me sleepy.

394
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,560
It's the giant sleep-inducing nine-pound tarantula.

395
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,860
It looked like it moved, but of course, it couldn't after so long.

396
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,140
Couldn't move.

397
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,260
Not while we're asleep.

398
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,580
Not at all.

399
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,160
The idea that that big hairy spider would move after we fall asleep is...

400
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,580
pure superstition.

401
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,560
It won't do anything.

402
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,040
Let's all lie down and just go see.

403
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,220
I'll lie down in this web-like hammock here and just...

404
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
you can sleep over on...

405
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,460
Oh, God!

406
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,400
Look out! Look out!

407
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,020
Yeah!

408
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,900
Ah!

409
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,860
Ew, it's crawling! It's alive!

410
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,240
It's big hairy legs!

411
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,720
Hello, you're on the air.

412
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,140
Ah!

413
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,360
Hey, it got the collar!

414
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:50,740
Look!

415
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,320
He's being swallowed up by its giant mandible, Edouard.

416
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,380
Yeah, these collars just can't take these giant arachnids that we often have trouble with at this time of day.

417
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,120
Boy, it's taking a long time for that collar to die.

418
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,160
Yeah, we'll just watch.

419
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,640
This is really fun for us.

420
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,860
I... I...

421
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:06,640
Whoa!

422
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,320
Whoa!

423
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,620
Ah!

424
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,480
Ah!

425
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,500
The acceleration!

426
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,840
Can't take it!

427
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,420
You'll have to cut up some flesh.

428
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,500
Shut up!

429
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,940
He's gonna die.

430
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,900
He's gonna die.

431
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,180
He's gonna die.

432
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,020
Who's the bomb?

433
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

434
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:30,720


435
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,940
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

436
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,420
Scream!

437
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,220
Hauling on over to San Francisco.

438
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,560
Capitalism is not democracy.

439
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,960
Convenience is not freedom.

440
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,640
Oh, hello.

441
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,820
OK, well we're going down to the floor right now, the convention.

442
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,980
You can see in the background something that is relaxing, yet.

443
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,100
It is relaxing here, in fact.

444
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:15,340
The edge of this is middle age male who wants a job.

445
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,780
Wants...

446
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,060
Wants...

447
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,620
And I enjoy working more if a woman, a naked woman is spanking me while I'm working.

448
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,140
Have you ever noticed how much more pleasurable it is to go down to McDonald's or Jack in the Box or wherever you work?

449
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,100
And, you know, it's no big deal.

450
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,280
You get your $4.25 an hour.

451
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,760
But to have a naked woman, especially one that doesn't speak English, beat the living crap out of you while you're working makes it a little more pleasurable.

452
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,680
Wouldn't you say, Doug?

453
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,120
Well, no, I guess.

454
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,100
Yes, for the Gabriel Family Institute.

455
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,620
Well, no, not for me, for the listeners.

456
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,800
Ladies and gentlemen, in just a few minutes, you're going to be ushered in to The Judgment,

457
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,520
a one-act play where men and women are brought before the judgment seat of Christ.

458
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,860
It's appointed under man.

459
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,520
And once to die, after death, the judgment.

460
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,160
Better pay attention, you subgeniuses.

461
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,840
Call the first defendant.

462
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,920
Joanne Copas to the bar.

463
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:00,820
Joanne Copas, born into the kingdom of God in the year of her Lord, 1971.

464
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,500
Having been convicted of her sins through the faithful preaching of the word.

465
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,460
Oh, yes, I have been saved.

466
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,040
Not by works, lest I should boast.

467
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,840
But only as I accept her judgment.

468
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,780
I have accepted your son, Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.

469
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,660
And allowed his blood to cleanse my sins away, I was saved.

470
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,100
Oh, yes, I have been saved.

471
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,460
And because you have been faithful in prayer, faithful in the reading of the word,

472
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,040
and because you have not forsaken the house of God,

473
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,760
you have overcome the tempter and gained the crown of eternal life.

474
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,340
For this I say, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

475
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,480
Enter thou into the joys of thy Lord.

476
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,840
Praise God, I made it, I finally made it.

477
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,440
Did you hear, I finally made it. Glory to God.

478
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,940
Oh, I thank you, Lord, for thy mercy.

479
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,040
I thank you, Lord, blessed be thy name.

480
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,440
Oh, I love you, Jesus. I thank you, Lord.

481
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,220
Hallelujah, glory to God. I made it, I made it. Hallelujah.

482
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,480
Praise God, thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.

483
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,540
The backslider will be there in that judgment.

484
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,540
Though Christianity for centuries has operated on the thought

485
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,760
that men could walk in and out with God,

486
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,600
that they could turn back to the world and back to their sins,

487
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,440
then come back to God without any loss,

488
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,680
has led many to speculate in the most frightening way.

489
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,020
But the Bible said, if the righteous man turned from his righteousness,

490
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,820
then all of his righteousness shall be forgotten.

491
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,080
Yes, sir, the backslider will be there in the judgment.

492
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,900
Call the next defendant.

493
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,360
Dana Dean to the bar.

494
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,980
Dana Dean, the record shows that in the year of your Lord, 1959,

495
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,160
you received the glorious experience of salvation.

496
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,080
Almighty God, King of kings and Lord of lords, indeed, it was a glorious experience.

497
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,900
The record goes on to reveal that for many years,

498
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,160
you were a faithful servant, performing your duties well.

499
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,340
Because of your faithfulness in witnessing,

500
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,640
many were brought into the glorious light of the gospel,

501
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,180
and many souls were added to the kingdom.

502
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,880
Because of your giving, my preachers were able to circle the globe

503
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,980
with the message of salvation.

504
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,100
Sir, I gave back only part of that which was given unto me.

505
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,600
Were the records to stop here, my son, it would indeed be a wonderful story.

506
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,780
But these faithful records are very careful to point out the darkest day in your life.

507
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,800
It is stated here that in the year of your Lord, 1973,

508
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:20,380
you turned your back upon your God and once more began to walk in your own way.

509
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,100
But, sir, I've come back. I've come back, sir.

510
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm closer now than I've ever been before. I've come back, sir.

511
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,060
My God, I've come back.

512
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,640
Yes, the record shows that in the fourth watch of your life,

513
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,660
you returned to the fold.

514
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,460
But what an awful price you must pay for your foolishness.

515
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Because you turned back, you have lost your reward.

516
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,020
You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to your credit.

517
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,880
It's unfair. It's so unfair.

518
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,320
I've worked so hard for the kingdom all these years.

519
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,740
It's unfair that I should lose all my credits now.

520
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,180
You knew all this before you backslid.

521
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
Show him his record.

522
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,400
January 3, 1973.

523
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,320
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,

524
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,080
and committeth iniquity,

525
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,480
and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth,

526
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,380
shall he live?

527
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,600
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned.

528
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,880
In his trespass that he hath trespassed,

529
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,020
and in his sin that he hath sinned,

530
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,500
in them shall he die.

531
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,940
This simply means that if you backslide

532
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,780
and turn away from God,

533
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,380
all the rewards that you've accumulated shall be lost.

534
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,480
I just don't understand how this could happen to me.

535
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,680
August 21, 1973.

536
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,960
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

537
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,000
Baby, don't bother me.

538
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,980
You know there's some on the day off.

539
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,320
I don't have to live in church to be saved.

540
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,620
Dana, if you aren't careful,

541
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,300
you're going to miss out with the Lord completely.

542
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,620
Come on, Kim.

543
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,920
My son, you heard the word.

544
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,660
You were warned.

545
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,860
Were you so foolish that you...

546
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,220
The glory and the splendor that could have been yours

547
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,180
throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity

548
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,640
is an awful price to pay.

549
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,420
Oh, my, what a fool.

550
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,960
Oh, my, what a fool.

551
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,040
Oh, to think that I could turn my back on God

552
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,280
and make it all my own.

553
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,080
My God, what a fool I've been.

554
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,920
How foolish can a person be?

555
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,540
Sir, I hope you haven't been the fool I've been.

556
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,080
My God, what a fool.

557
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,180
What a fool.

558
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,200
I like that feeling.

559
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:05,960
I like that feeling.

560
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:05,960


561
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:05,960


562
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:05,960


563
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,160
I like that feeling.

564
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,160
I like that feeling.

565
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,180
Bobby!

566
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,200
Bobby!

567
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,100
A policeman!

568
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,360
An English policeman is a Bobby!

569
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,380
Bob is with the Bobbies!

570
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:17,760
Bob!

571
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,260
Named after Sir Robert Peel.

572
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,700
Then there is the Bobby pin.

573
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,660
Yes, girls have Bobby pins.

574
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,440
Bobby pins in their hair.

575
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,680
Bobby pins everywhere.

576
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,940
And there are Bobby pins everywhere.

577
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,580
Bobby socks.

578
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,240
Yes.

579
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,760
Bobby's in socks.

580
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,280
Bobby socks.

581
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,840
All praise Bob, who is everywhere.

582
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,200
Yes, Bob.

583
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,920
Yes.

584
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,360
Yes, the Bobcats.

585
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,240
The links of America.

586
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,540
Something is happening here.

587
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,520
Apparently official.

588
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,640
That's bull.

589
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,860
And I'm tired of it.

590
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,060
I'm tired of it.

591
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,060


592
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,240
I'm tired of it.

593
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,460
I'm tired of it.

594
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:05,460


595
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,140
God bless the lovely Jack Garry

596
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,960
The next question most surely will be, what it means, right?

597
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,900
Does it have one?

598
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,640
it means nothing, it means everything.

599
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,780
It means whatever you want it to mean.

600
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,700
You know at the temple, they have a totally free society.

601
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:35,920
You know at the temple, they have a totally free society.

602
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:35,920


603
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,280
on all levels of artistic endeavor.

604
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,680
Particularly the two vital ones, art and music.

605
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,460
I see it, and I hear it.

606
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,080
I see it, and I hear it.

607
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,360
The history isn't made by conformists.

608
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,480
To make progress, you've got to break out of the mold.

609
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,900
You have to dare to experiment.

610
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,120
New ideas never go down easy.

611
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,580
Yeah, that's right.

612
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,120
Those new ideas never go down easy.

613
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,660
And, you know, the great thing is, dear friends,

614
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,660
we're getting all these calls.

615
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,520
Calls tonight, for some reason,

616
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,180
from folks who had never heard this show before

617
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:47,360
and possibly do not know that the Hour of Slack radio show

618
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,060
that you're listening to is a show produced

619
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,520
by the Church of the Subgenius.

620
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,820
Yes, it's a religious broadcast.

621
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:03,620
Preaching the word of not we, the hosts, nay, nay,

622
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,860
but of that man.

623
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,660
That saint of sales.

624
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,100
That living avatar of Slack.

625
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,700
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

626
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,000
The Slack master.

627
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,660
The living link between heaven and hell and earth.

628
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,840
The bridge that will take us to heaven.

629
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,280
We're talking about subgenius heaven,

630
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,640
not the one you may have been.

631
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
We're talking about the one you may have lied to about.

632
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,360
He will take us up, rupture us up,

633
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,600
on that mighty day, X Day, July 5th, 1998,

634
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,720
when the men from Planet X and the space goddesses

635
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,420
will lift us up into their escape vessels.

636
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,220
And on that day, my friend, on that day then,

637
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,900
you know, I hope you have found a way to do that.

638
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,960
And I hope you have figured out just what this Church

639
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,560
of the Subgenius radio show is all about.

640
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,580
And maybe this is a good time for me to give you

641
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,620
our post office box number again,

642
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,860
because you can get free information out of us.

643
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,700
Quite a bit of it.

644
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,800
Real easy.

645
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,700
All you got to do is send us a postcard

646
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,780
with your name and address.

647
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,040
Self-addressed stamped envelope to get you more.

648
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,720
And that address, dear friends, is, of course,

649
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,880
X Day.

650
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,540
Post office box.

651
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,960
1-4-0-3-0-6.

652
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,980
Dallas, Texas.

653
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,140
75214.

654
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,760
That's a magic address for some of us.

655
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,380
Post office box.

656
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,460
1-4-0-3-0-6.

657
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,760
Dallas, Texas.

658
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,760
75214.

659
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,240
And, you know,

660
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,100
there are those among the illuminated brethren

661
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,440
who have investigated this subject.

662
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,160
And all generally accept the historical existence

663
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,020
of the Dobbs and his personal founding of the Church,

664
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,560
but are still divided over the issue

665
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,480
of the origin of the Order.

666
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,500
A few, if any, seem willing to give the Dobbs

667
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,800
any credit for the basic tenets

668
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,220
of the Church.

669
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,220


670
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,220


671
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,220


672
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,220


673
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:42,840
One group, for example, speculates that the cult of Bob Dobbs originated in Atlantis,

674
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:50,760
arising out of an alchemical tradition that borrows from both the legend of Cheram Abiff

675
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,500
and the mysteries of the pre-Magean Persia.

676
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:05,200
The more these scholars investigate the matter, the older the Order of Subgenie Eon, the more

677
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,200


678
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,200


679
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,660
the Church's history of the Order of the

680
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:14,640
Yeti Anthropos becomes, until one day soon we shall discover that it existed before the

681
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,160
universe was created.

682
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:27,700
A second faction, led by Agronius Corlipa, maintains that the Church, and therefore the

683
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:35,000
Order, was founded by one Dr. Philo Drummond in the late twentieth century, and done so

684
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,140
in the same way that the specific Orders of the Dobbs.

685
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,180
Any attempts to relate this organization to other secret and mystic Orders are by their

686
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,260
very natures counterproductive.

687
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,420
That this organization is one with a most recent origin and rise to prominence in the

688
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,120
murky world of cults and splintered faith groups cannot be denied, despite what the

689
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,240
followers of Dobbs may tell you.

690
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:05,200
The fact is that J.R. Dobbs founded the Church and organized the hierarchical structure of

691
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,580
the Order of Subgenie Eon, and the financial programs in the early 1950s, at about the

692
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:16,180
same time another rogue subgenius, Elrond Hubbard, was putting together another such

693
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,300
organization but with a much more sinister goal.

694
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,300
America was looking for answers of some sort or another, preferably simple but profound

695
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:33,120
sounding ones, and the Church of the Subgenius was created to fill that gap.

696
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:40,600
The Dobbs had divined from his own personal encounters with the entity he referred to

697
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:48,060
as Yahweh Uno, that science did not remove the terror of the gods and acted accordingly.

698
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:54,960
His religion was one that could be pursued in one's spare time and at one's leisure.

699
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,120
There was no central dogma.

700
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,100
Members had to make up their own, and there were only a few simple rules to God's will.

701
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
The Church of the Subgenius was a religious organization that was a little bit more

702
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,100


703
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,980
Rather than repressing all forms of opposition to the consensus, like all Judeo-Christian

704
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:15,080
religions, the Church of the Subgenius encouraged aberrations of this sort.

705
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,680
Eternal salvation, or triple your money back, was an appealing and powerful come-on in those

706
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,320
troubled days, especially for those who wanted low-cost salvation and enlightenment on the

707
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,880
weekends.

708
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,880
The Church of the Subgenius, however, does not deny that the rituals and practices of

709
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,540
the Subgenius share many traits with other mystic orders that are indeed much older.

710
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:51,220
And in his all-encompassing work about the Church and the beliefs and practices of the

711
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,840
order, the anablepsis Geoffrey Higgins writes, quote,

712
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,020
The followers of Dobbs are quite ignorant of their origin.

713
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:10,340
But, by tradition, suppose themselves to be the spiritual heirs of the Yeti, Egyptians,

714
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:19,320
Chaldeans, Atlantides, Magi, and the Gymnosophists, the latter being the name given by Alexander

715
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,860
to the holy men of India who sat naked by the riverside and meditated unceasingly while

716
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,140
ingesting quantities of herbal extracts.

717
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,000
While there are arguments on both sides, there is a clear argument that the Church of the

718
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,100
Subgenius is not the only one who has been a part of the Church of the Yeti.

719
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:39,680
The general consensus among these factions is that a great deal of the attributed word

720
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,180
of Bob Dobbs and most accounts of the life of Dobbs are, for the most part, merely allegory

721
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,540
and should not be considered literally, quote, unquote, as they say here.

722
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,680
This does not mean that they are not teachings to live by or lack veracity.

723
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,200
It just means that the Dobbs may or may not have actually said or done certain things

724
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,980
credited to him when the flurry of various official biographies of the Church of the

725
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,880
Subgenius appeared shortly after he was reportedly struck down by an assassin's bullet on the

726
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,500
stage of a, quote, well-known San Francisco theater, unquote.

727
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:18,400
Indeed, the quantum universe demands this sort of reality, with the participation of

728
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,460
the observer a major factor in the interpretation of epiphenomena.

729
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,880
As to whether the Dobbs really died on that stage or whether, like the death of President

730
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,960
Kennedy, this was merely another orchestrated act of deception and confusion by the Church

731
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,360
of the Subgenius.

732
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:32,360


733
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,720
We shall never know.

734
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,380
History, after all, is no more than a tissue of lies and half-truths that historians generally

735
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:49,980
agree upon, and nobody seems to agree on this particular ripple in the local space-time

736
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,000
grid.

737
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:59,300
Well, that, uh, a little reading there actually is from, uh, the introduction to the book

738
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,220
Subgenius Myth by G. Gordon.

739
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,820
Gordon, and frankly, this trash, what is this, this bit of business here about the life of

740
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,860
Dobbs, for the most part, uh, uh, being merely allegory and should not be considered literally?

741
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:24,000
Look, I, my friends, it's in times like this that I, I feel, I feel sorry for America,

742
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,280
what America's come to when you can't, you know, when, when you can't, you know, when,

743
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,660
when you're, you're in the middle of preaching the word of Bob and suddenly you realize what

744
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,200
you're reading to the people is, is not orthodox.

745
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,360
It's modernistic.

746
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,320
It's fun, it's, it's non-fundamentalist, non-orthodox.

747
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,120
It's new experimental type Church of the Subgenius.

748
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,260
I don't want to have any part of it.

749
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,740
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

750
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:53,580
I'm an orthodox, Stangian orthodox, Mega Fist Temple Lodge co-founder under Dobbs of

751
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:57,240
the Mega Fist Temple Lodge, the original one in Dallas, where it all came from.

752
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,260
And I just, uh, the word of Dobbs is, uh, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm

753
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,360
a, job friends is to be taken literally.

754
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,800
Uh, literally.

755
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:12,840
And so, uh, I hope you take, because you can play, play around with your, you can go

756
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,200
out to any bookstore, pick up a book of the subgenius.

757
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,340
Any fool can read his own interpretation into it.

758
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,860
You can go down to any old Sam Warehouse, pick up a damn, uh, a Ryse videotape and then

759
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,280
read your own interpretation into it and you can still go to hell.

760
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,460
And the judgment, in the judgment.

761
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:39,920
Bob Dobbs is not going to look at whether you tried to be original with his revealed word, doctrine.

762
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,940
He's going to be looking to see whether you followed his advice,

763
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:52,320
whether you did what Bob said and disobeyed him in everything he told you to do.

764
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,960
Praise Bob and let there be slack.

765
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,580
Oh, yeah.

766
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,280
I see it and I hear it.

767
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,620
I see it and I hear it.

768
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
I see it and I hear it.

769
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,420
I see it and I hear it.

770
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,100
This is an electronic musical instrument called a synthesizer.

771
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,360
Get up!

772
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,760
There are different levers here.

773
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,680
If you feel well with your ears, then close your eyes.

774
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,000
Get up!

775
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,480
Listen to this.

776
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,520
One thing that you can do in this really.

777
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,160
Get up!

778
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:54,760
You can get up.

779
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:54,760


780
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,640
The next question most assuredly will be what is its meaning, right?

781
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,480
Educated version?

782
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,200
It means nothing.

783
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:05,880
It means everything.

784
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,820
Education andั

785
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,900
Education is what goes on

786
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:13,900


787
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,760
you start beingさい

788
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,760
ò

789
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,280
on all levels of artistic endeavors.

790
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,320
Particularly the two vital ones, art and music.

791
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,640
Yeah, that's right.

792
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
That's all this is.

793
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,540
It's just an art show.

794
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,640
It's just art.

795
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,100
It's satire.

796
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,480
That's what it is.

797
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,400
It's just a bunch of satire.

798
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,260
But I should actually give some credits

799
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,040
for the piece of music you just heard

800
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,040
was by Reverend Ray Samartano

801
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,440
from his new cassette,

802
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,040
Peeling the Big Blue Banana.

803
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,980
We've also been hearing quite a bit of KPFA,

804
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,220
subgenius show clips

805
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,060
with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence

806
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,420
and all their many sound effects

807
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,660
bubbling away in the background.

808
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,100
Some preaching from Church of the New Faith

809
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,360
and the Bob Summoning Ritual,

810
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,320
which you heard the priest doing

811
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,020
with the one of the two.

812
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,300
And the woman screaming in the background,

813
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,680
well, that was Reverend Sly

814
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,960
and Dangerous Odds on WORT

815
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,700
up there in Madison.

816
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,000
Summoning Bob.

817
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,320
Bits of music by Svara Christensen also.

818
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,000
And the Judgment.

819
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,100
But you see the church in these latter days

820
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,780
is attempting to communicate

821
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,140
with all of those tender and twisted souls out there.

822
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,640
As well as those who are fired

823
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,580
with that burning inner hatred for the normals.

824
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,260
Some people cannot hate.

825
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,060
They can only join with others

826
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,040
who do their hating for them.

827
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,440
And they will pay for that privilege

828
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,760
of practicing their religion.

829
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,880
This church gives them both the guidance

830
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,500
and the freedom to work up a good steam of hate

831
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,080
and to use it without feeling guilt or remorse.

832
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,460
Hate.

833
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,780
Is the liberating force.

834
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,460
And if you are not free to hate,

835
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,520
then you are a slave to the conspiracy of the normals.

836
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,480
Saint Gordon was said to hold within him,

837
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,500
deep within him,

838
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,280
the ennobling fury embodied in the hate of thousands.

839
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,620
And he was able to draw upon this awesome power at will

840
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,840
to overcome his enemies.

841
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,220
This force was so powerful,

842
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,500
it was by many accounts

843
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,940
the only weapon that he ever needed,

844
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,420
or used.

845
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,300
There are accounts of G. Gordon Gordon's projected hate

846
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,760
triggering landmines

847
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,260
and blowing up munition dumps and police stations.

848
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,060
His hate alone.

849
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,600
Gordon was a man of extremely advanced abilities and powers

850
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,820
who needed no other protection

851
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,660
than his own inner powers.

852
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,980
And, dear friends,

853
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,600
I have a great deal of biographical information here

854
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,900
on G. Gordon Gordon,

855
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,480
the mysterious figure

856
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,780
and subgenius history.

857
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,240
And we are lucky to have tonight

858
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,380
a tape recording of G. Gordon Gordon himself

859
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,720
giving a deposition

860
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,940
regarding his moment of illumination

861
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,980
under J.R. Bob Dobbs.

862
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,520
We'll pick up his story

863
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,800
about shooting the giant Malaysian rats.

864
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,820
It's a little long.

865
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,580
We don't have enough time in this show

866
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,760
to play the rest of it,

867
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,320
the beginning of it.

868
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,080
But I think if we pick up here

869
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,360
and we'll put some appropriate

870
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,000
Malaysian music in the background,

871
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,180
G. Gordon Gordon discussing his days in Dobbstown, Malaysia

872
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,880
with his master, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

873
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,340
Now, although Bob and I had done this a number of times,

874
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,560
nothing he had ever said to me

875
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,960
had led me to believe the man was more than just barely adequate

876
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,680
in the intelligence department.

877
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,260
He seemed to thrive on telling long and meandering stories

878
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,660
about his early days as a salesman.

879
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,960
And once or twice,

880
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,440
after sipping and fropping a little too much,

881
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,720
he had talked to me about mind-numbing situations

882
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,740
involving himself and various alien entities

883
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,740
that he either communicated with

884
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,060
or watched on television or both.

885
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,200
He was never really clear on that point.

886
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,860
Mostly, though, he just told me dirty jokes,

887
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,280
and I must admit that man could tell a good one.

888
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,360
Well, now, one night I went down to the dump as usual,

889
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,720
but I was delayed unduly on my walk down the hillside,

890
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,440
by a group of unruly young guerrillas

891
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,460
who thought that they could make a politically correct statement

892
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,520
by eradicating yours truly.

893
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,700
It was a well-staged, if simplistic, ambush,

894
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,320
and I was forced to spend a good three hours killing my way out.

895
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,860
Consequently, when I arrived at our happy hunting grounds,

896
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,220
the high heep-hawk had already come,

897
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,220
bagged his limit, and left.

898
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,960
But I could tell he'd been there by his spore,

899
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,600
which was scattered around in large quantities.

900
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:23,500
I called in a security flitter and was lifted back to the city.

901
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,540
After cleaning up a bit, I decided to pop across the minefield

902
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,740
and visit Dobbs to see how he'd fared with his evening's hunt.

903
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,980
I shall never forget that evening when enlightenment came to me.

904
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,900
I sent my identity pulse into the master computer at the door,

905
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,280
and I heard Bob himself tell me to come in over the portal speaker.

906
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,180
Well, I decided to test the sincerity of the man's offer,

907
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,120
and so I stood a further ten minutes, and I was ready to go.

908
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,340
I waited for the door to open,

909
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,660
and I waited for the door to open for about ten minutes in the light tropical rain,

910
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,320
which had meanwhile started falling,

911
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,620
until Connie, his wife, came and answered the door.

912
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,100
The lovely woman gave me a fetching leer as she escorted me through the compound.

913
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,560
I passed through the security maze and entered the great salon in Dobbs' suite.

914
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,220
Well there sat my mentor,

915
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,900
casual and languid, dressed in a smoking jacket and soft gabardine slacks,

916
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:19,120
seated at a cutting table with a large basket of freshly fried

917
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,100
Malaysian rice.

918
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,100


919
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:33,300
He turned to the kitchen table to hard spins and 페 possono terle brat for概念

920
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,380
l Broadway.

921
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,600
All the simply uncivilized minds got off guard.

922
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:35,960
On the stage he punishes him,

923
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,760
and botches at arobate at a Uruguayan commander.

924
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,000
Hello?

925
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,820
My name is Riley Mone,

926
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:46,320
and I am a employeur on the Balcony.

927
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,080
I am the ref kneading machine,

928
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:57,620
crispy delicacies and the effulgent odor of wok fried rodent wafted to my nostrils most pleasingly.

929
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,520
Bob looked at the basket and then at me mischievous lights flickering in his vapid blue eyes.

930
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:10,040
No, he said very emphatically. Recognizing that he was attempting to teach me an important and

931
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:18,740
universal truth, I decided to take a different logical tap. Bob, I said a second time, do you then

932
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:26,560
perhaps have any freshly cooked and oh so crispy rats in that basket? No, my master said a second

933
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:33,240
time, beaming all the while like a radiant bodhisattva and sending up clouds of smoke that circled his

934
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:40,140
bland and chiseled brows like a soft and fluffy wreath. He had thus put me into a situation of being

935
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:47,960
in a logical cleft stick from which I had but one recourse if I wanted to break free. Bob, I said a

936
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,640
third time,

937
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:54,880
my mouth dry with anticipation and my hands greasy with the sweat that comes from the fear of failing

938
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:02,680
your illuminated master. Bob, do you then have rats in that basket? Yes, said Dobbs with a benign

939
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:08,880
gesture of arcane significance and from that day forth we became the greatest of friends.

940
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:17,520
I must confess that this was the only time I ever received such insight directly from the mouth of

941
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,580
the E-popped himself.

942
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:24,660
Although his deeds were forever a constant source of inspiration for me.

943
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:45,460
And would you attest this power to raise demons of Mesopotamian and Egyptian origins to the Church of the

944
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:45,740
Sechenius?

945
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,720
Yes, yes, I think you should flirt with the old man.

946
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:48,720


947
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:48,720


948
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:53,800
I think you should do everything you can. Dance on the edge of the abyss, by all means.

949
00:55:53,960 --> 00:56:01,580
Have you seen our new catalog item on how to do justice, how to raise minor deities, demons, gods, and goddesses?

950
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,320
We got a little hair-raising thing here while we're on the subject of genitals.

951
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:18,080
Sacrifice an animal and kill it! It won't cover my sins! Sacrifice a human in a fire like Abel! It won't cover all his sins! Sacrifice God's only begotten Son on the cross with nail and flu-rim! Let who will raise all the sins of everyone!

952
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:24,260
This is why we killed him! His death is not over! He rose from the dead! We will all rise from the dead!

953
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,900
But non-Christians will stay dead! Did he die again after rising from the dead?

954
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:36,580
No, he went away, but he will come again when all dead Christians hop out of their graves and kill Satan! Life's a life of the living dead!

955
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:42,780
Like zombies, we will kill Satan! Sleep is death! Crack zombies are already dead! Die! Kill!

956
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,900
There'll be young people at the judgment.

957
00:56:48,080 --> 00:57:04,900
Jesus said it'd be better for you to have a milestone about your neck and cast into the sea than to be the cause of one of these little ones to stumble, indicating that it's possible to cause a child to stumble and to miss the way.

958
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:16,620
If a man, woman, or young person does not know Jesus Christ and the forgiveness of sin, that person will face the wrath of God at the judgment.

959
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,060
The Bible says,

960
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:26,620
He that hath the Son hath life, but he that hath not the Son of God, the wrath of God abides on him.

961
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:34,780
The judgment will be no respect to thee. The old and the young will be there.

962
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:42,560
Call the next defendant, Betty Cunningham, to the bar.

963
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,400
The judgment will be no respect to thee. The old and the young will be there.

964
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,400


965
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,740
Young lady, because you have never accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior, you must go to hell.

966
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,780
Oh, please. I don't want to go to hell.

967
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,780
Why, I'm only 14 years old. I'm too young.

968
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,060
I never even had a chance to be a Christian.

969
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,260
But I'd like to be saved. Couldn't I become a Christian now?

970
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,500
No, child. It is too late.

971
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:32,880
But you wouldn't send a person to hell who never had a chance, would you?

972
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:37,380
But you had an opportunity when you were seven years old.

973
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,760
June 2, 1968.

974
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,780
Oh.

975
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,120
Betty, you're too young. Betty, you're older. You have plenty of time.

976
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:07,280
But you saw how my parents wouldn't let me go. It's their fault that I'm lost. It's their fault.

977
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,040
Why wouldn't you let me go?

978
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,080
There were other times that I have dealt with you, but you would have none of it.

979
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,440
When was it that you dealt with me?

980
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,420
December 18, 1974.

981
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:34,280
Betty, for as long as I've known Christ, I've tried to make him real to you.

982
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,880
When are you going to accept him and be saved?

983
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:43,640
I don't know, Cindy. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but religion just isn't my thing.

984
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,400
There's plenty of time.

985
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,160
I'm just not interested right now.

986
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:56,540
Betty, one of these days you're going to stand before God, and you'll wish a thousand times you'd taken the chance to accept him.

987
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,100
But it'll be too late.

988
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:07,920
No, child. You are lost and there is no place found for you except the lake of fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

989
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,880
Take her away.

990
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,900
No. No. No, I'm too young.

991
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,140
I don't want to go.

992
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:17,760
Mama!

993
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,560
Daddy!

994
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,780
Help me!

995
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,400
Yeah, your mommy and daddy are in there too. Everybody's in there.

996
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,660
Except for the 144 chosen.

997
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,060
We seem to have lost our signal from the stadium.

998
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:41,260
In the meantime, let's join the Real World Network and the Drew Mello Love Show in progress.

999
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,200
Hi, I'm Drew Mello, and this is the Love Show.

1000
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,140
I'm very deeply pleased that you could be with me tonight.

1001
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,320
I hope I can transmit a little happiness your way while you're tuned in.

1002
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,680
Gee, how about the weather? Isn't it something?

1003
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,600
I...

1004
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,340
Oh, well, I haven't seen much of it recently myself.

1005
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,900
Seems like the only time I'm outdoors is getting into and out of my car.

1006
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:13,980
Maybe I should do that more often.

1007
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,320
Oh, well.

1008
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,420
And we'll be right back with our first song after this.

1009
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,100
Bob is everywhere!

1010
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,600
And there is the Bobo Link!

1011
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:34,500
American migratory songbird in fields and meadows.

1012
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,120
The Bobo Link.

1013
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,320
Bob is the Link.

1014
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,720
Bob is the Link.

1015
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,540
Bob is everywhere.

1016
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,920
Bob is in your car.

1017
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,620
I got a real nice car.

1018
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,740
It's a bobsled.

1019
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
You see my new sled?

1020
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,960
There's the Bob White.

1021
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,320
There's the Bob Red.

1022
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,340
There's the Bob Black.

1023
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,300
There's the Bob Yellow.

1024
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,540
Bob White.

1025
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,460
White North American.

1026
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,460
Whale.

1027
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,400
Bob is everywhere.

1028
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,880
Bob is everywhere.

1029
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:24,020
Bob is spreading out from the church.

1030
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,560
The soft genius.

1031
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:27,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob!

1032
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,940
Bob is bobbing about.

1033
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,920
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob!

1034
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,060
Bob for apples.

1035
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,620
Bob for fruits.

1036
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,580
Bob for grapes.

1037
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:37,960
Bob for drinks.

1038
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,960
Bob for cow dung.

1039
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,160
Bob for 데� keto.

1040
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,160


1041
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,220
Bob for nuts.

1042
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220


1043
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220


1044
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220


1045
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220


1046
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220


1047
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220


1048
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:44,220
