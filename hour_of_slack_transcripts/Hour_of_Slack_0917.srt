1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
You may think your husband has never killed a man, but you're wrong.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,320
And before I take him in to face the charges, he'll try to kill me.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:39,200
I love you.

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,200
I love you.

5
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,840
I love you.

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,580
I love you.

7
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,460
I love you.

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,280
I love you.

9
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,320
But first, are you experienced?

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,780
Are you experienced?

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,020
I'm experienced.

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:33,220
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,280
And when she gets there, she knows if the stars are closed.

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,140
With a.

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,980
Word she can get what she came for.

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,540
Whoa, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,680
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure.

18
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,100
And you know sometimes words have two meanings.

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,280
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings.

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,520
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Tiny Tim with Brave Combo, friends.

23
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,820
And before that, some Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh and some Mr. Fernanda Nandae Lemur.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,240
And some ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.

25
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:35,960
More of all of that coming up, friends, as we OD on far out grooviness on the backside of reality.

26
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,140
Man.

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
I mean, dude.

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,800
I mean, you're not going to make it.

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:40,800


30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:40,800


31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:40,860
I'm just going to make it.

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:40,880
I'm just going to make it.

33
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:40,920
Baby.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,480
Finally, you're a baby.

35
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,580
Pulverized peanuts.

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,180
Rye your own fresh meat.

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,720
Forever.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,460
Free.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,440
Chopper.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,680
But then the stranger's path got darker and darker.

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,920
And the baby lost his way.

42
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,960
And the baby got old.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,880
And the baby got fat.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,900
And the baby didn't like himself too much anymore.

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,620
And he died.

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,300
He died.

47
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,680
Yeah, but we have to never forget

48
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,540
We have to never forget that he was a baby

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
And babies are good

50
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,100
And babies are strong

51
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,260
Maybe the best of everything

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,420
None of that Lunk from those Lunk heads

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,400
Oh, there's a bunch of those Lunk heads on my block that do they smoke that Lung junk?

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,460
Oh, yeah. Oh

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,200
There's one of those Lunk heads right now

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,880
Hey, man, where do you guys get that that Lung that Lunk? Well, it's just for oh, that's right

57
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,120
It's from the guys who've been smoking

58
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,180
Lunk their whole lives

59
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,640
Well, you could get it a Chinese doctor to from their lungs. That's where you get the Lung

60
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,920
Right, it's actual scrapings of their mustard flavored lungs. Is that how they do it? They scrape it? Yeah, they have to scrape it

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,520
But it has to be

62
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,680
Dislocated first. It's very dry

63
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,660
When is this guy gonna run out of semen someday? When is he gonna get around sperm or whatever it is? It's making him do that

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,440
That's actually

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,740
Something more dangerous to the human race

66
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,960
It's love man

67
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,140
He's feeling me low

68
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,440
Sister, don't you do what your baby sister done

69
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,500
Oh, yeah, baby

70
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,860
Oh, yeah

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,240
Oh, solid 100% Amar

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,980
Oh, yeah

73
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,260
Oh, yeah

74
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,140
That guy irritates my stumps down sometimes. I don't know why he should be irritated

75
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,020
Here comes the pain!

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,000
You've got to just do it yourself man. You become the oh yeah channel

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,560
Become flow group

78
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Become flow group

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,300
They're not even foot with it identify yourself as if like a neural circuit was bypassed here the whole cavity no like one with it one with it

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:14,260
Become an escape for a nation of ignored you many parents too busy to stop

81
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,220
Listen

82
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,160
And love

83
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,900
Now get a job

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,760
We're in with a little bit of space. Oh, yes, it's best to use this little mouth for him

85
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,040
Bob said I'm gonna give you drugs

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,780
Bob said I'm gonna give you pills

87
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,100
Bob said I'm gonna free him from the false flag of the conspiracy

88
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,020
He's a son of water

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,080
He's a god that set fire

90
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,760
He's a pyrocladulator

91
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,740
Three and three year olds can't breathe

92
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,220
Hi there, Mrs. Garibald

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:55,760
Okay

94
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,740
And so she had found the answer to his question

95
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,200
That's right

96
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,020
Tell him all about it

97
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,480
Okay

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
Bye

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,480
Here comes Mrs. Darvon again in her nice soft dress

100
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,460
Hi, Mr. Valium

101
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,660
Hi

102
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,380
Well, today we're going to make sure that everybody feels okay

103
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,700
That's a really long picnic they're having

104
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,440
Yes, they're eating Kool-Aid and pills

105
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,280
Oh, baby, Abelina

106
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,060
Yeah, well

107
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,020
Exy Owl

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,060
Miss Valium

109
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,240
How in the world are you?

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,120
Well, I'm sad today

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,360
Good

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,080
Take that

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:53,000
I want to do a warm up

114
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,780
There can be no such thing as a safe pleasure drug.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,680
Even if it had no harmful physical side effects,

116
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:18,620
it would still be overused by some people who cannot get pleasure in other ways.

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,420
That's what's so sad.

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,300
Oh, I know smoking cigarettes causes cancer, but I can't stop.

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,640
But if them same folks told you smoking cigarettes in your automobile would corrode your engine,

120
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,960
it would be no more smoking in the car.

121
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,640
Now that's kind of sad.

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,200
Because they've manipulated us to the extent that these educational institutions ain't nothing but tricks.

123
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,340
Why?

124
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,060
Well, I didn't tell you this before, but he's an egg salad addict.

125
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,200
You mean he's hooked on it?

126
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,320
He's hooked. He's got a chicken on his back.

127
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,960
Yeah, well, too bad for him.

128
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

129
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,840
As far back as educated men have recorded their history,

130
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,320
veils have been lowered to disclose a vast new reality,

131
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,320
rents in the fabric of man's awareness.

132
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,340
And somewhere in the endless search of the curious mind lies the next vision,

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,660
the next key to his infinite capacity.

134
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,340
How much did I learn over the years?

135
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,400
How's the start going?

136
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,120
A big piece of information,

137
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,480
That we don't actually know,

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,480


139
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,120
Thats, that, that was,

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,120


141
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,660
we, we want to know.

142
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,000
Then we want to know,

143
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,540
to experiment.

144
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:48,900
To experiment with the war in front of us.

145
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:48,900


146
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:53,880


147
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,280
ahhh...

148
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
on the chemical dumper.

149
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,980
You look puzzled, Peter.

150
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
Other than you're still plain Peter Wayne.

151
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,780
But don't worry.

152
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,500
It'll all be crystal clear

153
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,260
as soon as you cross over.

154
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,540
Consciousness expanding.

155
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,380
Properly induced

156
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,580
CE will give a subject full awareness

157
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,420
of capabilities never

158
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,280
known before.

159
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,240
The doses have been somewhat

160
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,020
shorter for me the last time or two.

161
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:30,940
Music

162
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:30,940


163
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,560
Music

164
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,640
Music

165
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,940
Music

166
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:34,940


167
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
This is haviflop.

168
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,900
You can smell it. It doesn't smell like marijuana

169
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,520
at all.

170
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,960
It's got a very

171
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,200
pungent odor.

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,940
I don't like this stuff.

173
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,800
It is free.

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,200
We have to smoke it.

175
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,820
It's one of the rules.

176
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,080
We're talking about a

barrel of have a from we're talking about void a limitless void of have a frog right we're talking

You know, just a little bit, just to see what it's like.

184
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:02,120
Maybe compare it to something like marijuana or tobacco or banana peels, you know, whatever.

185
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:12,720
But just take a little bit, not a whole lot or anything like that.

186
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,600
Just enough to give me a hit, not enough to fill up my lungs or anything.

187
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,800
You know, just for me, I can try it? Really?

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,140
Ha! Oh, wow, man, that's really generous of you, man.

189
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,420
I think I will, thank you.

190
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,060
Okay, all right, I'm going to do it now.

191
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,700
I'm going to do it.

192
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:42,700


193
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,340
I'm going to do it.

194
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,980
Oh, man, I'm just really nervous here, you know.

195
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,740
I've never tried FROP before, you know.

196
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,940
I don't know what it's going to do or anything, you know.

197
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,280
Okay, all right, I'm really going to try it now.

198
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,440
Um, it's not lit.

199
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,800
Oh, oh, it makes its own fumes.

200
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,780
Okay, all right.

201
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
You know, you don't have to light it for anything.

202
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
No, you just, you just suck on it.

203
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,920
All right, all right.

204
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,740
Okay, we'll give this one a try then.

205
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,000
All right.

206
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,320
Here goes nothing.

207
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,740
All right, I'm going to do it.

208
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,760
All right.

209
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,980
All right.

210
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:42,700


211
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,340
All right.

212
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,780
All right.

213
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,860
All right.

214
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,780
Yeah.

215
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:15,960
Yeah.

216
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,340
Ah.

217
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,800
Oh.

218
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,120
Man, that stuff got on top of me.

219
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah.

220
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,260
It got right on top of me, man.

221
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,820
Yeah.

222
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,600
Yeah.

223
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,920
Oh.

224
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,940
Uh, can I have some more?

225
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,540
You know, just a little bit, you know.

226
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,300
Not anything really major or anything.

227
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,900
Popes Lilith von Frau Mensch, believe it or not, doing frog.

228
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:12,160
Also heard much old, old subgenius media barrage material,

229
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,760
which included clips of Dick Gregory, Doctors for Bob, Old Outer Limits,

230
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,240
and of course, puzzling evidence.

231
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,180
And now more of that, plus the Firesign Theater

232
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,000
with some of the greatest dope humor of the 70s.

233
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,120
You know I've seen a lot of people walking around with tombstones

234
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,360
in their eyes.

235
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
But the push don't cut.

236
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Ah, if you live or if you die.

237
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,540
My boy, if it's drugs you want, the old doctor can help you out.

238
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,260
Right this way.

239
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,300
Hey, get your hands off me. I don't want to leave.

240
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,940
Then roll up your arm and bend over.

241
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,640
Do you want regular or premium?

242
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,060
Oh, this is ridiculous. You guys are nothing but a pack of cards.

243
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,820
Drink me.

244
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,200
It may choke me.

245
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,020
Must be some way out of this.

246
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,160
I'll change the air. That's what I'll do.

247
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,620
Let's see, what have I got left on the climate control?

248
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,880
Uh, dust storm?

249
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,480
No.

250
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,780
Tibetan wilderness?

251
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,680
Land of the pharaohs.

252
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,260
Land of the pharaohs. That sounds great.

253
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,460
Deliciousairl ihren

254
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,420
unsterben.

255
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,380
Mama.

256
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,060
Papa.

257
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,560
Stop!

258
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,100
Where are the helpers?

259
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I'm in my old dimension.

260
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,780
Over there

261
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,560
Where all the evil

262
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,720
wished

263
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,580
G business .

264
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,260
God damn

265
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,920
On the pusher

266
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,760
Oh darling

267
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,120
I remember when the least of your problems

268
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,840
Used to put you right to sleep

269
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
Oh not anymore Matt

270
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,460
Today's modern now a go-go woman

271
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,740
Just pops these simple little pills

272
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,660
Called Anger Dream

273
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,860
Swell demonstration eh Sarge

274
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,380
It's routine

275
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,640
Maybe but if the chief ever caught me taking these pills

276
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
He'd snap my head off

277
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,620
Here try one of mine

278
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,260
Oh yeah

279
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,640
Yeah the chief himself's been on these for a week

280
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,560
And he's a chump

281
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,080
Good open your mouth chef

282
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
No I don't like pills

283
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,620
It really does help take the trouble out of falling asleep

284
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Oh

285
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,720
Oh

286
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,420
Oh

287
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:03,820
Oh

288
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


289
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


290
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


291
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


292
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


293
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


294
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


295
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


296
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


297
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


298
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


299
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


300
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


301
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


302
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


303
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


304
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


305
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


306
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


307
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


308
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:03,820


309
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,360
Oh

310
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:04,520
Oh

311
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:04,520


312
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,640
The haunting reality is

313
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,160
That any one of these addicts

314
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,440
Prostitutes

315
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,200
Or runaways

316
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,940
Could be your child

317
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,920
There was me

318
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,040
That is Alex

319
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,820
And my three droogs

320
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,040
And their enemy

321
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,480
Is the God centered family

322
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,280
Today drugs and alcohol

323
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,660
Have replaced baseball and football

324
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,000
As the national pastimes

325
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,140
We are producing a country

326
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,640
Without a future

327
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,700
Any punk will tell you there is no future

328
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,100
They don't think about it

329
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,320
They uh

330
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
They wallow in just now operating

331
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,340
They only have the present

332
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,540
Oh my heart is pulsing too fast

333
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,760
I shouldn't have done that much

334
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,080
Oh man Chase you gotta stop stiffing that stuff

335
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,200
That's mostly for like gay guys

336
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,580
You know

337
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,240
He's a lunkhead man

338
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,760
He's been doing lunk all day

339
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,580
That's not lunk man

340
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:03,820
That's not lunk man

341
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,740
Lunk is the decision

342
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,400
K kid

343
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,340
When he dies his lunk will go to the next generation of lunkheads

344
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,980
It'll be passed on down as if

345
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,100
If it were a little suitcase

346
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,640
Or perhaps a pair of socks dad used to wear when he was angry

347
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,560
I did too much M

348
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:16,980
M

349
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,620
What's M?

350
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,220
Oh that's about four letters higher than K

351
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:20,840
Oh

352
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,540
God damn

353
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,200
He's on the M mountain

354
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,520
I'm on the

355
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,700
I'm on Z man

356
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,860
I'm on the last

357
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,840
I was hanging out with the N kids last weekend

358
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,800
But that was a little too long

359
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,520
Too much for me

360
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,720
I was hanging out with the

361
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,640
I wasn't ready to go that far

362
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:37,660
Alpha group

363
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,880
N is

364
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,360
We here at Alpha World don't like to hang with other letters

365
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,860
The betas are negative

366
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,120
It's like null and void there's nothing

367
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,620
It's like you just do the N and there's just nothing

368
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,140
You're not high you're not low

369
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,800
You're not in the middle

370
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,820
You're gone you're on N

371
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,940
Yeah you're gone you're on M

372
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,800
There's no N hole because there's just nothing

373
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,780
There's not even a hole

374
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,300
There's a series of vapid zits and barks and short little unky sounds

375
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,340
No don't even talk about the O room

376
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,920
That's the hole

377
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,720
Oh man

378
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,900
That's when you do an O you go in the hole on O

379
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,360
God you guys are about to make me need to go do some P

380
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,680
You're about to yeah you're about to scare the hell out of me with your

381
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,200
My nipples are already sagging down little kinky letters

382
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,240
Let's go do some P man

383
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,500
Do you really want to

384
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,000
Mommy where's daddy

385
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,600
He's been gone for so long

386
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,820
Come on

387
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,520
seen my lonely knife in my mouth

388
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,000
I see it everyday

389
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,400
seen my ol- ....

390
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,520
Eyes آаааааа

391
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,120
I've got a work

392
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,720
It's like a vortex funnel sucking me down to the bottom of the ocean.

393
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,760
I was getting sucked down.

394
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,540
And you know, as much as I hate to admit it, it felt pretty good.

395
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,340
It felt pretty good getting sucked down in that vortex wave all the way down to the bottom of the ocean.

396
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,360
But God, I hate to admit it.

397
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,540
But God, I hate to admit it.

398
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,340
It felt pretty good.

399
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,180
But I hate to admit it.

400
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,180
Moving on down on the backside of reality.

401
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,980
My bad words on the side.

402
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,720
Riding the wave and stoking on my fine day.

403
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,880
Moving on down to the backside of reality.

404
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,100
Riding on my fine, stoking on my fine day.

405
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,960
.

406
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,360
Mojo can really play the drums.

407
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,340
He was stuck down in this group thing.

408
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,700
He was laying down on the backside of reality on those tracks.

409
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,440
Now how about the song Backside of Reality?

410
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,440
Our audience here is very familiar with that song.

411
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,940
We play it every week.

412
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,100
It was back in our acid days.

413
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,360
Back when we used to consume a lot of LSD.

414
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,880
Yes, I know that about me.

415
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,900
The Swingin' Love Courses at one time was a hippie LSD band.

416
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
Yeah, we don't really like that.

417
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,160
We don't talk about it.

418
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,660
We don't really advocate it.

419
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,340
We did expand our consciousness.

420
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,520
But I thought that you condoned contracted consciousness.

421
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,220
We condone contracted consciousness.

422
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,340
Yeah.

423
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,980
Expanded consciousness.

424
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,100
LSD.

425
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,980
So some of your music actually has been LSD.

426
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,580
LSD influence.

427
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,880
Right.

428
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,920
And that is...

429
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,600
What is the similarity here?

430
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,260
I'm reminded of the 60's garage bands.

431
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,320
That's like LSD.

432
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,960
Lollipop sugar donuts.

433
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,560
LSD lollipop.

434
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,580
Mushroom mountains appearing from the sky.

435
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,400
We got high on high doses of sugar.

436
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,540
That's what it was.

437
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,320
White sugar.

438
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,300
And we called it LSD just to cut of a joke.

439
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,400
And you would have visions and get into the backside of reality.

440
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,000
But actually it wasn't real drugs.

441
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000


442
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,080
It was a pile of drugs.

443
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


444
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


445
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


446
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


447
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


448
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


449
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,080


450
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,920
You would actually drive the curl into the back into the vortex.

451
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,240
Right.

452
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,060
It's like the molecule.

453
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,220
Oh this is my favorite.

454
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,580
This is beautiful.

455
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,820
These vicious junkies and...

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,080
Now imagine a world where heroin...

457
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,780
was legal.

458
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,680
But possession of coffee was punishable by up to 50 years in jail.

459
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,820
In other words friends, think of a world where you could run down to the nearest convenience

460
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,240
store just about any time of day or night and purchase any amount of liquid heroin you

461
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,800
wanted.

462
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,820
A whole bottle of heroin would be about 3 bucks.

463
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:58,220
Or you could go down to a heroin den and sit and shoot up with all your shooting buddies

464
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,520
until about 2 am.

465
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,520
Then you'd get on the expressway and drive home.

466
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,920
Or if that matter folks, in the heroin world.

467
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:14,680
Where imagine that the authorities making heroin so much a part of their business world

468
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:21,180
that nobody closed a big business deal without having a few shots of smack with the client.

469
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,360
When there'd be billboards all over the roads for the coolest brands of heroin showing beautiful

470
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,020
models.

471
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,320
Skin popping.

472
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,600
A waterfall.

473
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,320
And on TV, well not only would there be all these ads showing your favorite sports heroes

474
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,620
shooting their favorite brand of heroin.

475
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,020
But in any party scene, any scene of any TV show where people were shown relaxing or having

476
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,480
a good time, well they're always taking a few little sniffs of smack.

477
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,920
Now the leaders of a world like that would have to be pretty insane, right?

478
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,080
I mean it'd be obvious.

479
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,160
It'd be obvious that the leaders themselves were not only heroin users but stood to gain

480
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,660
quite a bit from the whole population aside from a few anti-heroin fanatics leaning on

481
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,980
this substance to relax.

482
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,500
But let's take it a step further friends.

483
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,040
Imagine if these people made coffee illegal.

484
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,400
Cause they said it was addicting and it led to harder stuff like espresso.

485
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,560
But yet untold millions of people had been drinking coffee for thousands of years and

486
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,140
no one had ever OD'd.

487
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,340
You drink it and it sharpens you up a bit and then later you crash a bit.

488
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,340
But it was so illegal that the smugglers are getting fantastically rich having contraband

489
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,040
coffee beans flown up from South America.

490
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,800
And there'd be this whole subculture of bean heads.

491
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,620
People that were into coffee partly as a rebellion against the establishment.

492
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,040
And the whole reason that coffee led to harder stuff like espresso or NyQuil.

493
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,340
Or whatever.

494
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,140
Was because to buy coffee you had to go to a coffee dealer's house.

495
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,560
A pusher's house where you'd encounter people who were espresso users.

496
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,000
And on top of that a one ounce bag of coffee beans would cost like a hundred bucks just

497
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,120
for an ordinary Maxwell House grade.

498
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,260
And people would be arrested and spend their whole lives in jail.

499
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,960
Maybe even be executed for using coffee.

500
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Which is relatively harmless.

501
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,360
While this whole planet of junkies was going scot free.

502
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,540
And that's why I'm here.

503
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


504
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


505
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


506
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


507
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


508
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


509
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:28,540


510
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,440
And President Reagan would be up there.

511
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,400
You'd see him in the news at, you know, partying with world leaders.

512
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,240
All of them snorting a bit of smack and shooting up.

513
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,260
Imagine what a horrible topsy turvy world that would be, friends.

514
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:49,780
Where they made a powerful central nervous system depressant not only legal but glamorous.

515
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:58,260
While an organically grown harmless bean off of a bush could wreck your life only because

516
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,240
of the laws against it.

517
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:06,500
But, but, we're an enlightened people here.

518
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,540
So just forget that little allegory.

519
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,900
You know, let's not get depressing about it, friends.

520
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:22,780
Let's just lean back with a good stiff drink and forget it.

521
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,440
CISCANS THAT DO ASSAULT.

522
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,540
ALSO ATTACK.

523
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:28,540


524
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:28,540


525
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,140
It doesn't exist.

526
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,940
Also it doesn't exist.

527
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,520
And they are shooting each other because of a new prize.

528
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,240
Billions of dollars in American money.

529
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,160
The hard earned or hard stolen dollars of America's heroin addicts.

530
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,860
If you want any of this junk huh?

531
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,540
Go to it boys.

532
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,120
But this young girl, 14 years of age, in the 8th grade, recently took 50 pills to take

533
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,620
her life.

534
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,120
She has slit her wrist and she's been into heavy drugs.

535
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:58,540
She's done this.

536
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,780
I've got super dynamic overdrive.

537
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm operating in 10,000 revolutions.

538
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,980
My motor is being preserved because I'm operating in supernatural overdrive.

539
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,400
Are you certain you know what reality is?

540
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:20,620
No matter what I do to change it, normal I remain.

541
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,600
Normal can be just as bad as riding in a wheelchair.

542
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,880
Today, serious heresy is a deviant state of consciousness.

543
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:50,520
Not so much deviant opinions as having a kind of experience which is different from regular experience.

544
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,720
We are taught what experiences are permissible.

545
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,060
And therefore, if...

546
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,580
A person has so-called strange experiences and endeavors to communicate these experiences to other people,

547
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,340
he is looked at in a very odd way and asked,

548
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
Are you feeling all right?

549
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,920
Because people feel distinctly uncomfortable

550
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,520
when they realize that they're in the presence of someone who's experiencing the world in a rather different way from themselves.

551
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,600
They call in question as to whether this person is indeed human.

552
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:34,780
They look like a human being, but because the state of experience is so different, you wonder whether they really are.

553
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:44,020
And in rather the same way, in a very everyday kind of circumstance, when you're sitting in a bar drinking, and you find you have a drunk next to you.

554
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,760
And he turns to you and says, I say, uh...

555
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,640
And you sort of move your stool a little way away from this man.

556
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,160
Because he's become, in some way, what we mean by non-human.

557
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,320
We expect a high of about 65 degrees tomorrow, increasingly cloudy skies once again, with some rain in the forecast.

558
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,740
So I found this little dish, crawled in, and I must say I'm happy.

559
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,940
All right, boys.

560
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,400
Bob's got you hooked.

561
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,280
Bob's got a monkey on your back.

562
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,440
Hey, you know that...

563
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,940
Bob's doing something spooky again, ain't he?

564
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,360
That's what you're listening to, right?

565
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,660
Yeah.

566
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Yeah.

567
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:26,940


568
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,080
Yeah.

569
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,080


570
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,080


571
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,400
That's the kind of Bob that comes up out of the shadows.

572
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,820
It's the kind of Bob that follows you home, man.

573
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,320
It's the kind of Bob that calls you up in the middle of the night and hangs up and suites you.

574
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,620
Hey, Doug, let's kill Bob, you know what I mean?

575
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,800
Yeah, hell yeah.

576
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,980
Hell yeah.

577
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,960
Hell yeah.

578
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,080


579
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,900
I have an espresso machine in there.

580
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,480
Espresso.

581
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,440
Yeah, what would you do?

582
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,300
I feel the need to express myself into a cup.

583
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,360
And then pour it back into the spot in which I once stood.

584
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,260
Pour it into my shoe, and I will be reborn again.

585
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,920
A man of caffeine.

586
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,760
Y'all get your little whiskey, get your little snort, get your little reefer, get your little...

587
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,560
You serious?

588
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,560
The same people that's fixing to kill you puts the drugs out here for you.

589
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,240
How many of y'all know that?

590
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,780
Let me see your hands.

591
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,380
Some of y'all got your hand up, got a reefer in your pocket.

592
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,280
And we sat in the Corova Milk Bar trying to make up our razzle-dazzle what to do with these guys.

593
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,280


594
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,580
And we were drinking the evening.

595
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,440
The Corova Milk Bar sold Milk Plus.

596
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:35,300
Milk Plus, Vellicet, or Synthamesque, or Drencrum, which is what we were drinking.

597
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,240
This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

598
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,120
And they got your head so messed up, everybody got in their hide and don't like nobody else's.

599
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,540
Yeah, the whiskey drinkers have always looked down on the wine owners.

600
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,560
Reefer smokers now got an attitude about whiskey drinkers.

601
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,920
And all at once the cocaine snorters think they're more sophisticated than the reefer smokers.

602
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,480
And the coffee drinkers hate them all.

603
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,320
A lot of the evangelical leaders seem to have forgotten that.

604
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,760
Now we understand the drunk. We know what's the matter with him and it'll wear off.

605
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,240
But when quite unaccountably, a person gives a representation that he's...

606
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,600
suddenly got the feeling that he's living in backwards time.

607
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,560
Or that everybody seems to be separated from him by a huge sheet of glass.

608
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:48,980
Or that he's suddenly seeing everything in unbelievably vivid, detailed, moving colors.

609
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,200
You say, well that's not normal.

610
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,460
Therefore there must be something wrong with you.

611
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,280
We like you and should ignore you. But instead...

612
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,380
Makes... oh god it hurts, my headaches come back.

613
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,680
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

614
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,580
If these headaches keep up...

615
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,880
Fuck. I'll go down in the medicine fish hole.

616
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,580
I'll go in the medicine fish hole if I have to.

617
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,760
Oh, fuck.

618
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:26,760


619
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh.

620
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,260
Do you have any aspirin?

621
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,640
Jesus Christ, this thing hurts.

622
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,620
What are you guys frustrated about?

623
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,340
A festering? I'm not festering. It just smells a little bad.

624
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,440
He is festering.

625
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,320
Smells really bad.

626
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,260
It's like some pussy festering.

627
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,640
What a fessup, man.

628
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,300
There it is.

629
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,300
Hey, in France they pay extra for that.

630
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Stop fessing, bro, man. You got me wrong, man. Stop fessing, bro.

631
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,220
Come on, you ain't puttin' no wood in my...

632
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,240
When you peel open the...

633
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,840
You open one of Dave's seeming boils. Inside of it there's a little Liberace sitting at a piano with a candelabra.

634
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,140
With a beautiful, beautiful...

635
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,800
Little blue room.

636
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,160
I'd like to...

637
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,820
And he's got a little boil on him.

638
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,260
With a tiny little...

639
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,180
Dave at a radio station.

640
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,740
Right on my Dave-uck.

641
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,180
I'd like to sing this song for my brother George and my...

642
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,720
Ranting insane.

643
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,380
Brother Dave.

644
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,600
Into the darkness.

645
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:16,680
My new brother.

646
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,680
The boil on my ass I've added to my entrec...

647
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,360
Entrec... entrec... entrec... entrec...

648
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,480
To my repertoire.

649
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,360
There's a little... There's the little Liberace.

650
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,900
Careful not to move around too quickly while I...

651
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,620
Tiny Libo.

652
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,840
Tinkle the high notes.

653
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,180
Now we zoom in on the back of his neck on that boil.

654
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,080
On that left-hand man.

655
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,840
And deep inside that boil there we see...

656
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,700
A little radio station.

657
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,420
A little radio station with loads and loads of...

658
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:42,420


659
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,420
Another little tiny Dave inside.

660
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,240
And on the boil on that Dave's butt is a little tiny Liberace.

661
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,000
And it goes in a loop like that forever and ever.

662
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,040
Like... Oh, look in the audience's eyes.

663
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,640
The molecular...

664
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,620
Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs are watching Liberace.

665
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,080
Like super strings.

666
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,340
Exactly.

667
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,060
Stretching through a multitude of dimensions.

668
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,000
And the Johnny Rotten is in the...

669
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
All coexisting together.

670
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,840
The one thing they have in common.

671
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,920
The boils of music.

672
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,080
The boils of Dave.

673
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,720
Yes.

674
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,060
All the different octaves of spacers being...

675
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,640
And one day we may even, if our telescopes are powerful enough, see the remnants in the

676
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,280
scattering pattern of the galaxies through the universe.

677
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,060
Of the original big boil that exploded some 15 billion years ago.

678
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,660
And the original lonesome cowboy Dave's ass.

679
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,300
And as the boil expands...

680
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,460
It makes the sound of 15 octaves below B-flat.

681
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,640
It's your time here at Stinky World.

682
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,900
Your time again.

683
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,320
Was there a burst before the big boil?

684
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,080
Yeah.

685
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,140
It's always your time.

686
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,940
What came first?

687
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,920
In Stinky Town.

688
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,640
The boiler burst.

689
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,080
The boiler gave.

690
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,300
It expands as you expand.

691
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,600
It's as light as the hassock around your waist.

692
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,980
And as tiny as your little button.

693
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,840
You can fly now.

694
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,140
Kick up your flings and your damn baggage and fly.

695
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,060
Fly.

696
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,460
You know, Copernicus predicted this some hundreds of years ago.

697
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,060
But the Catholic Church tried to prove that...

698
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


699
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


700
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


701
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


702
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


703
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


704
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


705
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


706
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


707
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


708
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


709
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


710
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


711
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,060


712
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,520
The boil came first.

713
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,040
Well, they had the documents and they were in an Alexandria library.

714
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,400
And they had them locked up.

715
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,080
I guess they called him the mad monk.

716
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,140
He found the actual documents themselves and he was quickly burned by his own...

717
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,080
It's the background echo of the original exploding boil.

718
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,960
Background radiation echo.

719
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,980
MLKY expanded from that point.

720
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,960
Andromeda did so itself also.

721
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,020
Andromeda, the great swan.

722
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,020
Cossopia, the lady with all the hair.

723
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:04,880
And of course our favorite couple in the Tinky Tiny room, Ronald and McDonald.

724
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,100
Ronald Reagan and Nancy McDonald.

725
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,940
Well, I'd just like to say that every night when I see you, I know you're a great man.

726
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:19,940


727
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:19,940


728
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:19,940


729
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,080
And I close my eyes.

730
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,700
I think about you, America.

731
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,580
When I put on my Santa suit and Nancy and I...

732
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,420
It should be more like I think about nothing.

733
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,060
Because my brain is gone.

734
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm sorry.

735
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,840
I'm sorry.

736
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,600
I can't think anymore.

737
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,400
Because I'm a freaking idiot.

738
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,440
And I was an idiot back when I was a governor of California.

739
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,120
It's taken me 42 years to realize this.

740
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,440
Ketchup is a vegetable and so am I.

741
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,220
Well, I'm not sure that...

742
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,220
They should have aired that thing.

743
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,420
Alzheimer's is not like...

744
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,180
They aired it out good.

745
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,340
Look, it smells again.

746
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,080
Like hell.

747
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,180
Alzheimer's is not like being a mindless vegetable.

748
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,320
It's like being in a Burroughs cut-up of your thoughts.

749
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,140
Yes.

750
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,540
Where it's just random cuts from one thought to another.

751
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,020
And you're wearing it on your head, waiting for Burroughs to shoot the apple.

752
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,620
It's like some kind of a bad acid trip.

753
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,900
Kind of, yeah.

754
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,020
Jack Kerouac was a very handsome man when he came back from...

755
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,280
Or a really good one, depending.

756
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:48,420
I would say that some люди nicely were...

757
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:48,420


758
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:48,420


759
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:48,420


760
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:48,420


761
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:48,420


762
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,360
You ain't the granddaddy of all liars

763
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,320
You're the good-natured of nature

764
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,920
They don't know that they're ugly

765
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,760
That's very funny

766
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,760
Happy, happy, joy, joy

767
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,360
Happiness Park

768
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,320
Happy, happy joy, joy

769
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,220
Joy

770
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,680
Joy

771
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,880
Happy Joy

772
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,940
Happy Joy

773
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:41,940


774
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,240
Happy Joy

775
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,600
Happy Joy

776
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,500
Happy Joy

777
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
We waste a grand many of our lives

778
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,560
Like the little critters of nature

779
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,040
They don't know that they're ugly

780
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,080
That's very funny

781
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,840
Happy Joy

782
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,560
Happy Joy

783
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,040
Happy Joy

784
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,240
That was Jeff Free

785
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,560
That was Jeff Free

786
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,520
That was Jeff Free

787
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,940
I suspect

788
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,300
His sexy voice

789
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,580
Juan B. His middle name is Juan B. Will B.

790
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,420
Jeff will be free, someday

791
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,560
Or he will be tied down and beaten with truncheons and hog hammers

792
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,820
A hog hammer, boy it's been a long time since I had a sandwich like that

793
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,260
Oh no that sounds like pseudo-homo-sexuality

794
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,820
I was just think about pig sandwiches for some reason

795
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,660
I've been around them

796
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,680
You know, that would be a good name for a bar.

797
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,280
Or a band.

798
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,880
Castro Street.

799
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,540
Hog Hammer.

800
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,280
Hog Hammer.

801
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,740
Castro Street Bar.

802
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,280
Yes, indeed.

803
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,320
There's Cripple Creek, where everyone enjoys dressing up every day of the week.

804
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:19,760
Well, no.

805
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,060
Hog Hammer would be a real...

806
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,660
That's where the tough guys would hang out.

807
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,500
They'd wear a butcher's apron and a hat.

808
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,880
Yeah, the real tough guys.

809
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,280
And they'd do snacks around their necks.

810
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:27,720
Yep.

811
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,480
Hog...

812
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,160
Hog what?

813
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,860
Hog what?

814
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,860
Hog Hammer, baby.

815
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,720
Come on over.

816
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,960
It's hot and ready for you.

817
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,540
You know, Hog Hammer.

818
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,320
Yeah, fist to fist.

819
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,180
Hog Hammer, man.

820
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,780
I can understand what's going on there.

821
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,660
I don't think I'm riding down that trail.

822
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,860
Feast.

823
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,620
Feast.

824
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:41,940
Feist.

825
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,880
Which way is the...

826
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,460
Faust-y little nightclub.

827
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,140
The clarinet room?

828
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,240
Hershey Freeway?

829
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,360
The Hershey Freeway.

830
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,880
I thought you were asking for the clarinet room.

831
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,480
You get it over on the west side there.

832
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,340
You know, you hang a left.

833
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:54,880
Yeah.

834
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,240
What?

835
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,120
You hang a left at Lake Erie.

836
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:58,620
A lonely street.

837
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,160
It's on Cliff Pallet Boulevard.

838
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,720
I guess I don't know my way around here.

839
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,640
Catch that exit off a lonely street.

840
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,160
No, but if you catch...

841
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,080
You carry a truncheon around and a bag of snacks.

842
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,560
A heartbreak hotel.

843
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,240
And a thermos bottle for a long enough period of time, you will find...

844
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,200
Next to a heartburn convenience store.

845
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,060
Yeah, next to a heartburn convenience.

846
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,620
A heart attack hospital.

847
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,340
Now, that woman is wearing a pig nose on her and a pair of devil horns, or am I hallucinating that?

848
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,620
They always come to more shows like that.

849
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,000
What's the difference anymore in this world?

850
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,920
As Pope Meyer used to say, if you...

851
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,960
In the 2000s...

852
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,020
In the 2000s, if you flap your wings and you fly, you're on drugs.

853
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:44,160
And if you flap your wings and you don't fly, you're in the 2000s.

854
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,500
Or if you have a bottle of water and a glow stick, you're on drugs.

855
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:50,880
Yeah.

856
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,720
Well, you know...

857
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,420
Well, no, you're just supporting...

858
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,340
You're not necessarily on drugs.

859
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,120
Or thinking of it.

860
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,940
You're thinking of supporting terrorists.

861
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:01,580
And, you know, in this decade of Big Brother...

862
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:01,660
On drugs.

863
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Thought crime.

864
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,580
Yeah.

865
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:03,720
Yeah.

866
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,100
If you've thought about it, you're as guilty as if you don't.

867
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,380
Think about having a breast enlargement operation.

868
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,760
You're helping Al-Haqsa Brigade.

869
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,120
That's right.

870
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,640
Doper, man.

871
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:11,980
That's right.

872
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,960
And the Brigadiers.

873
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,660
Thinking of having maybe a...

874
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:14,720
Not just dopers.

875
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,180
Tip enlargers.

876
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,540
A bunch of dopers.

877
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,360
Tip shrinkers.

878
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,420
Any kind of sex changers.

879
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,380
Opium smokers.

880
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,180
A freeway loader.

881
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,080
A bunch of dopers.

882
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:23,460
Skaters.

883
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,580
Skateboarders.

884
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,580
Snowboarders.

885
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,260
Snowers.

886
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:26,680
Yeah.

887
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,600
Boarders.

888
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,280
Puffy and Hooters.

889
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:28,980
Straight edgers.

890
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,500
I really hate straight edgers.

891
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,000
Dopers.

892
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,300
Dopers.

893
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,420
Dopers.

894
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,700
Bachelorettes with cleft palates.

895
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:40,880
And if you're not just a pink square of the exact right quota.

896
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,240
Oh, exact right partition.

897
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:44,500
Ethnician.

898
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,380
Oh, they still have that.

899
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:46,720
Okay.

900
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,760
Well, it depends on where you are.

901
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,860
You have to buy that down at the...

902
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,920
Wherever you are, you're going to be the wrong color for the job.

903
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,820
You're at the wrong gate.

904
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,180
We're back to chromatic indigens again.

905
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,520
Right.

906
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,300
And next year.

907
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,420
And all the places where you can broil.

908
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,000
It's like...

909
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,440
It doesn't matter what color you are.

910
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,400
This is the race.

911
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:03,820
You're going to ramp up to the slave loges.

912
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,720
You're going to be the wrong color for that job at that time.

913
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,520
Slavery, man.

914
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,420
The slave loges.

915
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,860
Yeah, the slaves get the loges now, Dave.

916
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,120
Not the balconies anymore.

917
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,340
And not the sidecars.

918
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:14,760
Yeah.

919
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,020
Oh, boy.

920
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,060
It's just getting worse every day.

921
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,280
We complain, but we never do anything.

922
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,860
Like, what could we possibly do?

923
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,180
Could we go to the mirror?

924
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,000
Complain louder!

925
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,320
Complain louder!

926
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,400
bach sendiri

927
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:46,580
barc delle salle

928
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,420

I said I'll stop theriftsorry

932
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,600
the way you treat them when you...

933
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,820
Ehh... Ehh...

934
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,840
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

935
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,820
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

936
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,760
I said, stop up-up-upin' that dopey-dopey-moper-down mama.

937
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,740
Can't you see that you're givin' that poor boy trauma?

938
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,880
Because you kick him in the face, and then you punch him in the face,

939
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,300
and then you hit him in the knee and the hell off with what?

940
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,640
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

941
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,040
Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh!

942
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,600
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

943
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,600
I said, stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

944
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,400
I said, I stopped abusing that substance abuser now, baby.

945
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,440
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

946
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,160
Because you kick him in the face, it's such a damn disgrace

947
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,840
The way you treat him when you feed him and you fuck shit his face

948
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,280
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

949
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,120
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

950
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,040
Because you kick him in the face, it's such a damn disgrace

951
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,240
The way you treat him when you feed him

952
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,100
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

953
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,020
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

954
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:54,960
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

955
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,820
Stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby

956
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,940
Lonesome Cowboy Dave with Cinzia, Princess Wee, and Chaz, and Bob,

957
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,620
live at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland, November 15th.

958
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,340
Ah, yes.

959
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,000
Before that, lots of ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB.

960
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,520
Happy, happy, joy, joy by Wax, I think.

961
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:34,440
And we heard some Alan Watts and Doctors for Wotan from 1980,

962
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,420
mixed there with miscellaneous old stuff in the subgenius media barrage number eight.

963
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,220
This music in the background, by the way, was by Help-O-Pewy.

964
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,500
And incidentally, that Beachland revival, friends, we got some good recordings,

965
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:56,040
and there was no violence, despite Chaz's confident promises heard here on Speaker 9.

966
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,140
The human strange will be...

967
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,540
I'd like to ask one question, if I might.

968
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,660
Sucking the brains out.

969
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,120
Now that sounds like something I could use.

970
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,260
Imagine that.

971
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,200
Now, why...

972
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,200
You suck their wallet out, the human strange will suck their brains out.

973
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,720
Actually, it's...

974
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,460
Bob can have the soul left flapping around on the floor.

975
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,880
Yeah, the soul is really the most valuable thing in there.

976
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,500
That's the only thing that lasts forever.

977
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,020
Hot.

978
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,780
It runs out.

979
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,980
The brains go flat, but the soul is eternal.

980
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,480
They're effervescent, those cans.

981
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,900
Unless Bob huffs it, or sells it to the aliens to...

982
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,720
Remember, one huff off some of the good cans is enough to not only sky you,

983
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,180
but send you on a rocket to the tombs, backwards and forwards into time, space, continuously.

984
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,620
Oh, yeah.

985
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,360
Mortals can't do...

986
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,220
We can't do soul.

987
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,860
No, we can't do...

988
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,460
We can't huff up soul, because there'd be two...

989
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:52,580
Un-soul.

990
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,800
There'd be two packers in the same woodshed.

991
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,280
Oh, yeah.

992
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:55,460
Right.

993
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:55,900
Yeah.

994
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,400
There'd be two humbuckers in the same...

995
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:58,840
Oh, yeah.

996
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,100
...cabinet of Dr. Tackler.

997
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:00,380
Oh, yeah.

998
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh, yeah.

999
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:02,060
Oh, yeah.

1000
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,620
Oh, yeah.

1001
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,560
A man...

1002
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,800
A man who has masturbated furiously...

1003
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:11,860
...and without relent for the past 25 hours, he's about to break the gink, gink, gink, gink, gink...

1004
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,460
I don't know why you interpret the oh, yeah thing as masturbation.

1005
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,100
I think it's more like a mantra.

1006
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,060
It's like a...

1007
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:18,560
Yeah, he is...

1008
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,520
I can tell his neural circuits are frying.

1009
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,100
It's like saying...

1010
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,780
Oh, yeah.

1011
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:26,560
Oh, yeah.

1012
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:26,780


1013
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:26,960
Oh, yeah.

1014
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:26,960


1015
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,820
Oh, yeah.

1016
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:27,820


1017
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:27,820


1018
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:27,820


1019
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:27,900
Oh, yeah.

1020
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:27,920


1021
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,820
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,240
Oh, yeah.

1023
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:30,660


1024
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:31,880
Okay.

1025
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,500
Okay.

1026
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:32,980
Okay.

1027
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,400
Okay.

1028
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,740
Okay.

1029
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,000
Okay.

1030
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,840
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,900
Well, what kind of drugs do you think he takes?

1032
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,900
I notice he has like two little holes in the top of his cranium.

1033
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,560
Or, well, I don't notice, but I have seen him at a deviable and he has little holes there.

1034
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,240
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:48,320
Oh, yeah.

1036
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,140
Oh, yeah.

1037
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:50,500
Oh, yeah.

1038
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,200
Now, oh, yeah means listen in Espanol.

1039
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,080
If you could just get...

1040
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,440
Right.

1041
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:54,820
Exactly.

1042
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,620
Oh, we could say...

1043
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,300
Oh, yeah.

1044
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:56,780
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,660
That's why I don't think it's...

1046
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:57,900
Oh, yeah.

1047
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,120
Oye, I think it's oye.

1048
00:50:59,480 --> 00:50:59,920
Yeah.

1049
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,580
Oye.

1050
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,460
It's like, listen.

1051
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,400
You listen.

1052
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,860
But, you know, it's not oiga.

1053
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:04,980
Oye, listen.

1054
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,100
Oiga esto.

1055
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,020
Oye.

1056
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,160
There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend.

1057
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,540
Por la carajo, oiga esto.

1058
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,740
Those who say oye and those who say oh no.

1059
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,800
Those who give thanks and those who go,

1060
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,260
take it where it's needed.

1061
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,900
Yeah, it's like a ball of spittle that earns and yearns

1062
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,120
to come out of your apple seeds.

1063
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,420
That's where the lung comes from.

1064
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,740
It's like a wholly concerted effort of all the stars and planets

1065
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,400
trying to win you over.

1066
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,760
That's Bob's secret destiny for you.

1067
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,000
And good night.

1068
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,200
There's two kinds of people in this world, my friend.

1069
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,000
There's a lot more now, Chaz.

1070
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,700
Nope.

1071
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,400
You guys are going to stay in Chaz.

1072
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,080
Those with guns.

1073
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,780
There's two kinds of people anywhere.

1074
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,400
Those who dig.

1075
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,140
You dig.

1076
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,240
When you leave this room, the effect will continue.

1077
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,880
Inside of your own mind.

1078
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,840
Inside of your own skull.

1079
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,880
God, these normal souls are amazing.

1080
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,380
You can drink them.

1081
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,080
You can smoke them.

1082
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,080
You can eat them.

1083
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
I don't know.

1084
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,760
Who knows what you can do?

1085
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,940
You can even snort them.

1086
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,420
I'm rubbing one up under my gums.

1087
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,220
I'm going to try a line of this human soul here.

1088
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,100
Excuse me.

1089
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:22,460
I'll go.

1090
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,280
Now that's what I call soul.

1091
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,360
Let me try some of that.

1092
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,300
Jesus.

1093
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,060
That must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

1094
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,020
Oh, no.

1095
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,120
That wasn't a normal.

1096
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:42,820
That was some of what?

1097
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,380
God, I think I got some of his memories off of that.

1098
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:46,860
How?

1099
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,200
Yeah.

1100
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,280
It's like I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s.

1101
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,600
Just for a second.

1102
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,180
That's probably the guy's mom.

1103
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:57,120
Yeah.

1104
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,780
God, you can snort their souls.

1105
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,100
Yeah.

1106
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,880
And these little primal memories.

1107
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,040
You've just got to give them final unction and dry them out first.

1108
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,500
Okay.

1109
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,160
God, how long have you guys known about this?

1110
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,500
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

1111
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,040
Yeah, yeah.

1112
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,400
It's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times,

1113
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,320
so they just dry it and keep it with volcanic rock as an absorbent.

1114
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:23,760
Wow.

1115
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,260
Wow.

1116
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,320
Wow.

1117
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:24,580
Wow.

1118
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1119
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1120
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1121
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1122
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1123
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1124
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1125
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:24,580


1126
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:24,620
It's crazy.

1127
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,480
They just grind it up and snort it through huge, huge caves.

1128
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,040
They didn't have the technology to extract souls.

1129
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,920
I mean, how'd they get them under pressure?

1130
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,280
How'd they get them into the canisters?

1131
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,120
They don't do it that way.

1132
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,680
They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants,

1133
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,780
and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal.

1134
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:41,300
You're kidding.

1135
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:41,800
No.

1136
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,180
Why can't we do that?

1137
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,780
We can if we've got the right pills.

1138
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,340
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic.

1139
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,840
I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract.

1140
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,820
You can go high technology,

1141
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,480
or you can go with just,

1142
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,260
kerosene and a couple of guys with bare hands.

1143
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,880
Why did Bob set up these extraction machines?

1144
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,740
Well, all you've got to do is you dig a little pit.

1145
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,220
You dig a little pit in the ground, you line it with plastic, peg down with wood,

1146
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,180
and then you put the body in.

1147
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,240
A normal, right?

1148
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,580
Yeah.

1149
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,560
Any normal?

1150
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,080
Any normal.

1151
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,600
Any normal that isn't dead yet.

1152
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,960
The stole is still in him, right?

1153
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:15,360
Uh-huh.

1154
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,120
Okay, then you cover him with kerosene and acetone,

1155
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,200
and then you just jump up and down on him until it turns kind of green and thick.

1156
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,500
Then you remove him, strain the liquid, then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

1157
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,300
But then there's some kind of ritualistic, I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

1158
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:42,420
Well, there's a group of people around the pit adding a psychic element of the alchemy, you see.

1159
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,980
They concentrate.

1160
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,400
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the soul amplifier.

1161
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,840
Right, so it's done with psychic methods.

1162
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,020
It probably doesn't cost them, you know, it costs them.

1163
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,220
A couple of necklaces or, you know, a taper.

1164
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,680
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

1165
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,580
Their pet taper.

1166
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,740
The most expense they've got.

1167
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,440
And it costs us a hundred grand a year to keep these things pumping.

1168
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,960
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

1169
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,060
And not to mention the bodies and the souls and getting rid of them.

1170
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,400
See, the body dissolves.

1171
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,440
Storing them.

1172
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,880
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

1173
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,420
Well, do you do up the body, too?

1174
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,960
No, they just strain it out with a solid waste.

1175
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,720
What do they do with that?

1176
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,080
With that?

1177
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,540
They press it into little cakes and burn it.

1178
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,900
Like for fires and stuff like that.

1179
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,320
They usually give it back to the guy's family.

1180
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,980
How come this was...

1181
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:36,160
How come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

1182
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,700
Well, you see, it's because...

1183
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,720
How come they haven't been ripped off yet?

1184
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,840
How come we didn't rip them off?

1185
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,980
Well, because we can pay for soul and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up here.

1186
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,860
Because, you know, like down there, nobody complains if you go through four or five hundred bodies in one night.

1187
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,220
You know, you can sit around and smoke all the soul you want.

1188
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:03,240
I guess it would be kind of questionable to be digging pits in your backyard and throwing normal bodies in there.

1189
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,480
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

1190
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,940
Noisy, if nothing else.

1191
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,000
It's just little pressed cakes.

1192
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:09,900
Most people barbecue on them later, you know.

1193
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,880
You see?

1194
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:18,580
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away to wherever they're taken on Jupiter.

1195
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,940
Well, of course, the thing about...

1196
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,140
That weirds me out, man.

1197
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,080
A lot of things weird me out.

1198
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,320
The fact is that you can't get any good soul here in the States, dry or liquid.

1199
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,040
It's always been cut with something.

1200
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,180
And I like my soul unstepped on myself, you know.

1201
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,140
Oh, yeah.

1202
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,400
They'll use monkey souls, chimpanzee souls.

1203
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,240
Hell, they just take up crystallized...

1204
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,400
It's probably two-thirds...

1205
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,360
They just take crystallized emotions and mix them in, for God's sake.

1206
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:49,640
I mean, you get a bad blast of rage mixed in with your soul, and the next thing you know, man, you...

1207
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,140
That's probably what happened to me last week.

1208
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,480
I think it put a lot of anguish in it, too, you know.

1209
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,260
It just makes you depressed.

1210
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:06,300
Whereas pure soul is nothing more than a psychic and, you know, almanic amplifier.

1211
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,620
And, you know, if your soul's in good shape when you do pure soul, I mean, it's even better.

1212
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,360
But, you know, like, you put...

1213
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,680
Stuff that's been stepped on and mixed with monkey soul or alligator.

1214
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,540
Yeah, next thing you know, your soul is...

1215
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,640
It's tainted.

1216
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,700
Very tainted.

1217
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,080
Got holes eaten through it.

1218
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:23,320
You know?

1219
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:23,780
Uh-oh.

1220
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,640
Running up demagnetized soul, bad golfer souls.

1221
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,340
Yeah.

1222
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,440
Can you imagine?

1223
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,700
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1224
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,260
G. Gordon Gordon.

1225
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,820
Interviewed there around about 1985, maybe.

1226
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,360
And you can learn more.

1227
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,680
From www.subgenius.com.

1228
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,180
You can also get free information about the Church of the Subgenius.

1229
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,900
By writing the headquarters in Austin, Texas.

1230
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,640
That's Post Office Box 204-206 Austin, Texas 78720.

1231
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,480
For those of you with tape recorders.

1232
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:09,800
For those of you with tapes and CDs to send me, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1233
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:22,500
Send those to Stang, Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 4411.

1234

1235
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:32,920
And our announcer will tell you what else you can get from J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

1236
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:36,920
Calcium.

1237
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,680
Uh, calcium.

1238
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,220
That's right.

1239
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:38,820
Disease.

1240
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,440
Yes.

1241
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,060
Calcium.

1242
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:40,700
Cancer.

1243
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:41,320
Calcium.

1244
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:41,660
That's right.

1245
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,220
Heart disease.

1246
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:42,660
Cancer.

1247
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,220
Diabetes.

1248
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,000
Calcium.

1249
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:44,520
Yes.

1250
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:44,920
Calcium.

1251
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,080
Acid reflux.

1252
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,420
And?

1253
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,240
Calcium.

1254
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:48,820
Cancer.

1255
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:49,800
Calcium.

1256
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,600
Heart disease.

1257
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,000
Disease.

1258
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:51,700
Calcium.

1259
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,400
Aging.

1260
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:52,780
Yes.

1261
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:53,500
Calcium.

1262
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:54,020
Pain.

1263
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:55,100
Sleeping.

1264
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,100
High blood pressure.

1265
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,820
Carpal tunnel.

1266
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,640
And dizzy cells.

1267
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,520
Muscle spasms.

1268
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,120
Like a baby.

1269
00:58:59,300 --> 00:58:59,560
Pain.

1270
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,020
Calcium.

1271
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,420
Illness.

1272
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:00,980
