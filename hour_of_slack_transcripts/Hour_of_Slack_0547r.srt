1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,760
Stuck in a nowhere job?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,100
Tired of rhetoric about privacy rights,

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,120
illegal seizure,

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,600
or innocence until proven guilty?

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,100
Don't get PO'd. Join the P.L.E.A.S.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,840
Yes, the P.L.E.A.S.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,240
America's fastest growing organ of law enforcement.

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,660
In just one day, you'll become a highly trained urinalysis deputy,

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,200
empowered by law to make on-the-spot urine checks.

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,380
Watch the fun as you make them drop drawers and pee in a cup, anywhere.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,220
In crowded elevators, in church, or family barbecues.

12
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,680
If any testees have used illegal substances in the last six years, you'll know.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,940
And as a P.L.E.A.S. deputy, you'll have the power to impound,

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,040
imprison, confiscate everything they own, including illegal substances.

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,420
So the next time you hear them say civil rights,

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,760
don't get PO'd, join the P.L.E.A.S.

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,640
Just send $2, cash, check, money order, or credit card

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,140
to Urine Trouble, 1 Vicious Circle, Utter, Missouri, 1330.

19
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,400
Act now while law for laughs and get the amazing little stoolie fecal sampler.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,100
Don't get PO'd. Join the P.L.E.A.S.

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,660
You say the taxman just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,540
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off-ramp

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,300
after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,360
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of NyQuil during the Ren and Stimpy Festival

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,760
and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,080
The aliens removed your brain for their pathology studies and you don't even care?

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,880
Well, my friend, you're ready for a big healthy dose of the subgenius hour of slack.

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,480
No one knows how to put the m-huh back in Christmas like J.R. Bob Dobbs and his twisted henchman,

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
the Reverend Ivan Stang.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,460
Your good friends and prayer partners in your bid to secure your place in hell

31
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,980
and stop worrying about all this unapproachable crapola.

32
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,860
So, refuse to take your medication for a week and tie yourself to the kitchen chair

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,600
for the next neuron-popping episode of the subgenius hour of slack

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,340
on that bastion of bogus southern hospitality, K-N-O-N, 89.3 FM in almighty Dallas, Texas,

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,660
where the horses have silver wings, the whales all speak French, and the politicians are honest.

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,820
Yeah, right, and Ross Perot's gonna pay off my student loan, too.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,520
I mean, praise Bob!

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,100
Have the technology, have the tapes.

39
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,060
Bob told me to make this, not gonna resist.

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,880
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down,

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,600
open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,440
Don't ask questions.

43
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,060
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurian traces.

44
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,020
Scanning now.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,500
Only people here are people.

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,760
They're the advanced techno-droids.

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,600
Techno-droids can't hold up much of a conversation, though.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,060
Of the subgenius.

49
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,860
For amusement, they toss children into pits with hungry dogs.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
Are we not men?

51
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,740
We are the subgenius!

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:07,880
Ah!

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,100
In nomine patri et fili et spiritus sancti.

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,000
Amen.

55
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,200
None's absence of humor.

56
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,140
Continuing.

57
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,960
Take notes if need be.

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,740
Call for assistance.

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,040
Operators are standing by.

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,940
Forward when notified.

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,700
Void when prohibited.

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,500
Visitors only.

63
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,260
Ten-minute parking.

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,120
Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate except in the presence of Krishna, Muhammad, Buddha, Jehovah,

65
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,340
Vincent Price, or Bob.

66
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,420
There's the only one.

67
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,300
He is the strongest of all the immortals.

68
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,480
He is the perfect one.

69
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,880
We are incidentally guested this morning by a distinguished member of the clergy,

70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,180
the Right Reverend Archbishop.

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,120
I am happy to say that I have received a vision from J.R. Bob Dobbs

72
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,180
that you have been...

73
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,200
Great.

74
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,480
You have been promoted to Archbishop.

75
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:00,960
That is...

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,160
Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,200
That's news to me.

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,240
That's pretty exciting.

79
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,460
I was just a sacred scribe until half an hour ago.

80
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,620
Well, I guess being on this national broadcast has had a very good reaction.

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,620
We had a story yesterday that I'd like to get to the bottom of, frankly,

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,840
about cow mutilations.

83
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,980
Now, these cows were suffering from having their udders removed.

84
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,320
Their peni were sliced off, surgically, I might add.

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,200
With incredible...

86
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,340
With incredible surgical precision.

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Yes, it was.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,660
And the other thing that was read out was their rectum.

89
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,160
I have no idea why anyone...

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,140
And I quote from the Bible to give some testimony to the fact that this is going.

91
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,500
The fire of God is fallen from heaven,

92
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,120
that hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them.

93
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,040
Am I only the escaped one alone to tell thee of?

94
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,200
And, of course, is John...

95
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,400
Job, chapter 1, verse 16.

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,320
Job.

97
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,000
Nowadays, when you've got a stale economy, you call them Job.

98
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,560
Job.

99
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,400
Cattle mutilations is...

100
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,060
Can I give you some facts and see if you can verify these for me?

101
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,960
Oh, please do.

102
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:23,040
I am advised by a study done by my research director, Rob Robbie.

103
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,120
A tiny percentage are done by miscellaneous small cults like Satanists,

104
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,820
and the Davidians, bikers, etc.

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,080
About 10% are done by one major Odinist right-wing Christian cult,

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,160
composed mostly of Texas oil millionaires,

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,100
who are essentially seeking, I guess, a ritualistic way of curing their impotence.

108
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,300
Now you know what Ross Perot does in his spare time.

109
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,260
Cow mutilations.

110
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,980
Yeah, well, he's got the silent choppers and, you know, all the equipment.

111
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,120
Well, I guess you really need...

112
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,720
And the motivation.

113
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,200
I am advised, sir, and I am glad I have you face-to-face,

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,020
because I don't like to back down from these types of confrontations,

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,580
but I am advised that a great deal of subgeniuses, part of your church,

116
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,040
all right, fresh from Dobstown on their first initiation test,

117
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,080
are involved in these mutilations,

118
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,900
and that it's not done as a test of their mettle.

119
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,980
It's a scientific fact that the only proper way, well, to divine the future

120
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,820
is by reading fresh animal bowels.

121
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,240
Wow.

122
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, I'm sorry.

123
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,080
This is a serious matter.

124
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,640
Hey, it's right there in Book of the Subgenius.

125
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,400
It says so right there in Black and White.

126
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,480
It does say that, then.

127
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,620
Then you have admitted to that.

128
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,640
Well, sure.

129
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,260
I mean, you haven't lived until you've gone out on a nice little cattle mutilation initiation hunt.

130
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,940
Probably the largest and most ruthless gang of saboteurs in this country.

131
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,140
I know.

132
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,780
For six months, they thought I was one of them.

133
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,780
Distance for all the lawyers, doctors,

134
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,900
ex-wives, and all the other gold diggers out there.

135
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
What is it, man?

136
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,980
Oh, and let them die with dignity.

137
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,640
Why, you dirty...

138
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,320
But, boss, but, but, but, but...

139
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,860
Isn't it wonderful what you can do with some wire and a few electric bulbs?

140
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,880
A little child looks up at me, sometimes with their eyes open.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,860
You know, right about 500 grams is when their eyes begin to open.

142
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,240
A half-staff turns to me and says,

143
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,620
Dr. Foroth, what do we do?

144
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,000
I didn't come in here with three points and a poem today.

145
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,160
I could care less whether you think I can preach a lick or not.

146
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,980
You understand that?

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
All I care about is saying,

148
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,540
Thus saith the Spirit of God.

149
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,720
All I care about is getting in the mountain

150
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
and standing behind that desk

151
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,300
with lips anointed from coals off the fire,

152
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,300
ready to declare the word of the living God.

153
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,580
And I'm ready.

154
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,380
They were red as crimson.

155
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,000
Now they're white.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,200
They're white as snow.

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,200


158
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,440
They're white as wool.

159
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,240
You don't have to encourage somebody

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,640
that knew they were a dirty, rotten hunk of stink and sinful flesh.

161
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,880
And yet, no matter how you slice it up,

162
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,180
no matter how you dice it out,

163
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,440
it's still another existing,

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,540
if it feels good to do it,

165
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,520
anything goes,

166
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,220
drug-induced hallucinogenic experience.

167
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,600
Well, we're speaking now, of course, as you know,

168
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,420
with Father Joe Mama,

169
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,960
who is at the end of the Democratic Convention parties.

170
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,080
We're looking down on the floor.

171
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,040
You can see at the subgenius convention

172
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,600
just what happened.

173
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,460
We heard the news about Jesus and the handgun.

174
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,100
We'll be going to descriptions of that soon.

175
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,280
We just wondered what you saw from where you were.

176
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,980
Well, I felt that the proceedings were very interesting

177
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,280
from an academic standpoint, of course.

178
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,900
I can say that without any hesitation.

179
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,300
That is, without any hesitation.

180
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,600
That the chaos that ensued was typical of that,

181
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,980
involving any sort of political assassination.

182
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,540
I personally think Jesus is a patsy.

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,280
Yeah.

184
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,660
This magic bullet theory.

185
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,780
Yeah, me too.

186
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,620
The magic splinter theory also.

187
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,540
There are all these theories.

188
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,520
They're just theories.

189
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,280
Well, I mean, you know, they'd only try to only use

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,280


191
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,280


192
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,280


193
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,100
the magic that Jesus would be accused of being able to kill a man

194
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,480
with one bullet with three different entry rules.

195
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,000
I mean, you know, what do they think this guy is?

196
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Some sort of God?

197
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, let's get real.

198
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,940
I believe we got a whole lot of folks sitting in church

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,200
think they're saved that aren't.

200
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,980
That's the reason we got to hire 14 more preachers

201
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,300
to counsel them all day long.

202
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,980
Shout now!

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,080
Shout now!

204
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,940
Oh!

205
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,600
Brother Rod, don't put that condemnation on me.

206
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,040
Let's play God.

207
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,480
My dear young man, you know as well as I do

208
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,920
that God is dying all over the world.

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,140
Man invented him but doesn't need him anymore.

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,620
Man is God now.

211
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,260
As a matter of fact, he always was.

212
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,040
Overpopulation, pollution, famine, nuclear holocaust, war.

213
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,060
Decivilization.

214
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,640
The two things are the same.

215
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,640


216
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,640


217
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,640


218
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
And that is the reason why this whole situation is driving us

219
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,160
into the sea of extinction.

220
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,700
The keynote is control.

221
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,060
That's the province of politicians, not scientists.

222
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,960
Yes, but we're the only ones who are trying to combat the problem now.

223
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,200
In 20 years time, we will be in positions of power,

224
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,640
and then we'll be ready to act

225
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:06,020
Friends, we've been enjoying media barrages here on the Hour of Slack from many of our friends,

226
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,960
starting with the P. Lease by Brain Rot Theater,

227
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,140
Hell Pope Huey's new contributions and promos,

228
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,520
Reverend Joe Riley's evil bulldada barrage,

229
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,400
and the barrages of Dr. Legume and KHSU subgenius show,

230
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,420
and good Reverend Morton Downey,

231
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:42,840
and a wonderful collection of Reverend Parsley from our dear friend Reverend Uncle Jimmy,

232
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,320
as well as some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence and Papa Joe Mama,

233
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,500
and more.

234
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,920
More of these things coming up, friends.

235
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,240
Oh, by the way, as Vincent Price was just saying there,

236
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,860
we got an amazing document in the mail,

237
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,200
a copy of what supposedly is top secret material,

238
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,860
a document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars,

239
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,500
a blueprint for your eventual enslavement.

240
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,680
And I don't want to say who sent this to us.

241
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,960
Of course, this could, I suppose, possibly be a hoax.

242
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,700
Whoa.

243
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,800
I can't put, can't use that tape, friends, that tape deck.

244
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,220
I'm going to use this one up here.

245
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,980
Did you hear that?

246
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,840
That noise that came in?

247
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,320
There's no telling what they were trying to do to us there with that one.

248
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,840
But, you know, as the preface to this thing says here,

249
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,500
conspiracy theories are not...

250
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,240
Not new in history.

251
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,860
For example, plots to kill Caesar and overthrow Rome abounded.

252
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,600
But there are many who go out of their way to ridicule and silence

253
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,400
those who today speak of conspiracies.

254
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,240
Why do you think they don't want people to think about conspiracies?

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,380
Seldom does hard evidence emerge that by its very content

256
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,900
indicates it serves as a blueprint for a conspiracy.

257
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,280
Yet the very nature and information in the top secret Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars

258
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,500
introductory book,

259
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
the programming manual,

260
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,180
reads like a government technical manual

261
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,420
from some secret group of think tank planners

262
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,300
who have put many years of research and development

263
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,200
into creating a new science of social engineering

264
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,440
so they can better manipulate the masses.

265
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,460
This document was uncovered quite by accident on July 7th, 1986,

266
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,380
when an employee of Boeing Aircraft Company

267
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,520
purchased a surplus IBM copier for scrap parts at a sale

268
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,780
and discovered inside...

269
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Aircraft

270
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,140
Anthropywacon

271
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,980
was an original part of Oram abdominal

272
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,860
There are no external own services

273
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,960
In every figure that's inside

274
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:01,960


275
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,480
containing a kind of disconnected辦法

276
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,480


277
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,480


278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's sick!

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,200
This does any reason not to worry about the Marco

280
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,800
male

281
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:18,940
And friends, here are some of the excerpts from this amazing document.

282
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,500
A Novecir

283
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:21,500


284
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:21,500


285
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,220
Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on Earth.

286
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,500
Natural science is the study of the sources of control of natural energy,

287
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,300
and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy.

288
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,540
All science is merely a means to an end.

289
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,360
The means is knowledge. The end is control.

290
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,280
Beyond this remains only one issue, who will be the beneficiary.

291
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,220
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

292
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:08,120
Although the so-called moral issues were raised, in view of the law of natural selection,

293
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,940
it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence

294
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,240
are no better than animals

295
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,380
who do not

296
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,820
have intelligence.

297
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:26,520
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.

298
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,620
Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace and tranquility,

299
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,280
it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public

300
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,580
with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy, or wealth,

301
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,540
of the undisciplined and irresponsible many,

302
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:53,800
into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible and worthy few.

303
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,420
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure and apply new weapons,

304
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,720
which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated

305
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,760
in their principle of operation and public appearance,

306
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,100
as to earn for themselves the name, Silent Weapons.

307
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,240
In conclusion, the objective of economic research as conducted by the magnates of capital,

308
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,760
banking, and the industries of goods and services, is the establishment of an economy

309
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,360
which is totally predictable and manipulatable.

310
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,320
In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the lower class elements of society

311
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,080
must be brought under total control, i.e., must be held accountable.

312
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,940
They must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke,

313
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,180
and long-term social duties from a very early age,

314
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,380
before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter.

315
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,200
In order to achieve such conformity, the lower class family unit must be disintegrated

316
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,700
by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents

317
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,660
and the establishment of government-operated daycare centers

318
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,640
for the occupationally orphaned children.

319
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,640
The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort,

320
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:25,460
so that the mote of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class

321
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,260
is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class.

322
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,420
With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals

323
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,400
will have little, if any, hope of extricating themselves

324
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,640
from their assigned lot in society.

325
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,120
This form of slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order,

326
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,520
peace, and tranquility for the ruling class.

327
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,340
The silent weapon shoots situations instead of bullets,

328
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,720
propelled by data processing instead of chemical reactions,

329
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,460
originating from bits of data instead of grains of gunpowder,

330
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,500
from computer instead of a gun, operated by a computer programmer instead of a marksman,

331
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,980
and under the orders of a banking magnate instead of a military general.

332
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,140
The public cannot comprehend this weapon,

333
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,340
and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.

334
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,960
The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong,

335
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,720
but because of the technical nature of the silent weapon,

336
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,160
cannot express their feeling in a rational way or handle the problem with intelligence.

337
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,620
Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help.

338
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,400
Ah yes, and then it goes on to describe the silent weapon, dear friends.

339
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:03,380
Mr. Rothschild's energy discovery, apparent capital as a paper inductor and so forth.

340
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,700
And they use a sort of shock testing by which the prices of weapons,

341
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,740
of commodities are shocked and the public consumer reaction is monitored.

342
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,400
The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted theoretically by computers,

343
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,060
and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered.

344
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,480
It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrices

345
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,880
that define the family household make possible its evaluation as an economic industry, or...

346
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,680
In other words,

347
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,220
once the household as dissipative consumer structure,

348
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,600
then the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated,

349
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,460
and society becomes a real regulated animal with its reins under the control

350
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,640
of a sophisticated computer-regulated social energy bookkeeping system.

351
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,260
Eventually, every individual element of the structure comes under computer control

352
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,180
through a knowledge of personal preferences.

353
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,000
Such knowledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer preferences.

354
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,680
Through the Universal Product Code, or UPC,

355
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,920
the zebra-stripe pricing codes on packages,

356
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,680
with identified consumers,

357
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,040
identified via association with the use of a credit card,

358
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:32,900
and later a permanent tattooed body number invisible under normal ambient illumination.

359
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,180
The document, dear friends,

360
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:45,180
then goes on to describe the formula for the economic model of the silent weaponry,

361
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,400
with various diagrams,

362
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,280
and the three industrial classes,

363
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,540
and looks sort of almost electronic,

364
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,520
the way it's laid out with the E-model of economic inductance,

365
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,700
time-flow relationships,

366
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,320
and self-destructive oscillations.

367
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,560
And then it comes...

368
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,380
comes to this little situation here, dear friends,

369
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,800
by which we find that the social welfare program

370
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,440
is nothing more than an open-ended credit balance system,

371
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,860
which creates a false capital industry to give non-productive people

372
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,380
a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs.

373
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,820
This can be useful, however,

374
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,880
because the recipients become state property

375
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,280
in return for the gift of social welfare.

376
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,600
They become a standing army for the elite,

377
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,560
for he who pays the piper picks the tune.

378
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,060
Those who get hooked on the economic drug

379
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,840
must go to the elite for a fix.

380
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,340
In this, the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance

381
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,980
is by borrowing on the future credit of the world.

382
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,580
This is the fourth law of motion,

383
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,060
and consists of performing an action

384
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,440
and leaving the system before the reaction returns to the point of action,

385
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,280
a delayed reaction.

386
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,540
And by this means,

387
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,380
politicians become popular in their own time,

388
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,820
and the public pays for it later.

389
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,760
In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.

390
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,380
The same thing is achieved by a government printing money

391
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,720
beyond the limit of gross national product.

392
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,000
An economic process called inflation.

393
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,700
This puts a large quantity of money in the hands of the public

394
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,240
and maintains a balance against their greed,

395
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,280
creates a false self-confidence in them,

396
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,680
and for a while stays the wolf from the door.

397
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,300
But they must eventually resort to war

398
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,400
to balance the account.

399
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,020
Because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor.

400
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,680
And the politicians

401
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,520
are the publicly hired hitmen

402
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,540
that justify the act

403
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,740
to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience.

404
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,620
If the people really cared about their fellow man,

405
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,600
they would control their appetites,

406
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,080
their greed, their procreation, etc.

407
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,320
so that they would not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system

408
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,780
which steals from the worker to satisfy the bum.

409
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,120
Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint,

410
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,280
there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system.

411
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,700
One, let the population bludgeon each other to death in war,

412
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:53,420
which only results in the total destruction of the living earth.

413
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,880
Or two, take control of the world

414
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,680
by the use of economic silent weapons

415
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,720
in a form of quiet warfare

416
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,400
and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level

417
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,480
by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.

418
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,740
The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option.

419
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,400
At this point it should be crystal clear to the reader

420
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,840
why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary.

421
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,480
The general public refuses to improve its own mentality,

422
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,620
and its faith in its fellow man.

423
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,740
It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians

424
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,000
and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.

425
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,340
They do not care enough about economic science

426
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,800
to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality.

427
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,820
And their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems

428
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,860
renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable by far.

429
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,940
It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive

430
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
as the fittest to survive

431
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,660
to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.

432
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,900
Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapon

433
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:23,120
would destroy our only hope of preserving the seed of future true humanity.

434
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,200
And see, dear friends, I have gone

435
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,840
and just exposed the secret of the silent weapon over the radio,

436
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,140
destroying their hope of preserving the seed of future true humanity.

437
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,920
But since when, my friend, did we need to preserve full-blooded humanity?

438
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,320
Why, the full-blood human has not a drop of yeti blood in it.

439
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,140
And I don't see any point in us mollycoddling those people.

440
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,500
And as far as I'm concerned, you should respond to this

441
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,420
uh, uh, the secrets revealed in this document,

442
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,020
obviously written by the higher-ups in the conspiracy itself,

443
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:11,280
by, uh, contributing to your voice of the church of the subgenius in your area, dear friend.

444
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,540
Ah, yes, because, uh, we love you

445
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,520
and want to save you from that evil, evil

446
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,360
and the vile conspiracy.

447
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,600
Ah, yes.

448
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,100
...

449
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,620
...

450
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,280
...

451
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,640
God understands!

452
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,040
He doesn't condemn you.

453
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,340
No!

454
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,760
Excuse me!

455
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,560
God does not understand!

456
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:56,940
No!

457
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,280
Excuse me!

458
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,900
God does not understand!

459
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,880
I was moist and fully self-actualized, brimming with the vital juices of life,

460
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,200
a hero to every guy, a source of lust to every girl, and the nightmare of every mom.

461
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,140
Yes, I was flying high and leaving a trail of delightful turmoil in my fetid wake,

462
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,360
but just as I thought it couldn't get any better,

463
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,820
just when I thought I was about to be elected God,

464
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,080
so as I could fix this mess good and proper once and for all,

465
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:26,780


466
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,440
...

467
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:27,860

468
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,220

469

474
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:29,840

478
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,300


479
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,300


480
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,520

481
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,520
...

482
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:34,520


483
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:34,540

484
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:34,580

485
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:34,900
...

486
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,740
...

487
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,920
.

488
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,080
.

489
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,520

490

.

494
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,360
...

495
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,800
scum who haunt the malls, making even my occasional excursions thereof in pursuit of some minor

496
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:12,800
plastic crap, a sleigh ride through hell unbounded. I was fully loaded and snorting with hellish

497
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,320
anticipation of the unforgettable rampage which would splash the front pages of magazines

498
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,500
and newspapers worldwide. But suddenly, Negi sucked me dry.

499
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:33,180
Dry. The lab was fully stocked, the quivering subjects strapped down, the batteries charged,

500
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,200
and the electrodes in place. The drill bits were sharpened, the clamps well-oiled, the beakers

501
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,980
filled with the vile fluids of my intent. The hookahs were primed, the incense burning, the

502
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,580
sacrificial chickens, goats, former employers, and imaginary enemies drugged and ready. The

503
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,480
generators were churning, the lights were on, and the lights were on. I was fully loaded and snorting

504
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,200
with hellish anticipation of the

505
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,700
night. I was fully loaded and snorting with hellish anticipation of the

506
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:02,880
guns loaded with the best explosive shells money could buy. But suddenly, Negi sucked me dry.

507
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,800
Summary. This revealed at the provided only apartment, due to removing engine load

508
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,820
accenter of a right sidering these pulse changes, at three of this test, were reinforcement of this

509
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,340
crush of the horizontal barrier barrier, anthropomorphic dummies, were reduced

510
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,640
by removing strumant zone two, results are listed, and the impact became clear the experience,

511
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,120
demonstructural integrity, and results, intrusion of the D-sectives. Although the moment zone femur

512
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:44,640
locations not pre and were 44.1 mile per hour intrusional, X. Accelerometry, rather compartment,

513
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,900
and post-test measurement, injury criteria or damage to the rail.

514
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,160
Oh, you can wear a fake beard and

515
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,320
die.

516
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,600
You can wear glasses.

517
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,260
You can trade buses, planes, and rickshaws till you're dizzy.

518
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,840
You can nail the basement door shut, crank up the antivirus programs, turn out the lights,

519
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,860
and muzzle the kids.

520
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,720
You can wear three rubbers, a gas mask, and a raincoat, and nothing else.

521
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,360
You can buy an arsenal of automatic weapons and nerve gases.

522
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,560
You can build your own pocket nuke.

523
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,740
You can dig a moat around the house and fill it with piranha.

524
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,800
You can buy a six pack of slobbering pit bulls and a growth of tigers for the perimeter.

525
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,060
You can put in voice print, retina print, and tongue print computers with crisscross

526
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,680
lasers aimed at the doormat where the subject to be scanned will stand.

527
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,700
You can hire Batman, Hannibal Lecter, and Hulk Hogan for bodyguards.

528
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,680
You can fly straight up in the air, screaming like a banshee, flinging fluids and vital

529
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,600
organs everywhere.

530
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,640
But sooner or later, no matter how far you run or how big your gun, you're gonna have

531
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,900
to look in the mirror like everybody else and admit to yourself.

532
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,400
You're gonna have to look in the mirror like everybody else and admit to yourself, you're gonna have to look in the mirror like everybody else and admit to yourself.

533
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,480
You're gonna have to look in the mirror like everybody else and admit to yourself, you're gonna have to look in the mirror like everybody else and admit to yourself.

534
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,560
Negi, suck me dry.

535
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,620
You have to look at the mission record, you're just going over it.

536
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


537
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


538
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


539
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


540
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


541
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


542
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


543
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


544
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


545
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


546
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


547
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


548
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


549
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


550
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,620


551
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,320
That was uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

552
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,640
You don't understand?

553
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:22,640


554
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,240
Excuse me, God does not understand.

555
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,240
Excuse me, God does not understand.

556
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,100
You said I'd pick up my foot, but he'd put it down.

557
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,220
You said the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord.

558
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,300
Lord, I don't want to fall in the ditch.

559
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,740
I don't want to be the blind leading the blind.

560
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,140
God, I need the Holy Ghost conviction to keep me on the right track,

561
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,360
to keep me in the center of your will,

562
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,840
to keep me progressing toward the glory.

563
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm destined for the throne, and I refuse to take a bypass.

564
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,280
I refuse.

565
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,060
And we've got slaughtered men and women of God laying around us like cordwood.

566
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,440
They're dead. The life's gone out of them.

567
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,160
No unction, no anointing.

568
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,580
You know why? They refused conviction.

569
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,540
They were numb to conviction.

570
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,080
They turned a deaf ear to the wooing voice of the Spirit of God,

571
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,560
and now they're dead.

572
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,660
My God, that's worth the price of admission.

573
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,380
I know he's dead.

574
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,140
He didn't leave with Luther.

575
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,280
Telephone ring.

576
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,040
You were not...

577
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,740
The office president, Kennedy, calling me up.

578
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,720
He said, my friend Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?

579
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,080
I said, my friend John.

580
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,740
The subgenius must have flat!

581
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,080
The subgenius...

582
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,720
Big boy.

583
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:02,900
Ring.

584
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,540
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

585
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,440
Roar!

586
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:12,040
Remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.

587
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
He didn't leave with Luther.

588
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,440
Kill Bob!

589
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,700
Roar!

590
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,120
I know what you want.

591
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,060
You want to kill me.

592
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,460
Roar!

593
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,640
Roar!

594
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,520
Roar!

595
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,820
Can, you know, shoot the s*** with the best of them.

596
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,740
But what about nectar?

597
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,040
Well, when the fly finds it's time to mate, or rut,

598
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,960
he puts out his feelers, turns up his olfactory and other sensory nerve inputs,

599
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,620
and scans the horizon for the piquant, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat.

600
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,440
Ah, lucky fellow, he's found one.

601
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,780
Yes, her mysterious dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night.

602
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,020
But it's all right.

603
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,580
As she comes to accept him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure

604
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,220
is matched only by his built-in proportionate inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time.

605
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,500
For no sooner has the mating couple filled each other's goby nodules with albumin and spoo,

606
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,840
than the fly, ever-touring, ever-seeking nectar, flies off to another destination,

607
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,780
smiling all the while as the facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace,

608
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,380
land, and mansions of endless stars, thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book.

609
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,000
Is it all in the name of love?

610
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,000
Or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?

611
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,580
Perhaps we'll never know.

612
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,280
But the next time you see a common fly, remember, there's more to this pesky fellow's life,

613
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,280


614
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,340
than rancid oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.

615
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,900
Yes, one of nature's most misunderstood anomalies, Mr. Fly will always be a part of...

616
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,640
Our Insect World.

617
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,480
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

618
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,460
Tadatit that time.

619
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,520
Here I am again, Mga Patatid, a Kaiban Sabuhai at Living Gun.

620
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,960
Narito Nanaman, an inyong wonderful and sexy doll, upang mahatid sa inyong pananahevik.

621
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,580
Ang mga topsy-turvy news sa ating local cinema.

622
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,700
Kayat, let us prepare everything now, especially ourselves, for this wonderful titibisyen.

623
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,480
Nagayon pagasumaka sumahin natin ang katanagyan ninyi torso.

624
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,740
A pogi si tirso handsome, a good dresser si mantasata clean-cut.

625
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,780
Ata si tirso ayamohasay umawitata sumayaya.

626
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,780
Then, ang naging second love.

627
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,180
Naman nini Nora nasi many.

628
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,500
Angi close-up nasa clean.

629
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Si many kahe hit short.

630
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,920
Sa height kung itatitibi kay torso.

631
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,760
Katatiti hindi si ya handsome na tulidni tirso ay cute.

00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,260
Naman et meirun.

633
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,540
E tingantana it.

634
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,440
Hi, Mrs.

635
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Tala tang ang hirap na ganga-maga-maga-maga ano?

636
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,060
Imagine.

637
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,380
Ang mahala malang ang mainga bilhemi.

638
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,140
Ang dami-dami pang maga mananga-mangaka.

639
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,760
Ma discourage ang manaka maga maga burglars.

640
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,620
Oh, kung hingi man discourage ang magaito, at least make it difficult for them.

641
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,320
Lalo ne para doon, saam ga amateur sneak thieves.

642
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,340
Cloyd Robinson, big-eye na big-eye na ang damahong in sa pelikulang big-eye.

643
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,040
Saam saal niya saad Beth Morgado, well, indi da bomba an pelikula a little sex lang.

644
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,500
Dear Mr. Auri, I am one of a million readers of your wonderful karam,

645
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,460
which I believe can help me find a lot girl-right fo me.

646
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,380
I did not think before that I would be in need of your help, for I had girl-friends, yet they all deceived me.

647
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,760
However, I don't blame even any one of them.

648
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,580
I've realized that we're not really men for each other.

649
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,320
With regard to the girl I'm looking for, she must be of a practical type, Caucasian, Catholic, understanding enough to get my situation.

650
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,280
She must not be necessarily beautiful or sexy, but charming and sexy and beautiful and simple to please my sophisticated heart.

651
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,320
Ngaggly.

652
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,880
She must be a teacher, even pursuing still such profession at 22 to 25 years of age, standing 5 to 5.

653
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:33,380
Speaking of my humble self, I am an A.B. degree holder, and at present still pursuing my studies for a B.S.E. degree,

654
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:39,560
and at the same time employed in one of the private firms in the greater Manila area, making Manila folders.

655
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,720
Till here, and I'll be hoping for the best of your kind health.

656
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,380
Thanks in advance, and more power to your column.

657
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
Very respectfully.

658
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,200
Tyrone.

659
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,980
Lang-gla-gay-ang-pang-gling-mo, roadside mailbox, saying house number nalang.

Mang-ga-gung-gum-gum-gum-a-na-nig-a-sing-a-laga-pang-gling-a-num-ro-an-ba-yay, this way.

661
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,980
The Church of the Sun Genius.

662
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,740
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Dallas.

663
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,180
Churches.

664
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,720
7, 5, 2, 1, 4.

665
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,560
Praise Bob. That's right.

666
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:26,920
That Malaysian address is Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

667
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,180
7, 5, 2, 1, 4.

668
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,220
And you really can write for more free information from Bob at that number.

669
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,880
But I'll be giving that sacred Post Office Box number again.

670
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
But in the meantime, I wanted to let you know what you have been listening to, dear friends.

671
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,960
We've heard Hell Pope Huey doing a Neegie sucked me dry.

672
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,200
A lovely sort of testimony there.

673
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,600
More of Reverend Parsley from Reverend Uncle Jimmy's tape that he sent in.

674
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,420
We've barely scratched the surface of that.

675
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,040
Dr. Legume's media barrage.

676
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,860
Dr. Riley's media barrage.

677
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,060
Bleepo Abernathy talking about flies in rut.

678
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,960
And that was the Fire Sign Theater.

679
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,920
Very rare recordings doing the Filipino ads there.

680
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:36,400
And coming up, we'll hear some ranting by Reverend Mike Cole in Cleveland.

681
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,600
A little bit of that.

682
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,040
Some, an amazing little piece about snake handling.

683
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,060
He's so well done.

684
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,060


685
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,520
In deutschland.

686
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:50,720
Course above safely in target.

687
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,300
Nothing.

688
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,100
Nothing but getting gets me somecap ya'll.

689
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,960
And that's that.

690
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,160
In the Savior's Business sent to películas that have any quality of human begins that

691
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,220
coming up and well we'll just see we'll try to get down to the

692
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,160
rudy schwartz project

693
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,240
uh...

694
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,000
on

695
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,400
are we not

696
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:23,860

702
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:44,520
perhaps

703
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,860

glory to god

723
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,360
reverend stang

724
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,420
and he was talking about that somewhat, reverend stang in the magazine on july fifth morning

725
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,420


726
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,420


727
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,420


728
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,640
Look around.

729
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,680
And he was telling the importance of the X-Day.

730
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,200
1998.

731
00:42:48,420 --> 00:43:00,520
And he was saying, he was saying, what was it he was saying?

732
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:16,140
Stay up all night, frobbing and frobbing and dooning and and gleaning and doing X-Day chants about how the time is nigh for their arisal.

733
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,720
And songs, you know, X-Day holiday songs like Take Me Off to Space, which we'll be playing soon.

734
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:29,520
And on X-Day morning, of course, well, the grownups been up all night, but the kids get up real early because.

735
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,560
Because on X-Day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

736
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,280
When we pulled up in the yard, I told the children here, I said, we're going to have ourselves a time tonight.

737
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,940
I just knew that old church is going to be full of spirit.

738
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,780
And it was, honey.

739
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,760
It was.

740
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,380
We went in there.

741
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,860
We after we sung about three songs, they were shouting all over that church.

742
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,580
I've never seen so many people in one church shout.

743
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,940
And in a little while, they shouted themselves right around in back office.

744
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,360
Three ladies and two men.

745
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,940
Well, now, when we were hooking up, we saw some curtains or something laying over some boxes back there.

746
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,320
We didn't pay any attention to it.

747
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,100
Didn't know what is in there and didn't care.

748
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:21,600
But in a little while, they came out around us with five of the biggest rattlesnakes I have ever laid my eyes on.

749
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,600
I like to die.

750
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:38,400
But when the service was over, they told us that the biggest rattlesnake they had in that service was five feet long.

751
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,100
Honey, the one they brought by me was 27 feet long.

752
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,000
They let me say this.

753
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,080
I'm not knocking these people.

754
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,920
I promise you, I'm not knocking them.

755
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,300
I don't know if they're right or wrong.

756
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,440
You know, I'll tell you that they claim that they they read in the Bible.

757
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,980
I don't know where Moses had enough faith to take up the service.

758
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,400
And some members of their congregation claim to have that much faith.

759
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,180
And I'll tell you one thing I found out before I left there.

760
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,040
They had a whole lot more faith than what I had.

761
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:21,880
Now, this one woman stopped about two feet from where I was trying to pick and sing.

762
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,260
I didn't even know what kiosk is.

763
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:38,440
She took that rattlesnake with a head as big as your fist and held it up and stuck it right down in her face and shouted in its ear.

764
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,120
If a rattlesnake's got an ear.

765
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,000
She wrapped that thing around her neck.

766
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:51,320
She threw it down on the floor, kicked off her shoe and put her bare foot on top of its head.

767
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,820
When she threw that thing down on the floor.

768
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,060
It fell.

769
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,500
It fell.

770
00:45:59,500 --> 00:45:59,500


771
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,080
I missed my foot about that far.

772
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,640
I done a little shouting myself.

773
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,280
And she thought I was in the spirit.

774
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,180
And brought me one up.

775
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,300
Well, I didn't know.

776
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,800
I didn't know what the world was going to do.

777
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,920
And I said, just take it easy.

778
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,160
Don't panic.

779
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,880
I said, just look around and find out where the back door is.

780
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,160
She said, I already looked and there ain't none.

781
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,300
I said, reckon where do they want one?

782
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:03,800
I said, there's one.

783
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,800


784
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,800


785
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,800


786
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,800


787
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,160
And this lady walked up to me.

788
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,200
She said, Brother Wendy.

789
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,880
You mean to tell me.

790
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,580
If the Lord commanded you to take up the serpent, you wouldn't take him up?

791
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,700
I said, yes, ma'am, I surely would.

792
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,800
But he didn't and I ain't.

793
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:24,540
Then the devil pulls off a mask.

794
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,340
It's me, Bob.

795
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,080
He's a good boy.

796
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,060
He's a good boy.

797
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,280
Ha ha ha!

798
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,180
We better get back, because it will be dark soon.

799
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,600
And they mostly come at night. Mostly.

800
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,660
I need your body as a dwelling place while I am here on your earth.

801
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,440
Where do you put it? You got a hollow leg?

802
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,520
It exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country.

803
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:21,640
And you must stand united on this, and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth.

804
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,520
Because it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.

805
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:27,940
Hooray!

806
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,560
Ah!

807
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:32,620
Ah!

808
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,220
Ah!

809
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,560
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

810
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,340
Let me be slack.

811
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,460
Hooray!

812
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,400
Didn't you give me this shit? You don't do anything to stimulate me.

813
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,720
Why don't you buy me a vibrator?

814
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Why won't I put it in your mouth and you hum?

815
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,620
I'm going to give you a good one.

816
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,620


817
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,240
A person walking down a sandy beach barefoot,

818
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,380
whose foot has been numbed by Novocaine,

819
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,440
steps on the jagged edge of a broken bottle,

820
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,500
slits their foot and bleeds to death,

821
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,760
because they never knew there was a problem.

822
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,800
My loss was his gain.

823
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:29,280
This was a manipulation, a tilting of the luck plane in his face.

824
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,420
I was not in favor.

825
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,500
And what goes up must come down.

826
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,800
And when you're talking about the luck plane, you're talking about both sides at once.

827
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,980
One goes up, the other goes down.

828
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,720
I happen to be on the wrong end of the luck plane.

829
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:48,920
But Mr. Rob Dobson, you see, was on the right side of the luck plane.

830
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,280
And I bet he had a damn good seat for tonight's game.

831
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,240
A wonderful paradise.

832
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,840
Is that a paradise?

833
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,620
Sort of.

834
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,240
He's on the coast, up north.

835
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:05,060
Up north, here, with all of his, well, what can you say, aliens, friends?

836
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,300
Oh, his family reunion.

837
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,760
What about me?

838
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,800
That's the code word we use, too.

839
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:17,340
Yes, it's a mighty big family tree we subgenius grow from.

840
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,980
That's right.

841
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,860
You never can tell what sort of branches he can branch off.

842
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,600
Well, we're going to the convention floor right now for that report about Jesus and a handgun.

843
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,940
Let's see what they have to say down there.

844
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,420
Jesus was running around at the bar last night with a handgun.

845
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:33,840
Really?

846
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,660
Okay, you can see Reverend Stan there.

847
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,520
Yes, he was.

848
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,920
And a wound in his side and a crown of thorns, a loincloth, and a handgun.

849
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,260
He was looking for Bob.

850
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,580
He was hunting for Bob.

851
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,120
And so what happened?

852
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,860
Well, he was bumming drinks.

853
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,320
Yeah.

854
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,320
He was real ecstatic.

855
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,900
You see him running around town.

856
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,940
You be on the lookout.

857
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,020
Yes, he was.

858
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,740
And a wound in his side and a crown of thorns, a loincloth.

859
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,220
And then I saw him going off with two guns.

860
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,220


861
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,220


862
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,220


863
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,220


864
00:50:59,220 --> 00:50:59,540
And he was running around town.

865
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,860
And he was running around town.

866
00:50:59,860 --> 00:50:59,860


867
00:50:59,860 --> 00:50:59,860


868
00:50:59,860 --> 00:50:59,860


869
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,720
That's a drinking, fighting Jesus for you.

870
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,840
I saw him fighting .

871
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,640
Is he Bob?

872
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,900
I wasn't around at that point.

873
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,040
I don't think he did.

874
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:07,600
I don't think he hit Bob.

875
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,200
He missed him.

876
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,840
Something must have happened.

877
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,040
We think the bullets were caught in some sort of void time warp or something.

878
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:14,760
Yeah, I saw it.

879
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,180
They were moving in Oz and had each other.

880
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,420
That's always a problem with those dealers.

881
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,840
The other thing you have to do on the show here is watch the little H-bombs.

882
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,720
They're over here in the corner.

883
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,540
There's a sink over here.

884
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,480
And you can watch their bodies.

885
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,240
We might have to leave the floor.

886
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,640
It looks like the crowd's getting ugly down there with Reverend Ivan Stang.

887
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,240
Uh-oh.

888
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,160
Uh-oh.

889
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,400
They busted through the...

890
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,760
Well, there you go.

891
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,440
They busted through the third medium into Stang's brain.

892
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,400
They now reside there until we can perform the radio exorcism on the second half of the

893
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,660
show.

894
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,820
Yes, I was there in the bar that night.

895
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,460
The night that produced with the lady.

896
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:58,460


897
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,760
And we were allegedly running around, but that was no handgun in his pocket.

898
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,600
Was it?

899
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:02,880
Let me tell you...

900
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,300
He was just happy to see another cult.

901
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,740
He wanted those followers back.

902
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,780
Customer service?

903
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,740
Yes, dear.

904
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:08,900
Papa Joe here.

905
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,380
And you know, you're far too young to remember this, but when I was a boy, we didn't have

906
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,980
any of these weakling Jesus with the handguns.

907
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:24,060
We only prayed to an almighty God that puts fear, fear in his disciples.

908
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,320
I'm talking about Jesus with a hand grenade.

909
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,220
Fear in his burial?

910
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,080
No, Jesus, back in my day, Jesus had AK-47.

911
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,260
I know.

912
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,240
Jesus had a Stinger.

913
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,020
I just understand that's the old world.

914
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,680
We're in new thinking now.

915
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,660
See, that's what's happened today.

916
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,480
People get slept off with these cheap imitations.

917
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,460
Yeah, but I'm a Papa Joe Mama.

918
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,460
What an imitation it is.

919
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:51,120
I think we have a list of high-ranking officials that were there that night and were actually subpoenaed.

920
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,820
All right, punch it up.

921
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,380
Name.

922
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,720
There we go.

923
00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:02,520
It has been alleged that certain high-archies have carried weapons of destruction on their persons during public appearances,

924
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,420
but this is merely a defensive measure, let me assure you.

925
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,040
These allegations of opening up on the audience, dispensing with people that didn't applaud loud enough,

926
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,080
these are purely exaggerations.

927
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:20,080
Okay, all right, there was some shooting on the audience, but it was target practice.

928
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,900
We were deliberately missing.

929
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:22,980
Tell the truth.

930
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,280
Okay, okay, so all right, a few people were hit, but that was from Wicked Day.

931
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,200
Yeah, we dial up Rocket Man.

932
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,500
What a beautiful future it is.

933
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,340
And how many people were taking hits?

934
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,100
Listen, what I lie to you, what I lie to you, those people that died, those were people that wanted to die.

935
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,620
They jumped up in the line of fire.

936
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,760
Would you lie to me?

937
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,620
What about that night you told me you were?

938
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,500
Well, never mind.

939
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,420
Never mind, never mind.

940
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,700
Close the Ravens.

941
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,400
Never mind.

942
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,660
Help!

943
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,360
Help!

944
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:52,920
Help!

945
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,480
Help!

946
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:54,760
Help!

947
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,320
He screamed at the orderlies when told he was actually Farlow Fudd, doctor of dental surgery.

948
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:04,760
He struggled with his bonds and snapped his jaws at them viciously, his mouth foaming like a St. Bernard's.

949
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:14,380
The drugs had shown some beneficial effect at first, but as time wore on, his violent reassertion of his fictitious persona pushed aside any hope that chemical management would lead to a breakthrough.

950
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,020
Get the electrodes, sighed Dr. Fine.

951
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,120
He shook his head in resigned frustration.

952
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,700
The man had already absorbed the full charge of four die-hard batteries and was still no longer alive.

953
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:23,700


954
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:23,860
He was no better.

955
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,860
His burning devotion to this Bob Dobbs was most disturbing.

956
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:36,460
Either it was the product of a fevered, sick mind, or this Bob had somehow tormented the man into a state of burning, psychotic loyalty unlike anything they'd seen before.

957
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,780
Perhaps it was both.

958
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,420
Hell-Pope Huey, indeed.

959
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,320
Well, regardless, I have a job to do, thought the doctor as he pulled on his thick rubber gloves and goggles.

960
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,400
And to think I used to enjoy this, he thought.

961
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,120
Something had to work soon.

962
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,120
There were only three orderlies left.

963
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,700
And one of them refused to approach this patient again, even with the peril of being fired over his head.

964
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:03,420
As the raving man had put the others in the ICU with snapped bones and large pieces bitten out of them, the doctor couldn't really blame him.

965
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,500
Perhaps he really was the Pope of Hell.

966
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,820
He was certainly earning his self-imposed title.

967
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:08,860
Oh well.

968
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,440
One last try with electricity, and then it would be time to turn to firearms.

969
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:19,100
Suddenly there were screams in the hall, followed by a terrifying, rumbling crash that sounded like someone had loosed a thunderhead in the building.

970
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,640
The multifaceted sonic chaos made him feel like a frightened child again, and his bladder loosened violently.

971
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:36,960
Against his better judgment, he ran from the room and turned the corner to see the orderlies in pools of their own blood, their arms ripped from the sockets, unimaginable burns, smoking and filling the air with the acrid tang of ozone.

972
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:48,480
Worse yet, one of them had been separated from his head, which lay forlornly in the corner like a discarded ragdoll, except that ragdolls didn't ooze loops of intestine and purple-pink brain matter.

973
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,360
My dear God, his nose has been bitten off, Dr. Fine thought as he vomited.

974
00:55:53,780 --> 00:56:01,740
I guess he shouldn't have called the man names when all this started, he thought absently, part of his fractured mind shutting itself off in a bid to prevent a complete breakdown.

975
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:10,560
There was a huge hole in the wall, jaggedly rent as if some unimaginable force of nature had gone berserk, which was, ironically, exactly what had happened.

976
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:18,460
A few bricks fell from the smoking edges of the gash as he watched, mouth agape, vomitous, unwiped, as he tried to wrap a protective cocoon around the wall.

977
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,460


978
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:18,460


979
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,660
This was the only thing that was in his mind until he could get to some tranquilizers.

980
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,800
Hmm, Bob Dobbs and Hell Pope Huey, he mused absently.

981
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,580
I'll remember those names.

982
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,020
.

983
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,020


984
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,840
. Yes, dear friends.

985
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:55,440
You can remember the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs by writing for free information.

986
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,140
That's right.

987
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:06,900
You can get all kinds of free stuff in the mail just by letting us know you care enough to send off for that wonderful packet.

988
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,040
You can write Bob.

989
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,700
You got that pencil ready, friend?

990
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,780
I'm going to give you a couple of different addresses tonight.

991
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:24,980
You can write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas at 75214.

992
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,640
Oh, yes.

993
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:30,020
There's a lot more besides this radio show that you need to know about.

994
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,640
At P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

995
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,580
And our good friend Onan Canobite is looking, apparently doing,

996
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:45,260
a book about SPK, the band SPK.

997
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:51,300
And he is looking for anything you've got, like interviews, discographies, tour data,

998
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:56,440
names and addresses of members, any language, reviews.

999
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,420
All contributors will be credited and all inquiries answered.

1000
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:07,840
And you can write to Trevor Blake at Post Office Box 2321.

1001
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,380
That's Box 2321.

1002
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,660
Portland, Oregon.

1003
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,120
97208.

1004
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,820
That zip, once again, in Portland, Oregon, 97208.

1005
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,120
But that doesn't tell you about Bob, does it?

1006
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,780
No.

1007
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:25,740
No.

1008
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,360
But this might.

1009
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,500
Now, the conspiracy talks about something called deviant sex.

1010
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,300
To the conspiracy, deviant sex is anything except having, uh,

1011
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,760
talking to a woman.

1012
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,000
But it's not just about talking to a woman.

1013
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,740
It's about having a baby in the missionary position.

1014
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,280
That's the only thing we consider to be a sin.

1015
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,560
Am I preaching right now?

1016
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,060
Am I preaching right now?

1017
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,220
That knew they were a dirty, rotten, hunk of stinking, sinful,

1018
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,860
hunk of stinking, sinful flesh.

1019
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,680
Dirty, rotten, hunk of stinking, sinful,

1020
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,500
dirty, rotten, hunk of stinking, sinful,

1021
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,620
hunk of stinking, sinful,

1022
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,680
dirty, rotten, hunk of,

1023
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,820
they were red as crimson, now they're white as wool.

1024
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,140
Dirty, rotten, hunk of stinking, sinful flesh.

1025
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,500
Oh, now that's hogwash.

1026
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,980
Every person pulled his hair,

1027
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,720
he-he-he-heir and clawed the ground.

1028
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,380
This is a battlefield, sir.

1029
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,300
This is no recreation room.

1030
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,520
That's it. That's the great sin.

1031
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,620
But, who wants to play Russian in that?

1032
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,060
The next time that somebody wants you to go to bed with them,

1033
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,140
with or without a gun,

1034
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,440
you're packing on a load of revolver-reaching windows.

1035
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,940
It'sライ,,,

1036
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:48,460
It'sauce,

1037
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:49,800
It'sauce,

1038
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:49,980
It'sa halfway around

1039
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,000
It'sa halfway around

1040
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,440
You're going to bed with every other person that person has ever gone to bed with before in their life.

1041
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
So just picture it,

1042
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,460
as if you're all crawling into one bed together.

1043
00:59:59,640 --> 00:59:59,800
And, can you imagine having a bed with one person who's never been to the same bed before in their life?

1044
00:59:59,800 --> 00:59:59,800


1045
00:59:59,800 --> 00:59:59,800


1046
00:59:59,780 --> 00:59:59,780
