1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Guess who's on the line? We have the Reverend Ivan Stang on the line. He's going to be coming up in just a bit.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,580
We're going to take a break right now, and then it's all Stang. It's the Stang Network, the hour of slack.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,620
And we're going to do it right here at Ground Zero.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,220
All Stang, all the time.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,960
Oh man, and people are excited.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,440
Spacecraft, spacecraft power, spacecraft, spacecraft power.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,240
The two sides looked like they were about to get into it a little bit.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,180
They've been ignoring each other mainly most of the evening.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,380
But a fellow who's up here from Texas waded into the crowd, and they moved in and broke it up.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,880
And you'll be seeing the staff here on television.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:42,640
The Texas is working even now as we speak on the big book of the subgenius, which will be published sometime before 1984.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,560
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,060
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,580
And to you, young man.

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,200
And to me, young man.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,380
And to me, young man.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:56,800
And to me, young man.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,880
Yeah.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,880
Or more.

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,160
Prostitution, yeah.

21
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,640
Use until it hurts.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,280
What do you think sex hurts means?

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,340
It don't mean chaining them up.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
It means sex until it hurts.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,000
Love him until it hurts.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Yes, indeed.

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,200
Yes, indeed.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,900
Hi, I'm ready to play school.

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,980
Would you like to play with me?

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,860
Good.

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,360
Now, what shall we call our school?

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,980
I know.

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,180
We'll call it...

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,220
The subgenius hour of sweat.

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,460
If we go two years without some group of armed wackos threatening and saying the government is coming for them,

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,440
then I'll worry that something important has gone out of this country.

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,620
Sounds like blood.

38
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh.

39
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,920
Attention, this is Principal Skinner, your principal.

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
The message from the school is...

41
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,260
The message from the principal's office.

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,280
All students please proceed immediately to an assembly in the Putt Head Memorial Auditorium.

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,820
Damn it, I wish we hadn't let those students name that one.

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm Clyde Lewis, and this is Ground Zero.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,520
Four, five, six, seven, oh, KBER.

46
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,600
The numbers to call tonight are 1-888-570-KBER.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,300
Tonight, special night for everybody.

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:38,100
We bring to Ground Zero, from Texas, the man, the legend, the Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,180
Reverend Stang, are you there?

50
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,560
Praise Bob, Clyde.

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,160
Praise Bob.

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,340
Praise Clyde Bob.

53
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,420
God, it's so good to have you back.

54
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,020
Praise Claude, five.

55
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,600
It's so good to have you back. God, it's been, what, two years now?

56
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
Oh, two long years, Clyde.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,980
Two long years.

58
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:02,480
And I figured you were so busy because of X Day and how everything, you know, so good in the rupture went so wrong.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,720
Or did it go wrong?

60
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,040
Well, I gotta admit, I'm pretty disappointed to be here tonight.

61
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,080
Okay, why?

62
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
No offense to you, I mean, I'm disappointed to be on Earth.

63
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,520
Why they didn't come.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,440
I mean, at the least, I would like Bob to show up and say,

65
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,120
Uh, well, I made a deal and we've got three more years to harvest more souls.

66
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:38,700
And like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yea, all which inherit it shall dissolve.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,980
And like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,560
We are such stuff as dreams are made on.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,780
And our little life is rounded with a sleep.

70
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,760
Ah, yes, the harvest, dear friend, schools out.

71
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,560
And perhaps some of the harvesting fad will pass.

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:20,040
But our show tonight, it seems, I guess, is gonna be a mix of the old formats and the new formats

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,200
and once again, Reverend Susie the Flusie has provided us with a copy of one of her shows,

74
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:37,580
her Get the Hell Out of School special from Bob's Slack Time Fun House on WREK in Atlanta.

75
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,400
And we're gonna be mixing that up with all this other, all these other little tapes.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,660
You hear these Wellman heads, we call them, all stacked up around here?

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,920
Yes.

78
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:58,060
And we've got lots of show about the blood-thirsty nature of kids these days and of humans these days.

79
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,880
That's the problem, don't you know, is humans.

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:10,560
And we've got the solution to the problem of humans, the final solution of XX Day, friends.

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,900
And I think you know what it's all about because you've got the blessing of Bob, don't you?

82
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,080
I know that you do.

83
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,700
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.

84
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,580
You can't buy a miracle, but you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

85
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,120
...like a bunch of ****** on the radio right now.

86
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,320
Really now, are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks or do you have...

87
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,340
And I wouldn't infer that our Secretary of State is Antichrist,

88
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,920
but I'm telling you that preparations are being made.

89
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,220
And that the very door of the Day of the Wrath of God is at hand.

90
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,240
And that if you plan to get saved, you had better do it now.

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:05,240
There will be a day not in the too far distant future in which Antichrist will be revealed.

92
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,420
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.

93
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,680
And people will have a number in their hands and in their forehead.

94
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,900
Our demand for energy will be met from the people of America.

95
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,160
And we will have our own production and our own conservation.

96
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,500
Also in your literature, I noticed connections with aliens.

97
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,460
And the God of Wrath who visits us every once in a while and talks to...

98
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,840
We've got to drop this name in here, Bob Dobbs.

99
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,200
The High Muckety Muck.

100
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,220
And ever behold, he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him.

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,280
Space vessel identity unknown.

102
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,320
Are we not men?

103
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,640
In the realm of the world.

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,820
Spacecraft, spaceweapon power.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,780
There are many, I would say, sort of super superstitious kinds of beliefs that are attached to the icons.

106
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,660
Spacecraft, spaceweapon power.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,380
Spacecraft, spaceweapon power.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
Spacecraft, spaceweapon power.

109
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,600
Lesson for your ministry.

110
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,100
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

111
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,820
Earth, we must get off.

112
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,880
Earth, we must get off.

113
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520
I don't know many people that are that serious.

114
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,200
Well, as your listeners may or may not be aware,

115
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,380
our guru, the leader of the Church of the Subgenius, Bob Dobbs,

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,280
was immaculated or given a vision back in the 1950s

117
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,800
by the alien space god known as Jehovah One,

118
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,540
formerly known as Jehovah One,

119
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,600
that the world would end on July 5th of this year

120
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,120
at 7 o'clock in the morning,

121
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,940
except for those who had basically sent $30

122
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,440
to Bob Dobbs' Church of the Subgenius,

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,520
is what it amounts to,

124
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,640
and therefore proved that they were of the subgenius race

125
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
as opposed to the humans.

126
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
So obviously any aliens that are going to come

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,740
are going to want to exterminate the pests and vermin

128
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,800
and save what might be useful.

129
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,340
Right.

130
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,360
Bob was trying to, you know,

131
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,700
distinguish between who was useful and who wasn't,

132
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,300
like who sent him $30, among other things.

133
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,300
Ah, little lad, you're staring at my fingers.

134
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,560
Would you like me to tell you the little story of right hand, left hand?

135
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,040
The story of good and evil?

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,000
H-A-T-E.

137
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,260
It was good.

138
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,040
With this left hand that old brother came

139
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,640
struck the blow that laid his brother low.

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,880
L-O-V-E.

141
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,480
You see these fingers, dear hearts,

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,000
these fingers has veins that run straight to the soul of man.

143
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,560
The right hand, friends, the hand of love.

144
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,460
Now watch and I'll show you the story of life.

145
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,900
These fingers, dear hearts, is always a-warring

146
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,400
and a-tugging one again to the other.

147
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,420
Now watch them.

148
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,260
Old brother left hand.

149
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,240
Left hand hates a-fighting.

150
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,140
And it looks like love's a-gone.

151
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,940
But wait a minute.

152
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
Wait a minute.

153
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,320
Hot dog loves a-winning.

154
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,720
Yes, sirree.

155
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,160
It's love that won.

156
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,600
And old left hand hate is down for the count.

157
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,380
I never heard it better told.

158
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
I wish every soul in this community could get the benefit.

159
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,460
Oh, you've just got to stay for our picnic Sunday.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,660
No, I must wend my way down river on the Lord's business.

161
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,740
You ain't leaving in no hurry if we can help it.

162
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,260
John, mind your manners.

163
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,380
Take that look off your face.

164
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:50,900
Act nice.

165
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,660
Why, you don't mean no impudence, do you, boy?

166
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,760
Do you, boy?

167
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,160
How many's the time poor brother Ben told me about these youngins?

168
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,560
What did he tell you?

169
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,660
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister were.

170
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,040
Yes, but they did not believe in Bob.

171
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
They must be taught.

172
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,960
We must find them, hunt them down, and teach them all.

173
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,040
All the little children.

174
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,200
Must be taught the word and the way of Bob.

175
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,900
Because that's the only way to keep them from, you know,

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,760
the idle hands is the devil's playground.

177
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,080
And them kids will get into all kinds of trouble if you don't lead them right.

178
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,720
You've got to give them a light to follow.

179
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,920
A true, a thing, a way, a way and a light.

180
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,220
And a half-toned face or a picture.

181
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,540
They've got to have a picture of God.

182
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,320
Short of God, you know, since obviously you can't have a picture of everything and nothing

183
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,380
and all, you, well, you know, we'll use a stand-in.

184
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,780
Why not Bob?

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,260
At least, you know, Bob's the kind of personal savior that you can be alone with.

186
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,300
You know, he's not like the kind that's always pestering you and after you, Bob.

187
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,060
You can be alone.

188
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,140
You can be alone.

189
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,240
You can be alone.

190
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,820
You can be alone.

191
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,080
With Bob.

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,320
And, oh, what news do we have?

193
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Oh, friends, we do have news of, you know, at X-Day 1998, at 6.30 a.m., July 5th, there

194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,940
were two crossed contrails in the air over the great campground where all the subgeni

195
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,580
were gathered.

196
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,900
We thought it was a sign and it may have been a sign.

197
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
It may have been a sign.

198
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,800
It may have been a sign of, of, uh, United States government doing weird effects on weather

199
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,220
and brain and health control.

200
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,380
As described here in this article, poison from the sky.

201
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,600
The chemtrails crisis.

202
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,560
From Nexus Magazine with this background music by, what is this guy's name?

203
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,740
Phil, Phil, I really like this stuff.

204
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,460
Yeah, Phil.

205
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,040
Phil of, uh, Tramapoline.

206
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:30,500
Um, yes, uh, aside from the high school maskers and, uh, uh, PC censorships in subgenius land,

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,920
we also wonder about these contrails of strange chemicals drifting down out of the sky, uh,

208
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,840
making everybody around them sick.

209
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:40,860
Uh.

210
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,000
And, uh, being not explained by the government or anybody else, even though they're obviously

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,340
coming from these giant Air Force planes.

212
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,640
The huge X's being traced by formations of tanker jets in clear skies can be tracked

213
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:03,440
by satellite and perhaps coordinated with the cross beams of ionospheric heaters to

214
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,860
heat the upper atmosphere, changing its temperature and density to enhance or mitigate storm,

215
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:10,840
uh, weather.

216
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,520
And, uh, the

217
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:11,520


218
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,880
I mean, this all sounds pretty, uh, outrageous, but there was a paper, uh, called Weather

219
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,880
as a Force Multiplier, uh, that was presented by a bunch of military officers.

220
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,280
And this Air Force study outlines how using tankers, airborne tankers to seed the atmosphere

221
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,260
and, uh, by adding, quote, small amounts of energy at just the right time in space, U.S.

222
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,420
Aerospace Forces could, quote, own the weather, unquote, by the year 2025.

223
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:40,840
Among those, the United States Air Force and the United States Air Force have been working

224
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,840


225
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,840


226
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,840


227
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:40,840


228
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,360
fine this year at almost every state, and we, ship, uh,

229
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,440
Uh, the suisne College designers and Arobot engineers are in thee near the

230
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,460
swamp two days ago.

231
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,060
Uh, but can you imagine if they produced one, uh.

232
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:01,620
M-m-moooo ...

233
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:10,200
counties like Arkansas, did you know that the удивit 문 is a little bit thành

234
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,380
ink

235
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,820
?

236
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:10,820


237
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,580
air type strands falling from the sky.

238
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,580
What is the use?

239
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,580
Could cobweb-like polymer strands

240
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,540
spun behind tank or aircraft,

241
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,640
perhaps contaminated with a bio-agent,

242
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,560
to discourage handling or tracking of its dispersion,

243
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,920
be formed in the cold reaches of the stratosphere

244
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,120
only to sublimate and disappear quickly

245
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
in sea-level warmth so they can't track it,

246
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,940
even though they use it for tracking,

247
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,340
and they're tracking diseases through us, friends.

248
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,960
Friends, you know,

249
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,800
Henry Kissinger and Ted Turner

250
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,840
and other Bilderbergers,

251
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,340
many other statesmen, great men of our time,

252
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,680
have called for a reduction in the world population

253
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,700
to 500 million or fewer.

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,620
And who knows, friends, perhaps they're getting ready.

255
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,660
They're just preparing.

256
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,340
They're testing their culling devices.

257
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,880
Well,

258
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,800
friends,

259
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
we ain't worried,

260
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,220
because as I make this tape here tonight,

261
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,040
it is one month and 14 days to X-Day.

262
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
By the time you hear it, it'll be,

263
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,180
why, X-Day'd be right around the corner, friends.

264
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,520
Are you right with Bob?

265
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,540
Have you figured it out?

266
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,340
Have you got, have you got, have you,

267
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,760
or are you still wearing that black trench coat,

268
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,460
toting that imaginary gun,

269
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,040
filled with hate

270
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,080
and no slack?

271
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,800
Friends,

272
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,660
we can't take away your hate.

273
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,060
We wouldn't want to,

274
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,200
because it's part of what makes you you.

275
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,900
And probably wouldn't, well.

276
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,200
But friends,

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,640
we do want to give you slack,

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,060
because we've got more than we need.

279
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,460
Any of the excess, heck,

280
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
might as well just hand it on in.

281
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,540
Might as well just hand it in.

282
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,960
Might as well just go for it, friends.

283
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,640
Why not?

284
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,920
Why not?

285
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,860
We pay to play the human way.

286
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,980
Twist away the gates of steel.

287
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,820
But beyond this, are we numb?

288
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,880
We pay to play the human way.

289
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,940
Twist away the gates of steel.

290
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:50,680
Twist away the gates of steel.

291
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,560
Do we all leave without friendship,

292
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,560


293
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,560


294
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,560


295
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,560


296
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:58,940
this bluff boat of ours is normal,

297
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:58,940


298
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,220
self- numerator.

299
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,020
But what may I say?

300
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,040


301
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,440
I was a Mis Shout Yeah.

302
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,400
I'd woken up for a snack a little bit.

303
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,860
And my doctor would emotionally repeat that,

304
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:06,860


305
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,920
Twist away, now twist and show

306
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,940
The earth, it moves too slow

307
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,920
But the earth is all we know

308
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,900
We better play the human way

309
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,960
Twist away the gates of steel

310
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,460
A man is real, that's how he feels

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:42,420

Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

327
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,900
Part of the passive thermal control program to maintain temperatures.

328
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,260
When the sunlight shines through the blackness of space, it's black.

329
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,180
But I was in sunlight and I was able to look at this blackness.

330
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,440
I mean, what are you looking at?

331
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,500
Call it the universe, but it's the infinity of space and the infinity of time.

332
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,160
I'm looking at something called space that had no end and at time that has no meaning.

333
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,400
You can really focus on it because you've got this planet out there, this star called Earth,

334
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,520
which itself is in its blackness, but it is lit up because the sunlight strikes on an object,

335
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,420
strikes on something called Earth.

336
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,660
Now, these are the most new.

337
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,660
Remember, this is Cambridge, Massachusetts.

338
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,680
This is like around the corner from Harvard and MIT, and it's PC Central.

339
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,320
Right.

340
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,600
We'll use this phone line as a rotating line, then.

341
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,840
I think I have the right one.

342
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,620
Shall we rotate?

343
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:04,860
We?

344
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,880
Are you ready to rotate?

345
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Does one of us have to hold our phone in a weird position?

346
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,820
Off to the other cycle.

347
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,600
Okay.

348
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,760
Will I be able to reach you on board Dimension X later?

349
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,340
Yes.

350
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:15,940
Okay.

351
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,480
We will see you on the other side of the wheel with the deal.

352
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,940
We're about to get off, though.

353
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,960
She just got off.

354
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,280
Okay.

355
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,500
Oh, wow.

356
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
Well, that is certainly exciting.

357
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,240
There she goes.

358
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:24,660
Okay.

359
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,000
I always love watching them go down the little, they swirl around in all sorts of directions.

360
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,040
They're like flushing them.

361
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,580
Doesn't it?

362
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,200
Doesn't the direction?

363
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,000
Doesn't the direction in which you swirl depend on which hemisphere you're in?

364
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,480
That's right.

365
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:37,940
Yeah.

366
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,380
If you're in the western hemisphere, you do.

367
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,320
Except on Pluto.

368
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:41,900
Right.

369
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,620
No, except on Neptune, because Neptune is the north pole.

370
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,580
In the western hemisphere, P-Lo, you're flushed down, and in the eastern hemisphere, you

371
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,940
come spewing up out.

372
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,340
Yeah.

373
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,060
We're flushed out.

374
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,580
But Neptune's, the north pole angles straight towards the sun.

375
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:01,920
Yeah, so Polaris, the north star, also is right behind the honey dip, which is also

376
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,460
the guy that cleans the urinals.

377
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,920
And that's a ... And in the summertime, he works as the dwarf that cleans up behind the

378
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,160
elephants at Barnum and Bailey.

379
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,280
That's ... In the summertime, that is a really terrible job.

380
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,820
That's awful.

381
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,160
On Uranus, or on Neptune, I mean.

382
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,860
Well, yeah.

383
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,800
It's okay on Uranus, Dave.

384
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,180
It's very cool there.

385
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,620
It's very placid.

386
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,580
It's much like a place I used to visit when I was a 20-year-old child before I learned

387
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,500
... Is that a Friday boy?

388
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,120
... that weapons are not the answer.

389
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:28,440
Yep.

390
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,620
It's producer Friday.

391
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,500
Huh?

392
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,080
It's producer F-J.

393
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,440
It's motor Friday.

394
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,520
All right.

395
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,140
Now that we got you all on board.

396
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,660
The twice-martyred and twice-redeemed Friday Jones.

397
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,260
Yeah.

398
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,000
When Friday got up at this time last night, Friday thought that she had lost thousands

399
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,380
and thousands of dollars.

400
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,420
Not only for myself, but for my church as well.

401
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,600
Now, wait a minute.

402
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,580
You said you were doing something Saturday night.

403
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,160
What time are you doing something Saturday night?

404
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,320
At the Baptist church.

405
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,420
No, Friday night.

406
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,600
No, Saturday night.

407
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,140
No, Friday's doing it Saturday.

408
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,240
No, Friday is doing it Friday.

409
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:01,520


410
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,500
No, Friday is Friday.

411
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,500


412
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,280
I'm going to the church on Friday.

413
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,100
Oh, man.

414
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,660
At Starwood or at Starwoody.

415
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,620
I am not coming to Starwood.

416
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
You are going to Starwood.

417
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,540
You remember Ferdy Arbuckle and Hank Costello?

418
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,460
I can't get ...

419
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,600
Who's ...

420
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:12,800
Who's ...

421
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,700
Hey, Stang.

422
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,180
Yeah.

423
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,120
Hey, what ... You said you were doing something Saturday night?

424
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,580
No.

425
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, okay.

426
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,680
Never mind, then.

427
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
No, I'm going to ... I'm sleeping Saturday night.

428
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,900
Were you guys dating again?

429
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,820
Because I remember the last time you guys started hanging out together, it was really

430
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,220
weird.

431
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,880
No, I mean at Starwood, are you gigging Saturday night?

432
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,480
Yeah.

433
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,500
Apparently, Saturday night.

434
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,500


435
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,500


436
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:32,580
I think so.

437
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,280
What time?

438
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,900
They want to put me in the puffer dome with you guys because we're too noisy for the

439
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,500
drummers and the pagans.

440
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,940
Yeah, but they told ...

441
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,960
The subgeniuses make too much noise for the drummers and the pagans.

442
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,920
But they ask for that.

443
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,840
Too much noise for the Baptists, you have to know.

444
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,000
No, the Baptists ... Well, like I said, these are the Baptists that have the gay and lesbian

445
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,940
office in their church.

446
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,520
They have the African homeless drummer's office in their church.

447
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,480
In fact, I believe that the African drummer's church will be proposed.

448
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,440
They're performing not parallel to us, but they're supposed to be winding down as we

449
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,880
arrive and they're like, well, do you think you'll mind the noise?

450
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
And it's like, no, in fact, we'd like the drummers to come over and play with us for

451
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,940
a while.

452
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,500
That would be cool.

453
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,220
Absolutely.

454
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,880
That's the problem when you let people play with you in another dimension.

455
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,560
We'll exploit anyone.

456
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,920
But I think ESO is playing on the main stage Saturday night as well.

457
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,140
We're playing at the Hitler Drom.

458
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,480
It's this huge head that they carved out of alabaster.

459
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,320
I've performed with that head.

460
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,800
Yeah.

461
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,120
That big Hitler head.

462
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,560
Yeah.

463
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,860
We like to poke out the eyes, you know, as a little joke the three of us have.

464
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,120
They had a rug for a mustache.

465
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,540
That's how big that head was.

466
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,380
Well, the rug is actually a tongue too that rolls out and spits out people like us.

467
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,760
We're the detritus, the effluent, the flotsam.

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,020
The dandruff of the mighty head.

469
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,160
The plant.

470
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,400
Okay, enough of that.

471
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,020
Let's get back to radio theater.

472
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,240
Really, because this is very ...

473
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:57,620
What?

474
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,940
You think we were telling the truth?

475
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,720
Y'all, this stuff is all radio theater.

476
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,480
But, you know, the idea is that we're going to have a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

477
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,740
big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

478
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:02,740


479
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:02,740


480
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,520
But the idea is, what are they doing in America when they can censor a church like the Church

481
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:08,920
of the Shepherds?

482
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,560
Well, they, yeah.

483
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,500
Well, here's the funny thing about this particular censorship.

484
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,760
They're so PC that they were concerned that we would say something in such bad taste that

485
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,520
it would endanger freedom of speech in America, so they had to censor us to keep us from endangering

486
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,500
the First Amendment.

487
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,100
Once again, America kills the village.

488
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,200
That makes sense, yeah.

489
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,260
It's a shaving.

490
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,900
That makes as much sense as killing for peace.

491
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,640
Yes. Well, I'm into that myself. I believe that if we kill enough humans, there will be peace on Earth.

492
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:44,000
We kill enough Serbs. P-O-E. Yeah. Purity of essence. Deloyer. Yep.

493
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:50,420
And when the bell's tolled for whom it will be, it will be for us 53. Here comes everybody.

494
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,520
And then at the end of it all. Give me a gun. Here comes everybody.

495
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,880
At the end of it all, you climb up. We'll meet again at the end of that. Give me a trench coat.

496
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,060
Or die in a derp and that's what it is. We'll meet again. Don't know where, don't know when.

497
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,760
But I know we'll meet again one sunny day.

498
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,860
At the end of it all, you climb up that big tube, up that rail, right through that little portal.

499
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,440
It spits you out and there you are standing alone in the middle of that desert.

500
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,900
Just like the very end of THX 1138.

501
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,160
But the way things been going before we get spitted.

502
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,940
But you know, you won't be alone.

503
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,160
The other subgeniuses.

504
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,760
Will be climbing up out of that underworld.

505
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,840
Well actually how it'll work, I think is that as you emerge out of your hole,

506
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,460
all the other subgeniuses will emerge at the same instant out of their own holes.

507
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,600
Yeah, but they're all doing it from different movies.

508
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,140
So you might be doing it from THX 1138, for example.

509
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,780
But Dave will probably be doing a boy and his dog.

510
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,640
Yes, everybody.

511
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,720
So if I run over real quick to Dave's hole and jump in, I'll be in a boy and his dog world.

512
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,860
I'm going to have telepathic dog who will be my best friend and let me eat.

513
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,220
Eat women?

514
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,740
Yes.

515
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,740
I want to go live in Dave's movie.

516
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,660
You're moving the fabric and now we're transdimensional.

517
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,260
I want to live in Dave's mind.

518
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,360
I want to live in the Dave drone.

519
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,880
The giant Dave head.

520
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,720
One self.

521
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,520
One Dave.

522
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,340
One thought.

523
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,800
One thought.

524
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,720
One voice.

525
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,380
One tongue.

526
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,280
All that is one.

527
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,160
One is one.

528
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:16,920
One is one.

529
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,740
Dave is Dave.

530
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,440
All one.

531
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:18,900
Okay.

532
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,460
Okay.

533
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,140
Friends, tomorrow from your Sunday morning, you won't need a bone in your jelly bag.

534
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,460
Praise Bob.

535
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,320
Praise Bob.

536
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,880
Oh, here's another misconception about X Day, Sunday morning.

537
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,040
The misconception that you will be going back home.

538
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,120
That also is just as much a misconception as that you will die.

539
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,700
It's second.

540
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,800
My parents, if you have a total and complete faith in Bob Dobbs, you will be ruptured.

541
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,680
That's all there is to it.

542
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,080
So there.

543
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,440
I have had, and I'm sure you've, I mean, I've had people come up to me at this very event

544
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,860
going, hey, are you guys playing?

545
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,520
Are you planning to go back to Cleveland on Monday or Sunday night?

546
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,120
On the destiny of the power of the dark side.

547
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,740
On what night?

548
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,800
Did you say Sunday night?

549
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,580
Well, you know what I mean, man.

550
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,860
I know, I know, I know.

551
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
But you know what I mean.

552
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,780
Yes.

553
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,720
Well, that's what you know.

554
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,600
I don't like Monday morning, Dave.

555
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,580
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, Hosea 516.

556
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,240
Well, the escape vessels of the sex goddesses did not arrive.

557
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,440
I think we're very shocked.

558
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,040
I was shocked at that.

559
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,020
In fact, I got up on that very morning because I only get up at the crack of two.

560
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,440
And I got up that very morning because I was hung over after a 4th of July party.

561
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,100
Right.

562
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,600
Because I wanted to watch the end of the world come in my backyard.

563
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,160
And it didn't happen.

564
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
Well, it's like that voice in that seance tape.

565
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,080
Okay.

566
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,120
That you guys were just playing.

567
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,440
That said, come to me.

568
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,680
Are you sure it was saying, come to me?

569
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,800
What did you think it said?

570
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
I thought it said something like, turn me on, dead man.

571
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,020
But listen, last night I was hearing colors and seeing whispers.

572
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,680
And I wasn't even at y'all seance.

573
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,620
Okay.

574
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,780
Anyway, yeah.

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,840
I will admit that it was a little bit disappointing.

576
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,460
Disappointing for our, you know, for all of us in the Church of the Subgenius.

577
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,740
And I'm sure you too, Clyde.

578
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:34,980
Yeah.

579
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,300
To not be able to torture everyone who ever irritated you.

580
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,640
To not watch the destruction of the earth as Bob had promised.

581
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,180
Right.

582
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,540
You know, not to be ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses for an eternal salvation or triple your money.

583
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,200
But that blah, blah, woof, woof.

584
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,460
Tell me something.

585
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,580
It was a kind of a letdown, I'll admit.

586
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,680
But, you know.

587
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
Did that ever stop the Jehovah's Witnesses?

588
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,220
Did the fact that they predicted the world five times in a row and it didn't happen.

589
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,020
Have you seen any dearth of Jehovah's Witnesses coming to your door?

590
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,540
They're still coming to my door and I'm happy to talk to them.

591
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,000
You know, I believe in Jehovah too.

592
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,020
Yeah, that's true.

593
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,860
And they have great artwork in their pamphlets.

594
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,900
We're trying to, you know, competition.

595
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,580
But who cares, you know?

596
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,800
We're religious nuts.

597
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,280
Are we going to let?

598
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,780
The Jehovah's Witnesses be bigger religious nuts than us?

599
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:43,680
Are we going to let the God Salvation Temple, that little Chinese end of the world cult that thought the world was going to end here in Dallas on March 31st?

600
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,520
You know, are we going to be another?

601
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,000
Are we going to let the Heaven's Gate people beat us?

602
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:58,400
Speaking of Heaven's Gate, I mean, a lot of people thought that since you were saying that the rupture was going to happen and that the exaucers were going to come down and take all the.

603
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,560
The people up.

604
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:09,020
Didn't you think for one minute that anyone out there thought that your cult was going to die and you guys were all going to commit mass suicide in your little gathering in New York?

605
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,420
Oh, all kinds of people thought we were.

606
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,720
And the sad thing is they didn't do anything about it.

607
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,200
It was almost like they were thinking, well, good riddance.

608
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,120
Of course.

609
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,360
I mean, we're not like Heaven's.

610
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,420
The Heaven's Gate people.

611
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,300
They, you know, they had a few things right.

612
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,460
They were a little too lazy to spell Bob Dobbs name all the way out.

613
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,540
They couldn't make it all the way to Dobbs.

614
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,380
They just called him dough.

615
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,200
You know, they had some imposter doing the whole thing.

616
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,720
They had a.

617
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,720
Well, look at the Heaven's Gate.

618
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,580
They were against sex.

619
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,680
To begin with.

620
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,560
Right now, does that sound very serious?

621
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,620
Like, does that sound to you like they've been reading book of the subgenius?

622
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,880
No, because I know that you get sex.

623
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,340
If you are a subgenius, you get a lot of sex.

624
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,160
Well, Bob promises that.

625
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,680
Yeah, Bob has promised that.

626
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:57,840
Yes.

627
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,520
That's it.

628
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,840
That's one of the big promises.

629
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,600
If you just pay $30, right?

630
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,100
Yeah.

631
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,380
Yeah.

632
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:09,020
Well, anyway, this is all, you know, I mean, it's sure it's maybe the excess didn't happen.

633
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,360
You know, the X day and the rupture did not happen this year.

634
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,460
But, you know, there's a lot of fine print in our particular Bibles.

635
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,740
Book of the subgenius.

636
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,620
And the Apocryphon.

637
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,400
Yeah.

638
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:28,240
You know, if any of our people would ever bother to read their own Bibles, they might notice that there were actually numerous.

639
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Provisos.

640
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't know.

641
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,480
Everyone makes mistakes.

642
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,480
Thank you.

643
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,640
Thank you.

644
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,120
Thank you.

645
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,180
Let her go, Bob.

646
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,420
Whoa!

647
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,120
They say the bigger the headache, the bigger the pill, baby.

648
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,860
Not if I saw her now.

649
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,700
What?

650
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,620
What's the use of pretending?

651
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,960
I can't stand this anymore.

652
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,660
Chandler said you went over to Georgia Street to see that doctor.

653
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,960
Yeah, I tried, Ed.

654
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,120
Short visit.

655
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,060
Poor guy.

656
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,200
Pretty bad, huh?

657
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,500
Well, the guy's really a mess.

658
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,980
The beat and it walked up to the epileptic and said,

659
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,820
Oh, I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

660
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,720
I hope you like that nonsense.

661
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,080
I try to make the audience a part of the entertainment,

662
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,320
and they go along with it all just great.

663
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,940
That chatter with the doctor,

664
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,220
there is no phony bit, really.

665
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,600
It's just the way it happened.

666
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,900
Make me take off my clothes and make me go out normal,

667
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,460
and I have to go outside and change before I come here.

668
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,140
Do you love your parents?

669
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,160
Yeah, I love them, but they're...

670
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,280
In culture schools across the land,

671
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,880
mere infants are taught all about contraceptive techniques

672
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,220
and are provided with a plastic phallus in the classroom.

673
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,940
I really like it.

674
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,420
I like the idea of having music in the classroom.

675
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,740
What was that?

676
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,520
Did one of you idiots in the back row just cut one?

677
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,460
Ha, ha, ha!

678
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,640
Up in the morning and out to school

679
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,180
The teacher is teaching the whole new

680
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,100
American history and practical math

681
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,820
You study them hard and open the plan

682
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,560
Working your fingers right down to the bone

683
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,420
Ha, ha, ha!

684
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,200
The guy behind you won't leave you alone

685
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,180
Ha, ha, ha!

686
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,460
I'd like to be your buddy

687
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,640
Be invited to your house

688
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,920
But all your parents think I'm just a stinky little house

689
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,220
People think I'm the life of the party

690
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,240
Cause I tell a joke or three

691
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,640
Ha, ha, ha!

692
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,520
It's not easy being evil

693
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,700
And evil's what I be

694
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,940
Ha, ha, ha!

695
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,720
студiuubl-e, ha, ha, ha!

696
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,860
Edi your pack on da

697
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,040
Hey, girl, sell your money

698
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,700
.....

699
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,260
Cant' stand it

700
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,980
I've got a super凴

701
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,900
Hi, kill the zoo

702
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,740
Now, the beat is fire

703
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,900
I don't know many people that are that serious.

704
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,360
We lose brothers and sisters every day that we've never known.

705
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,480
And, you know, we will know them one day and see them again.

706
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,000
But yes.

707
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,220
We must get off.

708
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,400
We must get off.

709
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,340
We must get off.

710
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,860
Persecution is the lot of the believer.

711
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,380
If you're not being persecuted, you have to wonder why.

712
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,100
Amen. Amen.

713
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,320
We must get off.

714
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,160
We must get off.

715
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,460
The last Earth radio just went off the air.

716
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,400
That means the war is over and Earth is finished.

717
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,220
I'd just like to tell you that you've, you know, you helped, you know,

718
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,340
you've flipped my world over.

719
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:39,140
And the thing we haven't mentioned tonight is Double X Day,

720
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,900
July 4th weekend there at Brushwood,

721
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,180
when I believe, Dave, I think you've been rousted from your seat.

722
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:52,780
And we're going to be strapping in Katahdin Lagoon into a lawn chair.

723
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,060
What? We're going to, we decide to launch Lagoon?

724
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,140
I think that's it.

725
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,940
Yes, I also agreed with it because.

726
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,740
That's damn time.

727
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,300
He's pretty damn heavy.

728
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,560
You're going to need a lot to launch him.

729
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,940
Well, between him and Mo, between me and Mo, we got a few, a few hundred pounds of thrust.

730
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,400
The Stooges are going to be there.

731
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,860
You're going to.

732
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,580
Larry, Mo and Curly are going to launch Katahdin Lagoon into space.

733
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,480
Mo Musgrave.

734
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,160
And they're going to sing 1999.

735
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:16,920
Okay.

736
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,600
It'll be Iggy.

737
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,620
It'll be like have his head shaved and stuff looking like Curly.

738
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,140
Mo Musgrave.

739
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,480
Yeah.

740
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,100
Dr. Mojo?

741
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:23,700
Yeah.

742
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,960
Dr. Mojo is a rocketeer?

743
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,860
Indeed he is.

744
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,580
I didn't know that.

745
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,620
Man, he's got bigger motors than I do.

746
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
I'm telling you, Sting, these guys now, they're weird ass.

747
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,680
We've been, the two.

748
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,920
Straw hats and everything.

749
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,720
They got them big moves.

750
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,140
The motors that they see are always bigger.

751
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,360
The two of us have been.

752
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
Weird little testicles.

753
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,840
I mean, bi-flocals.

754
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,040
The two of us have been.

755
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,700
Making notes and everything.

756
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,160
I've been emailing back and forth.

757
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,160


758
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,160


759
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,160


760
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,160


761
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,280
And actually the two of us has been conspiring daily on the arsenal that will be presented

762
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,060
for worship at XX Day.

763
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,760
I think they definitely would have shot guys like you at a school.

764
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,580
Or maybe, no, you guys would have been the shooters.

765
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,080
That's right.

766
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,460
The Killer of the Class of 53.

767
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,180
Dad, what are you doing here?

768
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,760
Reading about this Edison character.

769
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,120
They won't let me in the big people library downtown.

770
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,360
There was some unpleasantness.

771
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,200
I can never go back.

772
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,140
Excuse me, are you a student at this school?

773
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,380
I think it's pretty obvious that I am.

774
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,880
Go school?

775
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,520
I can't believe I ate the whole thing.

776
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,960
Hehehehe.

777
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,720
Activities?

778
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,140
None.

779
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,060
Sports?

780
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,200
None.

781
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,360
Honors?

782
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,320
None.

783
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,960
So many memories.

784
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,840
Time to go to the reunion.

785
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,880
It'll be great to see the old gang again.

786
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,880
Patsy, Ralph Malf, the Fonz.

787
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,240
That was happy days.

788
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,980
No, they weren't all happy days.

789
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,860
Like the time Pinky Tuskadero crashed her motorcycle.

790
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,360
Or the night I lost all my money to those card sharks and my dad, Tom Bosley, had to get

791
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,700
it back.

792
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,940
Well, you have to teach, aren't you?

793
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,760
Yes.

794
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,920
What do you teach?

795
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,460
English.

796
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,900
Well, I never was better than any student.

797
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,040
This is my chance to thank you all for the most wonderful year of my life, in which you

798
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,240
all took such an important part, with your hospitality, friendship, and smile.

799
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,120
It was a year full of experiences for me, of which the best was meeting you all.

800
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,980
Hope I'll see you all again sometime.

801
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,700
We'll give you life a living hell for the rest of the semester.

802
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:44,900
Thank you.

803
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:44,900


804
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:44,900


805
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,180
See ya, ma'am.

806
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,120
Bye.

807
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,800
Bye-bye.

808
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


809
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


810
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


811
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


812
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


813
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


814
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


815
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


816
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:51,800


817
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:51,900


818
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,180
What's the matter, Lisa?

819
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,360
You used to be such a good student.

820
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,920
Don't you want to please your teachers and get good grades?

821
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,160
Grades?

822
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,140
We need something to protect this family.

823
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,240
I couldn't agree more, Marjorie.

824
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,900
You deserve peace of mind, and peace of mind is what you shall have.

825
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,880
Love you.

826
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,140
to buy your deadliest gun, please?

827
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,700
Aisle 6, next to the sympathy cards.

828
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,640
Hmm.

829
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,460
Hmm.

830
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,960
Whoa, careful there, Annie Oakley.

831
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,240
I don't have to be careful.

832
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,000
I got a gun.

833
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,380
Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit,

834
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,220
holster,

835
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:28,760
Oh, yeah.

836
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,700
bandolier,

837
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,240
bandolier.

838
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,360
silencer,

839
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,080
Mm-hmm.

840
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,800
loudener,

841
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,680
speed cocker.

842
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,060
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

843
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,900
And this is for shooting down police helicopters.

844
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,940
Oh, I don't need anything like that.

845
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,080
Yeah.

846
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,600
Just give me my gun.

847
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,340
Sorry, the law requires a five-day waiting period.

848
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,520
We've got to run a background check.

849
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,600
Five days?

850
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,900
But I'm mad now.

851
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:52,700
Yeah.

852
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,860
I'd kill you if I had my gun.

853
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,320
Yeah, well, you don't.

854
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,560
That's a big ship.

855
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,280
She's so big because he's got a lot of guns.

856
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,980
If he didn't have any guns, I'd show him a thing or two.

857
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm going to go off into my store.

858
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,000
Then we'll see who's worried about five-day waiting period.

859
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,100
I hope we'llven up our sleep,

860
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,780
You're super mascara crazy.

861
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,740
Did you Нов meg confusion Goneez you,

862
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,740
ㅠ

863
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,600
Ow!

864
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,740
Damn, that's gunfire out there.

865
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,660
Is the NRA convention starting early or something?

866
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,140
Oh, no.

867
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,760
It's our own deadly American gun culture rebounding on us.

868
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,440
Quick, kids, get down.

869
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,900
No, no, not behind the tables.

870
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,640
Those aren't big enough to protect us.

871
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,260
Here, hide behind my purse so we can all fit.

872
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,380
Oh, Jesus.

873
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,260
Oh, sweet.

874
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,380
Jesus, as if a mutant doesn't have a tough enough time of it surviving

875
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,260
in these IV-covered institutional hellholes.

876
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,060
Now we're all dodging hot lead, too.

877
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,980
Just what the hell's going on here?

878
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,840
Hey, hey, you back there, stop praying.

879
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,980
This is a school.

880
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,580
Yeah, a school.

881
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,600
Boring, uneventful school.

882
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,860
You shouldn't have to die just to get out.

883
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:13,860


884
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,780
Get an education.

885
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,400
What's going on here?

886
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,140
Children, the times, they are becoming quite different.

887
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,500
Attention, everyone.

888
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,920
This is Principal Skinner.

889
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,420
I trust you all remembered to bring in your implements of destruction.

890
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,600
Now let's trash this dump.

891
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,140
Oh, Santa!

892
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,760
Santa!

893
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,020
Santa!

894
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,340
Santa!

895
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,860
Santa!

896
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


897
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


898
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


899
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


900
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


901
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


902
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


903
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:43,860


904
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,720
Santa!

905
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,980
Somebody put a torch to these permanent records.

906
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,120
Quickly now.

907
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,080
Wake up, boy.

908
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,300
Oh, I don't know who's the last day of school.

909
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,360
Well, it is.

910
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,480
Oh, how do I know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?

911
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,460
I'd like to welcome you to this year's freshman senior party.

912
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,580
I hope you all have a good time.

913
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,480
So now we'll go on with the entertainment.

914
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,780
You could call it entertainment.

915
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,380
Yes, Eke Tolos Picati Mundum and then the Mushroom Cloud shortly after is a whiff of excreted gas.

916
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,720
That's what will be happening.

917
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,140
Mushroom Cloud on pizza is pretty good.

918
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,140
It's just our way.

919
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,400
It's a white thing.

920
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,500
You wouldn't understand.

921
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,300
Right now I'm running.

922
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,760
That's why I have such a hard time with it.

923
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,720
As you know, it's quite off.

924
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,320
I'm running calculations on how much flash powder we can pack into the nose cone.

925
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,700
It sounds like a bunch of stupid drug talk to me.

926
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,860
How much white powder we can stuff in the nose cone.

927
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,980
That went out in the 80s, man.

928
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,640
No, he's talking about black powder.

929
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,000
Huh?

930
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,980
We're talking about flash powder here.

931
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,120
I wonder if you saw.

932
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,640
Switch that around.

933
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,480
Let's talk drug talk, but really be meaning rocketry.

934
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,960
Well, I'm sorry.

935
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,420
How much flash powder can you get from 10 pounds of frog?

936
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:23,900
Right.

937
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm going to go out this weekend and snort a bunch of lines.

938
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,580
I got two big lines I'm going to be snorting.

939
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,500
Two J-lines this weekend.

940
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,740
Okay, what's a J-line?

941
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,040
I forgot.

942
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,300
Now, the J-line is the one that pulls your moon pants off.

943
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,140
A J-line has 100 pounds of thrust.

944
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,800
So when you run up, when you run up that needle.

945
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:43,380
Right.

946
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,840
How high does it make you?

947
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,900
Now, that really means how far do you put the fuse up into the motor?

948
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,300
Because on composite motors, you have to get the fuse all the way to the top.

949
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,320
So now that again sounds like hot dog.

950
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,420
That's what you're talking about.

951
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,660
It sounds like you want to shave your head and take one of them little trepanation drills

952
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,120
and just pop your skull right open and stick a hole in there and run it around a little bit.

953
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,220
And kids out there, please don't do this.

954
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,480
I know you're anxious to do something, anything you hear.

955
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,580
But don't trepanate yourself.

956
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,100
No.

957
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,680
Snarting a line really means...

958
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,900
Leave that to professionals.

959
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,380
Snarting a line really means launch the launch itself because it leaves that trail of white smoke.

960
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,360
The doctors will launch the rocket up your nose.

961
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:32,560
And when they say they're smoking the froth, that means what they're doing is assembling their igniters together for the launching.

962
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,960
If you're going to check your lighter, it means you're checking your igniter.

963
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,240
And when they say they're going to commit the illegal sodomy act,

964
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,240
that means that they're really getting ready to clean up the smudge, the powder burns.

965
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,780
No, the bristles from the orifice.

966
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,560
You always, after you smudge the pooter pen, you always have to clean the bristles from the orifice or else you have an exploding syndrome.

967
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,800
When they say they're going to mass murder the fellow students,

968
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:04,500
what that really means is we're going to set up the swag table and sell pamphlets and church books.

969
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,100
But what it submonically means is underneath, when you hear your boon pants fumbling, it means the SWAT.

970
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,660
And that's when the SWAT team is coming in to remove you of your life essence.

971
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,880
When they say they're going to drop some acid, they really mean they're going to drop some acid.

972
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,180
Yeah, but hydrochloric acid.

973
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,320
Right, into the nose cone.

974
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:30,420
No, when you drop the acid, that's when you put the parachute in and actually strap the rocket to the launch rod.

975
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,580
That's what Dr. Leary always used to say.

976
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:38,940
Oh, listen, speaking of outer space and criminal acts, they go together.

977
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,480
Have you heard about the new conspiracy of giant X-con trails in the sky?

978
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,440
Oh, yes, of course I have. You know that.

979
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,080
Such as the famous one that we saw at X-Day.

980
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,940
Well, Dave always knows them first because Dave talks about them on here and we don't know what he's talking about.

981
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,720
And then two weeks later we go, oh, did you hear this?

982
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,380
And Dave already knew.

983
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,580
He was trying to tell us this two weeks ago and we thought he was crazy and just yammering on.

984
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,940
No, no, I knew what he was talking about.

985
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,120
I am a spam addict.

986
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,980
You know, they're now referring it to spam like psychoball.

987
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:08,740
Totally useless.

988
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,140
Psych, you know, conspiratorial information.

989
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,020
The film is a spam addict, you aren't that bad.

990
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,240
You saw them in X-Day where they were actually, that means you guys were being doped.

991
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,560
Right, exactly.

992
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:26,660
There was a giant X made of con trails over Sherman at 6.30 in the morning on July 5th, 1998.

993
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,060
Yeah, I saw that on the video.

994
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,720
Right.

995
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,340
Skyriders and just to be jets that...

996
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,500
That has been captured.

997
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,340
You ought to send that into Most Amazing Video Show or something.

998
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,840
Well, we saw, we also saw an X.

999
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,840
And con trails over Arkansas on our way driving up.

1000
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,520
The Dallas contingent did.

1001
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:51,920
Now, what Dave has since pointed out is that those con trails actually are all over the country and seen from outer space.

1002
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,920
They form a grid of X's.

1003
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:05,320
Which, since the government has to have those X's in the sky in order to track their weather modification and health modification experiments.

1004
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,960
But where are the, who makes the O's?

1005
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,580
Yeah, it's a massive.

1006
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,760
The information grid of X's, the way it looks.

1007
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,540
Dave, you know who makes the O's?

1008
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,420
They blow them.

1009
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,200
They're out there smoking their froth in their saucers and they blow their smoke ring.

1010
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:24,500
Well, that really means that they launched an air-to-surface missile.

1011
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,380
Right.

1012
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,280
Loaded with anthrax.

1013
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,820
Right.

1014
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,700
And little spider web types throughout.

1015
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,380
War in the Middle East.

1016
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,540
War against the Middle East.

1017
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,920
War in the Middle East really means that they've landed two more probes.

1018
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:46,240
No, that means that somebody connected Church of the Subgenius with mass murderers on NPR.

1019
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,080
And showed it.

1020
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,260
You know, a group of retard agents with very little to do.

1021
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,380
Come on, they're looking for anyone.

1022
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,940
They blame Marilyn Manson for it.

1023
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,800
Now, get this.

1024
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,120
This is a direct quote.

1025
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:06,340
When my friend Jesus Christ first heard the news about the massacre at the high school,

1026
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,360
the first thing he heard was,

1027
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,540
and I quote,

1028
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,980
you know, newsflash,

1029
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,860
15 students were apparently killed in a bloody massacre at a high school.

1030
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,760
The internet has not yet been,

1031
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,040
you know, the internet connection has not yet been discovered.

1032
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,260
Now, that worries me because

1033
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,400
in the old days, whenever there was a mass murder,

1034
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:29,960
they would say,

1035
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,060
we have not yet found a connection to the Church of the Subgenius.

1036
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,160
Well, now they say we have not yet found a connection to the internet.

1037
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,740
The Church must take over the internet more quickly.

1038
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,160
Yeah, we've been outpaced.

1039
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,420
And, of course, the Satanists remain our main scapegoat and decoy, I guess.

1040
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,080
And Jerry Fuzzy paints a very hoarse picture of Marilyn Manson,

1041
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,260
but he doesn't realize that he was a Christian boy,

1042
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,580
one of those people who had Christianity pumped into his,

1043
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,200
sodomistically into his areas.

1044
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,700
And that appears to be the old medieval thing where those guys...

1045
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:01,860
Yikes, yikes.

1046
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,780
Marilyn Manson sodomized a bunch of areas?

1047
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,580
Of course.

1048
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,840
With bundles of twine.

1049
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,540
That's the only way to get it back.

1050
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:08,740
That really means...

1051
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:08,740


1052
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,060
It means taking the wires to the ignition box

1053
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,600
and leaving them out a few yards to the...

1054
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,580
Have you ever had your body flossed?

1055
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,060
Yeah, that's...

1056
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,320
That's a medieval thing, too.

1057
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,020
We're all getting them flossed nowadays.

1058
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,220
Yeah, they run that...

1059
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,600
Where you put the swallow, the one end of the floss,

1060
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,900
and then when it comes out about six hours later,

1061
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,420
you just yank back and forth.

1062
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:27,780
Right.

1063
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,140
But they're going to come up with a real long piece of floss.

1064
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,940
The ergot ones will be just...

1065
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,440
Well, you use a rope, actually.

1066
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,080
Speaking of rages, you know, once they start foaming at the mouth,

1067
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,720
where are we going to get them?

1068
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,260
We're going to keep them like the albino refugees.

1069
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,600
You've got your Indian them now.

1070
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:42,860
Are you talking...

1071
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,440
Dave, are you talking about the madness that comes from eating the ergot rotted bread?

1072
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,920
Yes, since we're going to be all medieval pretty soon,

1073
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,800
we might as well start, you know, living middle-age-style,

1074
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,940
get ox carts and that.

1075
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,020
I was thinking, I don't know.

1076
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,380
Well, because of the Y2K bug sending us back in time to the 1990s?

1077
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,940
No, it just appears everybody's kind of gone more nuts than me,

1078
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,080
which kind of scares me.

1079
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,520
You know, I know what you mean, Dave.

1080
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,560
The other day...

1081
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,460
You know, it's almost like when subgeniuses,

1082
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,580
seem like the most sane people around.

1083
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,640
Out of the babes of mouse.

1084
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,200
What is this world coming to?

1085
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:12,720
Yeah.

1086
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,320
Yeah, that's it.

1087
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,180
Dr. Legume, the other day, said to me,

1088
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,500
you know, I knew that the end times were here

1089
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,220
when I realized that I was most frequently the voice of reason.

1090
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:23,960
I don't understand.

1091
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,440
What kind of points of culmination or whatever would you give to a subgenius

1092
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,240
who, you know, just feels so bad about everything that's going on?

1093
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,820
Just everything seems so stupid.

1094
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,840
Oh, we'd tell them to...

1095
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,340
About the only thing that'd make you feel any better is to, like,

1096
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,340
like a new Bob shirt.

1097
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,420
Or the new X-Day video.

1098
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,100
Double X-Day.

1099
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,180
X-Day 98 video.

1100
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,080
Wait, like, don't go bomb your school.

1101
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,600
Buy a damn shirt for crying out loud.

1102
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,060
Well, you know, that is exactly it.

1103
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,560
Those kids, aside from their poor timing,

1104
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,800
they're 65 days early with X-Day.

1105
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,500
But the message, the kids, those kids who are lost,

1106
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,880
their questions are, they're flooding their minds,

1107
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,220
and they need to have that...

1108
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,140
They need a walk-in full of ESO.

1109
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,220
Yeah, they need to wallow into the solid rocket fuel.

1110
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,040
They need to go and smoke the pipe of Bob.

1111
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,360
And they need to be there so they can buy some ESO

1112
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,280
and listen to that kind of music,

1113
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,160
because the music they're listening to is making their souls sick.

1114
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:18,780
It is.

1115
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,800
It is making them kill in the wrong way.

1116
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,800
And they need to listen to our music.

1117
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,000
We're telling...

1118
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,820
What we really mean is to...

1119
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,680
What that really means is love the normals.

1120
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,040
That's right.

1121
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,520
Until they have...

1122
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,020
Until they say nothing but Bob...

1123
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,840
This is a love cult, man.

1124
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,280
Yeah, man.

1125
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,220
They're thinking up and down.

1126
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,420
Yeah.

1127
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,100
You don't have children with them.

1128
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,140
Don't give them...

1129
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,640
Fertilize them, but love them.

1130
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,520
You know, don't...

1131
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,220
Do not give them up.

1132
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,120
Love them with the...

1133
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,340
Love them with the crooked DNAs you're going to be spreading.

1134
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,500
And when we say, take a pipe bomb to school,

1135
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,460
we're talking about a bag full of pipes.

1136
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,800
Free pipes.

1137
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,100
The smoke, the kind that you smoke out of.

1138
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,080
Yeah, a bomb pipe.

1139
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,680
A pipe bomb.

1140
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,860
Like you da bomb.

1141
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,980
Right, like you da bomb, man.

1142
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,400
We've been talking about pipe bombs all along.

1143
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:06,840
You da pipe bomb.

1144
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,940
You mean idiot kids.

1145
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,240
It's like, I thought for sure they'd know we meant, you know,

1146
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,300
those things that they normally use for smoking stuff like marijuana.

1147
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,420
Yeah, you're supposed to...

1148
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,280
We're trying to wean them off of that and off of bullets and hate

1149
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,280
and turn them on to love, man.

1150
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,100
That's what this...

1151
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:24,900
It's a religion.

1152
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,080
It's Bob's religion.

1153
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,980
Bob and Connie.

1154
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,120
Bob is love.

1155
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,520
A sort of a pan flushing.

1156
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,760
And Connie is...

1157
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,120
You sure?

1158
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,420
You brought fluid, you brought sex.

1159
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,080
Yeah.

1160
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,100
You know, if this rubric fluid starts moving funny,

1161
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:37,980
what are you going to do?

1162
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,500
The first thing, you don't want to kill mom, you don't want to kill dad.

1163
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,780
Well, I don't know.

1164
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,640
Well...

1165
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,000
Well...

1166
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,520
Kill.

1167
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,240
Kill.

1168
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:45,880
Kill.

1169
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,860
Yeah, Dave, speak for yourself.

1170
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:49,240
Yeah, well, Friday, she's into that, though.

1171
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,540
What, killing mom and dad?

1172
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,360
Yeah, she...

1173
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:51,660
Oh, yeah.

1174
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,500
Well, the good Friday is into the holocaustal kill stuff,

1175
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:59,260
and the bad Friday is into the evangelical love stuff.

1176
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,180
Well, which side do I get best on?

1177
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,160
It depends on whether you take the Jekyll or the Hyde, man.

1178
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,160
I don't like to get hit.

1179
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,880
I like smooching.

1180
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,240
I've got some Hyders.

1181
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:07,960
I've got some Hyders.

1182
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,660
And I've got some Jekyllers.

1183
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,680
I think you get the backside of Friday.

1184
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,980
Do you have some more rowers?

1185
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,080
A gun is not a weapon, Marge.

1186
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,160
It's a tool, like a butcher knife or a harpoon or an alligator.

1187
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,160
You just need more education on this subject.

1188
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,680
Tell you what, you come with me to an NRA meeting,

1189
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,320
and if you still don't think guns are great,

1190
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,420
I'll argue some more.

1191
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:41,120
Ladies and gentlemen of the NRA, the M-boy Dukes.

1192
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:41,900
Hit it.

1193
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,600
I'm not a juvenile delinquent.

1194
00:53:47,500 --> 00:54:01,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not a juvenile delinquent.

1195
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,880
Who are you?

1196
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,760
Who are you?

1197
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,360
Who are you?

1198
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Just do the thing that's right

1199
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,840
And you'd do nothing wrong

1200
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,340
Life would be so nice

1201
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,180
You'd be in paradise

1202
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,640
I know, I know

1203
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,180
Because I'm not a juvenile

1204
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:24,700
Oh, listen, girls and boys

1205
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,880
You need not be blue

1206
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,580
Life is what you make of it

1207
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,500
It all depends on you

1208
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,700
I know, I know

1209
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,200
Because I'm not a juvenile

1210
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,020
Wait a minute, that's Ted Nugent on guitar.

1211
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,620
That guy's a notorious nut.

1212
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,800
Oh, man.

1213
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,520
There's no way out of this.

1214
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,620
I've never seen such recklessness.

1215
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,140
Are you some kind of moron?

1216
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,100
Yeah, but...

1217
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,760
Hey, guts.

1218
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,460
Guns aren't toys.

1219
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,220
They're for family protection.

1220
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,600
Hunting dangerous or delicious animals.

1221
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,760
Keeping the King of England out of your face.

1222
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,020
A lot of people are stroking guns.

1223
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,300
Also, it has been brought to my attention

1224
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,040
that a number of you are stroking guns.

1225
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,280
Therefore, I will step aside and open up the floor.

1226
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,620
Oh, thank you.

1227
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,300
Thank you.

1228
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,840
And a special thank you to Clyde Lewis

1229
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,080
of Ground Zero in Salt Lake City.

1230
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:27,000
We ran some tape from that self-same talk show.

1231
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,040
And thanks, of course, to ESO, Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

1232
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
on WCSB in Cleveland,

1233
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,640
whose radio show a whole lot of that came from.

1234
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,080
And a special, special, special, special thanks

1235
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,340
to Reverend Susie the Flusie at WREK in Atlanta

1236
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,500
for that amazing collage.

1237
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,380
And that's only a fraction of what she put together

1238
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,180
in her Get the Hell Out of School special.

1239
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,920
This background music is Tramapoline.

1240
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:57,480
Tramapoline.

1241
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,300
That Feller Phil.

1242
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,120
Jones.

1243
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,320
In Sedalia, Missouri.

1244
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,080
Okay, friends.

1245
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,620
I'm out of here.

1246
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,260
I'm going to bed.

1247
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,120
I'm going to bed.

1248
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,320
And soon there's more shoving

1249
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,220
Rocks, leaps, and guns

1250
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,840
And the floor is on

1251
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,480
Kill and kill

1252
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,200
Destroyed

1253
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,520
It happened so quickly

1254
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,420
It's already over in the sequence of events

1255
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,560
Let the world keep turning

1256
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,260
It won't make more sense

1257
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,360
We can keep on learning

1258
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,000
In the sequence of events

1259
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,960
Hope you're learning something

1260
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,940
Well, I was hoping the same thing about you

1261
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,980
So, Herman, has the large-type edition

1262
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,380
of this month's Soldier of Fortune come in yet?

1263
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:00,460
Not yet.

1264
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,480
Not yet.

1265
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:01,480


1266
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:01,480


1267
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:01,480


1268
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,920
Can I interest you in some authentic

1269
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,520
mat-seat underpants?

1270
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,080
No!

1271
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,360
Actually, we came over because I want you to meet my grandson, Bart.

1272
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:09,640
Huh.

1273
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,280
Hello, young American.

1274
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,620
Jeez, man, you scared the hell out of me.

1275
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,620
Quick, get down here behind the purse with everybody else.

1276
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,720
Oh.

1277
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,680
Oh, man, it's even worse than we thought.

1278
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,700
I got a glimpse of them.

1279
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,660
They're us.

1280
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,400
They're us.

1281
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,880
It's the mutants killing the mutants.

1282
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,660
What the hell is going on here?

1283
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:36,600
But recently, everybody's noticing

1284
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,220
Janie's acting very strangely, indeed

1285
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,200
She's been hanging around with the toughest kids at school

1286
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:57,300
And the devil, what hasn't she been experimenting with?

1287
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:58,620
Don't

1288
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,380
Janie, I'm about ready to check.

1289
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,440
Don't stink an alphabet.

1290
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,160
Huh?

1291
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,840
Lisa, what are you doing?

1292
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,720
That's a bad girl bathroom.

1293
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,360
Adore you.

1294
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,700
You want to egg Skinner's car?

1295
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,540
Okay.

1296
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,180
What are you looking at?

1297
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,020
Nothing.

1298
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,840
Then get out, because we're figuring out stuff to egg.

1299
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,000
Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off,

1300
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,480
I suggest you attack the one thing.

1301
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,340
He truly believes in.

1302
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,880
But theirs will be a swift and terrible end.

1303
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,500
Many will follow their evil teachings,

1304
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,340
that there is nothing wrong with sexual sin.

1305
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,880
A place where beneath the surface of the carefree play

1306
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,400
and routine school activity,

1307
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,120
girls who are no longer children, but not yet women,

1308
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,840
are caught up in a whirlpool of their emotions.

1309
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,080
It tells the story of that delicate time in a girl's life

1310
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,140
when genuine affection, the intrigue of youth,

1311
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,420
and secret longing can erupt in an explosion

1312
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,680
of a strange and dangerous love.

1313
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,760
And Bobby's with his scout troop.

1314
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,660
Muffy's playing tennis.

1315
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,680
No one gets to play with Zorak.

1316
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,320
Zorak is a menace.

1317
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,880
Susie's at the shopping mall,

1318
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,000
hanging with her schoolies.

1319
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,480
No one gets to hang with Zorak.

1320
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,060
He's just too unruly.

1321
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,340
It's not easy being evil,

1322
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,600
but evil's what I be.

1323
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1324
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,200
Grandpa, I think this guy's a little nuts.

1325
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,120
Oh, yeah?

1326
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,460
Well, General George, that Patton was a little nuts.

1327
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,100
And this guy is completely out of his mind.

1328
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,740
We can't fail!

1329
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,900
Has to suck that question!

1330
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,600
Has to suck that question!

1331
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,420
Has to cycle back!

1332
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,940
Go!

1333
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,460
I'm all gone

1334
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,780
I can't circle back

1335
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,820
I can't circle back

1336
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,660
I can't circle back

1337
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,580
I can't circle back

1338
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,620
I can't circle back

1339
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,560
I can't circle back

1340
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,320
I can't circle back

1341
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,420
No matter where you go

1342
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,260
You're somewhere I don't want you to be

1343
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,840
Watch out for them Albano recluses

1344
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,940
They're everywhere now

1345
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,300
We've met some of them
