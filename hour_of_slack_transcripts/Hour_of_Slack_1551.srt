1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,020
Yes, sir. Yes, I understand. Goodbye.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,980
He says he's pretty sure this isn't sabotage.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,060
That he thinks there's something far more terrible than that in back of it.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,420
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,580
But why did they come here?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,540
Well, they're not friendly, we're sure of that.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,100
No matter what the cost, it must be destroyed.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,380
Oh, this is my kind of time of life.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,560
This is my way of living.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,680
Little shack in wisteria, Ohio, surrounded by...

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,120
What's that about?

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,740
And welcome back.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:55,460
Well, we're here and continuing this exalted special post-X-Day broadcast.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,080
Is Dr. Drummond still there?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,780
He had to go and...

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,360
Oh, likely story. What a pathetic excuse.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,320
Hal was wondering about a formula that was written at the bottom of my X-Day schedule.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,260
I was just wondering what that was all about.

19
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,720
It's a way of measuring a certain type of quality of X-Day.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,920
For instance, in the old days when we had a swimming pool to work with,

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,080
and more people...

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,520
In there.

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,740
You would have more exposed female breasts than at other X-Days.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,600
And say there were 15 ladies who got in without a shirt.

25
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,900
This is all very...

26
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,700
Okay, this is crude and dumb and sexist, all right?

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,740
But it is a formula.

28
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,720
Say if there were 15 topless ladies, that would be a 30T X-Day.

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,980
If one of them was an Amazon, it might be a 20T.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,060
29T X-Day.

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,400
This year's X-Day was only a 6T X-Day.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,900
Because that was the number of nipples visible in the baptism.

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Yes, it's the number of nipples visible in the baptism of girls.

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,700
I didn't realize you kept score about that.

35
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,840
We didn't until about two hours ago,

36
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
when Philo and I...

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,940
Philo invented that formula.

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,320
You think I would come up with that kind of juvenile,

39
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,640
J. June, sophomoric nonsense?

40
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,080
Furthermore, you realize this is...

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,980
But I will report on it.

42
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,980
Furthermore, you realize this is not good advertising for it.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,460
You're telling all the people out there that,

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,060
hey, you know what?

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
You don't get to see as many titties as you used to.

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,300
That's because...

47
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,420
What you should be telling them is that you're going to see more than ever

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,960
each year that goes by.

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,460
Well, there were more this year than last year, that's for sure.

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,220
Well, if Bob says it, it must be true.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I don't think that's right either, Stan.

52
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,020
My memory for these things is fairly good.

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,340
I think last year would have trumped this year.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,480
To tell the truth...

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,220
There were far more than six.

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,420
That is the silliest thing I have ever heard.

57
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,180
I was there.

58
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,400
I took photos.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
I can prove it.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,520
Now, Princess Mia's...

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,240
So how many nipples were there then, actually?

62
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,640
Oh, there were far, far more than just...

63
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,980
Right, but they weren't all visible.

64
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,240
This is the number of visible...

65
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,420
And they didn't all belong to females.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Invisible nipples don't count, I suppose.

67
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,200
Right, exactly.

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
They're not real nipples because they're invisible.

69
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,740
That would be a strange thing.

70
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,580
You have six nipples.

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,420
Oh, it's just because the woman had a shirt on that was wet

72
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,100
and revealed every contour.

73
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,780
That doesn't count.

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,740
Why bother?

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,460
I kind of wonder.

76
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,240
That doesn't count.

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,060
She won the wet t-shirt contest.

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,420
Yeah, she ended up covered with...

79
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,380
We call it walnut oil.

80
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,140
Yeah, whatever it really is.

81
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:53,820
Everyone does.

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,520
Does anybody really believe that for a second, that that is walnut oil?

83
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,200
Has anybody thought to get that stuff tested?

84
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,840
I don't...

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,160
No, I took some samples from the pond this time,

86
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,920
and our host, Charlene, said,

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,220
well, those aren't walnuts.

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,980
Uh-oh.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,720
What were they?

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,280
They're baby candier tadpoles.

91
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,320
Did you really identify what they were?

92
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,780
Little tiny candier tadpoles.

93
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,800
Nobody really seems to be interested in the question,

94
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,520
but I am passionately interested

95
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,300
because I have been telling everybody for years,

96
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,960
oh, it's just walnut oil,

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,440
and now I've found out that apparently

98
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,700
there are no walnut trees even near there,

99
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,280
but there's...

100
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,960
And furthermore, walnut oil is contained inside the nuts,

101
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,740
and that would have to imply that the nuts are all falling,

102
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,820
not just falling into the water,

103
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,160
but also breaking open and getting crushed as well.

104
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,180
It could be that there's a huge...

105
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,000
There is incredible scum on the surface of the pond.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,220
Maybe there are walnut trees in the area,

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,560
but the walnut oil is actually coming from the feces

108
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,980
of all the animals who eat the walnuts.

109
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,900
Yes, and then there was some wiseacre who said,

110
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,280
was that scum there before?

111
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,800
The subgeniuses got in for the bobtism?

112
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,600
I thought that was another good one.

113
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,860
It's very hard to get out of the pond

114
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,720
without getting that stuff all over you

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,860
because it tends to cling.

116
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,960
I can't imagine how you would.

117
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,760
Well, I'll tell you.

118
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,120
Nobody ever listens to me.

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,140
No one would listen.

120
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,100
No one would obey.

121
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
I tried to tell them.

122
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,220
They just don't...

123
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,420
They blow me off.

124
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,200
I know how to do it.

125
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,700
It's like a dead skin follicle that resembles a walnut tree.

126
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,560
That's what they're saying.

127
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,680
They're saying,

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
they resemble little tiny hairs

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,600
and it looks as if you're coated with yeti-like hair

130
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,340
when you get out of the pond.

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,980
Some of them link together

132
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,960
and it's like a large beard of Spanish moss hanging off you.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,340
The only way to get out without that on you

134
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,460
is to break the surface and splash around

135
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,360
so it won't adhere

136
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,120
and then keep splashing until the last second you get out.

137
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,840
Then you only get some on your feet-like.

138
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,320
We had a little debate over a photograph

139
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,720
of somebody taking a close-up

140
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,700
of that hair-like stuff.

141
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,460
Yes.

142
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,380
And one person said,

143
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,540
yeah, remember the picture from last X-Day

144
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,300
of Baby Bear's fanny

145
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,120
with those hair-like things all over it?

146
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,200
And I said, no, I thought that was Suzy the Fluzy's cleavage.

147
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,760
Would you like me...

148
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,840
And somebody else said, no,

149
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,440
that was two bald-headed guys leaning their heads together.

150
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,820
If you would like,

151
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll send you the picture from my private collection

152
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,100
which will show you once and for all

153
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,280
that there was no exaggeration

154
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,540
in this claim.

155
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,660
Wisteria, cilia, cilia, cilia, cilia.

156
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,200
They are almost like cilia.

157
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,400
They're these little short, nubbly nubs.

158
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,820
And that's what happens to anybody who gets in the pond.

159
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,880
That's one of the things that happens.

160
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,780
But if you listen to Dr. Howell,

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,980
you can wash them off of yourself.

162
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,880
Exactly.

163
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,840
Just as no one wants to read the schedule

164
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
I work so hard on with Pisces,

165
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,880
just so people refuse to listen to Dr. Howell.

166
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,140
Exactly.

167
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,100
They ask, but then they don't listen.

168
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,800
Well, they think that it'll never happen to them.

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,800
Just like in Psalm number 10,

170
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,400
they say,

171
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,040
I shall never be in adversity.

172
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,240
If only they knew

173
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,860
how important it is to be prepared

174
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,360
as the Boy Scouts do.

175
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,520
Yeah.

176
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,120
I think every legitimate arm of the government

177
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,880
is fully aware of how prepared we have to be,

178
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,760
especially with these kind of miscreants

179
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,420
in our vacation lands

180
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,120
and places where we go to have...

181
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,060
...fun over our day of independence

182
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,340
from the royal rule.

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,860
It is very unfortunate that people forget

184
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,640
that the purpose of all this stuff

185
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,240
is just to have fun.

186
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,920
Why all this angst and bitterness

187
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,360
and rivalry and fussing

188
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,200
and heartbreak of psoriasis

189
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,900
and...

190
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,820
You're making fun of me.

191
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,400
No, the idea is we're just trying to have fun.

192
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,280
...over a campsite, you know.

193
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,360
Well, yeah, they set a guy on fire.

194
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,880
You heard about that, I guess.

195
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,140
Well, I was wondering about it.

196
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,360
I actually was hoping somebody would expand a little bit on it.

197
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,700
It was a flamethrower.

198
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,320
The guy had a flamethrower.

199
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,980
And it didn't work.

200
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,180
It did work.

201
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,560
Those are surprisingly easy to build a home.

202
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,320
That guy that was standing in for Bob

203
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,800
was a cinder

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
faster than any other sacrifice

205
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,620
we've ever burned up out there.

206
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,700
Awesome.

207
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,860
So guess what?

208
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,960
Now we're going to do your favorite other thing with fire.

209
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,420
Head over that way.

210
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
And let's set Bob on fire!

211
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,420
Fire!

212
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,060
Burn more shit!

213
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,880
Burn more shit!

214
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,960
Burn more shit!

215
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,660
Burn more shit!

216
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,680
Take your way to the usual place

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,280
where we set Bob on fire.

218
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,520
Those who have been before,

219
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:56,980
God,

220
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,320
newbies to the usual place

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,440
we set Bob on fire.

222
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,840
Also, while you're walking over there,

223
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,700
you probably shouldn't stand too close to Bob

224
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,080
because I think flamethrowers

225
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
are going to be involved.

226
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,800
So please don't get caught on fire.

227
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,340
Would you tell me if my face was on fire?

228
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,100
Fire!

229
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,220
No!

230
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,280
The rise will be your deepest joy.

231
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,740
The rise, the radio shows command.

232
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,860
It's time that we elect our boss.

233
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,840
The choice of a person shall stand.

234
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Seriously, I don't know.

235
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,260
A child to pass on Jesus

236
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,080
shall rise for the world.

237
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
Fire and stand.

238
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm a little taken by surprise.

239
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
We're going to burn Bob

240
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,860
and we don't really...

241
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,440
We don't really have a reason to burn him yet.

242
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,460
He hasn't let us down yet this time.

243
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,680
I am observing a Bob effigy

244
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,900
tied to a stake.

245
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,720
It's almost like he looks like

246
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,280
he's riding a little motorcycle

247
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,060
only the motorcycle is made of wood

248
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,340
that is going to incinerate him.

249
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
He has to be burned.

250
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,840
He has a face

251
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,120
of a color-printed

252
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
Dobbs head

253
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,440
stuck on a wig head, I think.

254
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,240
And this should burn well.

255
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,540
It should burn well.

256
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,700
But why...

257
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,140
Why are we even...

258
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,580
Bernie, he hasn't done anything to us.

259
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,100
Not yet.

260
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
No, he's...

261
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,780
He's pretty good, man.

262
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,800
He doesn't intend harm.

263
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,760
It just kind of happens

264
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
if you're in the wrong place,

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,000
wrong time.

266
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,100
If you haven't been killing

267
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,640
your own personal Dobbs,

268
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,860
here's a chance to...

269
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:01,880
Yeah.

270
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,600
But it's not like...

271
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,520
Last time,

272
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,000
we got up at 7 a.m.,

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,420
the saucers didn't arrive,

274
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,160
so we burned Bob.

275
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,460
And Bob had killed

276
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,520
all these people, too,

277
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,160
on top of that.

278
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,440
So we burned him.

279
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,820
Great.

280
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,560
Or an effigy, of course, obviously.

281
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,180
It's a clever simulacrum,

282
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,740
but it's not the real Bob.

283
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,020
Just so anybody knows,

284
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,200
this is not the real J.R. Bob Dobbs.

285
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,580
I don't know who is under

286
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,600
that little mask

287
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,660
wearing the suit,

288
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,940
and I'm sorry about whatever,

289
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,720
but that's not Bob.

290
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,880
Somebody else.

291
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,800
I've heard it smells like bacon.

292
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,920
I do hear muffled...

293
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Shh.

294
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,100
Oh, I'm sorry.

295
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,320
Is he white?

296
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,520
He's not supposed to...

297
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,540
He's supposed to be

298
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,740
completely in us at times.

299
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,620
We wouldn't do that

300
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,080
to a conscious person.

301
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,940
Set him on fire?

302
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,220
We're just from right over our heads

303
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,320
from the flaming arrow.

304
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,000
I'd see it in white.

305
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,560
At this particular time,

306
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
I'm as puzzled as the pagans usually are.

307
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,500
Why do they burn their guru,

308
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,760
the guy they love?

309
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,600
Are you waiting for fire technology professionals?

310
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,780
They always say that.

311
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,280
Move back quite a bit.

312
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
Because fire technology professionals...

313
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,020
Oh, yeah, I know.

314
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,720
Right, right.

315
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,200
Of course.

316
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,920
No, by the fire technology professionals.

317
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,160
We are human flesh.

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,020
We can be unpredictable.

319
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:29,860
Can ignite.

320
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,620
Really, yeah.

321
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,220
Not unlike the searing flash

322
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,360
that announced the beginning

323
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,400
of the atomic age.

324
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,900
Yeah, they have...

325
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,620
There's gas in the human body

326
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,780
and it can explode.

327
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,560
That's right.

328
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Again, this is not J.R. Bob Dobbs,

329
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,920
but someone in a Bob mask.

330
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,160
Actually, if anybody here

331
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,960
wants to step in and, you know...

332
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,600
I mean, this guy didn't know.

333
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,580
And if anybody...

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
If anybody wants to take his place,

335
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,200
you'd probably be a little closer

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,480
to the saucers tomorrow.

337
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,560
Nah, fuck it.

338
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,380
Maybe get a little better seat.

339
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:06,720
Let me...

340
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,640
More of a front row.

341
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,220
I don't know.

342
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,380
Can't promise you anything.

343
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,140
Where's sex point if you can?

344
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,960
I'll triple my money.

345
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,660
We would...

346
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,240
It would have to be somebody

347
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,060
who would fit in that suit, though.

348
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,640
Flammable, if you get to what I mean.

349
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,760
I thought you were a ghost out like me.

350
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,460
Now, since subgeniuses have never been able to prod

351
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:27,580
Yeah.

352
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,640
to satisfy the secret of fire

353
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,340
from our friends, the pagans...

354
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,180
Oh, please don't flick my arrow on my head.

355
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,260
We are dependent upon the...

356
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,660
the pagan experts who actually know

357
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,380
how to ignite a flame.

358
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,140
This is the one secret.

359
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,120
professionals, because they are the keepers

360
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,160
of the Vestal Fire,

361
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,180
the sacred fire on the hearth,

362
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,980
right over there in that little circle.

363
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Yeah, where is that guy with the match

364
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,660
and the flamethrower and the howitzer?

365
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,100
Somebody ought to wake him up.

366
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,860
Oh, there! Oh, Jason!

367
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,900
Christ, Bob. Oh, my God.

368
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,600
He's adjacent.

369
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,480
You want him lit up?

370
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,720
Let's hide time.

372
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,920
Let's get this barbecue on the road.

373
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,980
Everybody's hungry, right?

374
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,340
Set him on fire.

375
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:12,880
Yeah.

376
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,560
He's hungry to see the old Bob burn.

377
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,660
Jason is now stalking the...

378
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,520
Well, he's tied up.

379
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,900
Oh, my God.

380
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,980
Holy shit!

381
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,260
Long live the new Bob.

382
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,300
But it is an actual flamethrower.

383
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,080
Bob has been ignited instantly.

384
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:31,940
Whoo!

385
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,120
Listen to the crowd and smell that bacon.

386
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, I'm so hungry now.

387
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,620
What's the problem?

388
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,680
I ain't trying.

389
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,340
I, I, I...

390
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,740
Hail Jason.

391
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,160
Jason, the bringer of fire,

392
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,680
the Prometheus of the subgeniuses.

393
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,900
Oh, shit!

394
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,280
Who is he out of space?

395
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,400
Between pagans and subgeniuses.

396
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,060
Are we still burning our conspiracy paper chains?

397
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,400
Oh, yeah.

398
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,860
Oh, do you have a conspiracy form?

399
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
I have a conspiracy form.

400
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,340
Is that your old business card from your old job?

401
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,120
No, this is my new business card from my new job that they gave me for free.

402
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:15,740
Wow.

403
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,460
And it has my slave name upon it.

404
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,320
Oh, cool.

405
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,400
And it shall burn.

406
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh, yes.

407
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,200
He knew that.

408
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,040
Baby Bear is burning.

409
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,260
Burning a symbol of her human life.

410
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:29,800
Yay!

411
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,240
The sad human life that we have to pretend to live.

412
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,100
That's a good idea.

413
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,680
If anyone has anything like their driver's license or their credit...

414
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,040
Well, maybe...

415
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,420
You know, the people that...

416
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,280
This is the Bob that we fill with money.

417
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,440
Last year we had people barbecuing hot dogs on his face, lighting cigarettes off his shoes.

418
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,740
This is the, yeah.

419
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,020
This is one of those...

420
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,120
This is the one that was supposed to be buried with money.

421
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,480
That we were going to retrieve.

422
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,260
Right.

423
00:15:59,520 --> 00:15:59,960
And...

424
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,560
What?

425
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,640
After the end times.

426
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,220
That was the one with the money in it?

427
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,480
Yes.

428
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,340
Oh, great!

429
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,720
It was supposed to be buried, not burned.

430
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,820
Oh, that's wonderful.

431
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,760
Oh, now you tell us.

432
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,180
It was on the schedule.

433
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,120
We were going to burn it.

434
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,620
You put the money on him?

435
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,180
Okay, we're going to need everybody to go up and pee on the fire.

436
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,500
Who was that guy?

437
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,340
Or blow on it.

438
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,940
Oh, it's too late.

439
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,700
It's gone now.

440
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,880
Oh, look.

441
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,000
I can see little dollar bills flying up into the sky.

442
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000


443
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000


444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000


445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000


446
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,640
I can see the blood here, just shreds of them.

447
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,440
Oh, but that was real smooth, guys.

448
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,520
Put the church savings in the sacrificial dead guy.

449
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,980
I didn't have anything to do with it.

450
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:41,180
So, yeah, the church needs everyone to re-register tomorrow, or actually today, because all of

451
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,500
the registration has gone into the sacrificial Bob.

452
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,880
How cute!

453
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh, thank you.

454
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,540
What was that?

455
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:53,980
Was that great?

456
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:53,980


457
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:53,980


458
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:53,980


459
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:53,980


460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,180
Was that granny panties or what?

461
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,160
That was my con uniform.

462
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:09,500
Dr. Drummond, don't you need to burn some representation of your job that you just retired?

463
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,740
No more arm sales?

464
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,080
I mean, how?

465
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,880
You sold arms?

466
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,840
Whoa.

467
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,300
Like mannequin arms?

468
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,680
Must have some.

469
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,820
Right arms.

470
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,680
Do you have any strong, like testicles you could throw in there?

471
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:23,880
Sure.

472
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,060
I have the last one, the last two extra ones removed recently.

473
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,520
Of cosmetic?

474
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,220
Yeah.

475
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:34,480
The extras.

476
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,220
Yeah, everybody wants to be cool.

477
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,480
Bob instantly burned.

478
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,920
And then there was a Nazi-like moment where they put a book in the flames, a book called

479
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,200
Unburnable.

480
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,520
And it almost was.

481
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,980
It took a long time for that book to finally start cramming.

482
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,500
We were starting to lose faith.

483
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh, here's somebody with the, what is this, Reverend Fox?

484
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,700
I see.

485
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,700
Unburnable.

486
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,280
A book called Unburnable.

487
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
Oh my God.

488
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,660
This is a test.

489
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,620
It's mocking you.

490
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:17,140
Reverend Fox actually has a book called, with the title printed on it, a hardcover book,

491
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,360
Unburnable.

492
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,620
Yes, let's get a good photograph of this.

493
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,120
Oh, I see it.

494
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,500
It's Unburnable.

495
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,220
Because, is it truth in advertising?

496
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,360
Can you really judge a book by the cover?

497
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,340
I guess that would be the experiment we're learning tonight.

498
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,880
What is this?

499
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,700
He wants to know the publisher.

500
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,780
Who is the publisher?

501
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,560
HarperCollins.

502
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,440
HarperCollins.

503
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,740
They turned down the book of the subgenius.

504
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,380
They offered a smaller bid than Simon & Schuster.

505
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,480
HarperCollins, the publishers of this so-called book.

506
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:52,480


507
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,400
It's called Unburnable Book.

508
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,440
We'll see.

509
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,500
And if this book burns, it means any book can be burned.

510
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,580
The book of the subgenius.

511
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,340
I'm not sure what that's good for.

512
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,100
The book of the subgenius burns really fast.

513
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,020
Well, we know that from many X-days and many disappointing X-day drills.

514
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,260
All right, here it goes.

515
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,520
Here we go.

516
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,960
Oh, the author is looking out at us.

517
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,100
That means we'll get to see.

518
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:19,340
Wait, it's not burning.

519
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,160
It's a Ouija board.

520
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,360
It's still not burning.

521
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,080
It's melting.

522
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,420
Well, maybe we ought to change religions.

523
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,860
Maybe, oh, wait.

524
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,980
There it goes.

525
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,940
I like this.

526
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,540
There's a photo of the author on the back and she's going all Freddy Krueger.

527
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,780
I believe.

528
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,240
I fucking believe.

529
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,780
Yeah, we all believe something.

530
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,620
He's smoking now.

531
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,600
He's smoking hot.

532
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,480
How does, how did that Bob replacement dude taste?

533
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,980
Does anybody use it?

534
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,340
If you inhale the smoke, not only will you get the smoke, but you'll get the smoke.

535
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


536
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


537
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


538
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


539
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


540
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


541
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


542
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,340


543
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,780
You'll die, but you'll know the book.

544
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,100
If you inhale the smoke of the book, book burning is, is not a disruption of book dissemination.

545
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,280
Book burning is a vehicle through which people can ingest books faster.

546
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,900
All these douches are vaping books now.

547
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Have you seen this shit?

548
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,340
Fucking douchebags vaping books.

549
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,080
Are you telling me?

550
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,300
It's taking a long time to burn.

551
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,600
It is taking a long time to burn.

552
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,040
Oh my God.

553
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,200
The, the, his shoulder.

554
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,580
The shoulder and the scapula fell off the body into the side of the fire.

555
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,540
Bob's in sad shape.

556
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,900
God, it smells like bacon.

557
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,880
Like hold it up.

558
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,420
Really?

559
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,220
It's really making me hungry.

560
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,920
You can see his shin bones through the pants now.

561
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,760
No, no, I'm taking it out.

562
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,120
Maybe it is unburnable.

563
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
It's still sitting there.

564
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,080
Still sitting there.

565
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,940
I don't know.

566
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,980
I'm starting to change my mind about this whole Bob thing now.

567
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,140
I'm changing my mind about everything.

568
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:51,820
Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,060
Well, this is a strange situation, Billy.

570
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,880
Have you fucked up?

571
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,500
Yes.

572
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,080
Oh my God.

573
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,560
My mouth is just watering.

574
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,120
I want to pull some of that meat out of there.

575
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,080
I love the fact that we've really got some Bob.

576
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,420
We've got some bread back in the car.

577
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,920
And we're fascinated by the blood.

578
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,840
And we're fascinated with the book.

579
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,460
It's called evolution.

580
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,240
Kill book.

581
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,520
Kill book.

582
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Kill book.

583
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,080
Kill book.

584
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,080


585
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,720
Kill book.

586
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,160
What if you guys are just because it, just because it claimed to be unburnable.

587
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,040
And apparently it is because it's still sitting there.

588
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,440
Bob's gone.

589
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,200
The stupid pink book is still there.

590
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,140
What is this telling us?

591
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,640
Again, the conspiracy wins?

592
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,960
Or are we reading too much into it?

593
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,420
I think we're just impatient.

594
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,840
Oh, yeah.

595
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,720
Naturally.

596
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,140
Naturally, after 18 years of waiting for the fucking saucers, we can be allowed some impatience.

597
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,440
I guess we can.

598
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,260
Yeah.

599
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,740
Yeah.

600
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,860
Yeah.

601
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,260
Yeah.

602
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,600
We can.

603
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,040
It was all a lie.

604
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,860
Thank you.

605
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,320
Yeah.

606
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Alphina was right.

607
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,860
How is that?

608
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,300
Something's been taken off my shoulder.

609
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,700
Was that a great thing?

610
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,320
Oh, my gosh.

611
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,140
You need to make an announcement about this.

612
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,720
Here you go.

613
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:08,580
Well, we have here a CD by the band or thing called Pink.

614
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,840
Pink.

615
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,060
Pink.

616
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,600
I've been seeing these t-shirts that say, I love pink everywhere.

617
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,840
They disgruntled me.

618
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,660
So I would love to see this.

619
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,760
You are so not gruntled.

620
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,960
No shit.

621
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,520
It's terrifying.

622
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,760
So I would love to see this.

623
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,460
See, I wonder what they would do.

624
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,040
I've microwaved a lot of these CD things.

625
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,340
Pink.

626
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,480
Pink.

627
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:28,720


628
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,320
Pink.

629
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,320


630
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,480
Pink.

631
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,480


632
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,540
Pink.

633
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,540


634
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,540


635
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,540


636
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,560
Pink.

637
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,560


638
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:29,600
Pink.

639
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:29,600


640
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:29,600


641
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:29,900
Pink.

642
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,360
Pink.

643
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,060
Pink.

644
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,060


645
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:31,720
Pink.

646
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:31,960
Pink.

647
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,760
Pink.

648
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:43,900
Pink.

649
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


650
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


651
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


652
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


653
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


654
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


655
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


656
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


657
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


658
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


659
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


660
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


661
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:43,900


662
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,320
Okay, eat your heart out, Harper Collins.

663
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,540
Mother fuckers.

664
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,180
There we go.

665
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,860
It's on page 42.

666
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,380
Oh, too late.

667
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
Pink inside.

668
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,640
Pink!

669
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:54,880
Pink.

670
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,440
Pink!

671
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,040


672
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,360


673
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,880
Pink!

674
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,000
Pink!

675
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,200
Boy, what a .

676
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,700
What is that secret video you took of your wife, and you promised her you't get rid of

677
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,540
You got married? Is that what you're burning?

678
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,740
There's not going to be any meat left.

679
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,220
Fuck a clown!

680
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,100
Dad, what the fuck am I going to tell mom?

681
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,900
But Baby Bear mourned and said, now we're like Nazis and so forth.

682
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,520
No, because we only burn unburnables.

683
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,300
Well, I think any book that has a picture of the author on the cover can't really be a good book.

684
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:44,880
The last year that I remember seeing Magdalene there, there were quite a few books burned that year.

685
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,040
Well, those don't count. Those were mostly Bibles and Korans.

686
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,900
Yeah, those and the subgenius Hitler youth.

687
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,040
Jack Chick tracts.

688
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,320
Jack Chick tracts were burned?

689
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,340
No, I just said that to get you upset.

690
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,500
Oh, no.

691
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,280
Nobody burned the precious comic.

692
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,180
Who tells me that goose-stepping morons such as yourselves should try reading books instead of burning them?

693
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,460
Well, okay, sure, I'll sit down and read some right now.

694
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,020
Sure, I'm kidding.

695
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,400
No, the idea behind those...

696
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,180
Was there a hairy person that got in there?

697
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,720
Independent Jones and the Temple of Literacy.

698
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,040
The place was like a steam bath and no one could get in.

699
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,840
Or get clean.

700
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,680
You'd have to go up to the shower house for that.

701
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,400
Climb up a long, muddy trail and then...

702
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,200
By the time you get to the bottom of the hill, you need another...

703
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,440
Another shower.

704
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,460
Right.

705
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,120
They get a lot of exercise that way.

706
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,740
There were plenty of showers falling from the sky.

707
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,640
And I did go up and down that thing more times than I could count.

708
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,060
And I got plenty of exercise.

709
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,400
Hard, physical exercise.

710
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,420
What was that thing?

711
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,700
What thing?

712
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,180
You just said you got a lot of exercise going up and down that thing.

713
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,000
The trail.

714
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,060
The trail that goes up the side of the mountain to the bath house.

715
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:06,520
Sorry.

716
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,800
Where the baths are taken and the house has the odds.

717
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,000
And that is just the beginning of my journey.

718
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,920
Because I'd walk past that and all the way down the road a piece

719
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,600
until I came to the Hierarchite's cabin in the woods.

720
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,620
Is there one?

721
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,240
All around.

722
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,240
A beautiful little idyllic looking place.

723
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:35,240
And there were also RVs inhabited by Mr. Sistar and by Dr. Dark.

724
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,700
And...

725
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,560
And a golf cart driven by Princess Wee, which in the middle of the night made a metallic squee.

726
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,820
And...

727
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,300
Oh, oh, oh.

728
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,360
I heard that.

729
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,320
And then Pastor Pressure had a ghost meter on his cell phone, an app for that.

730
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,440
And he was metering the squeal.

731
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,000
I have it happen again.

732
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,500
So you heard the squeal I referred to.

733
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,660
Now, what is in these advanced surveillance techniques?

734
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,800
The haunted golf cart.

735
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,380
A ghost...

736
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,360
A ghost-busting app.

737
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,920
In DC Comics.

738
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,900
It was a ghost-busting app?

739
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
And it was shown a very high number.

740
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,460
Very high number.

741
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,280
Somebody who was high on it.

742
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,960
It is a haunted.

743
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,180
It is measurably haunted.

744
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,220
Yes, according to his app on his cell.

745
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah, the golf course would make that noise when it was off.

746
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,540
No key in it.

747
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,300
The golf curse.

748
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,660
Yes.

749
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,200
That's what was happening.

750
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,080
Yes.

751
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,280
Yes.

752
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:35,500
Indeed.

753
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,320
It's one of the mysteries.

754
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,720
My theory was that it was Doc Savage trying to solve a crossword puzzle under the golf cart.

755
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,900
For hours?

756
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,540
Yeah.

757
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,440
Well, it was a really tough puzzle.

758
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,880
He makes that noise when he's concentrating.

759
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,940
It was making that noise when I went away.

760
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,260
And it was making that noise when I came back hours later.

761
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,980
Check the tires.

762
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,040
Yeah, check the tires.

763
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,740
Check the hood.

764
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,920
Maybe the engine's missing.

765
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,780
One of these crazy kids out on the street might have stolen it.

766
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,180
Ha ha.

767
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,780
There are two.

768
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,560
There's the other direction.

769
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,080
All down below.

770
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,600
All talking at once.

771
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,440
Oh, he's back from the correction.

772
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,200
Maybe that's your mom.

773
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,280
Even when the car's turned, when it's off.

774
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:14,660
Yeah.

775
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,040
Oh.

776
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,660
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments about my ears.

777
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,200
And sometimes voices.

778
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,220
I turned two of them off yesterday.

779
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,560
You killed a moth?

780
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,020
I turned two of them off yesterday because...

781
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,080
Oh, turned two of them off.

782
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,980
This sounds like those conversations between deaf people.

783
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,220
Right.

784
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,920
Right. Telegraph.

785
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,500
No, I thought he said he killed a moth.

786
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,440
But no, he turned two of them off.

787
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,980
Dr. Drummond knows the secret of the mysterious squeal.

788
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,120
And it is that when you're putting it into a reverse gear,

789
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,300
if you don't take it off, even when the vehicle is turned off,

790
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,260
it squeals until it's all...

791
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,500
Well, that was quite a squeal.

792
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,660
And how much power does it use up while it's shrilling away in the dark?

793
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,740
I have no...

794
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,720
No idea.

795
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,640
But you'll find out...

796
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,820
When the battery gives out as you're attempting to navigate an exceptionally steep and troublesome hill.

797
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,580
When suddenly you roll backward at a frightening pace

798
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,320
and crash into the small animal administration.

799
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,260
Don't forget to send a triplicate, too.

800
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,880
And you have to have a hard copy of something.

801
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,760
Thank you.

802
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,780
You get your paperwork done and then give us another call.

803
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,440
This email will get you nowhere.

804
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,640
You need a personal touch.

805
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,700
You need to call up somebody once in a while and know their first name.

806
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,080
Well, you can't make prank calls anymore with the new technology.

807
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,740
There are ways.

808
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,880
People spoof phone numbers all the time.

809
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,960
They spoof phone numbers?

810
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,920
They spoof them.

811
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,860
How much did they buy them then, Matt?

812
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,680
What did you say?

813
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,420
Now, let's not have the speaking in tongues thing.

814
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,800
I was getting excited.

815
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,180
I can't help it.

816
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,540
I would say...

817
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,020
But you'd know what I was talking about.

818
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,460
Right.

819
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,980
And Kabasenka also.

820
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,020
Two or another great thing they used to have.

821
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,780
That southern thing, Kabasenka.

822
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,460
I'll see your Shalikandala and raise you one Vandarian.

823
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,780
One Debasoya.

824
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,560
Oh.

825
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,180
Got to stop drawing.

826
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,920
I'm getting ink all over the desk.

827
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,140
Maybe we should ration our speech so we can go one, two, three,

828
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,160
instead of all at the same time, and then a gap of silence.

829
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:46,760
Over.

830
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:47,720
Oh.

831
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,760
Just say over after each sentence.

832
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,040
Roger that.

833
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,100
Okay.

834
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,000
Let's try this new method.

835
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,360
Over.

836
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,600
Well, the first transmission is going fairly well.

837
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,360
It looks like almost everybody has decided to opt out of the observation,

838
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,900
but it looks like somebody...

839
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,040
I heard you say over.

840
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:09,540
Over.

841
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,800
Roger that.

842
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,360
Over.

843
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,400
Over.

844
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,760
I'm still hearing those rogers and overs.

845
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,340
Over.

846
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,820
Hearing them over and over.

847
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,580
Over.

848
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,620
Looks like we have a new caller calling in here.

849
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:22,940
Over and out.

850
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,800
Over and out.

851
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:23,880
Okay.

852
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,340
Okay.

853
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,860
Over and out.

854
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,880
6-2 and even.

855
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,300
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.

856
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,400
6-2-1-half-a-dozen-of-another.

857
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,880
Talk about snouts, whistle, aerodinies.

858
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,940
Pork snouts and ham jowls.

859
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,640
Hey, you guys already forgot to say over, over.

860
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,240
Over.

861
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,760
Over.

862
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,340
No, you say it after you say something.

863
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,420
You don't just say over, over and over again.

864
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,200
I'm taking my radio etiquette from a radar-activated robot known as Roger.

865
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Over.

866
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,940
Roger.

867
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,320
Over.

868
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,880
Roger that.

869
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,800
My God.

870
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,280
Is this going to go on all night?

871
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,780
Look, this is not ham radio.

872
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,220
See, this is kosher radio.

873
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,220
Tell Rover to roll over.

874
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,260
Roll over and over and ten times over.

875
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,740
He has that kind of picky-oon atmosphere in the background where it sounds like people

876
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,780
are street singing and playing with their toes and everything.

877
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,720
Yeah, sure.

878
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,800
There's plenty of chimpanzees, I'm sure.

879
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,460
I had a little dog and his name was Rover.

880
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,480
When he died, he died all over.

881
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,600
All but his tail and it turned over.

882
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,740
Over and over and ten times over.

883
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,040
Hello.

884
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,140
Hello.

885
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,100
New caller, you're on the air.

886
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:34,680
Yes, I was reading about the Russian Museum of Erotica the other day in St. Petersburg.

887
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,700
He said Petersburg.

888
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Rasputin display.

889
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,160
Wait, so you're saying Vladimir Putin started smoking ganja and listening to reggae and he's now Rasputin?

890
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,120
He said Putin.

891
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,800
No, no, no.

892
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,120
I don't know.

893
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,920
I'm from St. Petersburg.

894
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,340
I don't know if he has anything to do with the museum.

895
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,020
I think there's...

896
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,660
There's something there.

897
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,220
... something in Erotica.

898
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,340
But...

899
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,340
It's too much of a coincidence to be a, you know...

900
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,280
Are you saying that...

901
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,560
A coincidence?

902
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,640
... communistical Ruskies are ahead of America in Erotica?

903
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,020
Yeah, I'm just saying...

904
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,220
Well, friends, we've got to get busy.

905
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,100
There used to be...

906
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,080
I have an article...

907
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:21,800
We can't allow a porno gap.

908
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,060
That's right, Mr. President.

909
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,160
... of Putin is in Rasputin.

910
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:26,940
Wow.

911
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,220
And they know they have Rasputin.

912
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,540
They have to breed more prodigiously than the commies.

913
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,720
They purportedly have Rasputin's penis on display.

914
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,000
That's John Dillard.

915
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,640
I would call that a holy relic, all right.

916
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,560
No, I've seen it.

917
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,060
How many ways did they try to kill him?

918
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,060
It just means you can't kill him.

919
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,940
It had little I's on the end, right?

920
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,880
You know, I could give such a great historical lecture right now.

921
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,120
I'd like to hear it.

922
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,000
I'd like to know.

923
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,760
Why can't you?

924
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,120
Go ahead.

925
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,100
Barge in.

926
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,520
Suspended in formaldehyde.

927
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,380
Listen.

928
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,360
It's behind a curtain.

929
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,140
And you have to...

930
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
You have to do this.

931
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,140


932
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,140


933
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,060
Now, what I want to know, what I want to know is...

934
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,220
Has it...

935
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,760
Hold on, hold on.

936
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,620
What I want to know, hey, professor, what I want to know is, is it...

937
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,820
Safe?

938
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,300
Is it...

939
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,060
What kind of state is it in, shall I say?

940
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,380
Is it in a discernibly turgid state?

941
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,660
I mean...

942
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,160
No, no.

943
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,300
It's not Iraq, but it's 13 inches.

944
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,300
It's quite large.

945
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,180
He was 13 inches flaccid?

946
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,260
Yes.

947
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,120
It's quite large.

948
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,440
No wonder he was a mad monk.

949
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,400
You know, if I had equipment like that and I was stuck as a monk, you can't even use it.

950
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:25,920
... as Alexander.

951
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,800
No, we liked him so much.

952
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,340
But, you know, listen, all you guys...

953
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,360
He was quite promiscuous, you know.

954
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,500
Ivan Stang has the straight poop on this.

955
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,120
I knew Rasputin.

956
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,860
Rasputin was a madman.

957
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,740
I was there when those boyars killed him.

958
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,680
They strangled him.

959
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,400
They beat him.

960
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,860
They cut his weenie off.

961
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,840
They shot him.

962
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,760
They knifed him.

963
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,940
And he still...

964
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,400
He died.

965
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,020
The title of this article was...

966
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,620
Drowning.

967
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,860
The title of this article is...

968
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,300
I quit.

969
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,680
Rasputin was poisoned, shot, beaten, and drowned.

970
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,620
Oh, okay.

971
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Sorry I brought it up.

972
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,960
Yes, he drowned in...

973
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,940
What was the idea of cutting his weenie off?

974
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,720
That's not normally a fatal...

975
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,780
Well, you know...

976
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,440
Hey, you've gone that far already.

977
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,320
You know, you might as well throw that in just for good measure.

978
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,340
They were bored Russian aristocrats.

979
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:21,140
So why would you say then it would be the reason for the secret police to remove his penis?

980
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,340
So they could put it in the freaking museum.

981
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:24,780
Yeah.

982
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,780
I think we should have a Cleveland Museum of Erotica.

983
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,200
And maybe we could get like Ralph Perks penis.

984
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,080
You mean Cleveland Little Museum?

985
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:34,700
Ralph Perks?

986
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,860
No, no, Cleveland Erotica Museum.

987
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,280
In Cleveland?

988
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,400
Yes.

989
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,640
Okay, well, let's put that before the next city council meeting.

990
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,780
Maybe we could put Dr. Sinister's penis up for play.

991
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,280
And move on to new business.

992
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,460
You're going to give it up.

993
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,120
Seriously, you know, it would probably get more use in a museum than it would detach my own body, so...

994
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,460
Well, now, that's a sad thing.

995
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,580
Now, put your pants back on, Dr. Sinister.

996
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,340
That's all right.

997
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:57,940
I believe you.

998
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:58,820
I believe you.

999
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,460
We believe you.

1000
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,840
Sorry, I forgot.

1001
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,400
Pull them up.

1002
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,120
I believe you.

1003
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,900
We believe you.

1004
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,500
We believe you.

1005
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,140
Well, I think you should go to the leather stallion then tonight, maybe.

1006
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,600
We are on duty doing a radio show.

1007
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,740
Do you have any idea?

1008
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,200
Have you any conception of...

1009
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,100
You can't just drop things and go off to the leather stallion.

1010
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,160
The social responsibility is so great.

1011
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,400
Many of them crack half of the time.

1012
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,340
Oh, well, if you're offering crack, then that's a different matter.

1013
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,960
The schedule of over-consumption is large.

1014
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,200
Are you guys on drugs tonight?

1015
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,900
Sometimes 300 miles long.

1016
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,020
Are you, Professor?

1017
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,520
No, no, I don't do any drugs at all.

1018
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,880
Although I've been running a lot of...

1019
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,320
I get the feeling you are high on something else.

1020
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,300
Would I, Tom?

1021
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,140
I've been running into a lot of people who do a lot of drugs lately.

1022
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,120
It's very strange.

1023
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,860
Yes, you and Mr. and Sister.

1024
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,200
Very large percentages of the population.

1025
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,780
They consume various substances on a regular basis.

1026
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,740
Us people are on drugs.

1027
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:03,680
I've had someone say this something about these drug cases.

1028
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,660
I can shake any man on this lip.

1029
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,540
It's a recording of staying at S-Day 2.

1030
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,680
I mean, I'm a guy who does a lot of DMT.

1031
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,760
You know a guy who does a lot of DMT?

1032
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,620
Yeah.

1033
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,920
At the DMV?

1034
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,600
So does it become like...

1035
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,260
Does it get easy?

1036
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,120
Is that one of those things that gets easier every time?

1037
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,200
Because I've never heard a...

1038
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,660
I've never heard a description of DMT usage as being all that pleasant.

1039
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,640
It all depends if you use the venom of the Colorado River Toad.

1040
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,040
You know what that means.

1041
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,960
There's ayahuasca.

1042
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,120
You've got to keep trying it one time more.

1043
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,900
Just one more time.

1044
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,460
Damn, man.

1045
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,880
I mean, Tammy.

1046
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,840
Yeah.

1047
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,660
Well, there's a good description of Daniel Pinchbeck's book called Breaking Open the

1048
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,840
Stories about Modern High-Tech Shamanism in Contemporary America.

1049
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,640
He has a good description of...

1050
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,660
I know it exists.

1051
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,380
I've been...

1052
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,560
I've been to those ceremonies in Hollywood.

1053
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,380
They had a private one.

1054
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,680
They had the shamans flown in for it.

1055
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,620
And I was there.

1056
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,320
Participated.

1057
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,080
It's designed to brainwash all of us into accepting a new world order.

1058
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,660
Too late.

1059
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,140
We've already accepted it.

1060
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,680
Hey, hey.

1061
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,400
Wake up, sleepo.

1062
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,720
Wake up, sleepo.

1063
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
You're all asleep.

1064
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,000
You don't know nothing.

1065
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,040
Oh, my God.

1066
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,440
I've got to warn people by calling this college radio show.

1067
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,360
It's going to take him a long time.

1068
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,100
It's going to take a long time to figure out that I hung up on him.

1069
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,740
It's going to take a long time to figure out that I hung up on him.

1070
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,300
Because I don't think he was even listening before he called it.

1071
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,800
Hey, jet fuel don't meet melt steel.

1072
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,180
And I'm not used to him calling this early.

1073
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,800
Usually, he only calls me after midnight.

1074
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,100
I think he was on drugs.

1075
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,000
In the case of that previous caller, if he had a hallucination that he was being swarmed,

1076
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,820
they wouldn't be ants.

1077
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,940
They'd be little tiny Jews.

1078
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,200
He's a notorious anti-Semite conspiracy theorist, actually.

1079
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,360
I got the impression that that guy was rather tactful.

1080
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,500
Taking himself a bit seriously.

1081
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:02,140
What is it about mental illness and anti-Semitism that there's such a strong correlation between that?

1082
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,060
They're jealous because the Jewish chicks are so hot.

1083
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,440
He wanted to get some pots and pans together and start slamming some chili on the stove.

1084
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,380
Oh, someone's making a call.

1085
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,600
Oh, this guy wants to call in again.

1086
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,800
Let's have it.

1087
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,740
You again?

1088
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,880
Go away.

1089
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,420
Go away.

1090
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,060
Ted, listen.

1091
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,880
Ted, listen.

1092
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,220
Ted, just go away.

1093
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,520
Okay?

1094
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,320
Don't go away angry.

1095
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,120
Just go away.

1096
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,480
Okay.

1097
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,280
So now that guy's like an SS guy or something.

1098
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:30,920
He calls up every weekend.

1099
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,040
He's just a really, really obnoxious person.

1100
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,640
And sometimes it's fun to talk to him, but eventually, as soon as he says words like

1101
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,800
Illuminati or whatever, you know that you've pretty much gone into the realm of stuff.

1102
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,660
But I thought he was talking about ancient Romans.

1103
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,420
And half the stuff he says is Sonny the Great.

1104
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,140
All right.

1105
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,540
You know what?

1106
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,020
Since we let one non-subgenius caller on before.

1107
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,680
I guess we should let one more on.

1108
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,100
Yeah.

1109
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,840
One more.

1110
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,420
One more on.

1111
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,900
Let's get a good one this time.

1112
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,340
One more person on.

1113
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,160
And that is this guest here.

1114
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:02,920
Hello, you're on the air.

1115
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,660
Hello, you're on the air.

1116
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,240
Hello, you're on the air.

1117
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,460
This is the subgenius caller.

1118
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,440
Guess who's there?

1119
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,240
Who is there?

1120
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,820
Subgenius.

1121
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,640
Subgenius.

1122
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,180
Yes.

1123
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,500
Speak up.

1124
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,100
Subgenius.

1125
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,940
Me, subgenius.

1126
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,560
You.

1127
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,260
Subgenius.

1128
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,680
Church of the rub penis.

1129
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,600
Subgenius.

1130
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,720
The subgenius.

1131
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,860
The planet Venus?

1132
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,360
The planet Venus.

1133
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:23,860
The planet Venus.

1134
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,600
Let's try this again.

1135
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:25,980
I'm not a man.

1136
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,580
Let's try this again.

1137
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:27,960
You're on the air.

1138
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,980
WCS 3 FM.

1139
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,240
Subgeniuses are being eaten by mosquitoes.

1140
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,080
Let's let the new caller speak for a second.

1141
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:34,900
Hello, no money mark.

1142
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,660
Welcome to the program.

1143
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,500
Subgenius?

1144
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,460
Good to talk to everybody.

1145
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,420
Well, so much for no money mark.

1146
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,320
Okay.

1147
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,940
Let's just let him talk for a second, okay?

1148
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,160
He's a good guy.

1149
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,580
He's been loyal to the program.

1150
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,020
Let him talk already.

1151
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,360
Let him talk.

1152
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,360


1153
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,360


1154
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:53,360


1155
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,360
Let him speak for a second.

1156
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:54,720
Put him on.

1157
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,340
I'm going to hang up on every single one of you and kick you all out.

1158
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:57,940
Okay.

1159
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah.

1160
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,640
Oh.

1161
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,600
Is Dave still there?

1162
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,000
They hung up.

1163
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Yeah, they got too many hangups.

1164
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,900
Oh, we lost Dave.

1165
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,500
Oh, look.

1166
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,780
We lost everybody.

1167
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
Do your own thing, man.

1168
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,420
You mean nobody is on now?

1169
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,340
They're all gone?

1170
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,060
They're all gone.

1171
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,840
Hello, you're on the air.

1172
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,120
I'm back.

1173
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,700
You're back.

1174
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:17,880
All right.

1175
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,500
And you're beautiful.

1176
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,900
And hey, I think the other people are back too.

1177
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,220
They're all beautiful.

1178
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,980
I'm back.

1179
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,680
Hello.

1180
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,240
Oh, you hate me so much, Dr. Sinister.

1181
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:27,980
Why is that?

1182
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,380
Because you're really annoying.

1183
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,280
Okay, Mark, you're on the air.

1184
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,180
That was quick.

1185
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,580
Okay, well, I would just like to warn you guys that whatever you do, stay away from

1186
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,940
New Zealand because it's about to be taken over.

1187
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,100
Really?

1188
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,220
By giant carnivorous crickets.

1189
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,080
No, by subredditors.

1190
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,480
Subredditors?

1191
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,540
Subredditors?

1192
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,260
Okay, you've heard of the Reddit site, right?

1193
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,560
I read it every day.

1194
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,060
I did a Reddit interview.

1195
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,020
You did?

1196
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,020
Yes, I did.

1197
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,360
How about that?

1198
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,140
Mm-hmm.

1199
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,700
Mm-hmm.

1200
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,200
Mm-hmm.

1201
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,180
Have you heard of a group that's on Reddit called the Red Pill?

1202
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,220
Yes, I have.

1203
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,960
They're horrible people.

1204
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,060
They are, from everything I've heard.

1205
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,740
They're like an anti-feminist group.

1206
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,320
We hate them.

1207
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,560
They're basically pro-rape advocates.

1208
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:21,940
Mm-hmm.

1209
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:27,080
Well, also, they call themselves the Red Pill because of the Matrix, because they're the

1210
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,020
only ones who see the world as it really is.

1211
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,780
There's no Red Pill in the Matrix.

1212
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,840
Mm-hmm.

1213
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:39,680
But anyway, this is why I read recently, thanks to a pro-feminist site that mocks the anti-feminist

1214
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,480
sites called We Hunted the Mammoths.

1215
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,840
Okay, so there is...

1216
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,260
Mammoths?

1217
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,160
We hunted the mammoths.

1218
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,600
Princess We did indeed hunt mammoths in her years.

1219
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,800
Yes, she was a hunter.

1220
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,060
She was a hunter.

1221
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,060


1222
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,060


1223
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,060


1224
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,160
She was a hunter.

1225
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,100
She was a hunter from the start.

1226
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,640
Yeah, so...

1227
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,000
Anyway, enough backstory.

1228
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,420
Okay, yeah.

1229
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,040
Okay, so there's an anti-troll law in New Zealand that just got passed, and these guys

1230
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,020
are afraid that their site is going to be banned there because of it, so here is their

1231
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,220
plan for dealing with it, thanks to a poster called, I kid you not, Gay Lube Oil.

1232
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:14,840
Okay.

1233
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,640
Okay.

1234
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:15,860
Okay.

1235
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,940
Quote, the Red Pill is 120,000 fit, college-educated.

1236
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,020
Middle-class men.

1237
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,620
If we really wanted to, we could invade New Zealand and install a new government.

1238
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,320
We definitely have the manpower.

1239
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,260
There are plenty of veterans here.

1240
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:39,380
Plus, everyone here knows where the magazine releases on an M-16 from years of playing

1241
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,480
Call of Duty.

1242
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,760
Do they even use M-16s anymore?

1243
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,780
I thought they used the M-4 nowadays instead.

1244
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,020
Well, I mean, the point is, apparently this guy believes that the...

1245
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,280
The last Starfighter principle works in real life.

1246
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,060
Right.

1247
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,140
If you're good enough at video games, you'll be recruited.

1248
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,920
Isn't that what the U.S. Defense Department does?

1249
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,680
You know, I've been contacted by the Monster Attack team because I got so good at Monster

1250
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,940
Hunter, that game.

1251
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,000
Now, I can't...

1252
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,800
I don't even know how to load the shotgun that I used to have, and yet, I can sure

1253
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,640
mow them down.

1254
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,660
I can't mow them down in that video game.

1255
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,780
Okay, so...

1256
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:30,080
Well, those manly men are very oppressed these days by the limp-wristed sissies, the

1257
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:38,840
high-voiced women, and just about every kind of weak, outnumbered minority somehow is able

1258
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:45,160
to bully these manly men to such an extent that they're just crying and weeping and complaining

1259
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:45,840
and...

1260
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,220
What's the matter with these huge...

1261
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,240
The girls picked on us manly men.

1262
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,540
Brawny, broad-shouldered...

1263
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,020
Those homosexuals picked on me.

1264
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,500
Flannel shirt-wearing, stubble-chinned, watch-cat-wearing...

1265
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,240
They made fun of my neckbeard.

1266
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm going to hate women forever and start a website.

1267
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,220
I can't believe that neckbeards became a thing.

1268
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:12,080
I actually had a neckbeard once when I was a teenager, just to be ridiculous.

1269
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,240
I'm like, I've never seen one of these before, ha ha ha.

1270
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,560
And then fast forward many, many years later, suddenly it's a thing now.

1271
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,620
A gross thing?

1272
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,820
And you gotta pair it with a fedora.

1273
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,660
I don't like it, but I'm hard-wired not to like it.

1274
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:33,320
By the way, there is a little bit left of this comment here that is almost as funny

1275
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:33,920
as what you've heard.

1276
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,760
Realistically, red pill reaction force would be far more effective than half the world's

1277
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,480
militaries.

1278
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,680
The Afghan military is fucked up on opium.

1279
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,880
The Iraqi army can't even do jumping jacks.

1280
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,220
Plus, New Zealand has only 8,000 military personnel.

1281
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,560
The majority of whom are useless paper pushers.

1282
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,880
I don't actually support the violent overthrow of New Zealand.

1283
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,740
I just think it's kind of a fun idea conceptually.

1284
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:04,720
But they make all those movies there about hobbits and things.

1285
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,360
I don't know why that has to be overthrown.

1286
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,860
They've got King Kong and a whole bunch of giant orcs and stuff.

1287
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,880
How are you going to fight them?

1288
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,540
And, as I said earlier, they have giant crickets.

1289
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,820
Not to mention all the sheep.

1290
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,300
Seriously, the sheep will put up a fight.

1291
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,080
Right.

1292
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:20,260
Right.

1293
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:20,620
Right.

1294
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1295
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1296
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1297
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1298
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1299
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1300
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1301
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1302
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:20,620


1303
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,200
And Ruthie Lawless could take out all these guys and win.

1304
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,040
Oh, yeah.

1305
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:24,840
Oh, yeah.

1306
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,420
All right.

1307
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,880
We're starting to get some of our callers back here.

1308
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,520
There.

1309
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,920
Actually, I think this is a new caller.

1310
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,760
One more try.

1311
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,340
Oh, hey.

1312
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,200
What's going on?

1313
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,440
Not much.

1314
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,320
We're just sitting around chewing the fat.

1315
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,360
You're supposed to know.

1316
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,120
You're supposed to know.

1317
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,360
I was curious why the ancient tradition of throwing stang in the pond was not adhered

1318
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,340
to during X-Day.

1319
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,900
We weren't anywhere near the pond.

1320
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,320
I walked into the pond myself.

1321
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,520
Followed by a...

1322
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,960
A number of delightful young ladies and young men.

1323
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,560
That's true.

1324
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,220
And then I dunked them in the pond over and over again.

1325
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,520
That's been the tradition ever since the year the conspiracy calls 1998.

1326
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,320
Yeah.

1327
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,920
Because I turned it around.

1328
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,520
How about them apples?

1329
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,460
Now I do the dunking and they do the kerplunking.

1330
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,560
He does the dunking and they're the donuts.

1331
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,360
All right.

1332
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,420
As a newcomer, you know, Reverend Peace feels very strongly we should go back to the traditional

1333
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:19,460
way of throwing.

1334
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,500
I haven't...

1335
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,600
I haven't thrown stang into the pond.

1336
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,260
And I think...

1337
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:23,680
Oh, okay.

1338
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,660
Well, why don't you do that?

1339
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,060
...and leave on side of that.

1340
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,500
I guess you better do that.

1341
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,400
Reverend Pease can't even spell his own title.

1342
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,260
Well, that's true, but that's part of the love and...

1343
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:33,600
He can't even.

1344
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,800
...in terms of that is Reverend Pease.

1345
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,100
All right.

1346
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,760
So, anyway, now I'm worried that...

1347
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,300
Hello?

1348
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,480
Hello?

1349
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,280
We're in the town.

1350
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,080
I'm told you to go away, okay, Ted?

1351
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,620
We're not letting you on anymore this week.

1352
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,200
We're not letting you on anymore this week.

1353
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,200
I'm told you to go away.

1354
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,760
Outside agitators.

1355
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,880
Agitators, witches, hippies, and Jews.

1356
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:56,640
And, by the way, I don't know, if somebody could, like, send a text to Princess Wee to

1357
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,380
tell her that I didn't mean to hang up on her, could someone tell, like, we and Philo

1358
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,220
and Dave that I did not mean to hang up on them?

1359
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,380
Yeah, I'll let them know.

1360
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,680
We have heard that kind of thing happen before.

1361
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,280
They've all done radio or been callers.

1362
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,900
It was going to be intentional that you were going to hang up on her.

1363
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,220
I said I was going to, but that was just an idle threat.

1364
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,160
It's kind of like back in the Cold War.

1365
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,120
We had that mutually assured destruction thing going on.

1366
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,600
Well, that's true.

1367
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,680
It was a challenging time.

1368
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,980
Nobody really intended to launch all the nukes.

1369
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,400
I was confident in the ability of my laminate desk to protect me from any nuclear fallout

1370
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,040
that was about to happen.

1371
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:33,900
Nuclear.

1372
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,380
You know.

1373
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,680
Grammar Nazi.

1374
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,500
Grammar Nazi.

1375
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,320
Ach du lieber, ein Stoller.

1376
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,040
It sounds like Andy Kaufman's on the phone.

1377
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,640
Well, look, we appreciate the contribution you've made.

1378
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:55,060
It seems to be voguing up the air a little bit, though, so we're going to...

1379
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,940
Okay, well, it was a pleasure myself.

1380
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,880
It was wonderful talking to all of you, and have a pleasant night.

1381
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,020
Oh, slacker.

1382
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,740
There was a guy who threw up, and we could do an update on him.

1383
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,980
Have a little patience, my God.

1384
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,980
Bob put it in Ayn Rand.

1385
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,060
We messed up.

1386
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,520
Oh, superstitious, eh?

1387
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,700
They don't deserve to know what's going on.

1388
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,620
Next time!

1389
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,580
Easy.

1390
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,380
So is this a...

1391
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,040
Stang, remember your blood pressure.

1392
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,620
Do you have to actually log into Facebook to view it?

1393
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,740
I'm afraid so.

1394
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,960
But I think Facebook is the most insidious tool the conspiracy ever came up with,

1395
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,640
and I will not touch it with a ten-foot pole.

1396
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:37,720
Then you're plum out of luck, and you're going to miss all them titty pictures from the Bob test.

1397
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,640
That's all there is to it.

1398
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:44,760
I'm not going to put it on subgenius.com only because that guy wanted me to.

1399
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,240
So much for that idea.

1400
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,000
Let's move on now.

1401
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,140
You see, he needed to...

1402
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,860
I see those pictures, and that's what makes it...

1403
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,960
Because he can't come to X-Day because he's too much of a wimp to come to X-Day.

1404
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,960
No offense, Dr. Simpson.

1405
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,760
If anything...

1406
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,260
If anything, the Facebook page should just link to the sub-site where the real information is stored.

1407
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,600
Yes, it should be completely reorganized.

1408
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,760
I can't agree more.

1409
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,620
That's just my opinion.

1410
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,680
We've got to start all over again.

1411
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,880
How about your opinion?

1412
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,640
You know, yours opinions is interesting to us.

1413
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,240
We need to know...

1414
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,780
I bet that was one of those people that...

1415
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,720
Are you mocking me, Hal?

1416
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,780
No, I'm just adding on that we...

1417
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,840
We welcome a great diversity of opinions here.

1418
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:29,020
The people who hate me for not working hard enough are usually the people who can't even spell Bob's name right.

1419
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,560
I hate Ivan Stang for not working hard enough.

1420
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:33,840
Right.

1421
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,500
I got your message, buddy.

1422
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,240
I'm going to remember your name is on a list now.

1423
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,100
Uh-oh.

1424
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,040
Uh-huh.

1425
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,460
Oh, yeah.

1426
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,160
Don't have to take steps, huh?

1427
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,640
Bob sees all, Bob knows all.

1428
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,580
And he tells his duly called ministers.

1429
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,540
The dirty laundry behind those little sad bobbies.

1430
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,580
Picking on hard-working old saintly Reverend Stang.

1431
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,920
The kindly, humble Reverend Stang.

1432
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,160
I have to take your laundry into Pomeroy.

1433
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,400
Who could care absolutely very much, could not care less...

1434
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,140
Thank you.

1435
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:14,640
...about what some subgenius wants to see on his subgenius internet.

1436
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,100
Or find underneath his subgenius Christmas tree.

1437
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:18,660
We have news.

1438
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,220
You can call her here.

1439
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,240
Hi, this is Reverend Andrew Genis.

1440
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,440
Reverend Andrew, did you get my Facebook message?

1441
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,480
I did, and I responded to it.

1442
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,040
It was a transposed area code.

1443
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,660
Well, I'll eagerly attend to that when I manage to get away from the world of radio.

1444
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,180
If she can tell us simply the correct area code, that won't reveal anything.

1445
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,340
Yes, tell that, and I'll add it.

1446
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,600
Okay.

1447
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,640


1448
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,640


1449
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,640


1450
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,640


1451
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,640


1452
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,680
You can go ahead and put it in my memorandum book.

1453
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,440
Yes, it would be 856, and that would be correct.

1454
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,240
So, there was a slight transcription error on my part?

1455
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:57,880
Was that the start of the card?

1456
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,760
Yeah, when you call 865, you get Satan and Hell, and they put your name on a book.

1457
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,960
Yeah, so it's 856.

1458
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,840
Okay, I thought that guy sounded very grumpy and unpleasant.

1459
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,540
I kept calling him.

1460
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,140
Now we know that you live somewhere in New Jersey, and we are going to start stalking you,

1461
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,880
because we know you live somewhere in New Jersey.

1462
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,400
Oh, my God.

1463
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,000
The Garden State.

1464
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,240
Only one of the most populated states.

1465
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,900
It's beautiful.

1466
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,500
It's a beautiful place.

1467
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,100
Reverend Andrew Genis, by the way, so the listeners and Dr. Sinister know,

1468
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,260
Reverend Andrew Genis is one of the mutant mountain boys, among other things.

1469
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:36,420
Yes.

1470
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:48,700
She did a great show at X Day of her spoken word stuff and her songs and her subgenius hit song,

1471
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,320
May Your Records Be Unbroken.

1472
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:57,400
So I was hearing intermittently some of the reports of X Day,

1473
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,600
and I really, really, really regret not being there for the whole time.

1474
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,960
You were there for the best part.

1475
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,360
Okay.

1476
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,120
No, it was cool.

1477
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,060
In my view.

1478
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,400
So there's always the next time, and it's a large target to hit.

1479
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:12,820
There's the next drill, yeah.

1480
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,220
I mean, you know what?

1481
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,480
It never works out.

1482
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,180
Like Bob, I don't know what his deal is, but, you know, I was there.

1483
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,020
I was waiting in mid-Pennsylvania.

1484
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,220
I went out in the field.

1485
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,260
I waited at 7 a.m.

1486
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:26,660
Oh.

1487
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,780
Nothing happened.

1488
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,300
We were out there, too, but I hope you had a good time at X Day.

1489
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,440
I did.

1490
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,280
Absolutely.

1491
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,160
Yeah, me too.

1492
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,060
Definitely.

1493
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,120
So, you see, it's a, what is it, an ill wind that blows nobody any good.

1494
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,480
Even if the saucers didn't actually descend, you know, they probably got all messed up.

1495
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,900
They are fallible.

1496
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,780
They're beings like anybody else.

1497
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,180
It could happen any second.

1498
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,080
It could happen this second.

1499
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,080
Or this.

1500
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,420
Oh, I already did that.

1501
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,300
Stop trying to scare.

1502
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,520
False alarm.

1503
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,800
You know, now that it all has happened or hasn't happened,

1504
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:14,900
I kind of like a breathing space before we all pony up for the next inflatable miracle that refuses to inflate.

1505
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,300
That's right.

1506
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:25,740
Let's get some breathing room here, and then we'll be able to face the future more steadfastly.

1507
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:26,920
Yes, yes.

1508
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,620
Absolutely.

1509
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:34,580
Reverend Andrew, you should know that when, was that really this very morning?

1510
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,280
Yes.

1511
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,640
Dr. Hal and the other doctors and I drove down to the stone circle to meet the gathered subgeniuses.

1512
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,320
They'd already been ruptured.

1513
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,280
Their empty clothes were scattered all around the stone circle.

1514
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:48,800
It's true.

1515
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:54,220
And we were feeling pretty left behind until we heard them giggling behind the trees.

1516
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,180
They were hiding.

1517
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,720
They played a trick on us.

1518
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,660
Hiding over in the poison ivy, snickering and giggling at us.

1519
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:00,940
Uh-oh.

1520
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,720
So.

1521
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,240
That's dessert for me.

1522
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:03,700
I don't know.

1523
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,560
No.

1524
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,900
But it was a good attempt to create variety instead of monotony.

1525
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,040
That's cool.

1526
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,420
I'm sorry I missed it.

1527
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,540
It was real where I was, you know.

1528
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,020
It was a drill.

1529
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,520
You cooperated.

1530
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,520
You went out.

1531
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,060
I did the best I could.

1532
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,260
And you know the saucers will come to get you wherever you are.

1533
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,760
They'll just get you first if you're at the landing site.

1534
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:35,120
And I'll be seeing you again at the devotional, which I think is August 15th.

1535
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:35,260
Yes.

1536
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:35,600
In Cleveland?

1537
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,200
Yes, you will.

1538
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,340
15th and 16th.

1539
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:41,900
And I might be a mountain boy that day.

1540
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,280
That would be good.

1541
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,160
We hope you can.

1542
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,480
I think so.

1543
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,240
We hope you can be a mountain.

1544
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,140
Wait a minute.

1545
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,840
That sounds funny.

1546
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,660
A mountain boy.

1547
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,640
Now you're getting it at last.

1548
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,140
Right.

1549
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,000
Well, you know.

1550
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,200
There's all those possibilities, you know.

1551
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,340
Absolutely.

1552
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,060
Why not both?

1553
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,480
That's what we say.

1554
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,400
That's our motto.

1555
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,480
Why not both?

1556
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,200
Wait.

1557
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,120
You might be a mountain boy.

1558
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,080
You might be a mountain boy.

1559
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,220
Was that the joke that you guys were making?

1560
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,440
Now you're getting it.

1561
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,400
See, apprehension is sometimes slow.

1562
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,580
He who laughs last.

1563
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,620
Laughs best.

1564
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,920
Thinks slowest.

1565
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,700
Oh, wow.

1566
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,440
Reverend Andrew, are you usually up at 10 minutes of midnight like this?

1567
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,600
Is this not somewhat late for you?

1568
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,240
Yes, it is.

1569
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,580
It's about 11.51 p.m.

1570
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,480
Well, what do you know about that?

1571
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,320
We're all in the same time zone together.

1572
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,720
That's pretty sexy.

1573
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,140
Feels very intimate.

1574
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,720
Unfortunately, think of all the other losers we're in the same time zone with.

1575
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,760
Millions of them.

1576
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,080
They're not tuned in.

1577
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,920
There's not that many phone lines.

1578
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,380
They can't all call in.

1579
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,600
Yes, we don't recommend that everyone in the state right now call WCSB.

1580
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,120
No, we would not want that to happen.

1581
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:00,020
No, that would be a brute force attack.

1582
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,460
It sounded like that had happened earlier in this very show.

1583
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,880
I'm glad we got away from that, where everyone would gabble at the same time

1584
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,800
and then stop at the same time, and there would be blobs of quietness interspersed.

1585
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,160
It was kind of a bit cacophony, though.

1586
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,520
Oh, you were listening.

1587
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,140
Okay, well, as long as you can tell.

1588
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,540
It's like a musical, you know, or something.

1589
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,900
I didn't know what you were saying, but it was art.

1590
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,200
Well, that's the problem.

1591
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,140
You see, my own theory is that for that to work,

1592
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,160
each voice has to be tremendously distinct from each other voice.

1593
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,480
When they resemble each other,

1594
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,460
it just sounds like...

1595
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,000
well, a lot of noise with little signal.

1596
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,300
You know what's going to happen?

1597
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,300
You've recorded this on a CD.

1598
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,180
CD?

1599
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,640
And hardly anybody uses CDs for anything anymore.

1600
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,660
Oh, yeah?

1601
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,720
The apocalypse is going to come.

1602
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,960
All the technology is going to be lost,

1603
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,400
but someone's going to find a CD player,

1604
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,780
and they're going to find this CD,

1605
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,720
and they're not going to have any of the voice recognition software that we have now.

1606
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,860
And people will have this CD wondering,

1607
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,820
and nobody will be speaking modern English anymore either, of course,

1608
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,440
because it's far off in the future.

1609
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,160
And people are going to spend centuries,

1610
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,500
trying to decipher what this noise is.

1611
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,280
They're going to be convinced there's some kind of a really profound deep message.

1612
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,620
They followed a god named Bob.

1613
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,000
Well, they have a lot of time on their hands in the future.

1614
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,080
Up time.

1615
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,840
It looks like they've solved some of the problems of leisure,

1616
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,920
the basis of culture.

1617
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:26,000
Now they can spend all their time with our old discs.

1618
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,360
It's so glad to hear the show taking this turn at this hour,

1619
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:32,960
since we are...

1620
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,120
Drawing to a close.

1621
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,600
Oh, yes, that's right.

1622
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,060
We have only a few precious more moments to squeeze out of this radio slot.

1623
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,420
Terrible.

1624
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,440
Well, I will let you do your official closing.

1625
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,560
All right, Andrew.

1626
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,680
Price Andrew.

1627
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,240
All right, so we...

1628
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,520
Andrew sounds like a girl.

1629
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,860
Well, you see, welcome to the present, Reverend Stan.

1630
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,580
Oh, yeah, I know.

1631
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,920
It's that gender blur again, but...

1632
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,240
Andrew Genis.

1633
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:02,860
Yeah.

1634
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:04,840
The subgenius.

1635
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,840
Now you're getting it again.

1636
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,480
More delayed appreciation.

1637
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,400
Yes.

1638
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,740
So, I guess that wraps it up.

1639
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:20,000
We've said just about all we can say about X-Day, storms, the entire Megillah.

1640
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:25,380
And we had Dr. Philo Drummond, of course, lonesome cowboy Dave,

1641
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:31,320
Reverend Andrew Genis, and many others who qualified our comment.

1642
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,940
Well, for...

1643
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,780
Thank you very much for visiting us today.

1644
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:41,320
And again, yeah, I'm sorry, last week, I proposed that they replace the porta-potties with the wormhole.

1645
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:41,980
Right.

1646
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,060
Boy, you'd never hear the end of it.

1647
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,720
And, you know, the same band who brought us that song, I recently discovered another song by them this week,

1648
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,600
which I think is almost as ingenious.

1649
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,980
So, I think I'm going to close with that song.

1650
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,360
This is by the Toilet Bowl Cleaners.

1651
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,500
And I hope you enjoy it.

1652
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,060
Well, we were lying in a field

1653
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,180
Just staring at the clouds

1654
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:02,940
And telling you that we're not alone

1655
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,400
Telling each other what they looked like

1656
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,840
She said, that cloud over there

1657
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,620
Kinda looks like a house

1658
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,620
And I said, that cloud over there

1659
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,460
Kinda looks like a mouse

1660
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,520
And then I started thinking

1661
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,160
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1662
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,800
You know, you could do the same thing

1663
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,920
With your poo

1664
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,120
So I said, baby, let's go

1665
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,980
Poop in a toilet

1666
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,920
Stare at it and see

1667
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,520
What it resembles

1668
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,400
If we wipe our butts

1669
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,920
The toilet paper should go into our...

1670
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,400
Barrel

1671
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,380
Cause if we put it in the toilet

1672
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,140
It would cover up the poop

1673
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,460
And ruin everything

1674
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,280
It would ruin everything

1675
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,820
Everything

1676
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,060
Well, she was into it

1677
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,380
And we broke up

1678
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,560
And almost instantly

1679
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,080
I woke up

1680
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,520
I realized that I never loved her

1681
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,020
I went home and pooped

1682
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,540
And stared at it for hours and hours

1683
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:02,360
And I was...

1684
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,340
I was...

1685
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,420
Hours and hours

1686
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,220
I stared at it for hours and hours

1687
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:20,000

01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,160
Praise Bob.

1689
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,360
We fucked up!

1690
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,140
We fucked up!

1691
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,080
We fucked up!

1692
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,120
Fuck a clown!

1693
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,460
Fuck a clown!

1694
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,700
Fuck a clown!

1695
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:32,900
Fuck a clown!
