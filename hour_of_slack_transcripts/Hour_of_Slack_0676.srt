1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
A closer look in this ancient Mayan tomb reveals a large plate.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:09,220
The plate is a ceremonial dish containing figurines from around the empire.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,980
Some look like subgeniuses, some look like sub-morons, others are barely visible.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,720
But when you unwrap the wrappings from the desiccated mummy,

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,300
and apply the tanner leaves,

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,860
and chant Yartrathor three times,

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,900
the tanner leaves,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,540
and place the pipe in the lips, the shrunken, shriveled lips of the skull-faced mummy,

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,800
and he will grin, his flesh will fill out, he will swell up and expand,

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,380
he will balloon out, and soon the salesman shall walk among us again.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,340
Bring him back to life, and we will bring to him his bride.

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,840
Soon the world...

13
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,160
would be filled with salesmen.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,360
Caucasian, pipe-smoking, salesmen.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,620
Selling to each other, and buying from each other.

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,720
A prediction of an ideal world, or the rantings and babblings of a madman.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,240
Much schnell.

18
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,580
Much schnell.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,300
Thank you.

You're so genius.

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,420
Our house to watch.

23
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,760
We'll see you all again.

Mighty Warrior

28
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,260
For the legend of the Gepardians

29
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,180
For the struggle of my land must be

30
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,320
Mighty Warrior

31
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,400
For the legend of the Gepardians

32
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,580
For the struggle of my land must be

33
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,180
Free

34
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,960
Ah yes

35
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,960
Ah yes

36
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,920
Dear friends

37
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,880
That music was Rhapsody

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,260
Rhapsody, Warriors of Ice

39
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,980
Now this is what my friend Pope Sternodonts sent to me

40
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,360
He sent me this whole tape full of Scandinavian and European death metal

41
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,240
And I said, well, I don't know

42
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,840
Rare stuff

43
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,980
And he wrote descriptions of everything

44
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,060
And he says, Italian power metal

45
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,160
Right on

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,040
These dudes take the Halloween

47
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,120
Slash Blind Guardian power metal sound one step further

48
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,040
The first time I heard this

49
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,720
I liked to crack up

50
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,460
Then suddenly it hit me

51
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,520
These dudes are virtuosos and a half

52
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,980
I walked around for weeks singing

53
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,800
Mighty Warriors

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,620
After playing this a couple of times

55
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,240
For the legend of the Gepardians

56
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,000
For some reason

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,800
There is a load of Italian power metal bands

58
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
Playing stuff just like this

59
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Check out the Bob Dang guitar solo

60
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, that's what we did

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,100
That's what we just did

62
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,820
Rhapsody

63
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,400
An Italian power metal band

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,640
You never know what you're going to hear on the Hour of Slack

65
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,200
Such as this background music by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

66
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,920
Ah, yes

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,220
Oh, how about this?

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,540
That's Michelle on the violin in the background there

69
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,780
We had some kind of bad clipping noise there

70
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,420
Which causes this to be relegated to background music, I'm afraid

71
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,640
But at least it's better than nothing

72
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,520
Because, you know, what have we got here?

73
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,100
For the show tonight, friends

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,520
We've got a lot of tape

75
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,180
We've got a 1.45 caliber automatic

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,360
We've got one combination Russian phrasebook and Gideon Bible

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,180
$100 in rubles

78
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,560
$100 in gold

79
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,520
One package of prophylactics

80
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,700
One pack chewing gum

81
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,940
Three lipsticks

82
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,760
One pair of nylon shoes

83
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,960
A feller could have a pretty good weekend in Dallas with all this stuff

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,600
And friends, the next time you watch Dr. Strangelove

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,160
Watch Slim Pickens' lips

86
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,540
He did say Dallas

87
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,220
He did say Dallas

88
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,220


89
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,220


90
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,220


91
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,220


92
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,820
Not Vegas

93
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,280
But Dallas had become an offending word

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,540
Between the time the movie Dr. Strangelove was shot in 1963

95
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,260
And released the following year

96
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,920
They just couldn't bring themselves to say Dallas

97
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,420
Terry Southern had one word to say when he

98
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,360
He's a Texan

99
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,360
The late Terry Southern who wrote that film

100
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,180
He had one word to say when he heard of the substitution

101
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,340
But it won't be repeated here

102
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,960
Friends, uh

103
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,240
I wish for the luck plane to be tilted towards you

104
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,240
You, the listener, at all times

105
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,640
And may she, for luck is a lady

106
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:15,880
Be a sheeny, scratch-free surface of complete safety and love at all times

107
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,200
Never slippery

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,560
Except in the places you want lubrication to be

109
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,160
Go and do whatever

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,560
Whatever

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:24,940
Whatever

112
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:24,940


113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
The hell you want

114
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,900
And may Connie, Bob, and all the elder and newer gods

115
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,120
Up to and beyond the time stream of this invoking

116
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,340
Spare you their hate and or wrath

117
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,980
And or any attention they may pay to you

118
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,080
That would cause you and or your loved ones harm

119
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,840
Unnecessary panic or even inconvenience

120
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,160
Unless, well, never mind

121
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,100
And slapped be

122
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,940
Praise Bob

123
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,020
Amen

124
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,440
Yes, friends, it feels good to hear them cranking away in the background

125
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,200
ESO

126
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,360
And that benediction there with which we open this holy religious show

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,620
Was written by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,000
Who begins so many, so many

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,560
Hours of slack

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,340
So many

131
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,540
This is Hour of Slack

132
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,940
600 hours

133
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
And 76

134
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,200
10 shows past the number of the beast

135
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,900
It's Chaz Smith

136
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,940
And I'm Dr. J. Schultz

137
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:54,940


138
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,640
Michelle George, Ron Slabe, and Jeff Rosenbaum,

139
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,260
the last two from Ace, in the background.

140
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,860
Friends, there's an interesting...

141
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,760
Well, I'm going to get back into show, but I have to tell...

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
No, I don't. Let's just go straight into show.

143
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Okay.

144
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,560
Okay.

145
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,700
July 8, 1979, all the fathers of Nobel Prize winners

146
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,300
were rounded up by United Nations military units, all right,

147
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,320
and actually forced at gunpoint to give semen samples

148
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,080
in little plastic jars, which are now stored

149
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,980
below Rockefeller Center, underneath the ice skating rink.

150
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,080
We want to be there for the thaw.

151
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

152
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Ugh.

153
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,620
I mean, it's disgusting.

154
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,340
You know what they put in the water, don't you?

155
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,980
Fluoride.

156
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,680
Yeah, fluoride.

157
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,360
On the pretext that it strengthens your teeth.

158
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,120
That's ridiculous.

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
You know what this stuff does?

160
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,200
It does to you?

161
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,260
It actually weakens your will,

162
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,420
takes away the capacity for free and creative thought,

163
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,700
and makes you a slave to the state.

164
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,660
All right.

165
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,140
What, what, what?

166
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,580
What, what, what?

167
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,400
Okay, well, this is, of course...

168
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,960
This is an update, ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,320
This just in from Dallas, Texas.

170
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
Park, the Lord Jesus.

171
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,900
The Lord, this is the Lord.

172
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,780
This, I just, this was slipped into the back of today's paper,

173
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,060
probably the most important event ever.

174
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,560
It will be, at least in this century...

175
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,280
Look out!

176
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,160
We must get off!

177
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,420
Dave was just talking ten minutes ago on this tape

178
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,580
I was playing about a plutonium storm

179
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,020
that we did that Tuesday night.

180
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,620
We recorded this improv thing that I'm playing right now.

181
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,280
And I just wrote it down because I thought it was a great little word phrase.

182
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,100
And Dave just, was just talking about...

183
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,840
That there was a plutonium, plutonium storm.

184
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,300
That's right.

185
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,260
You guys are psychics.

186
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,740
You've predicted the future.

187
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,180
Okay.

188
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,420
Okay.

189
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,880
So what happened?

190
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,900
Let me just read it from AP Newswire here.

191
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,560
Sure.

192
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
Tiny Pluto slips outside of the orbit of Neptune today

193
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,400
to resume its role as the farthest planet from the sun.

194
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,780
Normally the most distant planet, Pluto has an unusual orbit

195
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,360
that takes 248 Earth years to complete.

196
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,020
Pluto moved inside...

197
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,600
Well, let me get to the punchline.

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,140
Pluto will remain the most distant planet for the next 228 years.

199
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,540
You see, Pluto used to be the eighth planet.

200
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,240
Right.

201
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,780
It is now the ninth planet.

202
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,840
When I was growing up, it was always the ninth planet.

203
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,040
Well, it used to be the eighth planet.

204
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,860
In fact, it's moved so far away,

205
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,300
they're now taking a vote on whether or not to even call it a planet.

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,300
Well, it's a pathetic little dingleberry of a planet.

207
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,840
It's like when I pulled out of my dog's...

208
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,500
Parn.

209
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:49,700
Parn.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Parn.

211
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,400


212
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,420
It's not a real...

213
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,700
They're trying to demote it.

214
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,940
That's exactly what they're trying to do.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,400
They're trying to demote it from a planet to a asteroid.

216
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
Not an asteroid.

217
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,320
No.

218
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,040
A hemorrhoid.

219
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,680
It is like a hemorrhoid asteroid.

220
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,120
It is.

221
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,920
Well, I was just saying it was like a dingleberry.

222
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
It started the plutonium storm.

223
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,240
It's like a dingleberry of Uranus, you know?

224
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,580
Dave.

225
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,120
Here it is.

226
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,480
Here it is.

227
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,460
They're trying to demote it to the status of dingleberry.

228
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,240
You're absolutely right.

229
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,440
That's the correct phrase.

230
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,340
To the status of a lowly dingleberry.

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,900
A dingleberry of Uranus.

232
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,240
Dave, you predicted the other night that there would be a plutonium storm.

233
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,240
Yes.

234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,980
And it's happening right now.

235
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,220
Where is it happening right now?

236
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,820
It's such a big storm.

237
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,580
It knocked it completely to the ninth planet.

238
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,340
Now I've got to memorize the planets again.

239
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,140
Well, you never knew the names of the planets to begin with.

240
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,240
I remember you were calling Venus Oxgalit.

241
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,780
Pluto's not a planet.

242
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,220
I don't know how to memorize things in order.

243
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,780
Now, Neptune's a planet.

244
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,980
But Pluto, you know, it's just that rock out there.

245
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,420
It's a cold, dead rock.

246
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,040
Hmm.

247
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,640
As far as we know.

248
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,780
As far as we know.

249
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,760
They think that...

250
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,620
Yeah, there may be superconducting, you know, elements in Pluto

251
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,000
which make it a far more intelligent mind than any human could ever hope to be.

252
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,360
So you think Pluto is a vast, hemorrhoidic brain?

253
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,060
Yeah, but it'd be a really bored one, I would think,

254
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,800
unless it's able to sense radio and signals, you know.

255
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,060
But that huge, humongous creature belt supposedly goes on and on

256
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,160
for thousands and thousands of middle clanks off into the universe.

257
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
I mean, it goes further.

258
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
That belt you're talking about,

259
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,040
they're trying to stick lowly Pluto as a dingleberry into.

260
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,520
The Klipler belt.

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,420
The Klipler belt.

262
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,140
I'd like to give you a whipping with that belt.

263
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,380
And I'll take the bleep, oh, and I'll beat this Alpha Centauri of four.

264
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,440
There goes the clanking in the head.

265
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,860
It's the Scottish bunny Princess Wee.

266
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,880
She's riding that Plutonian storm.

267
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Greeting Princess Wee.

268
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,220
She's a really Plutonian stormer.

269
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,020
She put up her sails for the Plutonium.

270
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:49,680
Plutonium storm.

271
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,100
Yeah.

272
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,000
Is that another false alarm, or is there really one going on?

273
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,080
There is one, and you should wear sunglasses.

274
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,640
Here it is.

275
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,420
Here's the sound of it.

276
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,340
You should go outside in a hat.

277
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,780
Sunglasses and hats.

278
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,700
This is a gas.

279
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,980
That's during the night.

280
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,140
If you go out at daytime, just wrap yourself up in aluminum foil.

281
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,720
This is gas music from Pluto.

282
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,780
Tonight on Secrets of Space.

283
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,100
Right here.

284
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,980
It was just fading out.

285
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,400
A confused recycling engineer takes his final vow

286
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,080
and does not to think of what it may have.

287
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,780
Snip, snip.

288
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:17,880
Snip.

289
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,860
Gas music from Pluto.

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,060
Oh, wait.

291
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,960
I've got the gas music.

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,300
Lord?

293
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,220
Yes, sir.

294
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,540
Are you still there, Lord?

295
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm still there.

296
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,480
I was listening to the antics of ESO radio.

297
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,380
As far as I know, we're offline tonight.

298
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,520
You're off.

299
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,760
Yeah, I did try to get online.

300
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,300
That's an interesting story in itself.

301
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,960
Did you know that your college...

302
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,380
Here's the gas music.

303
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,180
...doesn't own its own...

304
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,620
Wait.

305
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:38,940
Here.

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,940
I tuned it in.

307
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,340
Here.

308
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,960
I have the special disc that can tune it in.

309
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,040
Gas music from Pluto, ladies and gentlemen.

310
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,700
I've got a decoder ring.

311
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,120
Should we go out there and start channeling so far?

312
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,640
The energy's coming off of Pluto.

313
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,080
That is a microphone that is on the Voyager spacecraft,

314
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,740
which is still picking up things.

315
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,240
Okay, I've got my decoder going.

316
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,380
I've got my Macintosh.

317
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,660
It's running like mad.

318
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,040
Okay, it says...

319
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,580
It's a medically sealed in one of them aluminum foil...

320
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,600
It's a looping message.

321
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,980
It says, get off.

322
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,460
My brain must get off now.

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,120
My brain must get off now.

324
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,760
My brain must get off now.

325
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:17,760


326
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:17,760


327
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,120
Your phone!

328
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,360
Look out.

329
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,660
With.

330
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:19,820
With.

331
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,140
Down.

332
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,280
Look out.

333
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:31,920
Look out.

334
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,080
To the vent...

335
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,340
Need to take a ride?

336
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,780
So, we're gonna get those headphones off?

337
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,060
Yes, we are.

338
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,680
Is it suffer packaging?

339
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,060
to attack

340
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,860
to attack

341
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,300
to attack

342
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,820
Go, go to sleep

343
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,900
and dream of pleasure ships

344
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,600
from high above

345
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,920
on July 5th

346
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,880
this year

347
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,580
Go to sleep

348
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,060
and dream of flying out

349
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,940
on lullabies

350
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,980
and dreams that far has none

351
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,800
Go, go to sleep

352
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,260
and dream of times

353
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,180
when we will meet

354
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,920
to sing

355
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,900
and praise the name

356
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,380
of Bob

357
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,600
Go to sleep

358
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:38,660
and dream of times

359
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,640
we will know

360
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,320
where the scars

361
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,700
come from

362
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:48,700


363
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:48,700


364
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,400
the animals

365
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,440
will be

366
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,440


367
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,320
Will keep allegorically

368
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,380
the snake

369
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,560
to drag

370
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,460
Take a look

371
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:55,840
First to the

372
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,120
rest of the

373
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,520
to the grave

374
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,040
then it's

375
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:10,380
The smiling face of Bob will keep you safe until next day.

376
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:21,680
Safe until next day. Safe until next day.

377
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,180
END

378
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,400
If you'll turn the machine on.

379
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,920
Are we getting through?

380
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Is anything happening?

381
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,200
I mean, will they...

382
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,200
Will you turn the right knobs?

383
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,240
I mean, we're on the air.

384
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,620
Is that good?

385
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,680
Oh, you say we're getting there.

386
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,600
Oh, fine.

387
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,000
Good.

388
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,500
Any minute now.

389
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,660
Please be patient.

390
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,780
I mean, it's very difficult

391
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,140
to come through.

392
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,060
We can't contact outer space.

393
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,060
Oh, now they're coming through.

394
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,080
Here they are.

395
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,460
Wait.

396
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,260
The questions will come any minute now.

397
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,840
Here they are.

398
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,400
Why, of course.

399
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,940
Yes, we have

400
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,400
many, many women

401
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,940
here on Earth.

402
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,340
They're beautiful, actually.

403
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
They're different

404
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,620
from men.

405
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,140
In fact,

406
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,040
women are

407
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,700
extremely important to us

408
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,340
here on Earth.

409
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,080
I hope that that answers your question.

410
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,540
But

411
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,380
is there anything else that you'd like to know?

412
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,420
Well, I told you about the women.

413
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:49,920
I mean,

414
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,720
you know, you're repeating

415
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,580
the same question.

416
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,580
Maybe you don't have anything.

417
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:54,600
You're repeating the same thing

418
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,160
like that where you are.

419
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,100
By the way,

420
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,800
how are things

421
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,140
where you are?

422
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,060
Oh, I see.

423
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,340
Well, I'm sorry

424
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,140
I brought that up.

425
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,680
Is there

426
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,240
anything else

427
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,100
that you'd like to know?

428
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh, well,

429
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,740
temperature here is

430
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,440
very, very nice right now,

431
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,060
actually.

432
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,360
It's been very hot,

433
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,100
especially for the time of year.

434
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,400
We like our weather.

435
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,780
We're very pleased with it.

436
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,840
It's been one of the warmest winters

437
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,340
we've ever had.

438
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,140
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that it's been so hot where you are.

439
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,680
Well, that's the way things are, you know.

440
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,040
I'm sorry to hear that it's been so hot where you are.

441
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,240
Oh, by the way,

442
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,580
I'm interested in knowing

443
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,560
if you have

444
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,280
hydrogen bombs

445
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
where you are.

446
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,260
Oh, I can tell

447
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,620
by the way you said that.

448
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,400
Is there anything that you'd like to give

449
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,540
to us

450
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,660
as a message

451
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,060
from outer space that

452
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,160
would mean something?

453
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,020
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that you're

454
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,000
so frightened of us.

455
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,560
There's no reason.

456
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,260
These are little attempts

457
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,440
of science.

458
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,840
We have absolutely no intention

459
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,120
to do anything.

460
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,560
Don't you ever wonder about all these militia groups?

461
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,160
Survivalist type kooks on the right wing side?

462
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,460
They say that they're defending the country

463
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,800
from the UN troops.

464
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,640
These guys are yelling so loud.

465
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,940
My theory is, and this is a conspiracy, pal,

466
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,860
that they are the UN troops

467
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,000
and that they're in place.

468
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,000
The infrastructure's ready.

469
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,980
It's just a fading company.

470
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,940
When the time comes, they'll just take over

471
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,620
and we'll all be toast.

472
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,120
Oswald, yeah, Oswald.

473
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,000
That's what I said, Oswald.

474
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,720
He said, I'm just a patsy, and that means

475
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,760
that he didn't do it, right?

476
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,180
I'll tell you something about Armand Hammer.

477
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,620
Goes to the doctor, and the doctor said,

478
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,540
Hey, Armand, you've only got one day left.

479
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,800
You've got three minutes to live.

480
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,760
And he says, Oh, my God, that's terrible news.

481
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,880
Isn't there anything you can do for me, doc?

482
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,780
Three minutes.

483
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,840
And the doctor says, Well, Armand,

484
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
I can boil you an egg.

485
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,240
I guess not.

486
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,480
All right.

487
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,700
What is commonly referred to as the pyramid inch,

488
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,220
which is not only a cosmic number and measurement,

489
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,600
but also a cosmic number and measurement,

490
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,100
which predicts the end of time as we know it

491
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,800
as 552,000,

492
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,060
but they have numbers incorrectly on it.

493
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,520
See, it's 752,000.

494
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,140
It's 7599.

495
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,940
David, you sound like a chimpanzee teaching math class,

496
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,020
teaching the seventh grade math class.

497
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,060
What would be more appropriate in the world we live in today

498
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,940
than to have, like, perhaps a mackerel hanging from the top of your head

499
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,980
while you're playing basketball?

500
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,780
A chimpanzee should be allowed, not only,

501
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,440
should be foresworn to do his duty and teach math to the modern smudge

502
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,840
because they have no idea how the real Bulu would be

503
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,860
and the architecture goes.

504
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,800
You know, one of these days, Dave,

505
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,400
you're going to start making sense to me.

506
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,300
I did. I did.

507
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,260
When you play the tieback, it makes sense.

508
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,060
It just doesn't do us a whole hell of a lot of good right now.

509
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,460
I just said that chimpanzees should teach math because they're smarter.

510
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,840
And sexy, too.

511
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
Well, I've been going that way for a long time.

512
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,200
And I think most people that are listening agree.

513
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,740
You've been swinging from the trees, as they say?

514
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,400
Yeah, I've been the Assyrian slammer since I was 24.

515
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,760
I first met my first baboon, I think it was in Calgary.

516
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,300
Hey, did you also hear the scientific news that they think one of the venera

517
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,760
and the zond spacecrafts that landed on Venus?

518
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,880
The Mons Venera?

519
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,300
The Venera?

520
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,460
The Mons Venera.

521
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,440
The Venera 2 and 3 were launched back in 1965, I think it was.

522
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,820
And the zond, the big zond, was launched even earlier, 64,

523
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,040
and those landed on Venus.

524
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,340
The zond.

525
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,180
Are you sure this isn't, this sounds like Scientology to me.

526
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,000
No, zond.

527
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,280
The great god zond landed on the planet Venus.

528
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,040
No, we had, like, we had the Mercury, I mean the Saturn 5 rocket.

529
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,440
They called their Saturn 5 the zond.

530
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,760
That was their moon ship.

531
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,580
Ah, the zond.

532
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,180
Yeah, that was their...

533
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,500
So it drifted out of orbit and smacked into Venus?

534
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,180
It landed on the dark side of Venus.

535
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,700
Oh my god.

536
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,100
And the other one landed on the opposite, the sunny side of Venus.

537
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,400
And now they...

538
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,340
Now they battle for domination of Venus?

539
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,160
Well, after years of them being...

540
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,340
They only lasted a few minutes while they were there on the surface before they were fried.

541
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,580
Well, all of a sudden, we're starting to get messages from those probes.

542
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,880
What?

543
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,460
Yeah.

544
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,240
They reactivated?

545
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,980
Yeah, somehow on their own.

546
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,760
That's another prediction that out...

547
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,420
That's definitely a sign.

548
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,660
Princess, we...

549
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,080
That is the message.

550
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,240
You're the queen of the UFOs.

551
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,660
You, you, you look into it.

552
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,460
You explain it.

553
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,940
What are these messages?

554
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,420
I can look into it, but you know these things cannot always be revealed.

555
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,320
But Venus, we know that Venus is inhabited by a race of space creatures.

556
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,440
Yes, the planet Rets.

557
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
Have you heard of the planet Rets?

558
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,020
No.

559
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,540
Sri Paul Twitchell in his book, The Ancient Science of Ekankar, explained that the city

560
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,260
of Rets contained many, many beautiful, beautiful women.

561
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,020
Ah, Ek.

562
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,360
Sri Paul Mitchel, he is the holy Ek master.

563
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,060
Yes, and he said there were babes of plenty up there, too.

564
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,520
And he's asked...

565
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,960
Bob Dobbs is the holy Drek master of Drekankar.

566
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,820
Well, what's the difference?

567
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,940
There's none at all, just the spelling.

568
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,900
Well, I think...

569
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,320
There is no spelling.

570
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,320


571
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,140
There's more like negative sound to it, like dregs of humanity, like Bob might be

572
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,520
some sort of alcoholic underneath the whole thing and can't really keep books...

573
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,160
No.

574
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,280
No?

575
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,460
Drekankar, you've heard of that.

576
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,800
No, I haven't.

577
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,200
Three Darwin Dobbs, they teach the art of mystic soul travel.

578
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,740
They believe that the soul is in the foot and it's supposed to travel to the seat of

579
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,540
the soul of the next person.

580
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,760
That's why...

581
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,580
It's also called ass kicking for Bob.

582
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,000
I thought it was licking.

583
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,120
I believe I've heard of it.

584
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,140
I thought it was chicken licking.

585
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,860
And here all the time, you know, I was doing that.

586
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,700
Speaking of chicken licking, now, you know...

587
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,260
It is.

588
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,340
That little chicken ran around saying, the sky is falling, the sky is falling, and was

589
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,520
sort of crying wolf, so to speak.

590
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,440
And yet today, when we say the sky is falling, we literally mean it.

591
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,060
On July 5th, 1999, this very year, the sky will fall.

592
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,360
Nostradamus himself predicted it.

593
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
And how would he...

594
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,740
Well, the thing is, though, how do we know that Nostradamus' persuasions have anything

595
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,420
to do with reality?

596
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,180
Because so many of them...

597
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,360
I mean, history was kind of on the money, but as we float out here in a giant gas bag,

598
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,700
you know, it doesn't seem to make that much sense.

599
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,260
It seemed to...

600
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,880
I think he screwed up a lot.

601
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,400
Well, next year, you're going to be saying the Bible doesn't make sense, or Book of the

602
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,840
Subgenius doesn't make sense.

603
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,680
Well, if I think Simeon should be teaching higher math, how could I think the Bible makes

604
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,140
any sense?

605
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,360
I mean, I...

606
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,780
Well, I was going to ask you that very question, Mr. Lonesome Sea Dave.

607
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,720
Well, on the same lines, I do believe in the Bible...

608
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,460
I mean, the Apocrypha of Bobbin, the Church of the Subgenius, because it makes the same

609
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,600
sense as the monkeys does.

610
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,720
In the same fashion, they...

611
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,740
Well, I guess you're right.

612
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:46,860
I got one letter today that said that Revelation X was full of hate, 180 pages of hate.

613
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,980
We have a movie...

614
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,760
Actually, there's only 178 pages of hate.

615
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,100
The Church is a Church of the Subgenius.

616
00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:00,600
I saw a license plate today that said F-R-E-E, the number two, and the letters H-T.

617
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,400
Well, now, see, you sent me an email about that.

618
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,480
You said that to you that meant free to hate.

619
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,180
Yeah.

620
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,580
Now, when I saw that on your email, to me, the first thing I thought of was free to hits.

621
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,620
Me too.

622
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,260
Yeah.

623
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,080
I thought it was frustrated hemophiliac thermo monkey, whatever it was.

624
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,580
Well, now, see, it's like the book of the subgenius.

625
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,300
It's whatever you read into it.

626
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,260
You read into it what is the deepest thing in your heart.

627
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,120
Relevant interpretation.

628
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,140
And Chaz, obviously, was full of hate.

629
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,560
Hate.

630
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,640
Free to hate.

631
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,660
And Princess Wee was full of pills.

632
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
And I was free of nuclear flil.

633
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,980
Poor Dave was full of hemorrhoidal tissue.

634
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,400
Nuclear flil.

635
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,080
You know, the Earth...

636
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,880
The Earth...

637
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,240
The Earth books around the sun at 18 and a half miles per second.

638
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,240


639
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,720
We're moving.

640
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,320
Our spaceship is moving at 18 and a half miles per second.

641
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,460
You know, that would explain that vertigo I was having.

642
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,600
That would explain why my navel's back where my spinal column used to be.

643
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,300
Of course, I don't have much of a spinal column left.

644
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,420
We must be going pretty fast.

645
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
But how fast is the sun moving?

646
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,220
And relative to what?

647
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,980
Oh, relative to the center of the galaxy, I'm sure the sun is probably moving at hundreds

648
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,400
of thousands of inches per second.

649
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,640
Oh, yeah, that's right.

650
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,760
Yeah, it's looking pretty quick.

651
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,220
Because it goes up and down.

652
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,360
It goes all the way around the galaxy every...

653
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,140
I think it's like 400,000 years.

654
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,120
Oh, man.

655
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,680
Wow.

656
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,420
A drop in the bucket.

657
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:23,660
Yeah.

658
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,080
A tiny shaping off the great beard of time.

659
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah.

660
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,620
If we could go there and back on a razor's edge in supernal time and so forth like they

661
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,380
predicted about, and we came back, and then 5,000 years would be one aeon of a god's time.

662
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,320
And by the time we come back to Earth, we would look like babies, and there would be

663
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,560
new gods on the planet.

664
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,340
Wait, wait, wait.

665
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,080
Earth, Earth, Earth.

666
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,200
Earth, Earth, Earth.

667
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,420
Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth, Earth.

668
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,060
I mean, that's kind of like saying smoke cigarettes or drive cars.

669
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,140
I mean, it's real generic.

670
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,660
It's like this guy looks at me and he says to me, do you think you're living in a free

671
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,000
country?

672
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Do you think this is a democracy?

673
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,480
Of course it's not.

674
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,360
Websites, newsletters, self-published manifestos, they think we're kooks.

675
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,500
I mean, George Bush knew what he was saying when he said new world order.

676
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,300
Remember those great little words, new world order?

677
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,180
Well, he was right.

678
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


679
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


680
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


681
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


682
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


683
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


684
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


685
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


686
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


687
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


688
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:16,180


689
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,720
He was a 33rd degree mason, you know, and his ex-director of the CIA.

690
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,080
He was a lawyer, and was a lawyer in his own right.

691
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,680
Yep, that's clueless.

692
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,000
Check it out.

693
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,160
I mean, history has already been said.

694
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:28,460
First, but first, friends, you must first send your love to Bob.

695
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,460
Yes.

696
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Well, I should probably tell you what we've been listening at here.

697
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:42,260
Einstein's Secret Orchestra on the radio, Swamp Radio, broadcast on WCSB Cleveland.

698
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:53,360
Cleveland, and with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz Smith, the maestro there, the violins of Michelle George,

699
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,920
and Princess Wiardo, and Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, as guests.

700
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,340
And a little bit of clips there from Conspiracy Theory, the movie with Mel Gibson,

701
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,220
in which Mel Gibson plays a character that I'm convinced is based on Lonesome Cowboy.

702
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,100
Cowboy Dave.

703
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:25,460
And then the older-sounding outer space routine was the man's voice talking to the aliens on side one

704
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:37,400
was Ken Nordean, the great Ken Nordean, one of the earliest home studio indie...

705
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,920
What?

706
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,340
Well, then we come back and there'd be a whole bunch of...

707
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,160
We've been around. The Earth has been around the galaxy 16 times since it was formed.

708
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,100
The Earth has?

709
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah. Our solar system has made its round around the galaxy.

710
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,580
Who's been counting?

711
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,860
I can only remember about three.

712
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,120
Carl Sagan told me that.

713
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,540
Three back.

714
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,120
Carl Sagan, he counted about 14 of them.

715
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,080
You were around for the second trip around, weren't you?

716
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,780
And the seventh.

717
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:18,120
Well, supposedly, if we follow the same rules of correction where our feet fit in like the dinosaur prints

718
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:25,120
and we see the spectral illusion of ourself like Pluto, what you were talking about, and the sun particularly...

719
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,380
I'm sorry. I lost my train of thought there.

720
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:31,440
The escape velocity, the velocity we're going to need to get off.

721
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,020
That's it.

722
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:38,280
The velocity we need to get off is 6.94 miles per second.

723
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,880
We're going to need a lot of thrust to get off.

724
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That's equal to the speed with which...

725
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,740
Dave's memories leave him.

726
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,580
Yeah.

727
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,220
That's Dave's escape velocity.

728
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,640
Yeah, that's the...

729
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,060
It reminded me of what I was thinking of before, and then it was gone again.

730
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,140
Jeff, how goes the rocket building?

731
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,560
How many feet per second are you up to?

732
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,560
Well, we're not sure.

733
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,560
We're going to have a lot of testing to do when the weather gets...

734
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,740
Now, you're saying that the military is going to have a problem if we launch any rocket more than 100,000 miles?

735
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,920
100,000 feet, which is...

736
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,240
Well, we don't want to accidentally set off...

737
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,680
That's the Russians' early warning system, which would then set off ours.

738
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,840
So, I mean, should we just go ahead and just do it, or should we contact somebody?

739
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,260
Well, they're pretty much just made out of cardboard, so...

740
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,140
Yeah.

741
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,100
I don't know.

742
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,620
I think maybe they're stealthy, because they're just made out of cardboard.

743
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,760
Well, you're thinking, J.C., it's totally for a subgenius to think about,

744
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,940
hey, whose airspace am I going to violate?

745
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,040
Yeah, I have to...

746
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,160
Well, as business manager of the church to the subgenius, I have to worry about, yeah, the...

747
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:48,660
Yes, you have to, but as the official spouter, staying most in-sconsious to go out there and violate them airspace.

748
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,780
Well, yeah, yeah, I guess...

749
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,460
Who does it belong to?

750
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,380
In reality, to get up to 100,000 feet, you'd have to have something...

751
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,960
You'd have to steal something from NASA.

752
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,100
Yeah, the...

753
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,840
Deal your own ship.

754
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,660
Jesus was saying that himself.

755
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,680
Deal your own ship.

756
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,580
That's a possible...

757
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,180
Are you sure?

758
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,480
Now, you're sure that you're just not...

759
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,420
You're saying that because you've been told that by the conspiracy.

760
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,460
No, no, no.

761
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,180
I know that to be true.

762
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,060
Friendly C engine.

763
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,680
Friendly C engine on the face of the planet.

764
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,200
You might do it, yeah, if you could light them all at once.

765
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,140
Yeah, we'd light them all at once.

766
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,100
We still couldn't get it...

767
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,420
Well, you'd have an awful lot of thrust, but you'd only have about 12 seconds of burn time.

768
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,320
Listeners, if when you're on your way to Brushwood, if you're coming from the west, stop at Hangar 18.

769
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,260
And steal your own ship.

770
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,860
And stop at Area 51.

771
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,100
If you're coming from south, stop at Cape Canaveral or Houston Control.

772
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,300
If you're coming from the east...

773
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,580
Thank you.

774
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,480
Studio 54.

775
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes.

776
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,520
Yes.

777
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,160
Steal your own ship.

778
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:41,860
Yes.

779
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,840
All that talking just makes me paranoid as usual because, you know, they know that you're pirating parts already and stuff.

780
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,720
So, what difference does it make?

781
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,060
Manipulate your orbital eccentricity, for Christ's sakes.

782
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,060
Dave, I think they want us to get off the planet.

783
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,620
I don't think anything would make them happier if we actually achieve this goal.

784
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,540
In fact, if we do go to NASA and ask them for a ship, they may very well give us one.

785
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,300
Just to get rid of us.

786
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,960
I think they, more than anyone, would like to see us go.

787
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,500
That's part of the racial plan of the Uberman.

788
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,240
I think they're going to take advantage anyways to get us all interested in this stuff so we leave.

789
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,460
It's all a big myth about the world is firing.

790
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,680
No, no, no.

791
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,780
It reminds me of a classic science fiction story called The Marching Morons.

792
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:30,300
Where a brilliant sleazeball from the past comes up with a great idea to get rid of all the morons of the Earth

793
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,560
by tricking them into a big vacation on Venus.

794
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:38,020
They're packed into spaceships and crashed into Venus where they die.

795
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,920
That's the world of No Light.

796
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,400
No Lay.

797
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,760
No, that's not the world of No Lay, is it?

798
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,500
That was the song.

799
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,780
We are not tricking idiots to get into rockets to launch them into space just to get rid of them.

800
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,060
No, no.

801
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,260
No, no.

802
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,860
Actually, I think that's an old Douglas Adams idea.

803
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,840
Well, anyway, because most subgeniuses aren't idiots, obviously.

804
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,440
Dave, you're a subgenius.

805
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,040
I'm a subgenius.

806
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,860
Yeah, I know, idiot.

807
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,440
Well, there you go.

808
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,860
I'm a full-blood, goo-goo-lipping, 300-pound, red-blooded baby boy.

809
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,240
There you go.

810
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,440
So, I mean, by just...

811
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,540
Your existence proves that subgeniuses aren't idiots,

812
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,080
and therefore, why would we be trying to get rid of them?

813
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,960
I guess I'd buy it on that basis.

814
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,640
Well, some subgeniuses are idiots.

815
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:22,880
Yes.

816
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,780
Duh.

817
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,280
Live in the abyss.

818
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,060
What are you...

819
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,760
Well, some subgeniuses are idiots.

820
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,060
Yes.

821
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:30,900
Duh.

822
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,660
Live in the...

823
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,160
Well, some subgeniuses are idiots.

824
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,260
Duh.

825
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,840
Live in...

826
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,400
Some subgeniuses are idiots.

827
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,420
Duh.

828
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:38,720
Live.

829
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,280
Duh.

830
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,320
Duh.

831
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,740
Live in the abyss.

832
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,800
What do you think subgenius means?

833
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,880
Below.

834
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,260
I thought it was...

835
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,100
Ah, the level.

836
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,120
Reading my pamphlet number one,

837
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,380
I thought that we were geniuses of things that were under...

838
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,480
The underculture, the underground, the things that were...

839
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:00,920
The underworld.

840
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:06,800
Well, that's the politically correct way to say they're a bunch of retards.

841
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,960
Then it becomes...

842
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:28,680
So you went into some kind of place where they came from and you start learning from

843
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,200
you...

844
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,380
Yes.

845
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,740
Right.

846
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,240
The Lord God took the man, put him in the Garden of Eden to tend it and to keep it.

847
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,860
And the Lord God commanded the man, saying,

848
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,240
Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat,

849
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,880
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat,

850
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,960
for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.

851
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,320
But they didn't die.

852
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,020
As the story goes, they lived to be quite old.

853
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
No more experiments.

854
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,340
I thought you would be able to understand that.

855
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,480
Perhaps four is better.

856
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,240
Anyway.

857
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,760
If he'd gone up like he went up,

858
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,240
he would have come down like he came down.

859
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,520
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

860
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,540
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

861
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:51,980
As a result of losing my house, my job, all my money, all my friends,

862
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,460
almost my dignity, I've lost it all.

863
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,680
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

864
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,720
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

865
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,460
Something's going to happen.

866
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,820
And I wanted to say goodbye.

867
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,500
What's going to happen?

868
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,600
Something wonderful.

869
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,620
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

870
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,660
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

871
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,780
It sounds good, and the promotion of it makes it sound like this could be your ticket out.

872
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:28,720
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

873
00:40:33,480 --> 00:41:00,280
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

874
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,820
Something's going to happen.

875
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:01,900
Something's going to happen.

876
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,020
Something's going to happen.

877
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,200
This is the way it's been done for millions of years.

878
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,900
You gotta get that thing fixed, man.

879
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,140
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

880
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,540
I mean I thought it was a bad haircut day,

881
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,240
and then I looked closer and it was like peeling up.

882
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,440
The plate was like punched in on the back side,

883
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,640
and the front side was haha so that you could actually

884
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,820
see the meat in there or brain or whatever.

885
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,760
That is, you know, I thought maybe I could take care of it holistically.

886
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,000
You know, I drink these teas and stuff of that in law.

887
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,280
The brain tissue and the CFH fluids appear to be seeping right back into the

888
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,260
core where they supera—

889
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,280
supposed to be, but I still have a vertigo sensation, and sometimes I see things in trees

890
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:44,880
and sixes, but it's all right. Well, Dave, once the soul has been corrupted like that, there's

891
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:52,420
really no way to get your balance back. Well, I suppose my car has been made caca, but what about

892
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:57,940
your own soul staying? I mean, mine's up on a jack in the front yard. It's up on blocks.

893
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,860
Ain't no good to nobody, is that what you're saying? Won't go no more? Neighbor's been

894
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:07,880
complaining. Hey, your brain's out there, been out there on blocks. It looks like now it's got

895
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,860
a flat tire. Looks like an abandoned brain. We're going to have it towed away if you don't do

896
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,160
something about it. You can make a ship out of that thing. See, anything will work, even your

897
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,260
car shell or your astral shell or hunks of your own brain. You can model into a way of getting

898
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,740
off here. Well, now you're talking that Drakankar religion, because they,

899
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:33,340
they preach that you could travel by just sitting there with your eyes closed in the car,

900
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,520
driving 70 miles an hour. You could shut your eyes and travel astrally to other planets.

901
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:46,260
What we call daydreams, the Akankar religion teaches are actual real other planets.

902
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,140
So if I think of an album cover world, you know, or something I saw a long time ago

903
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,660
in some painting, and I, and I go there in my imagination, if I was an

904
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,940
Akankar or Drakankar nut, I would, I would literally believe that I had been there. Unlike

905
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,280
we subgeniuses who of course are rational and scientific. But we realized that it's not until

906
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,140
after you leave the planet that we will visit those worlds. Right. We we're, we're, we're

907
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:20,200
literalists about this sort of thing. I don't, I don't want that. I'm not going to put up with

908
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,060
some imaginary X vessel, the escape vessel planet. I wouldn't put no stock in that neither.

909
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,920
I want the real thing. If I'm not going to put up with it, I'm not going to put up with it.

910
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:27,920


911
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,600
I'm going to get the real thing. I'll just keep my eyes open, my feet on the ground, my head in the clouds.

912
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,100
Just go for it, man.

913
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,700
Yeah, but there's so many...

914
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,480
Point on, Mr. Businessman. You can't dress like me.

915
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,460
There's so many grim visages in the dark and so many phantasms. I can't tell what's real and what's not anymore.

916
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,500
You know, chances are he's building all these ships and not getting in, climb inside them with them and everything.

917
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,600
And it seems like to be a great time, but I don't know if they're in my mind or not.

918
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,540
No, those are real, Dave.

919
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,200
Well, I have doubts about them.

920
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:57,900
You mean when the real thing...

921
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,240
When the new ones come, I'm going to have doubts, too. Those are real. These are real.

922
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,800
The ships are real. I might not be what the ships are.

923
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,120
They might not. See, that might not be real either. Of course, you have so little faith.

924
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,440
Well, that's the thing. The UFOs are the only thing that are real. You're a hoax.

925
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,080
Well, all hoaxes, then, if you...

926
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,040
Reader, you are the hoax.

927
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,320
Are you rathering...

928
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,900
The UFO is the hoax.

929
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:34,720
The UFO is the witness to the strange phenomena of you driving down that weird road at night.

930
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,500
That UFO is more freaked out than you are.

931
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,300
You're the ephemeral hallucination. You and your whole world.

932
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,140
The whole conspiracy is really that we're living on an alien world and we don't even know it.

933
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,660
This is not our world, friends. We're meant to be somewhere else.

934
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,480
It was a night in April in 1959. I was...

935
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:08,220
Cruising down the highway. I was headed down Route 66 to see my beloved Aunty Flora, and as I looked up to my right, I saw what appeared to be a large oval object.

936
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,380
Cruz And, as I looked up to my right, I saw what appeared to be a large, oval object.

937
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,460
I thought at first my diaphragm had tipped out of the side of the car and wasn't, like,

938
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:13,760
I wasn't, like,

939
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,220
gevura-king Roman

940
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,220


941
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,220


942
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,140
navitating over my head, but, you know it, it was something much stranger than that.

943
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,280
navitating over my head, but, you know it, it was something much stranger than that.

944
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,920
And I, I, it was glowing in some way I can't describe.

945
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,560
And it, it was, it was, it was obviously glowing above my head.

946
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,680
And I Iz지는 a'

947
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,280
Mo'

948
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,860
pulled over the side of the road and...

949
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,800
And I broke down and began to cry.

950
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,500
I didn't know what was...

951
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,180
We are your friends.

952
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,260
We wish only for a sample of your ovaries.

953
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,040
We come for a little piece of what makes you.

954
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,640
Please, Earthling, be calm.

955
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,600
We come in peace.

956
00:45:54,740 --> 00:46:00,280
I don't know if you should touch me there because I've never let anyone touch me there.

957
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,880
Just relax, ma'am. It'll be all very soon.

958
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,240
It's for your own good, human.

959
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,240
This is the way we've done it for millions and billions of years.

960
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,660
Millions and billions of years? I hardly know you. I've never seen you before.

961
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,580
You've known us for thousands of years. We were there when the pyramids went up, ma'am.

962
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,260
We were there under the four-leafed clover.

963
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,520
We were there with our pot of gold.

964
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,600
Oh, no, don't stroke me there.

965
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,440
Oh, please.

966
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,560
Oh, please.

967
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,100
We are there in your dreams, the night hag sitting on your chest.

968
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,980
You can't breathe.

969
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,000
You must believe.

970
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,040
I've seen that hollow face so many times before.

971
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,220
I thought it was my granite chin, Jing.

972
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,380
We were there when you climbed out of the trees.

973
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,200
It was the face of the monkey in my looking glass.

974
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,540
We were there when you crawled out of the...

975
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,940
Oh, no, it's Professor Berswam. He's going over the books again.

976
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,540
We were there when you first reproduced yourself successfully.

977
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:12,400
We were there when the sun that exploded to create this solar system...

978
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,360
You were there when the sun was created in your own mind, whoever you are.

979
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,220
...did itself in.

980
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,580
We'll admit we've been recombined a little bit into radio superstars.

981
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,620
Instead of flakes of carbon and hydrogen.

982
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,500
The ash of stellar alchemy.

983
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,860
Is it true, possibly, that we're all made of the same material?

984
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,600
Everyone on this line, everyone listening, may be made of the same genetic and psychoactive...

985
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,860
We're made of the...

986
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,820
Well, everybody except you, Dave.

987
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,880
Come on, Spaniard.

988
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,700
And Jesus, Jesus is of holy stock.

989
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,920
Oh, yeah, right.

990
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,860
Oh, gee, look at that. The Lord has fallen asleep.

991
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,280
The greatest protection I can give to you is from yourself.

992
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,480
Tonight, we're going to see some chilly temperatures, a few showers, and rocket ships.

993
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,260
And today in the news, an amateur rocket builder from Ohio has launched a rocket ship...

994
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,520
into low Earth orbit.

995
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,940
He says he built a spaceship in his garage.

996
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,080
And that it's powered by what he calls solid prop rockets.

997
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,320
Let me go to space. Let me go to space.

998
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,420
Don't tell the air traffic controllers nearby.

999
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,660
But, um...

1000
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
And that's a baby one. I mean, for X Day...

1001
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,000
X Day at Dos Equis? X Day at Brushwood? This summer?

1002
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,200
We literally have military issue rockets that will be launched.

1003
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,440
Eighteen rockets.

1004
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,540
Leashed to a large industrial trash can.

1005
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,100
Holding inside of it, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1006
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,280
Who was late again this afternoon.

1007
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,840
But hopefully he'll be here tonight.

1008
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,720
And a little video camera and a radio transmitter.

1009
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:21,280
And a little video camera and a radio transmitter.

1010
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,580
And a little video camera and a radio transmitter.

1011
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,480
So...

1012
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,120
So...

1013
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,100
You know, friends, we're trying. We're trying to get off.

1014
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,300
Now I gotta memorize the planets again.

1015
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,920
He was very gracious to get me up at the crack of dawn the next morning.

1016
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,680
Behind the wheel and on my way to Waco.

1017
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,020
I didn't have breakfast in bed. I didn't get to watch a midnight movie.

1018
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,840
I missed a lot of things. But I did what I had to do in Waco and returned.

1019
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,220
And that incident was put out of my mind.

1020
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,780
Except to tuck away and say, you know, nothing happened. I had no car trouble.

1021
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,720
I missed a wonderful time.

1022
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,140
Because my husband wouldn't let me do it.

1023
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,060
The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter when they come at you.

1024
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,140
Bill, Bill, old rocket ship. Bill, Bill, old rocket ship.

1025
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,540
E.S.O. Radio.

1026
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,180
Bill, Bill, old rocket ship. Bill...

1027
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:19,720
And the Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of...

1028
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,700
Slack.

1029
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:29,480
Which is what you're listening to all mixed up with Einstein's Secret Orchestra Radio.

1030
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:39,560
And you can get more information about these mighty edifices and these shambling monsters of faith

1031
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:49,140
by writing to this P.O. Box and website addresses I'm about to give Bob and Church of the Subgenius Information.

1032
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,100
With a self addressed stamped envelope to...

1033
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,980
Post Office Box...

1034
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,740
140306...

1035
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,180
Dallas, Texas.

1036
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,300
75214...

1037
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,120
That's www.subgenius.com

1038
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,160
Which does...

1039
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,300
Subgenius does not have an O in it.

1040
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,440
Einstein's Secret Orchestra is at P.O. Box 81555.

1041
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,320
Cleveland, Ohio 44181.

1042
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:42,820
Friends, you can find out... you can learn everything from Slack at subgenius.com.

1043
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,060
You can learn... well, code. That's enough.

1044
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,040
This Godzilla music is great.

1045
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,560
This is King Kong versus Godzilla.

1046
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,200
That rascally Friday Jones sent this in.

1047
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,260
And what else have we listened to?

1048
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:59,780
Actually, I think it's all been...

1049
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:11,720
Chaz Smith's editing has been the cause of the excellent collage work that has broken up the various live radio show recordings.

1050
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,480
Thank you.

1051
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,840
The old rugged cross.

1052
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,480
That is a gruesome, terrible representation of a...

1053
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,540
Wonderful sacrifice.

1054
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:28,360
Also in the news today, religious scholars agree that Jesus should have built his own rocket ship.

1055
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,900
Who do you think you are, living the lifestyle that you're living?

1056
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,440
Let me go to space. Let me go to space.

1057
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,560
That's how it's been done for billions of years.

1058
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,520
It's been done for billions of years.

1059
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,560
It's been done for billions of years.

1060
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,580
It's been done for billions of years.

1061
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,640
It's been done for billions of years.

1062
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,700
It's been done for billions of years.

1063
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,280
Let's have a party, man. Let's have a blast.

1064
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,320
Let's celebrate.

1065
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,900
Let's have a good time.

1066
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,500
Yes, they have some sort of electronic umbrella. It's quite impenetrable.

1067
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,820
I'm sure there are any other people who wish to share details about their fleet.

1068
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,300
Perhaps if you've been enjoying a prairie squid or other wonders of nature.

1069
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,160
Featured here in the Ohio wilderness area.

1070
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,760
You know, we'd love to hear about, you know, your poison ivy sex.

1071
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,940
Told you we were into bug porn.

1072
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,660
And you thought that was just a cosmic gag, some kind of a concept.

1073
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,380
And we're working on the computer animated bug porn.

1074
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,820
We're training the stag beetles.

1075
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,180
And that ain't easy.

1076
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,440
No, surely. I mean, come on.

1077
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,220
Anything.

1078
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,720
Otherwise I'll just have to preach, and I don't want to preach.

1079
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,880
We try to avoid preachiness.

1080
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,520
Corniness is the downfall of the new age.

1081
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,980
No offense.

1082
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,300
But I like dinosaurs more than unicorns.

1083
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,160
You know.

1084
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,500
I don't know. It's just a person.

1085
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,360
Oh, yes.

1086
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,940
You know, it's funny.

1087
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,040
You go back in time.

1088
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,560
A hundred years. What would you take with you?

1089
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,880
If I could go back in time a hundred years, what would I take with me?

1090
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,780
Uh, water purifiers.

1091
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,800
Pretty good answer, huh?

1092
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,140
It's just weird thinking about the basics here.

1093
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,700
I haven't even done my Y2K shopping yet.

1094
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,440
I'll probably head down to Kmart on the, you know,

1095
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,640
the day after Christmas.

1096
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:52,400
Looking for bottled water and dehydrated eggs and flashlight batteries.

1097
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,880
I'm sure they'll be well stocked then.

1098
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,580
Oh, and then I was also going to sell all my stocks.

1099
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:02,540
Figured I'd do that about, oh, December 30th or so.

1100
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,860
And run to the bank and cash them all in.

1101
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,140
Friends, you know,

1102
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,380
every day is X day.

1103
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,140
If you've got a gun,

1104
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,760
power to man.

1105
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,060
The escape velocity, the velocity we're going to need to get off.

1106
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:32,640
That's it.

1107
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:39,020
The velocity we need to get off is 6.94 miles per second.

1108
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:39,520
What?

1109
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,400
It's j empresa .

1110
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,820
Andreas eu de

1111
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,300
Emil

1112
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:05,760
I'm out of here

1113
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,580
It's my favorite song

1114
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,700
Said I need you here

1115
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,740
And it's the best one

1116
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,800
I've seen in years

1117
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,500
Give me my way

1118
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,280
We've got a love

1119
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,120
It's only me

1120
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,760
I'm coming in love

1121
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,520
Don't need no letter at all

1122
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,340
We've got a plan

1123
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,340
We're not alone

1124
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,340
We've got a life

1125
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,360
We've got a plan

1126
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,140
We've got a plan

1127
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,400
We're not alone

1128
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,440
We've got a life

1129
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,820
Hi.

1130
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,480
Hey.

1131
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,880
First chance.

1132
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,060
I've had to talk.

1133
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,400
It's, uh...

1134
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,340
Well...

1135
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,080
Sort of funny up here.

1136
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,080
I don't think we'll make the moon.

1137
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,760
I don't know where we'll get.

1138
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,180
Maybe Venus, Mars...

1139
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:30,700
Neptune...

1140
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:32,800
Jupiter...

1141
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,520
Pluto.

1142
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:38,740
Lonely up here.

1143
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,660
Forty degrees outside.

1144
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,300
Seventy-two here.

1145
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,700
I miss eating.

1146
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,480
Doesn't seem right.

1147
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,260
This way.

1148
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,580
Can you hear me?

1149
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,120
I have no way of knowing if you can hear me.

1150
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,340
I'm not sure.

1151
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:04,340


1152
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,420
I'm not sure.

1153
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:05,940
Tell, uh...

1154
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,040
Tell anybody that...

1155
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:13,980
I, uh...

1156
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,740
I'd like to get back.

1157
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,200
I'd like to...

1158
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,920
I'd like to get back to Earth.

1159
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,400
What I thought was my ignorance...

1160
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,320
What I thought was my cause...

1161
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:34,320


1162
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,300
When I had reasoned to rise...

1163
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,280
Something gone mad.

1164
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,820
Can you hear me?

1165
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,960
Can you hear me?

1166
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,460
Can you hear me?

1167
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,300
Can you hear me?

1168
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,460
Can you hear me.

1169
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,740
The Radio Place

1170
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,720
Radio Place

1171
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,600
Radio Place

1172
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,460
Radio Place
