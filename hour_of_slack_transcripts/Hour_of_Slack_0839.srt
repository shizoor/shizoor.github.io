1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:10,860
But let's leave things of this world behind, and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,300
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke they call reality.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,900
Let your body be sucked out of your ears, for we're going to take you deep, deep inside yourself to the place of silence in the noise.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,460
We're going deeper, deeper into your consciousness, down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,140
We bore down into the cranium, drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality,

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:43,320
piercing the squamous epizootis rolling around in the hollowed-out inside of the skull,

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:52,240
scraping along the edges of the birth canal and stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,880
Now, let all your...

9
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,640
Let your thoughts drain out through the brain pan, tumble down through the sinuses, slide down the esophagus,

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,020
and finally, let them plunge to the base of the soul itself, located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,940
And finally, an idea, a key, an ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind, and it is Bob.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,680
Let there be slack.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,520
Let there be slack.

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,580
It's not a crunch.

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,280
Dad, it's something I've come to rely on to help me through life.

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,520
He will not reveal his identity, so for today, we're calling him Bob.

17
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,500
Good, good. I think we're ready, Dad.

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,060
And then...

19
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:22,720
And then...

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,080
And then...

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,620
And then...

22
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,320
A miracle!

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, please, no miracles.

24
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,080
You're a nice guy, Bart.

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,820
Drink up.

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,020
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime.

27
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,780
I don't...

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,580
I don't...

29
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
I don't...

30
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,680
I don't...

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
I don't...

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,080
I don't...

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Most people seek to control life in order to secure a more positive, productive, and

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
free existence.

35
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,320
Often, however, the objectives of others conflict with our objectives.

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,460
Now, most people, common people really, can barely manage to control their own self-centered

37
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,560
myopic existence.

38
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,500
They command armies of lawyers armed with paper weapons, attacking with spiteful, vengeful,

39
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,340
cowardly litigation.

40
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,200
Others operate within elephantine bureaucracies.

41
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,360
We'll all get fired.

42
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,240
Cut to a promo.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
Start tape.

44
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,840
Oh Rollin'?

45
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,640
Rollin'?

46
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,680
You little.

47
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,540
A-a-ahl inna.

48
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:44,880
A-a-ahl, ha googly A-a-ahl, a-a-u-hoh, a-a-ah A-aa Alg scans, you've all seen it now.

49
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm boomer.

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,860
How dare you editorialize so blatantly?

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,900
You have just violated the most sacred canon of journalism.

53
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,280
Millions of Americans were listening to you.

54
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,260
Now what is the idea of screaming at me in the middle of the night?

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,120
I was ignoring you.

56
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,380
What's the big emergency?

57
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,040
It started this morning.

58
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,520
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

59
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,480
We got static, we got snow, all kinds of distortions.

60
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Unexplained disturbance and the hysteria that it's causing are incredible.

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
How would you describe what you are seeing?

62
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,060
It is clearing the mountains, moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor.

63
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,380
Widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets.

64
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,700
It is confirmed.

65
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,260
There it is, the strange atmospheric phenomenon.

66
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,620
It is apparently what we've been causing all the distortions in our broadcast.

67
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,980
So far the phenomenon has not caused any damage.

68
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,160
We have to ask you to try to stay calm and it's important for everyone not to panic.

69
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,680
We have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear.

70
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,860
We are over American City.

71
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,200
It's just unreal.

72
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,620
Alright, fine.

73
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,060
Yeah.

74
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,660
Um, she wants to buy me my own radio station.

75
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,480
And so, as of 10 a.m. tomorrow morning, this will no longer be a classical music station.

76
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,900
We're gonna try a talk radio format for a while, see how that works.

77
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,500
Oh, also we're changing the call letters of the station to KRZY.

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,080
I can't believe you're the same person I listen to on the radio every day.

79
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,020
I thought you'd be, I don't know, older.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,880
Not so attractive.

81
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,640
It's...

82
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,660
It's...

83
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:45,660


84
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:45,660


85
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:45,660


86
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:45,840
It's weird.

87
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,840
I mean, I listen to your show every night.

88
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,020
And your voice, I know that this is gonna sound strange, but it's becoming so familiar to me.

89
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,580
So comfortable.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,180
And I feel like you're a friend, home with me every night.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,660
Keeping me company.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,540
Why don't you come back with me at my place tonight and have some wine?

93
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,200
You can tell me how you come up with all those crazy things you do on the air.

94
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,640
Maybe you can even...

95
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,560
...took me in the head.

96
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,520
What are you talking about?

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm talking about the show.

98
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,160
We gotta become more outrageous.

99
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,800
We gotta tap ourselves, otherwise we're gonna lose our numbers.

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,080
More outrageous?

101
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,180
You think that's possible?

102
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,720
200,000 people down there listen to me and you on the radio every night.

103
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,940
We are right on the verge of getting what we wanted.

104
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm starting to get offers to syndicate nationwide.

105
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,760
If our numbers keep growing, I'll be taking our show into 50 cities across the country.

106
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,560
We are entering a new age.

107
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:45,640
We are entering a new age.

108
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,600
Old taboos are falling away.

109
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,200
People...

110
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,940
People are now as afraid to tap into the dark side of themselves.

111
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,880
In fact, they are fascinated by depravity.

112
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,160
I want to do a new segment and call it My Best Crime.

113
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,580
People call us up anonymously and they talk about a crime they committed.

114
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,220
And we're not talking shotlets in here.

115
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,960
Isn't that a little hardcore?

116
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,480
The absolute cutting edge.

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,200
Sure, we'll get a lot of crank calls.

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,100
But we'll also get a lot of real calls.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,740
There's a whole city of perversion down there and we can plug into it.

120
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,220
Use our 55,000 watts of power to spread it to every single corner.

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,640
I don't know, man.

122
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,200
It sounds way over the edge.

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
I mean, you gotta admit, it sounds crazy.

124
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,680
It'll be fascinating.

125
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,020
We'll have people glued to the radios.

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
We'll have them asking, who's gonna call tonight?

127
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,100
What sick confession will I hear this evening?

128
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,180
I bet we get a 25 share on first month.

129
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,180


130
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,740
And from there, you and I are a signature on a contract away from going to the team coast to coast.

131
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,860
Makes a great gift.

132
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,900
Not available anywhere.

133
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,820
Oh yeah, and I suppose Jonescow is just a plumber party.

134
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:55,980
But...

135
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,840
All our best warriors are gone, man.

136
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,900
John Wayne, Sir Lancelot, Joan of Arc, Nelson, Wellington, hell baby, even Doris Day.

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,460
They've all died in battle, man.

138
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,360
Anything like that would put me right over the edge.

139
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,620
I wouldn't joke about anything else that happened here tonight.

140
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,020
Now don't tell me you're taking all this seriously.

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,700
Aren't you?

142
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,260
I really love your show.

143
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,820
It's all that keeps me going.

144
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,640
I think I better get off now.

145
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,840
Sir, please stay on the line.

146
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,460
I'll go back and get you.

147
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:44,820
Don't hang up.

148
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,920
Hello?

149
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,760
What is it?

150
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,260
All right, let's see if we should take a break.

151
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,580
We'll be right back.

152
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,440
Pleasant dreams.

153
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,640
Oh yes, dear friends.

154
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
I know you're all going to be a little bit worried about this.

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,260
But I know you're going to be a little bit worried about this.

156
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,560
Because today, I'm going to be talking about an old school subgenius collage by Puzzling

157
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,100
Evidence.

158
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Actually, I suppose you might as well call it a Puzzling Evidence Old School collage

159
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,920
by a subgenius.

160
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,960
And tonight's show, Hour of Slack number 839, has sort of a new cast, almost, just because

161
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,160
there's a lot of material from the new school subgeni.

162
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,140
Upmailed or emailed or whatever.

163
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,140


164
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,980
or uploaded or down chucked,

165
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,540
including those new titles,

166
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,460
that great new title song there

167
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,020
by the El Queso All-Stars.

168
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,040
We got new material from The Bishop,

169
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,720
Saint N, and Hell in a Handbasket.

170
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,860
This music in the background is by DJ Epoch.

171
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,240
We got stuff from Ed Fred,

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,140
Pater Nostril, Modemak,

173
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,980
Britney Spears.

174
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,200
The Bishop of New York

175
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,340
found some especially juicy educational material

176
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,280
full of good news about Johnny and Jane.

177
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,720
The Bishop of New York found some especially juicy educational material

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,500
At the same time, the lining of the uterus

179
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,320
becomes engorged with blood and nutritive fluids

180
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,760
in preparation for the development of

181
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,500
Rolo the Robot, the chromium-plated butler.

182
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,020
And here's a gadget that breaks down

183
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,160
and is discharged from the body.

184
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,180
Golden Brown, the amazing tiny automatic genital organs

185
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,280
that almost seem to think for themselves.

186
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,700
It is just a daydream after all.

187
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,860
The millions of small mechanical external glands

188
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,780
pulls out its own pituitary gland

189
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,280
at the base of the brain.

190
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,220
Therefore, each Johnny and each Jane

191
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,120
need the sympathy, understanding,

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,780
and cooperation of servants that never ask for afternoons off.

193
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,460
And still another deep thinker rides way up in the vagina

194
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,820
where a milky secretion is added to form

195
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,020
Rolo's little brother.

196
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
But the rap at Grubb's is a little more selfish than that.

197
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,400
The growth of his penis, testes, and emissions of semen gives him a need for sexual activity,

198
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,060
both organized and unorganized, which gives him a feeling of strength and achievement.

199
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,580
Don't look now, but with a bit of a vacuum, this sturdy fellow can manage to stage a grand

200
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,260
performance.

201
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,100
What's more, her sex glands and genital organs and her breasts tell him when to come and

202
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,400
get it.

203
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,580
This is one of the primary sex characteristics of girls.

204
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,040
He may twitch and squirm when he tries to remain disproportionately small.

205
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,080
The resulting congestion wouldn't be half so much fun if we didn't have that robot

206
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,300
that likes its meals served through a long tube, a brainy collection of jets and valves,

207
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,300
and underarm hair sex cells.

208
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,620
All we need to do is push the button, but your regenerative circuits are tuned asynchronously,

209
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,620
and that causes concatenation in the intermediate amplifiers.

210
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,980
And this is important.

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
This gradual and irregular readjustment of the glandular system is a key to the success

212
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:40,800
of the system.

213
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,020
The system is almost certain to give Johnny and Janie ravenous sexual appetites.

214
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,840
From now on, I don't think there'll be the slightest trouble with your sexual maturity.

215
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,980
Your domestic problems are completely solved.

216
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,980
On the other hand, there was the sudden spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt, spurt,

217
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,200
and finally...

218
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,560
Every day in our homes and offices, we have to be careful.

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,560


220
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,680
In our transporting moltores as well as in our motor cars sex glands and genital organs

221
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,100
are doing more things for us than we realize.

222
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,300
He really needs a blast

223
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,660
That boy needs a rewild

224
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,560
He acts so childish

225
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,980
It's all his big boy way

226
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,160
I'm hoping it's just a phase

227
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,020
I just want to let you know

228
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,920
And things don't change, I'm gonna blow

229
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,500
Suck my bitch, suck my bitch boy

230
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Suck my bitch, suck my bitch boy

231
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,420
Suck my bitch, suck my bitch boy

232
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,860
Give him something to remember

233
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,940
They think they're dragging him way down

234
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,960
They keep on trying to push him round

235
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,900
I tell the boy you must have sucked

236
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,620
Between the stretches where it's at

237
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,540
He thinks that I'm insane

238
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,640
But this is no fucking game

239
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,720
I just want to let you know

240
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,780
And things don't change, I'm gonna blow

241
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,000
Suck my bitch, suck my bitch boy

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,060
Suck my bitch, suck my bitch boy

243
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,940
Suck my bitch, suck my bitch boy

244
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,480
Give him something to remember

245
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,940
Suck my bitch boy

246
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,160
They just wanna be next for me

247
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,160


248
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
Its still hard work where you didn't leave

249
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,500
Sometimes things simply fade and breathe

250
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,600
And he's still pretty undecided

251
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,700
The rub b adequate better bite him

252
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,040
Suck my bitch boy

253
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,200
You a real fucking hoe

254
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,260
I just want to let you know

255
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,700
If things don't change I'm gonna woe

256
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,640
Slap my bitch, slap my bitch boy

257
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,680
Slap my bitch, slap my bitch boy

258
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,620
Slap my bitch, slap my bitch boy

259
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,120
Give him something to remember

260
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,660
Slap my bitch boy

261
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,680
Slap my bitch boy

262
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,580
Slap my bitch boy

263
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,700
Slap my bitch boy

264
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,180
My daddy finally found his way

265
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,980
He fucking smugs off every day

266
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,560
He's getting right with my b-bob

267
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,020
He even tried to quit his job

268
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,180
He's getting right with my b-bob

269
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,840
I got my boyfriend back

270
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,800
And I doubled all my slack

271
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,860
I just want to let you know

272
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,960
This song has nowhere left to go

273
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,220
Slap my bitch, slap my bitch boy

274
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,320
Slap my bitch, slap my bitch boy

275
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,160
Slap my bitch, slap my bitch boy

276
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,700
Give him something to remember

277
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Slap my bitch boy

278
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,260
Slap my bitch boy

279
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,920
Slap my bitch boy

280
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,800
Slap my bitch boy

281
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,720
Slap my bitch boy

282
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,580
Slap my bitch boy

283
00:18:49,580 --> 00:19:04,200
Slap my bitch boy

284
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:13,560
This warped idea of law and authority has contributed to the fact that vice is fun.

285
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:25,620
The things we have in America are venereal disease, syphilis, gonorrhea, murder, forcible rape, or assault to kill.

286
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,640
In pace with the emphatic decisions of the American people as to what they want,

287
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,660
substances, human waste, made attractive by misery, which we as Americans may enjoy.

288
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,620
Do you want your children stimulated by the way things look as well as the way they perform?

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,480
Do you want your son enticed into the world of the American love of beauty?

290
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,960
Or your daughter lured into the basic freedom of the American people,

291
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,000
which is the freedom

292
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
of individual choice?

293
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,060
Marijuana? Sure.

294
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,260
Every mother and father in this country

295
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,640
leave their unmistakable marks on homosexuals

296
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,920
faster than we can build jails to house them.

297
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,060
The bishop did that, friends. Before that, we heard the lightest from Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

298
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,320
Uh, you can get more about Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket

299
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
from www.minitru.org.

300
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,060
Minitru is M-I-N-I-T-R-U.

301
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,720
Minitru.

302
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:48,460
And, uh, the bishop has a great new subgenius video and audio club

303
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,660
on Yahoo! called Yeti Video.

304
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,200
A multimedia interactive website, friends, where you should send your weird art and video clips and sounds.

305
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,380
And here's where to do that.

306
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,880
You go to groups.yahoo.com

307
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,300
on the web.

308
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,620
groups.yahoo.com

309
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,260
slash group

310
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,480
slash Yeti video

311
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,260
or just generally, Yahoo groups.

312
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,640
Do a search on Yeti Video.

313
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,060
Y-E-T-I video.

314
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,960
One word.

315
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:27,940
And friends, we got some email from an old high school buddy of mine,

316
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,060
Jim Long.

317
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,300
Uh, uh.

318
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:38,100
A guy so weird and inventive that some of my own work is based on a dream I had about some work by him.

319
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,940
Except that I just dreamed it.

320
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,440
Anyway, friends, tonight for Transitions, we're using...

321
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,240
I give you the finger.

322
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,080
Jim Long.

323
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,280
Transitions.

324
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,300
Do you copy?

325
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,300
Over.

326
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,980
Bob.

327
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,280
Do you copy?

328
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,100
Over.

329
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:06,880
Bob.

330
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,300
Bob.

331
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:14,980


332
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,760
Do you copy?

333
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,600
Over.

334
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,920
Bob.

335
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,720
Do you copy?

336
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:30,620
Over.

337
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:32,960
Bob.

338
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,620
Phivell Thomas.

339
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,140
Phivell Thomas.

340
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,080
Phivell Thomas.

341
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,180
Phivell Thomas.

342
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,580
Phivell Thomas.

343

Phivell Thomas.

344
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,080
Phivell Thomas.

345
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,540
Phivell Thomas.

346
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,240
Phivell Thomas.

347
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,540
Phivell Thomas.

348
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,340
Phivell Thomas.

349
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,800
Phivell Thomas.

350
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,140
Phivell Thomas.

351
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,960
Hello, this is Ricardo Montalbán.

352
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:59,780
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

353
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:30,280
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

354
00:25:47,740 --> 00:26:00,300
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

355
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:27,940
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

356
00:26:44,240 --> 00:27:00,300
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

357
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:30,280
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

358
00:27:47,540 --> 00:28:00,260
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

359
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:30,240
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

360
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,860
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

361
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,420
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

362
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:53,860
This is Ricardo Montalbán.

363
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,460
Oh, shit.

364
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,120
Oh, shit.

365
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:58,900
Oh, shit.

366
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,640
Goodbye.

367
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,600
How about I give you the finger

368
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,120
and you give me my phone call?

369
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,560
Yes, friends, that was,

370
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,480
that big long collage there

371
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,120
was by Reverend Ed Fred

372
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
called Or Kill Me

373
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,840
by Ed Fred.

374
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,460
Before that, we heard a little bit

375
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,040
of Hell Pope Huey at 4X Day.

376
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,720
More of that coming up.

377
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,400
And now, from the most recent

378
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,900
subgenius devourable

379
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,720
here in Cleveland,

380
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,640
friends, at the Beachland Ballroom,

381
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,460
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

382
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,780
And by the door,

383
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
he fell in love with an Indian baby

384
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,320
over an empty store.

385
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,660
But I just

386
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,080
just a little thing

387
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,440
I never let it show.

388
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,220
So she could never answer

389
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,020
yes or no.

390
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,480
And he always called it Sunday business.

391
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:58,880
Hell,

392
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,800
the time of all

393
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,160
the pain and water

394
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
beats and braids

395
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
and hopes and fates

396
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,420
and thoughts.

397
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,620
But I knew

398
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,400
there was never

399
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,580
a sure sign

400
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,800
because the sign

401
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,740
is made of light.

402
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,760
Light.

403
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,080
Hey!

404
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,620
Hey!

405
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,080
More than life.

406
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,840
You never got a kiss.

407
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,520
Oh, life.

408
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,340
You don't know what it meant.

409
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,200
Incidentally wonder

410
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,100
about his face and breath.

411
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,960
Elijah with the oil

412
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,720
for the night.

413
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,460
Elijah was a woman in it.

414
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,700
You never went nowhere.

415
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,140
He felt his heart

416
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,020
and he didn't mean it.

417
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,440
He didn't go for over here.

418
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,340
Elijah

419
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,320
should have been

420
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,660
never let it show.

421
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,440
So she could never answer

422
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,260
yes or no.

423
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,980
And then one day

424
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,940
a wealthy customer

425
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,800
bought him a

426
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,920
to go so far

427
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,100
away.

428
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,760
But only Elijah stayed.

429
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,960
Elijah!

430
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:33,680


431
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,080
Elijah!

432
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,420
So then,

433
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,040
lonely as can be,

434
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,780
and wishes he was still

435
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,860
in my dream.

436
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,940
Elijah!

437
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:56,700


438
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,700
Elijah!

439
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


440
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


441
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


442
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


443
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


444
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,900


445
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,640
WOW bait Why Liam?

446
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,440
He bought me some

447
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,540
washed money

448
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,140
trying to find

449
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,320
uncles

450
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,320


451
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,320


452
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,320


453
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,240
I was

454
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,240


455
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,240


456
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,460
on the

457
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Thank you.

458
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,860
Thank you.

459
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,260
Thank you.

460
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,160
Thank you.

461
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,120
Thank you.

462
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,240
Thank you.

463
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,760
Thank you.

464
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,680
Thank you.

465
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,060
Thank you.

466
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,860
Thank you.

467
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,440
Thank you.

468
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,900
Thank you.

469
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,620
Thank you.

470
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,640
Thank you.

471
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,120
Of the whole planet.

472
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,600
Dinosaurs, everything.

473
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,000
Solar system.

474
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,120
Oh, but then he gets to find out what everything's really like.

475
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,820
He'll wake up on the planet of broken glass, sitting there naked.

476
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,380
Looks like my feet are bleeding.

477
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,140
What the hell's going on?

478
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,340
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

479
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,040
How am I doing?

480
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,840
You hear that one, Dave?

481
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm going to be out of here.

482
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,260
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

483
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,340
You hear that one, Dave?

484
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,500
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.

485
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,440
You get the same way twice.

486
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,860
I feel much better now.

487
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,240
Same way twice, yeah.

488
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,580
Well, as we can see, all of the memories are coming up on the front view monitor.

489
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,340
Oh, yes, yes.

490
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,040
Yes, I hear you, Dave.

491
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm sorry, Dave.

492
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:16,900
H5.

493
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,740
I'm afraid I can't do that.

494
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,280
Oh, look what they're doing to him.

495
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,960
He's playing pin the tail on his face.

496
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,220
Stop calling him back.

497
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,100
Stop.

498
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,740
There's no more signal from Earth.

499
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,100
He's too far away.

500
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,020
Or there's simply no signal.

501
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,560
Nothing's happening anymore.

502
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,000
The last ones have died out.

503
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,320
Signals no longer exist.

504
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,900
Maybe Dave's the only one left.

505
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,040
Well, if he did get a signal, it would be as the Earth was 300 years ago now.

506
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,180
That's the hyper signal, man.

507
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,840
That's what he's been waiting for, the hyper signal.

508
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,040
You don't want to scratch his neck that way.

509
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,940
No, no, it's going to come off.

510
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,700
Echo the signal.

511
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,780
It's actually in the past.

512
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,260
It's gone 300 years into the past.

513
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,480
Echo me.

514
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,580
It's gone 300 years into the past.

515
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,160
In the future.

516
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,140
Echo me.

517
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,120
Echo me.

518
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
Echo me.

519
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,180
Echo me.

520
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:09,980
Echo me.

521
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,700
Echo me.

522
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:12,920
Echo me.

523
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,180
Echo me.

524
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,640
That's all about black indecision

525
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,380
And I'm in a broken class

526
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,100
Every woman upon the road in class weighs 600 pounds

527
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,760
Every day is 120 degrees with 100% humidity

528
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,480
No one has any clothes except for shoes

529
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,140
They're under the chairs

530
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,240
There's no place to sit to break a glass

531
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,620
Any thought you get will never heal

532
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,500
No matter how severe you'll never die

533
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,480
Every day at 4 o'clock it'll rain rubbing alcohol

534
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,780
There'll be nothing to eat

535
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,260
The radiation will flood everyone's blood into a rich and tasty sauce

536
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:43,660
And the only thing you'll be able to do is hunt down that next 600 pound deep-booted naked humanoid

537
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,260
Snatching up and eating him

538
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,400
But no matter how severe his wounds

539
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
He'll never die

540
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,480
Everybody can't be bored

541
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,960
So let me be the shit that falls through your ass

542
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,060
When you feel the pain that's every single day

543
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,740
I'll issue a license for everyone who wants to go to Disney

544
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,400
Planet of Broken Glass

545
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,120
Planet of Broken Glass

546
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,880
Ranted by Dr. Legume

547
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,960
And mixed by

548
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,920

Thank you.

00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:27,300
Thank you.

599
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:39,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,900
Oh baby!

601
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

602
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,140
Oh baby!

603
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,460
Yeah, yeah!

604
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,960
Oh, baby!

605
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

606
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,080
Oh, baby!

607
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

608
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,920
Well, one thing we certainly know about that lovely young lady,

609
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,580
she's not only not that innocent, she's not that supplicant.

610
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,420
Just take a close look at the space between her eyes.

611
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,880
Look at her mouth.

612
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,380
She's not even a she, Dave. Give me a break.

613
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,580
Correctly spoken.

614
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,760
She's just a little boy.

615
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,240
She's a little boy.

616
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,240
Well, she's not a little boy.

617
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,760
With all the added equipment that little boys want.

618
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,440
Yes.

619
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,180
Very, very, very many implants in every pore.

620
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,340
There used to be a little black boy named...

621
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,400
Michael Jackson.

622
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,320
And now?

623
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,400
And now is a young...

624
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,800
She's a hirsute, young Norwegian named Loretta Swit.

625
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,940
No, no, she's...

626
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,920
No, she's Britney Spears.

627
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,000
She's Britney Spears, America's favorite sweat hog.

628
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:20,960
Sweat sweetheart.

629
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,980
She's America's sweat hardest sweetheart.

630
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,300
All Michael had to do was discard his skeleton,

631
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,220
which now still goes by the name Michael Jackson.

632
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,060
I just removed the plug from his butt and stepped aside.

633
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,040
The skeleton in it, that's Britney Spears.

634
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,940
The meat without the skeleton?

635
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,220
Yeah, that's...

636
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,620
The ultimate fruition of Michael Jackson's plastic surgery

637
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,160
was to have his skeleton removed,

638
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,500
and that's the one that's doing the Michael Jackson album.

639
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,620
And then there's the meat, the sack of meat that was...

640
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,300
that no longer has a skeleton.

641
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,580
Oh, the ultimate carnal...

642
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,840
There's some kind of nasal there.

643
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,840
What's wrong?

644
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,420
What's wrong?

645
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,820
Pick me up real quick.

646
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,660
I don't think so.

647
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,760
There's no carnal?

648
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:28,820
Angie Fowles.

649
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,000
Thank you, Randy.

650
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,420
They are bad guys, and think I'm telling a joke.

651
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,800
Better to tell the truth.

652
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,480
Jamie O'Reilly said in an interview puji.co.uk,

653
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:34,480


654
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,560
夏 viscosity gay Juicyבа еґ trades Bull 밍 so you can take me to school for 5 hours,

655
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,740
Anyway, listen pilgrim, dobsian, brothers and sisters of mine, I know quite a few of

656
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:03,440
us look really fetching or in a felching in black leather, which I know sets your thighs

657
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,160
to sweating, but Nazis, turn off the pencillandrics there, Oboe, if you have more than two, that's

658
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,540
two brain cells to rub together.

659
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,980
You know that Nazis are way down the list behind our other and much more spectacular

660
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,820
failings.

661
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:20,100
We feature soulless beasts, foaming maniacs, vengeful former fanboys with magic the gathering

662
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,380
eating up that part of their brains that should have been devoted to sex, misanthropic hacking

663
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:28,980
bastards, misanthropes, hackers, and bastards, succubiating with a little incubus action,

664
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,420
cracked actual geniuses with great camouflage who are just sluggish.

665
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,100
We feature a bunch of people on the dewy eyed Bobby droves that still have the pipe brand

666
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:40,480
smarting on their asses and a cadre of hangers on them that make me want to bowl them over

667
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,200
with a columnar pillar of my own puke.

668
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,020
It's a jolly list.

669
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,520
The freaking Nazis, that's best say, we're as sweet and pure as the Hershey syrup being

670
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,080
dribbled down like Mary Magdalene's back.

671
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,440
And remember catch and hold dispel spongiform bovine encephalopathy.

672
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,020
No, that's not the cartoon in spongiform Bob Squarepants, that's the brain worm.

673

He's Bob.

703
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,560
That's just basilic.

704
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,640
That's just basilic.

705
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:28,680


706
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:28,740

00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:28,740

710
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:33,500


711
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,140
and the moam-rats outgrabe.

712
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,260
Beware the jabberwock, my son,

713
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,240
the jaws that bite, the claws that catch.

714
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,080
Beware the jub-jub bird and shun,

715
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,120
the frumious bandersnatch.

716
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
He took his vorpal sword in hand,

717
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,680
long time the manxum foe he sought.

718
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,460
So rested he by the tum-tum tree

719
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,140
and stood a while in thought.

720
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,880
And, as in uffish thought he stood,

721
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,100
the jabberwock with eyes of flame

722
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,320
came whiffling through the tulgy wood

723
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,040
and burbled as it came.

724
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,380
One, two, one, two,

725
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,140
and through and through,

726
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,160
the vorpal blade went snicker-snack.

727
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,300
He left it dead and with its head

728
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,060
he went galumping back.

729
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,200
And hast thou slain the jabberwock?

730
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,620
Come to my arms, my beamish boy.

731
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,020
O, frabjous day, kaloo-kalay!

732
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,860
He chortled in his joy.

733
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,680
Twas brillig, and the slithy toes

734
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,920
did jar and gimble in the wabe.

735
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,880
