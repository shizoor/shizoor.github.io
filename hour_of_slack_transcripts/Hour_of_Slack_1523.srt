1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
You're normally such a slacker.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,160
It's the first time you've heard of him.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:02,940
Are all four of you guys in here?

4
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,580
Is Phil in there?

5
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,520
He just, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:04,920
Can we?

7
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,140
Doing with four?

8
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:06,820
Yeah, all four.

9
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Okay.

10
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:07,880
What are we doing?

11
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,300
How do we?

12
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,440
This is, this is.

13
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,900
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,660
They'll do the comedy.

15
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,320
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave of the Firesign Theater.

16
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,160
Okay.

17
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,160
This is Phil.

18
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,760
Phil.

19
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,240
Let's take it again.

20
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,620
Oh, Pete and Dave.

21
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,300
Okay, there we go, yeah.

22
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,480
All right, you over here?

23
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,500
You just shut up.

24
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,800
This is Phil.

25
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,140
Phil.

26
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,600
Pete.

27
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,900
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.

28
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,060
And we're listening to The Hour of Slack.

29
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Because we're subgeniuses.

30
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,460
And we're slacking off.

31
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,180
Tonight on the show, we're going to have the Thumb Brothers, Hangnail and Sneaky.

32
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,740
They're going to be with us.

33
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,060
Wonderful, wonderful.

34
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,320
Oh, the I Ching for this evening.

35
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,840
We might as well get to this in the slow part of the show here at the beginning.

36
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:48,940
Deliverance.

37
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,780
When heaven and earth deliver themselves, thunder and rain set in.

38
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,660
When the thunder and rain set in, the seed pods of all fruits, plants, and trees

39
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,420
break open.

40
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,000
The time of deliverance is great indeed.

41
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,400
That's wonderful to hear.

42
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,380
Very good indeed.

43
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,980
Yes, yes, yes.

44
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:14,760
And friends, this episode of Hour of Slack is dedicated to the late St. Phil Austin of

45
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:24,140
the Firesign Theater, who boarded his escape saucer last Friday, June 18th, the year the

46
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,940
conspiracy calls 2015.

47
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,980
He had evidently been fighting several forms of cancer without letting on in public, so

48
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,760
it was unexpected to most of his fans.

49
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,080
He was 74.

50
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,080
And the Firesign Theater, well, later in the show, we'll get into what the Firesign Theater

51
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,200
means to the Church of the Subgenius.

52
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:55,720
But Phil Austin was the only member of that group that I never met, although I doubt if

53
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,580
Proctor and Bergman remember me.

54
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,200
I was a baby and barely remember myself.

55
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,620
But Phil Austin is the guy who is famous for the character Nick Danger, private detective,

56
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,460
and also as Happy Harry Cox, the New Age radio host who explained that everything you know

57
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,260
is wrong.

58
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,220
And I could play excerpts from those classics, but that's what everybody's doing who owes

59
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,100
their radio career to the four or five crazy guys of the Firesign Theater.

60
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,300
So instead, for the next 20 minutes or so, I'm going to play cuts you probably haven't

61
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:32,860
heard before.

62
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:43,200
These all come from one Firesign Theater radio hour-hour show broadcast on KPFK in Los Angeles,

63
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,760
February 15th, 1970.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,340
Goodness.

65
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,040
I was a junior in high school.

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,020
That's negative.

67
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,900
Five months.

68
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,460
Yeah.

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,440
Yeah.

70
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


71
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


73
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


75
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


76
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


77
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


79
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


80
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,560


81
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,840
And these all come from that one show.

82
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,900
I went through looking for the Phil Austin-centric parts.

83
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:12,380
And ironically, in 2012, I scoured this very same episode for Peter Bergman clips for the

84
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,520
show that we devoted to him when he died, leaving only now Phil Proctor and Reverend

85
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,060
David Ostman from the original cast.

86
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,480
Anyway, here is a bunch of old Firesign Theater.

87
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,080
and mostly Phil Austin.

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,620
Praise Bob.

89
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,460
Yes?

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,280
That was a nice break.

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,340
You have some correspondence?

92
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,980
I could read finally after all three weeks of promising.

93
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,500
I shall read a Richard Brodigan poem real fast and loud.

94
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,040
Fast and loud. Let's hear it.

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,020
I like to think, in the sooner the better, of a cybernetic meadow

96
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,340
where mammals and computers live together in mutually programming harmony

97
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,400
like pure water touching clear sky.

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,560
I like to think, right now please, of a cybernetic forest

99
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,060
filled with pines and electronics

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,400
where deer stroll peacefully past computers

101
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
as if they were flowers with spinning blossoms.

102
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,760
I like to think, it has to be, of a cybernetic ecology

103
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,920
where we are free of our labors and joined back to nature,

104
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,020
returned to our mammal brothers and sisters

105
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,360
and all watched over by machines of loving grace.

106
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,480
Aw, that's a nice idea.

107
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,260
I like his head.

108
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,080
In the midst of the melon mountain there is a wonderful place called Pearville,

109
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,160
not far away from Banana Glade.

110
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,480
People can easily find Munchy Melon, Barnaby Banana, Corky Corn,

111
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,480
Punchy Pineapple, Percy Pear, and Sassy Strawberry

112
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,100
living there in a happy and blissful way.

113
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,220
They do not even know the meaning of sorrow or suffering

114
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,320
and all people feel happy when they look at them.

115
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,000
They look at their cheerful and funny looking faces.

116
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,280
It's all right, it's all right.

117
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,800
The electrician pulled the plug.

118
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,680
Okay, now let's see.

119
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,500
The next act is going to be, the first song here is

120
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,580
Renee, Psychic Image, Oh Renee.

121
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,380
Volume 1, page 45, Dr. Will Irvick, Irvick Publishing House.

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,160
Now this is the way it goes.

123
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,740
Staging, soft instrumental background with stage movements of dance, mime, acting, cast,

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
and Mr. X taking position.

125
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:22,880
That's me.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,360
Okay.

127
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,380
All right, now the next song here is That Earthbound Spirit

128
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,460
followed by Renee, Psychic Image, Oh Renee.

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Renee said, Mr. X, you sing Renee, Psychic Image.

130
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,640
Don't bother to go through it now, Henry.

131
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,980
Now, as Mr. X finishes singing, the center stage becomes intermittently misty

132
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,080
with greenish highlights and a fantasy with dance mime cast.

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,260
And Mr. X in choreography through several repeats of Renee

134
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,340
and That Earthbound Spirit with key transpositions, background instrumental.

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,000
While this center stage activity continues,

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,060
Mrs. X dramatically speaks the following as she leaves her chair for the second time

137
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,820
and goes to perimeter lighted window overlooking the dance cast center stage scene.

138
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,080
Mrs. X, present century dress.

139
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,600
That haunting melody places me in a period of French history

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,920
and this present life consciousness of occurrence simultaneously.

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Those sounds not only serve as the thread of continuum of past century to present,

142
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,100
but are related to my courtship before marriage.

143
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Through several superimposed levels of awareness manifesting

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,940
as I address this ESP clairvoyant image of mind

145
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,280
and as I remember doing before and praying for same to be in my life.

146
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,420
Oh, I do thank God for the vision while acknowledging the act and it was done.

147
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,560
And I'm partly responsible for having been drawn to this circumstance again and again in various lives.

148
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,660
But I must escape this trap. I must change things.

149
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,240
And the first thing I must change is my consciousness.

150
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,780
She's fading.

151
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,840
Has stopped her feet.

152
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,320
She's fading away.

153
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,900
And coming to me.

154
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,160
She's going off mine.

155
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,160
Him to be coming.

156
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,540
The big question.

157
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,040
Who wrote the book of love?

158
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,540
That's the big question.

159
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,200
Who wrote the book of love?

160
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,520
I want to be the weather man and let the people know

161
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,140
if the sun is coming out or if it's going to snow.

162
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,200
Sorry folks, no weather again today.

163
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,060
But whether I say the weather is cold or whether I say the weather is hot,

164
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,440
it all depends on whether or not I am the weather man.

165
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,440
There are only two things in the world.

166
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
What are they? What? What?

167
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,100
Unity.

168
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,840
Yes.

169
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,080
And duality.

170
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,800
Let's hear it.

171
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,280
Oh boy.

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,200
At one time, but I have changed my mind now, I thought I was going to write a little note at the top of each of these poems.

173
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,900
In the manner of Mr. William Wordsworth, who liked to tell his readers where he was staying

174
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,960
and which of his friends he was walking with and what he was thinking about when the idea of writing his poem came to him.

175
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,600
You will find some lines about a swan here, if you get as far as that.

176
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,260
And I should have explained to you in the note that Christopher Robin, who feeds this swan in the mornings,

177
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,680
has given him the name of Pooh.

178
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,120
This is a very fine name for a swan because if you call him and he doesn't come,

179
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,620
which is a thing swans are good at,

180
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,280
then you can pretend that you were just saying Pooh to show how little you wanted him.

181
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,180
Well, I don't know.

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I should have told you that there are six cows who come down to Pooh's lake every afternoon to graze.

183
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
And of course they say Moo as they come.

184
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,980
So I thought to myself one fine day, walking with my friend Christopher Robin,

185
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,820
Moo rhymes with Pooh.

186
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,560
Surely there's a bit of poetry to be got out of that.

187
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,820
Well then I began to think about the swan on his lake and at first I thought how lucky it was that his name was Pooh.

188
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,100
And then I didn't think about that anymore and the poem came out quite differently from what I intended.

189
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,040
And all I can say for it now is that if it hadn't been for Christopher Robin, I shouldn't have written it.

190
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,720
Which indeed is all I can say for any of the others.

191
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,960
Toot toot toot toot toot toot.

192
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,360
What cryonic services are available to you?

193
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,920

If I was trapped in another world-

216
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,360


217
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,360


218
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,360


219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:53,940

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:53,940


222
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:53,940


223
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,120
I hate yous.

224
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,160
Oh damn, this is the Department of Christmas presents I forgot to give David.

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,880
Wow, down Mamrie Lane, tout automotive!

226
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,360
For you, David, here is this.

227
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,900
A small cellophane bag of what I think are Chinese non doctelike mushrooms.

228
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,000
labeled Cloud Ears.

229
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,460
Cloud Ears?

230
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,860
Cloud Ears, two ounces.

231
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,460
It was the war against the Cloud Clan.

232
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
That was the booty.

233
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,240
Oh, that's nice.

234
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,180
Being sold now in Chinatown in Los Angeles.

235
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,780
I'll pin it up above my desk along with the rest of the ears.

236
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,620
Right.

237
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,420
Thank you.

238
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,420
As ears go by, it's an old-fashioned joke.

239
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Come in.

240
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,600
Dialogue lesson number 72 from New Vaudeville Jokes.

241
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Well, that's the way you get through sector C.

242
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,620
You have to play out the day.

243
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,280
That's the day.

244
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,460
You've got to say,

245
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,520
Hey, fisti vigina, lassi vigina, e la mai passi a porta.

246
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,420
And the guy goes,

247
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,480
That's okay, that's fine, let him through.

248
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,300
And if you miss,

249
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,120
Well, you know, you've seen what they do to those cars.

250
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,040
They make them into little cubes.

251
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:44,860
Really?

252
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,680
You've seen it, haven't you?

253
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,620
Then they play with them.

254
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,720
I'm not saying they do it.

255
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,740
I'm just saying you've seen it.

256
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,720
Oh, come on, man.

257
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,720
I haven't seen that.

258
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,540
I know, I know.

259
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,200
Seen what?

260
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,940
The cars and the little cubes.

261
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,540
And the visions.

262
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,440
I saw them in the movie.

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,280
I have dreams about people throwing long metal spears now, man.

264
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,500
When I go to bed at night,

265
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,340
just before I go to bed,

266
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,580
I put myself in some place like a fantasy, right?

267
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,780
And as I begin to drift off,

268
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,160
sometimes I see myself liked with Gandalf

269
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,720
and making the trip against the darkness.

270
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,940
And now I've got this thing with the spears.

271
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,840
The cast as Timmy Harper.

272
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,080
Cute, expressive face.

273
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,160
Wasp looking.

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,260
As Mrs.

275
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:32,600
Harper.

276
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,200
30.

277
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,240
Warm, typical homemaker type.

278
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:35,880
As Mr.

279
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,340

281
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,940
So long, Mr.

282
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,160
Harper.

283
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,160

Bye, Mario.

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,260

295
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,860
Good old Pete.

296
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,660
See you next week.

297
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
Looks like Mike's your brother.

298
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,300
Another helper.

299
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,000
Eight.

300
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,660
Negro.

301
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,900
And another little helper.

302
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:05,340
Eight.

303
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,120
And dark, somber.

304
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,120

40.

308
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,100
Kindly.

309
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:26,480
And now here's a special important emergency message from Ed Zane of the Small Animals Administration.

310
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,320
That serves him right.

311
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,360
Oh, Mr.

312
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:29,960
Oh.

313
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,020
Oh.

314
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:31,740
Yeah.

315
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,640
There comes a...

316
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,460
Woody Brown here.

317
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,440

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,400
Mr. Mutt.

322
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,060
Yeah.

Oh, right all the way up.

324
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,280
What can I do you?

325
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,220
All the way up Spine Hill.

326
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,220
Well, well, well.

327
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,380
Just here, let me rest my arm here on the...

328
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,120
You just sit down there, Mrs. Gunderson.

329
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,180
You take it easy now.

330
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,380
I'm looking for some liver.

331
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,380
Liver, are you?

332
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,340
I'd like two pounds of liver and a crock rear.

333
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,640
Oh, just a second.

334
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,860
Before you get to that, Mutt, would you hand me some of those police slung shots and billies?

335
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,580
Oh, well, yeah.

336
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,680
They're right over here.

337
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,620
Listen, I can take care of that with you.

338
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,160
Talking about billies.

339
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,600
You take care of old Mrs. Gunderson over there, okay?

340
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:04,880
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,640
Take care of Mrs. Gunderson's liver.

342
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll get those police hooks.

343
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,680
What were those?

344
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,940
Police slung shots and billies.

345
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,080
Slung shots and billies.

346
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,060
Yes, I can, I can, I can find that.

347
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,540
How about get a couple of decoys, Jux, while you're back there?

348
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:15,940
Oh, yeah.

349
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,580
I'll just, I'll just sit down here on the glass eggs.

350
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,120
Yes, sirree.

351
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,500
Are these lard containers supposed to be here, Chops?

352
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,040
That's Vaseline.

353
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,760
Lard containers.

354
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,280
Yeah.

355
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,760
No, no.

356
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,440
That's the cow Vaseline.

357
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
What about the paprika?

358
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,060
Cow Vaseline.

359
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,600
What about the paprika there?

360
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,480
Oh, this paprika, a Hungarian worm.

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,540
It goes next to the chives, freeze-dried.

362
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Oh, yeah, yeah.

363
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,660
I forgot to tell you now, we need a, we need a reorder, you know, on number 237.

364
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:37,960
The man's not.

365
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,560
Oh, have you got any batteries for the electric belts, you fool me?

366
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,920
Oh, you, you've been wearing, you've been wearing them electric belts?

367
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,480
Yes.

368
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:47,840
Oh.

369
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,340
Or do they do anything for your, for your manly virility?

370
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,740
Yeah, for my grunt.

371
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,680
They do?

372
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,260
Yes.

373
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,540
Oh, I've been, I've been.

374
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,300
How many of those can you get for, for like $10, which is what I got to spend on?

375
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,380
Electric belts?

376
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Electric belts, that's what I want.

377
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,800
Well, look, here's a 295 peerless vapor bath cabinet.

378
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,320
Oh, yeah.

379
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,640
Like our brown bath cabinet number two, or maybe a milk oil sheep dip.

380
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,800
I think that we should have some of those.

381
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,960
Do you have any low hawks?

382
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,280
Low hawks?

383
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,180
No, I don't, Mrs. Feverstam.

384
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm afraid that we ate them all.

385
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,580
Oh, no.

386
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes, well, times have been hard.

387
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,220
We sent out for an order of slug festers, and we got back instead those car hooks.

388
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,140
Oh, listen, baby Timmy's got the dropsy on his eyes.

389
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,180
Tell me something.

390
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,240
Yes, I'll tell you anything.

391
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,880
I understand that your grandmother's strung out.

392
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,020
Strung out, yes.

393
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,920
Yeah, I walked by her house the other day.

394
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,200
I noticed she's walking around.

395
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,000
She's got clothes hanging on all the lines.

396
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,300
I've been out there for over a month.

397
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,200
That's because she's got the weeps.

398
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,100
Is that what it is?

399
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,800
She's walking around the house naked, you know.

400
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,620
Yeah, that's right, weeping out of every pore in her body.

401
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,120
Well, I hope she gets better.

402
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,220
I hope she gets better.

403
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,480
Oh, just a minute now, bud.

404
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,340
Listen, that's an obner.

405
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,240
I thought you were supposed to be back at the smokehouse smoking.

406
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,200
Why, don't hit on me, Mrs. Fendon.

407
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,660
You're the only slave I've got.

408
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:13,240
Well, I'd come in to see if you got any junior warden's female pills for all female diseases.

409
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,120
Nabner, Nabner, that's what you come in here for, little Nabner.

410
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:23,200
Well, maybe you could give me some of that Dr. Hammond's knife and brain pills.

411
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,240
Is this for your mistress there, Nabner?

412
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,120
Yeah, I'd like a couple half dozen of genuine.

413
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,280
Diamond herb laxative tea, too.

414
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
Well, that's up on the top there.

415
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,600
You get it up there, you can find it.

416
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:44,140
Mr. Mutt, would you pick me up a couple of gross police slung shots and billets?

417
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,420
Oh, we sold those already.

418
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,260
They's already gone, I'm afraid.

419
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,380
Mr. Mutt, this liver is spotted.

420
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,620
Oh, it's all right, as long as it's not great.

421
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,180
I mean, I'd like one of them double action revolvers.

422
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,720
I think I'd like one of them new service double action revolvers.

423
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,380
I was trying to get this one.

424
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,760
I think maybe I'd like one of them.

425
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,460
Well, there's a grocery store.

426
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,460


427
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,340
I'm going to butcher them up there.

428
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,520
I'm going to crush it on the frontier and target re-revolvers.

429
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,140
There's no way he's out to make up for it.

430
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,200
I can't get on that.

431
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,860
Somebody gave him an opportunity.

432
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,020
That's why he's getting on my nerves.

433
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,460
I'm sorry.

434
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,620
I'm sorry.

435
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,680
I'm sorry.

436
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


437
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


438
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


439
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


440
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


441
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


442
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


443
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


444

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:33,680


446
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,140
I'm Scott Carpenter, and I'm attaching a balloon to this car.

447
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,300
That's not a balloon, Scott.

448
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,420
No, no, no, no.

449
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,100
That's not a balloon.

450
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,960
That's a pencil holder.

451
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,900
No, it's not.

452
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,920
They keep dead fish in those.

453
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,260

You're not the professor anymore, you clown.

509
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,540
I'm not?

510
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,680
This is a free university, you bum.

511
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,920
All right, if I'm not the professor anymore, then who's the professor?

512
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,220
Well, who wants to wear that?

513
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,300
Is it something?

514
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,340
Is it something?

515
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,340


516
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,380
Who wants to carry on the great tradition of education?

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,720
You bums.

518
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,060
You kids.

519
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,880
I'm dropping out.

520
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,520
I am running for president.

521
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,880
Goodbye.

522
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,620
It had been night.

523
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,620
It had been dark night.

524
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,400
Silver birds had flown through the night.

525
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,320
Their wingtips had brushed me.

526
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,500
Their wingtips had brushed my face.

527
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,640
Now it was dawn.

528
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,380
Now I knew it was dawn.

529
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
It was dawn.

530
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,580
It was dawning.

531
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,180
It was getting darker.

532
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,320
It was getting darker.

533
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,400
I knew it was dawning.

534
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,400


535
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,400


536
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,400


537
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,700
It was getting darker.

538
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,040
It was getting darker.

539
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,760
It was getting darker where it was night.

540
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,980
It was getting darker where it was night.

541
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,660
I knew it was dawning.

542
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
I was sitting on the diesel engine.

543
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,100
My back was warm from the diesel engine.

544
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,100
My back was warm from the locomotive.

545
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,060
I was the keeper of the locomotive.

546
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,220
It was dawn.

547
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,520
It was dawning.

548
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
I was yawning.

549
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
It was an all night job.

550
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,340
It was an all night job in the train yards.

551
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,860
It was by the highway.

552
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,580
It was over by the highway.

553
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,840
It was over by the highway ninety nine.

554
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,300
It was underneath the sign that says,

555
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:08,780
said Highway 99. It was underneath the Highway 99 sign. Anyway, the sun came up. The sun was coming

556
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,780
up. It was getting higher in the sky. The sky was turning golden. It was the golden sky. It was the

557
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:22,140
pearl sky. It was our father, the sun. It was the golden sky. It was his pearl sky. Now those birds,

558
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,480
they flew through the dawn. It was like fish leaping in the high country. It was like trout

559
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,560
going about their business in the morning. It was like rainbow trout leaping in the morning.

560
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,000
It was rainbow trout leaping through the dawn. It was the scales of our brother, the fish. He came

561
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,820
leaping through the dawn. He had come back to us safe. He had been away from us. He had come back

562
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:48,720
to us. He had come back to us to make us happy. It was happy. It was like birds flying in the dawn.

563
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,780
I was sitting on the locomotive. I had my feet and my boots hooked in the guardrail.

564
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,360
I was a young man that morning. I was taking the locomotive

565
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,460
to the המι funky iron orр be bem su永 gnaс ağq. Gnaq was έn phộialandg vinn, gnaw gnaw hiäed at where his come from hёл.

566
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,560
to its shed. It had been night. It had been a short run. It had been a short run from Kalinga.

567
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,700
It had been a short run from Chowchilla. It had been a short run from Tulare. It had been a short

568
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,620
run from Dinuba. It was making me happy. I have been remembering it ever since. I have been trying

569
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,480
to say it ever since. Now I have said it again. Now I am finished.

570
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:56,800
Let's see. Tonight, the Firesign Theater Radio Hour Hour was brought to you by

571
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,340
Annie Price.

572
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,820
Yes, we'll make a map.

573
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,480
By the people who are worried about covering the lower half of their body.

574
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,560
By the Department of Forest Paving.

575
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
New Actor Jokes by I. and M. Ottenheimer.

576
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,720
Major Mad Massen Moon Mission, a big little book.

577
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,560
The First Man.

578
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,320
Matsumori's Notebook from the New Yorker.

579
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,380
I had both harmonicas, but cold fevers complete.

580
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,240
From the radio.

581
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:25,980
The Colors.

582
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,480
The

583
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,180
Thank you, John. Thank you, John.

584
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,820
Tell it like it is. The truth.

585
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,620
Tar. Opium.

586
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,060
Thank you.

587
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,880
Now you thank you in pursue of Japanese millions,

588
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,640
and the

589
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,180
I am our enough perfect this long.

590
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,420
Ahem.

591
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,740
It was the nose-tongue and she was useful.

592
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:07,800
Oh.

593
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,360
P recovering for the uy it.

594
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,080
That's it right there.

595
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,080


596
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,080


597
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,080


598
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,280
How are you?

599
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,280


600
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,280


601
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,280


602
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,140
Feel.

603
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,960
ред

604
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,900
Oh, yes, dear friends.

605
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:41,120
A bit of the Firesign Theater with a focus on their late member, Phil Austin,

606
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:53,020
who has skipped ahead for X-Day to wherever the great saints go to party.

607
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,960
I remember the first time I heard a Firesign Theater album, Princess Wee.

608
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:08,500
It was the second album, and I was only 15, and I was at some theater kid's house.

609
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,260
And by that, I mean somebody involved with my high school's theater club,

610
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:20,180
and somebody who probably had sophisticated older theater-type siblings who knew about

611
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,800
things like Tom Lehrer.

612
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,940
And the Firesign Theater.

613
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,480
And while we sat and listened to that stuff in the dark, I remember thinking,

614
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,100
this must be what smoking pot is like.

615
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,040
And a few months later, I proved myself right.

616
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,600
And you know, if I had not heard that album that night, I might today be a very highly

617
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,000
paid, suicidal movie star.

618
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,320
I'm not going to be a movie special effects technician in Hollywood instead of a slackful,

619
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,840
sacred scribe of a weird cult in Cleveland, married to a princess from outer space.

620
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,740
So thanks, Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave.

621
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,100
You guys probably saved my life.

622
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,760
I don't know where I'd be without the Firesign Theater.

623
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,380
On the other hand, I was looking at that, I was cleaning up my room and unearthed one

624
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,980
of my Zap comics from my collection.

625
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:22,980


626
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,940
I don't know where I'd be without the underground comics.

627
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,520
I'm pretty sure if any of those things had been missing, I wouldn't be working for the

628
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,300
Church of the Subgenius now.

629
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,980
I wouldn't even be able to understand Bob at all.

630
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,560
And there was a lot of things that were like that, not just underground comics and the

631
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,020
Firesign Theater, but see if you can think of any others like this.

632
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,540
Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shay and their book Illuminatus.

633
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,400
Which included some of the stuff from the Discordians, which I originally thought they

634
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,220
had made up themselves.

635
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,300
Frank Zappa.

636
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,180
Ray Harryhausen.

637
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,000
The great special effects, the Three Stooges.

638
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,660
The Warner Brothers cartoons.

639
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,140
Mammy and Pappy.

640
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,240
Oh, and Dr. Philo Drummond, I suppose.

641
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,980
All of their influences are inestimable.

642
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,960
I'm not sure.

643
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,200
Yeah.

644
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,140
So, I guess it's a list that never ends.

645
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,380
A list of sinners.

646
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,660
As Bob, well actually it wasn't Bob that said this.

647
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,840
Titor Gumphreys, you haven't heard this one yet.

648
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,880
Titor Gumphreys spouted something.

649
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,000
Said, Bob loves the sin, but hates the sinner.

650
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,900
And it looks like one of those sinners is finally calling in.

651
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,140
I'm not alone.

652
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,000
This is not a coincidence.

653
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,640
Hello?

654
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm not alone.

655
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,920
It is.

656
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,460
Hello.

657
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,040
It is.

658
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,540
And I just got a message I believe from you.

659
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,160
Well, I don't believe in what you're saying, but I believe from you.

660
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,440
Saying, what the hell are you doing?

661
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,240
It's 927.

662
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,300
We were just talking about Phil Austin and the Firesign Theater.

663
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,640
Yes.

664
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,820
And I played a bunch of their stuff.

665
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,380
Yes.

666
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,880
And I then described how the...

667
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,940
I think it's the...

668
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:22,940


669
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:22,940


670
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:22,940


671
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:30,960
In my case, I owed my existence as a subgenius to not just the Firesign Theater, but other

672
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,540
things as well.

673
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:44,280
But I have a feeling, Dave, that you, me, puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, and a whole

674
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,960
mess of other subgeniuses wouldn't even know what to do with the microphone if it weren't

675
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,660
for those guys.

676
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,420
Yes.

677
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,600
I would concur with said monitors.

678
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,760
It's totally, completely false.

679
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,820
It's true.

680
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,760
It's completely true what you said.

681
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,960
And just think it's the second Firesigner now, who were all named after the Firesigns

682
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,160
of the astrological, zoological chart.

683
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,420
The other one was Peter Bergman, who was actually a Cleveland lad in his ladhood before being

684
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,540
summoned to the great comedian in the sky, I suppose.

685
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,140
And now this.

686
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,780
So there's only two left.

687
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,160
There's...

688
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,400
There's Osman and who else now?

689
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,760
Phil Proctor.

690
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,720
Osman and Proctor are still alive.

691
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,680
Yep.

692
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,600
Yep.

693
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,640
In fact, it was...

694
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,980
I heard on...

695
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:36,700
I heard the news that this happened Friday, and I heard the news on Facebook by way of

696
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,260
Paul Mavridis, by way of Phil Proctor.

697
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:45,240
Paul had forwarded Proctor's message, and that's how I got it.

698
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,580
Wow.

699
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,440
Yeah.

700
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,800
Apparently, it was fairly unexpected.

701
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,400
Yeah.

702
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,700
I mean, I think he was a little bit disappointed by everybody but Phil Austin and probably

703
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,080
his wife, Una.

704
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,680
So...

705
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:57,960
Yeah.

706
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,000
But it is true what you said that many folks who...

707
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,580
Now, there is really nothing like what Firesign did and continues to do.

708
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,460
And think of the early days of the first four albums and stuff, and how they actually predicted

709
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,640
everything that's going on right now without having a computer to work with.

710
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,360
Indeed.

711
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,140
It is true.

712
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,400
Oh, no.

713
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,580
You mean people could work without computers?

714
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,780
Apparently.

715
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,760
How did that ever happen?

716
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,880
They used a lot of paper.

717
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,560
They used a lot of paper.

718
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,800
They cut down a lot of trees.

719
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,300
And to roll their marijuana cigarettes in, I bet.

720
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,080
Mm-hmm.

721
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,440
And they were prophetic.

722
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,000
Prophetic.

723
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,860
And they were profound.

724
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,040
And profound.

725
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,460
And they're preferred by nine out of ten ladies and gentlemen.

726
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,120
Absolutely.

727
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,740
Well, actually, they're unknown to most ladies and gentlemen.

728
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,620
But they're preferred by the group that is the core of the group.

729
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


730
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


731
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


732
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


733
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


734
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


735
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


736
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


737
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:49,620


738
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,540
I mean, they're part of the core of my social circle right now.

739
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,020
If it hadn't been for Firesign Theater, I'm not sure what any of those folks would have

740
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,440
been doing.

741
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,580
Oh, they'd have gotten in big trouble.

742
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,760
They've kept them off the streets.

743
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,220
Yes.

744
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,400
And they're still reciting those albums.

745
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,620
They absolutely are.

746
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:04,880
Ad nauseum.

747
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,500
Yes.

748
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,100
Well, you know, this was kind of before your time, Dave.

749
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,440
But at Starwood, we used to have a little group every year called the Firesign Clones.

750
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,280
And we would do...

751
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,300
We would read through their radio plays.

752
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,140
We would go up on stage.

753
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,060
I was one one year and I flunked.

754
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,860
Wilson Bomb fired me because, well, I read the wrong line at the wrong time.

755
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,500
And I said, did we get to Goshen yet?

756
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,700
And that wasn't the right line for that moment.

757
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,920
And everybody looked at me.

758
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,700
And then someone else said the other line.

759
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
And then they said, are we to Goshen?

760
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,380
Are we to Goshen?

761
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,060
Why are we to Goshen?

762
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,940
So I...

763
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,620
In my youth, I recall like there would be like ten stumble bum musicians in a room.

764
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


765
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


766
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


767
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


768
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


769
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


770
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


771
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:49,620


772
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,620
From different bands.

773
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,900
And somebody would play Firesign Theater.

774
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:59,320
And like three of the musicians would go and huddle by the stereo and sit there transfixed

775
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,140
and not say anything.

776
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,540
And the rest of the musicians would all take drugs and chase women and do all the bad things

777
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,400
musicians do.

778
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,620
Why not both?

779
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,780
It was just like, well, yeah, yeah, that's funny.

780
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,480
Right, right.

781
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,820
Yeah.

782
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,820
What is it again?

783
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,540
Meanwhile, the other three are being in and being in with this insanity and spew out

784
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,420
all the lines at a moment's notice from the next day on.

785
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,480
For the rest of their lives.

786
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,380
Like we're all Bosers on this bus, all that stuff.

787
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,420
Right.

788
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,100
They were the first ones who said that so we could say it.

789
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:27,620
Right.

790
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:35,000
Well, they were the first ones to write complex, surreal radio plays.

791
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:41,160
Plus they did the improv live radio stuff that we try to do.

792
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,100
Yes.

793
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,900
Those are two different types of things.

794
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
Their albums are very different from their live radio shows.

795
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,140
They glean their materials.

796
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,140


797
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,720
From their KPFK.

798
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:02,400
And you know, did you know that all of their early shows, all four years, 1970 through

799
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,720
74, are available with a book called The Duke of Madness Motors that came out about four

800
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,740
or five years ago from Sealand Records.

801
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,800
That's the Negative Land Friends and FiresignTheatre.com.

802
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:26,340
And a guy, our friend, Reverend Taylor Jessen, who accumulated all of this material and

803
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:35,100
put all of those shows in high quality MP3s all on one big DVD, which comes or came with

804
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,040
the book Duke of Madness Motors.

805
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,780
And that's what we listened to a little tiny fraction of tonight.

806
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,420
Lucky consumers.

807
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,800
Now here's something funny from this book.

808
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,780
And, uh, and I'm going to read it to you.

809
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:48,780


810
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,680
And there's little interviews or statements from all four of the four or five crazy guys.

811
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Um, here's Phil Austin talking about doing the shows.

812
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,160
We smoked pot all through those radio shows.

813
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,860
The Dear Friends album has me smoking pot on the cover for God's sake.

814
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,800
This is the period when we were sitting around, uh, writing around a big table at my house

815
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,740
in Silver Lake.

816
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,620
And we'd stare at my film cereal posters.

817
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,200
And smoke huge amounts of really good, cheap marijuana.

818
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:24,580
Laughs.

819
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,360
People would buy it in huge paper bags for a dollar or something.

820
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,800
Pot didn't affect our intelligence.

821
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,160
It just broke down the barriers of logical transitions.

822
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:41,220
There was a strong intellectual stance on non-associative transitions in all the arts

823
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,060
at that point.

824
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,840
Dance, theater, music, rock and roll, everything.

825
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,000
So if somebody wanted to pop up and run in some direction.

826
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,880
Theoretically, three other guys were going to run after him.

827
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,640
Nobody was going to sit there going, wait a minute, this isn't going to get me a job

828
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,260
writing on the Mary Tyler Moore show.

829
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:04,740
We were operating in an absolute hippie ethos love fest, giving up our individual egos and

830
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,000
having the Firesign Theater up front.

831
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,640
And we're all so grateful that they smoked that much to produce so much.

832
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,500
Who says who in this, in this noble decal.

833
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm sorry.

834
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:17,980


835
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,080
You know, Kate Cr relação em agora, qualificar do seu ar 강

836
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,080


837
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,080


838
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,080


839
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,960
se val mee ir cá com o People take on a stroke of marijuana next thing you know.

840
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,780
You won't want to do anything.

841
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,940
Meanwhile, I came out with what, like 900 albums or something like that.

842
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,080
Yeah.

843
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,220
I mean, were still thing.

844
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
One of them sold millions of copies.

845
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,520
Proctor at home and vakरevna has his own little thing that we keep.

846
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,980
My brains, Kultur we we fixa.

847
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:45,120
He still does a little column called Planet Proctor that you see in some weeklies and the Funny Times.

848
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,180
And they were doing podcasts.

849
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,280
The phony detective guy.

850
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,760
What's his name?

851
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,680
Nick Danger.

852
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,760
Nick Danger.

853
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,840
Yes, I'm sorry.

854
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,260
I forgot.

855
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,700
Rignodkassin.

856
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,460
Yes, Rignodkassin.

857
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,900
But anyway, the funny thing about Austin talking about all the pot they were smoking at KPFK,

858
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,940
by contrast, the next page, here's Peter Bergman.

859
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:19,900
Cigarettes were allowed inside the radio station, but I don't remember ever toking up on the air in any of the radio work I did there.

860
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,900
I almost never in my entire career have performed publicly in any way high.

861
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,860
The couple of times I have I think were disastrous.

862
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,860
For being as wildly surrealistic as we were, we were very professional.

863
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,240
I'm sure that we weren't smoking pot live because it would have put the station at risk.

864
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,180
We may have come on slightly high, but we certainly didn't get high on the air.

865
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,940
So there you have conflicting.

866
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:51,540
I tend to think that what it was was they were so high, Bergman doesn't remember whether they were smoking on the air.

867
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,880
Yes, that's my perception.

868
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
Sounds quite likely.

869
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:01,700
Oh, here, a little bit further down, he says, and thanks to KPFA and Pacifica at the time for letting us do it.

870
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,720
We'd be darned if we could get a show like that today.

871
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,880
It would be lovely if Clear Channels.

872
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,560
Or Infinity or Premier would call up Firesign Theatre and say, you know, we really need you guys.

873
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,660
Just get around a microphone and let her rip.

874
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:21,040
You know, the sad thing is, was it Sirius or no, but the one that was taken over by Sirius Radio.

875
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,900
The guy that also was going to put Lou Brutus was going to put Hour of Slack on.

876
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:35,660
And he did put, Firesign Theatre had a weekly live show about six or seven years ago for four weeks or so.

877
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,640
Yes.

878
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,560
But as soon as one drunk jock emailed him and said, I don't get it.

879
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,260
That's just nonsense.

880
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,400
They canceled the Firesign Theatre.

881
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:53,640
The guy never even returned my phone calls after I said, no, you can't play our show every day for a year for $600.

882
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,120
No.

883
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,340
While advertising?

884
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:55,960
No.

885
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:03,040
No, you have to give us a little bit more than we got in the 70s from a television show, Night Flight.

886
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,520
Anyway.

887
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,760
Phooey.

888
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,840
So.

889
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,000
There you go.

890
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:16,420
Imagine like with the government and the big corporations and MK Ultra, and they can put the laryngeal implants right in the esophagus glands.

891
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,400
And that way, you know, a person could be, could without knowing it, be a fire scientist.

892
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:33,140
And suddenly start spouting all this genius and brilliant stuff without even knowing what he's talking about, especially if he's on the bus or he's like waiting in the grocery store line or something like that.

893
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,580
And then he could talk with his regular voice at the same time.

894
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:46,940
And I think that's one of the most abysmally dark hearted things that our universal Prince Saurad, some people call him Prince Saurad.

895
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,160
I call him, you know, we have different names for him.

896
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,800
Well.

897
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,660
I think that's.

898
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,140
I don't know.

899
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:59,340
It just makes me sad, especially since this is the penumbrance day of the passage of Mr. Oswise.

900
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,420
Well, it's actually not true that you can't do radio like that.

901
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,460
Anymore, because that's what we're doing right now.

902
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:22,680
And if we suddenly fell over dead, I could put on two hours of puzzling evidence show, which is likewise similarly an acquired taste.

903
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,460
But I mean, let's face it.

904
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,500
KPFA in Berkeley is doing that kind of radio.

905
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,460
WCSB in Cleveland.

906
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,700
WREK in Atlanta.

907
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,420
WORT in Madison.

908
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,840
Oh, no.

909
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,680
WEFT quit doing it.

910
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,760
Champagne.

911
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,800
But WHUS in Storrs, Connecticut.

912
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,140
And that other station in Storrs, Connecticut that Rob Zarka does.

913
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,380
Those are all stations that play.

914
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,200
They don't pay exactly, but they play this kind of stuff.

915
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,300
And they're probably all playing Roller Maidens from Outer Space right now.

916
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,260
Right this very moment.

917
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,540
Yeah.

918
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,900
But that's not what we played.

919
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:14,140
We played rare stuff that you could only get off of that, off of the ancient shows.

920
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,260
The rare ancient shows.

921
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,660
Like chili pepper, it's mildly unreasonable for those without digestive problems.

922
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,820
But the really sad thing about it, I think, is that there is a layering or the paneling of the country and stuff now.

923
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,080
So that there's like people on one intellectual level.

924
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,940
And you think a whole completely different.

925
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,380
It's completely.

926
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,240
It's all.

927
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,020
Totally.

928
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:44,740
But a totally and completely different way and perceive things totally and completely differently than the rest of the people.

929
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,540
There's there's no there's no space.

930
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,280
There's no connective tissue.

931
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,600
There's no connect.

932
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,960
There's no connective tissue.

933
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,440
The center does not hold.

934
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,440
Right.

935
00:39:54,600 --> 00:40:03,720
So you can sit there and laugh your derriere expository parts off while a person right next to you think is equally of fitness to you.

936
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,900
Or on the same level of understanding.

937
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,800
And stuff will go like, like, yeah, it's like, OK.

938
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,820
So that's what that's what our listeners are saying right now.

939
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,640
I'm going to switch over to Rush Limbaugh.

940
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,840
That's a lot more popular.

941
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,260
And I can see why, too.

942
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,740
These guys don't make any sense.

943
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,300
Hitchhikers.

944
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,460
Yeah.

945
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,860
So how about about this one is more normal stuff.

946
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,280
You can tell.

947
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,020
It was deeply grounded in radio theater of the 1940s and 50s.

948
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,240
Right.

949
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,840
But nobody.

950
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,980
Most people don't even know what that is now.

951
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,420
Actually, they were inspired by the Goon show.

952
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,040
Right.

953
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:42,480
Yes.

954
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,180
The British show.

955
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,240
British radio show with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan and the other guy that nobody ever remembers.

956
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,700
Harry Seacombe.

957
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,160
Yeah.

958
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:50,980
Harry Seacombe.

959
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:59,860
And that they were they paved the way for the Fireside Theater and no doubt for Monty Python also.

960
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,520
Now, you notice I'm leaving Cheech and Chong out of this whole formula because they were.

961
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,860
Strictly dope humor of the 70s.

962
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,880
Whereas the Fireside Theater stuff sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday.

963
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,820
Most of it.

964
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,440
They might occasionally refer to Nixon, but so does Futurama.

965
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,900
So, you know, I mean, it's it is actually uncanny.

966
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,560
Their stuff has held up beautifully.

967
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:33,660
It didn't reach as many people as, say, Monty Python did.

968
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:39,920
And but even before, you know, the Goon show had to be inspired by somebody.

969
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,360
And I would I would venture to say maybe the writers like Lewis Carroll come into the picture here.

970
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,880
But he was of a totally different genre and media and era.

971
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,940
And so, you know.

972
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,520
Who?

973
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,060
Which?

974
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
Lewis Carroll.

975
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,960
Well, yeah, right.

976
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,920
They hadn't invented recordings yet, but they had invented mind blowing.

977
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,540
Paradoxical.

978
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:04,620
Sentences.

979
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:15,120
But I would be willing to bet that the Goon show was influenced in some small way by some British or perhaps American or Canadian, I guess, in the day they were all listening to each other and stuff.

980
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:24,220
From the 30s or 40s, some kind of Professor Erwin Corey-ish type of crew of people who were into non sequiturs and absurdums.

981
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:32,660
Well, there actually was a lot of radio comedy that was pretty absurd and non sequiturian.

982
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,660
What was the Bickerson's?

983
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:37,660
The Bickerson's.

984
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:38,700
The Bickerson's.

985
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:38,880
Right.

986
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,660
Don Amici and what's her name?

987
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,520
That was actually a pretty.

988
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,540
It was America's first comedy show about a dysfunctional marriage, they say.

989
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,140
Yes.

990
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,800
Yes.

991
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,560
Correcto bundle.

992
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,600
And those are actually really funny.

993
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,860
For that matter, some of the.

994
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,240
Don't get me wrong.

995
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,660
Some of the Amos and Andy shows are quite funny.

996
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,500
They're very well written.

997
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,440
And quite non sequiturist, too.

998
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:03,820
Yeah.

999
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,340
Yeah.

1000
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,000
Bull Dada.

1001
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:05,920
Yes.

1002
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:13,600
Well, earlier tonight's show, the Firesign were doing a takeoff on their favorite old timey comedy radio show.

1003
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,800
There was a segment they called Mutt and Cheops.

1004
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,640
And they were.

1005
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,780
It sounded exactly like a 1940s comedy show, like in a little Abner kind of environment.

1006
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,900
You know, Ma and Pa Kettle takeoffs.

1007
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,700
Now, this is all generational.

1008
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,320
As you say.

1009
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,900
Your clam pigs are getting damp.

1010
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm sorry.

1011
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,640
We're in our 60s.

1012
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:40,260
So, of course, we not only remember the Firesign Theater, we can quote them, you know, chapter and verse.

1013
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,480
But the kids, these kids these days.

1014
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,260
You say it anywhere.

1015
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,580
Perhaps as you're going uptown to go to the police department and pay your ticket.

1016
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,020
And as you hand them your check, you say, oh, gee, the clam cakes are getting damp and stuff like that.

1017
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,620
And they would let you go free.

1018
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,460
We're all meant to be free.

1019
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,180
Come on.

1020
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:03,920
Dang.

1021
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,100
I know it's not true.

1022
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,860
Yeah, I was going to say.

1023
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:07,860
Yeah.

1024
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah.

1025
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:17,180
If you say that at the police station, they'll say, would you please disarm yourself, turn around and run away so that we can shoot you from behind?

1026
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,080
Oh, make sure your video camera is on.

1027
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,440
Yeah, I know.

1028
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:21,840
I know.

1029
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,460
It's not a.

1030
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,480
It kind of stopped being funny at some point earlier this week, I think.

1031
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,200
Finally.

1032
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,780
I think it was 1865.

1033
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:31,720
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,220
Yeah.

1035
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,380
Actually, it stopped being.

1036
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,840
Funny back when it started.

1037
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,040
Yes.

1038
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,320
Here we are.

1039
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,900
Set loose.

1040
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,180
Broken hearted.

1041
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,140
On beautiful Lake.

1042
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,800
Painted diamond verbally.

1043
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,660
Savage.

1044
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:50,860
Savage.

1045
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,520
Flushed.

1046
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,500
From deep in my bosom.

1047
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,420
Have you ever talked to your bosom?

1048
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,160
Did you know that men can have nipples?

1049
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,960
Hey, you know what we can't forget, though?

1050
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,200
You know what we can't forget, though?

1051
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,360
What is it that we can't forget?

1052
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,120
Forget what we're saying.

1053
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:13,160
It's, you know, in previous years of the last show before we leave for leaving for Wisteria,

1054
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:19,700
we would normally be talking about the upcoming minor little event we call the end of the

1055
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:25,300
planet Earth and all human reality and the beginning of a subgenius only reality called

1056
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,480
X-Day.

1057
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,880
X-Day.

1058
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,340
And when X-Day is successful, we celebrate it with a party.

1059
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,440
A party called Starwood.

1060
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,060
And even if it's not successful, we still have the Starwood.

1061
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,080
Well, Starwood takes place on your saucer.

1062
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,800
Isn't that it?

1063
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,160
Right.

1064
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,480
And my saucer is going to look like Wisteria no matter what for the first couple of weeks.

1065
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,320
So...

1066
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,720
Well, that's what I was wondering.

1067
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,620
How, you know, maybe someday instead of having Starwood or something, when everybody comes

1068
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,440
to and comes back around and stuff like that, you could maybe have a...

1069
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,500
You could have a...

1070
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,320
You could have a...

1071
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,800
You could sell them hamburgers or other comestibles.

1072
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,060
Or, you know, you could do something different instead of having that.

1073
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,560
Yeah, the world could end for once.

1074
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:20,040
You know, normally I would be reading from the Bob Leografon about how the mystery of

1075
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,620
X-Day may prove to be a lesson that some subgeniuses desperately need to learn.

1076
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,320
They should be damn glad the Church of the Subgenius got to them before Heaven's Gate

1077
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:27,660
did.

1078
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,280
But instead, I will mention that we're getting very excited.

1079
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:39,120
In between all of our swag making and clean up and schedule brochure editing.

1080
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,280
And the crushing of the protuberances, too.

1081
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,720
There's so many going on now.

1082
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,840
Well, we're going to be seeing all our friends.

1083
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,720
Next week, Dr. Howell will be here in the studio, probably for three hours.

1084
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,340
The live, real Dr. Howell in the flesh will be here.

1085
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,900
And then he'll be back again the week after that from the saucers.

1086
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,100
But, yeah, we're going to be seeing...

1087
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,380
Oh, gosh.

1088
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,240
Dr. Philodrum is going to be there.

1089
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,960
We're going to jam.

1090
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,940
Doctors for Wotan will play.

1091
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:12,380
Poo Water Towel will be joining Doctors for Wotan.

1092
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,600
Those are the two greatest bands.

1093
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,160
Type it in on YouTube, man.

1094
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,720
Type in Poo Water Towel.

1095
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,260
Type in Poo Water...

1096
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,500
Just Google Poo Water Towel YouTube.

1097
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,320
And you'll see that it is indeed a two-piece band.

1098
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,600
But anyway, yeah.

1099
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,600
We don't know if the Mutant Mountain Boys are going to be there.

1100
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,720
But we know that a Mutant Mountain Boy will be there.

1101
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,200
Reverend Andrew Genis for sure will be.

1102
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,120
And it'll be a party.

1103
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,940
Somebody's going to bring another Bob dummy for killing or burning rather than sexing.

1104
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,640
I cannot for the life of me understand your love of doing such things to Bob.

1105
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,080
It's such a brilliant old chap.

1106
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,760
And you're so full of himself.

1107
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,040
Well, usually by the end of the weekend, the saucers haven't come.

1108
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,460
And people are a little bit irritated at old pipe face.

1109
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,440
I would say irate would be a little bit more accurate.

1110
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,580
And they want to burn, burn, burn him.

1111
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,420
People were lighting marijuana cigarettes off of his flaming face.

1112
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,440
Well, I did see someone toasting a hot dog over his burning head.

1113
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,740
Yes, indeed.

1114
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,620
Anyway, so.

1115
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,280
S'mores out of Bob's lessons.

1116
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,240
I get it.

1117
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,280
S'mores out of Les Fonz and Bob's.

1118
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,500
Oh, no.

1119
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,660
Anyway, we've been getting more pre-registrations.

1120
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,020
I think we're going to have a new crop of newbies and newbies.

1121
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,320
Which is good because the oldies don't look so good.

1122
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,560
Are they newbies, Levi?

1123
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,440
Or are they?

1124
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,380
They're both.

1125
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,200
I'm empowered with the spirit, with the community spirit that we can take out into the streets

1126
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,100
and spit on the ground and say, this is my hometown.

1127
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,140
You can just go.

1128
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,660
You can just go.

1129
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,220
You can just go.

1130
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,260
You can just go.

1131
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,260


1132
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,260


1133
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,260


1134
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,260


1135
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,260
You can just get out of here and stuff.

1136
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:12,400
That's a cross-section of weirdos, old and young, grandpas and grandkids, all kinds.

1137
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:18,500
We're bringing Princess Weemaw, Grandma Bob is going to be there.

1138
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,020
We even rented a golf cart to tote her around in and show her off.

1139
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,640
Now, you're not going to leave her in charge of the goat, are you?

1140
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,860
Because last time that proved truthful.

1141
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,860
She loves that goat, man.

1142
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,560
She is still talking about the goat.

1143
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,820
She just fell in love with that black goat.

1144
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,040
Yeah, the black goat of the woods with a thousand young.

1145
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,140
With the white J on his side.

1146
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,200
His name is James.

1147
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,680
Why is that part?

1148
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,260
What's the white J on his side?

1149
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:53,460
It's just a marking on the side of the goat in the shape of a J, which made his owners call him James.

1150
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,400
Well, there's going to be more than goats.

1151
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,320
There's going to be an evolution control committee.

1152
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:07,860
At both X Day and Starwood, there will be devivals at X Day and Starwood.

1153
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,960
In fact, there'll be two devivals at Starwood.

1154
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,820
One on the main stage and one in the Pufferdome with the Waking Dream people,

1155
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,860
who are like a multimedia giant puppet making crazy people.

1156
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,420
The Pufferdome is an air-supported nightclub that we had made for us.

1157
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,340
We have a Pufferdome album starring Dave and the Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1158
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,220
Oh, yes, I know.

1159
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,760
But not...

1160
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,380
A lot of the listening audience has never heard of the Pufferdome.

1161
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:34,400
They don't know.

1162
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,260
They don't know nothing about this stuff.

1163
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,720
Well, if they went to Starwood.com and read about it, they would know more.

1164
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,500
Starwood.com, you say?

1165
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,020
Starwoodfestival.com.

1166
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,500
Oh, that's right.

1167
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,300
It's Starwoodfestival.com.

1168
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:47,520
Yes.

1169
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,280
If they're interested, they could go there and read about it.

1170
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,780
Were they interested?

1171
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,160
If you were interested, yes.

1172
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,080
Sort of like subgenius.com.

1173
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,460
Were a person, for whatever bizarre reason, interested in...

1174
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,460
X Day.

1175
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:02,780
X Day.

1176
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,880
Now, these places are not in Cleveland.

1177
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,920
They happen in a campground near Athens in southern Ohio.

1178
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,040
And we're praying that it rains a little.

1179
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,220
Just had to cool off.

1180
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,560
Yeah.

1181
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,240
Way down upon Ohio River.

1182
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:19,820
That's where it is.

1183
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,480
I would not expect that in the Ohio River with what it's doing right now.

1184
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,900
And, you know, maybe it will change by then.

1185
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,080
But what it's doing right now, it's like in the middle of a July pattern.

1186
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,760
And it's stuck.

1187
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,340
And it's still...

1188
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:31,540
Until June.

1189
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,660
And there was no strawberries in the northern part of the state this year.

1190
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,840
Another agricultural entanglement thanks to the weather.

1191
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,460
Goodness.

1192
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,540
I didn't know that.

1193
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,500
It also ruined two other large industries because of the coldness.

1194
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:55,140
Ruined the wine grape industry and stuff, which was getting all kinds of awards from France and California and New York State and whoever else used to be their competitors.

1195
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,960
And just like that.

1196
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,900
Just conquered in, you know, regular grapes.

1197
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,100
No.

1198
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,220
Or, you know, native grapes.

1199
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,480
No more varietals.

1200
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,960
And then they botched up the strawberry crop.

1201
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,980
There's no peach crop because of the weather.

1202
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:10,680
Goodness.

1203
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,240
In northern Ohio.

1204
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:22,960
And we used to go to a huge peach orchards in the summertime and dance around with our shoes off and throw peaches at, you know, the idyllic, you know, Garden of Eden.

1205
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,700
That's all against the law now, Dave.

1206
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,180
Mm-hmm.

1207
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:30,080
Frolicking, taking your shoes off.

1208
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,460
Throwing peaches.

1209
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,780
These are all things that people of the primitive barbaric past used to do.

1210
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,400
Now we stay indoors and obey.

1211
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,000
Yeah.

1212
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:57,820
So unless you're a subgenius or some kind of crazy pagan weirdo interested person, then you can go take, by golly, you can take off your clothes, climb a tree and learn to play the flute.

1213
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,320
Or something like that.

1214
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,100
Yeah.

1215
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,780
Yeah.

1216
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,800
You can go hug a tree.

1217
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,540
Yeah.

1218
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,660
You can do more than just hug a tree out there.

1219
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,400
Sorry.

1220
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,760
So, yeah.

1221
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,220
Yes.

1222
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,600
We're all, as you can see, we're, we're excited about this whole thing.

1223
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:28,480
And we can't exactly advertise the way we would like to or the way we would say we were running.

1224
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,020
Say this was a Christian radio station.

1225
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,860
Which would be commercial, therefore.

1226
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,080
Then we could.

1227
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,580
But we're not on those kinds of stations.

1228
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,820
But we're on the kind stations.

1229
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,060
These.

1230
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,520
The kind stations.

1231
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:49,500
I just heard on one of those revel-racious stations that you're talking about of the real crazy Christians.

1232
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,720
They were having this thing where it looked like thousands of people.

1233
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,220
I know they do a lot of green screen work when they make the cathedrals look, you know, like they take 30,000 people.

1234
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,100
But maybe there are 30,000 people.

1235
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,620
And they're not a couple of substandard intelligence there.

1236
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,120
Sure.

1237
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:03,480
Anyway.

1238
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,060
Why not?

1239
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,720
They were doing a thing called pump up Jesus.

1240
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,800
And I was thinking, how?

1241
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,340
He needs help, friends.

1242
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:10,700
How are we going to do this?

1243
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,340
He's not all powerful like they say.

1244
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,920
He needs the help of little illiterate old ladies.

1245
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,480
Praying.

1246
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,800
And more.

1247
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,180
Pray.

1248
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,740
Don't get off your butt.

1249
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,440
Just pray.

1250
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,780
That'll help Jesus.

1251
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,000
He needs help so badly.

1252
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,400
We need to pump him up.

1253
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,240
We need to pump him up.

1254
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:27,480
Him up.

1255
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,860
Let's just use like one of those gigantic.

1256
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,680
One of those huge balloons.

1257
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,080
That looks like a balloon.

1258
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,420
That looks like a furry critter or the invisible snowman.

1259
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,600
Remember that episode?

1260
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:36,700
Nah.

1261
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:40,320
You know, I think some people are giving the Lord a bad name.

1262
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,080
That's the problem.

1263
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,380
The world?

1264
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,100
They're giving Jesus a bad name.

1265
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,600
The Lord Jesus.

1266
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,720
His fan club.

1267
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,240
Jesus is just all right with me.

1268
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,300
That's all he is.

1269
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,200
He's just all right.

1270
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,520
His fan club.

1271
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,040
Some of them.

1272
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:56,900
I don't know.

1273
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,020
I don't know.

1274
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,620
Dave, it's almost time to go.

1275
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:06,040
I have a touching tearjerker song by Phil Austin to play.

1276
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,240
Oh, I think I might like to hear it.

1277
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,900
In the background, of course.

1278
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,580
No, not in the...

1279
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,920
Yeah, you would be in the background.

1280
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:13,740
Yeah.

1281
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,020
It's...

1282
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,980
I think we played...

1283
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,960
We played it at the end of the Peter Bergman Memorial show.

1284
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,680
And now here we are playing it again for the guy singing it.

1285
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,600
And crazy people who talk all of it.

1286
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,960
And I think we're playing it all at the same time, because that's what the song is about.

1287
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,100
Oh, you took all the funny-ness out of me.

1288
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,560
Well, Dave, well, this is kind of...

1289
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,400
It is kind of...

1290
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,600
It's not exactly a funny song.

1291
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,540
But I'm gonna...

1292
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,180
I'm gonna pot you down and light up the pot.

1293
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,280
I'm just kidding.

1294
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,080
Potting David down.

1295
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:50,240
A little bit.

1296
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,980
And then I'm gonna play this...

1297
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,960
This song here.

1298
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:53,500
Okay.

1299
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,620
My friends are all crazy.

1300
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,260
They're mad as loons.

1301
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,580
The talk is slow.

1302
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:00,580


1303
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:00,580


1304
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:00,580


1305
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:00,580


1306
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:11,440
all at once, it's a hundred tunes. You hear them at night as you push down the highway like loons

1307
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:24,060
landing, elusive loon fly away. And oh, can it be true, y'all feel free to just join in,

1308
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:37,600
that there's no rest for the wicked, no peace for us too. Amazing what sounds you can get out of a banana.

1309
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:46,880
Now the laughers and screamers, their crosstalk is incredible. It's all you can do to believe

1310
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:53,600
they're inedible. And policemen and doctors hover around the edges,

1311
00:56:54,060 --> 00:57:04,940
as they drag in new converts and make them sign pledges. And oh, can it be true,

1312
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:17,600
well that there's no rest for the wicked, no peace for us too.

1313
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,040
Now me and my singing,

1314
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,040


1315
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,040


1316
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:24,040


1317
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:33,360
sweetheart have tried to escape we secretly put down our thoughts on this tape and we're sending

1318
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:43,340
it out so all we might hear don't you talk all at once so you'll wind up right here and oh

1319
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,340
oh can it be true

1320
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,980
there's no rest for the wicked

1321
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:00,680
there's no peace for us

1322
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,220
all right one more

1323
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:09,900
a passage of loons to their home in the sky

1324
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:15,020
don't tempt me a bit i think i'll pass it right by

1325
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,020
so listen up friends

1326
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,600
now you've heard my sad tune

1327
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,000
but don't be tempted

1328
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,400
to talk all at once

1329
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,360
like a loon

1330
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,940
and oh

1331
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,920
can it be true

1332
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,300
that there's no

1333
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,700
rest for the wicked

1334
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,820
no peace for us two

1335
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,360
y'all sound beautiful

1336
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:51,980
applause

1337
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,400
well I don't know

1338
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,240
I don't know

1339
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,240
I don't know how far out in space you have to get

1340
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,180
to get that far out

1341
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,000
that's quality on this show you know

1342
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,800
beyond the orbit of the asteroids

1343
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,100
we're lucky we're sponsored I tell you that

1344
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,240
Hilario you know now that football's been

1345
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,020
outlawed by the interstellar console

1346

1349
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,780
I am in orbit around the third planet

1350
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,520
of star known as sun over

1351
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,660
may this be earth over

1352
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,100
positive it is known

1353
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,720
to have some form of intelligent species

1354
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,420
over

1355
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,680
I think we should take a look

1356
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,880

you listened to this show

1393
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,660
and we're even more glad

1394
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,520
that some listeners

1395
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,620
have donated enough

1396
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,880
to help us keep on going

1397
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,420
for another couple of months

1398
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,240
and not just this show

1399
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,880
but subgenius.com

1400
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,620
and all the other

1401

archive sites

1402
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,960
but if you truly love Bob

1403
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,160
and want some of that

1404
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:43,880
slack back

1405
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,620
to rebate

1406
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,520
down to you

1407
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,900
you should go to

1408
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,320
subgenius.com

1409
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,460
front page

1410
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,000
or especially the radio page

1411
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,960
or the catalog store pages

1412
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,240
and help out financially

1413
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,340
as best you can

1414
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,140
now we know

1415
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,840
what it's like

1416
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,780
to be on the brink

1417
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,620
of total poverty

1418
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,580
and we don't want

1419
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,720
any subgeniuses

1420
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,240
to make their own

1421
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,360
situations worse

1422
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,980
but some of you

1423
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,300
still have jobs

1424
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,300
even five bucks

1425
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,620
