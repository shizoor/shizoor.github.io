1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,540
From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,860
All right, Mac.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,700
You got it?

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,300
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,160
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,400
Handle it gentle now.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,160
All right.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,360
I've got it.

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,800
Here.

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,680
All right.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,940
One, two, four, three.

12
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,180
The subgenius power of slash.

13
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,640
I'll crawl in first.

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,280
Good, though.

15
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,560
Okay, now, let's get to work.

16
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:30,920
Here.

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,480
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.

18
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,280
Six grenades.

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,740
Yeah, that ought to do it.

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,840
Welcome, futurists, cyberphiles, and the rest of you dateless wonders.

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,140
And now, to push this convention into hyperspace,

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,240
the man who put the star in Star Wars,

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,400
a real bird on the Darth Vader's saddle,

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,340
Bob.

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,280
Bob.

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:57,780
Bob.

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,140
Yes?

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,960
You got it, Bob.

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,500
Hello and welcome.

30
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,420
Our topic today is UFOs.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,900
Of course, that's just the start.

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,500
Throughout recorded history,

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,760
human society has been haunted by reports of unidentified flying objects in our skies,

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,160
many of which have defied all attempts at scientific explanation or understanding.

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,420
What are these phenomenon, and how can they be explained?

36
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,980
With me today is Terence McKenna,

37
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,260
a philosopher and thinker of note in the area of altered space,

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,360
and the world's most famous UFO expert.

39
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,380
He's been studying the state of consciousness in alternative realities.

40
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, well, the ordinary approach to the UFOs

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,800
has been to view them as visitors or intruders from a nearby star system

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:48,860
that have come in metal ships for reasons of trade or scientific investigation or military conquest.

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,220
Or missionary activities.

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,640
Or missionary activities.

45
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,860
Let me tell you, you're not the missionary type.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,720
You never last.

47
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,640
And incidentally, you want to do mankind a real service?

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,260
Tell me.

49
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,260
Tell me some funnier joke.

50
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,020
And therefore, it is threatening.

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,140
And this is one of the reasons that I think it relates to the psychedelic experience.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,080
Because the psychedelic experience is like a UFO encounter on demand.

53
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,180
You know...

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Whoa, another acid flashback.

55
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,300
Whoa, another acid flashback.

56
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,440
Whoa, another acid flashback.

57
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,520
Whoa, another acid flashback.

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,980
Half your yellow will lift you into orbit.

59
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,620
Real rocket man.

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,640
I'll take two.

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,940
That would probably kill a horse.

62
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,720
I said I'll take two.

63
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,640
Oh, whatever.

64
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,940
They decide to have this curious, symmetry-breaking kind of experience.

65
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,880
What I have tried to say to the UFO community is...

66
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't want my mom to die!

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,260
You need some help?

68
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,120
Let him go, Ralph.

69
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
He knows what he's doing.

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,540
We will not really have a deep understanding of what the contact experience is

71
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:13,100
until we include data from the psychedelic experience as a legitimate data to be included when looking at the problem.

72
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:23,600
The UFO phenomenon is a modern manifestation of pixies, elves, fairies, sprites, demons, whatever you wish to call them.

73
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,980
Angels.

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:25,900
Angels.

75
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,420
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,640
And I'm gonna kö Alban,

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,500
friend and partner.

78
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:48,060
If you're ever surprised about explode levels on the secret brain

79
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,180
like on太?'s team's group for Hyun,

80
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,180


81
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,180


82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,440
about

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,440


84
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,800
So last thing,

85
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,880
the Portra

86
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,460
's

87
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:53,500
Just

88
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,420
July

89
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,060
June

90
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,720
I do

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,560
Angel baby

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,700
My angel baby

93
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,820
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like you

94
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I like you

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,820
No one would love you

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,960
Like I do

97
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,460
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

99
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,960
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

100
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,080
Attention please!

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,500
We have just received a new bulletin

103
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,020
that Mothra must attack Zucca City

104
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,260
Mothra!

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:45,960
Mothra!

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:46,940
Mothra!

107
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,120
Mothra!

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,320
Angels?

109
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,920
Angels?

110
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,740
In the past we had a professional class

111
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,500
for dealing with these go-betweens, shamans

112
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,940
and they mitigated these comings and goings

113
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,880
and had a lore and a mythology about them

114
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Mothra!

115
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,700
Please, we don't want to hurt you

116
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
We want to reason with you

117
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm a psychoanalyst

118
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,580
This is my pipe

119
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,560
We want to help you

120
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,380
As we have lost contact with our shamanic roots

121
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,900
the things which go on at a low frequency

122
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,640
out in the wilderness and deserts of this planet

123
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,680
have become something like that

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
either like invasions from another world

125
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,380
or virtual impossibilities

126
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
I think that the flying saucer is knocking on our door

127
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,980
to remind us of the depths and strangeness on this planet

128
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm going to visit

129
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,900
You!

130
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,340
This little6

131
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,140
Dear, I spoke

132
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,600
This little6

133
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:15,800
I talked to my readers

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,940
I have seen an almost complete 하면ography

135
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Is bringing these people here

136
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,780
kind of interplanetary discourse.

137
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah, right.

138
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,140
Take this kind of data and deal with it

139
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,960
the same way we might deal with our lunch or our toothpaste.

140
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,700
And not think of it as being some terrible possibility

141
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,100
of an invasion of the lizard people from outer space.

142
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,960
One possible view of the flying saucer

143
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,320
is that it is a kind of projection

144
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,820
from the consciousness of the planet,

145
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,320
that it is dire,

146
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,360
that it is in fact a kind of alchemical object

147
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
haunting human historical time

148
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,880
with a symbol of totality,

149
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,080
the kind of totality that our religions

150
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,840
and our mystical yearnings

151
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,260
are so at pain to concretize for us.

152
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,660
What?

153
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,680
This was Jung's view.

154
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,420
Huh?

155
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,560
The Swiss psychologist Carl Jung,

156
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,400
who in 1953 wrote a book

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,800
called

158
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,880
Flying Saucers,

159
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,820
a modern myth of things seen in the sky.

160
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
So in the fall of 53,

161
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,800
for three or four months altogether,

162
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,680
I drove all around the country

163
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,160
interviewing people who had been mentioned

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,720
in the early Flying Saucer books.

165
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,460
I'm getting this book on UFOs.

166
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,460
Did you know they're real?

167
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,580
But there's a huge comic conspiracy to cover it up.

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.

169
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,360
So naive.

170
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,280
Who's naive?

171
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,160
I didn't say anything.

172
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,480
In the fall of 1953,

173
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,640
which was the time that I got into the UFO field,

174
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,900
so he got into it a year or so before I did.

175
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,400
Huh?

176
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,200
Carl Jung saw in their circular form,

177
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,040
in their scintillating, shining, alchemical, brilliant,

178
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
a symbol of human wholeness

179
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
to interpret them psychologically,

180
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,960
to interpret them as one would interpret a dream.

181
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,320
I hope that if you all haven't seen a flying saucer,

182
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,440
that eventually,

183
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,600
you will see one.

184
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
If you haven't seen one,

185
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,500
my advice would be

186
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,760
not to look for them in outer space

187
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,920
or even in another dimension.

188
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,860
If you look deep inside yourself,

189
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,620
there you will see them.

190
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
In a way, this kind of explanation is very satisfying.

191
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,100
However, it is not satisfying to the person

192
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,260
who has immediately undergone a very strange experience.

193
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,700
Unless such a person,

194
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:48,800
unless such a person,

195
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
starts waiting,

196
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,600
how could such a personpoint to the air won't know

197
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:57,600


198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,260
was built?

199
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,420
Now, we must look at ourselves 참lex.

200
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,000
So, you may think that this was a страшing legend...

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,100
...for America.

202
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,040
But you've never seen better for ourselves.

203
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,780
All that would seem to be 분� contracted

204
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:07,780


205
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,540
Clinical quality,

206
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,700
is a leanedONT!

207
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,520
What corkes anticipating

208
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,300
in 700 hundred and five thousand of years

209
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,760
have a superstitious degree of

210
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,120
宮es dIallo di downs.

211
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,420
Take a breath.

212
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,740
to what is termed your world situation.

213
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,600
As all of you know, your planet at this time

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,080
is experiencing a period of great unrest.

215
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,400
For instance, imagine, just as a possibility,

216
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,340
that some naive, well-meaning alien should come down

217
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
and try to address a joint session of commerce.

218
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:40,900
Who's naive?

219
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,780
I didn't say anything!

220
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,100
Well, what good would it do?

221
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,140
So naive.

222
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,320
There would be a sensation on all of the tabloids

223
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,740
and newspapers for a few weeks,

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520
and hand you back the Monday Night Football.

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,280
And so what good would additional information

226
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,980
or inspiration be that came from outside?

227
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
Let's assume then for the moment

228
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
that we are being visited by these aliens,

229
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,140
as I presume you assume.

230
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,540
What's the next for them? Why are they here?

231
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,760
Why are they bothering with us?

232
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,560
Well, it's a very interesting planet,

233
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,540
this particular time in its history.

234
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,520
I mean, maybe there's only once every 500 million years

235
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,480
that a particular planet goes through this phase of civilization.

236
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,300
Last time this happened was several years ago,

237
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,100
several million years ago.

238
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,140
It's happening again.

239
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,420
They all gather around,

240
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,400
like a volcano ready to go off.

241
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,680
There's a volcano waiting to erupt into the Pacific Rim.

242
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,140
That's really hot, isn't it?

243
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,320
Yeah, it looks like we're watching fireworks, doesn't it?

244
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,700
But we're not.

245
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,300
That's what's coming out of the center of the Earth.

246
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,400
Wow.

247
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,440
Here are all the dogs.

248
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,240
There's no dogs.

249
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,460
There's nothing living on Earth.

250
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,580
Not even dinosaurs and Pia Star monsters.

251
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,220
Nothing.

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,420
There's nothing but land and volcanoes

253
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,240
and the molten lava coming out and shooting up at 2300 degrees.

254
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,780
Burn it! Send it to hell!

255
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,780
We left the Earth, and we could see...

256
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,200
I could see a hurricane down in the Gulf area from the craft.

257
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,380
I took photos, but none of that.

258
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,360
I took photos of the Earth, leaving the Earth.

259
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,560
I took photos of approaching the Moon.

260
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,380
This is in 1956.

261
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,980
Can you imagine how I felt?

262
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,480
This is before any of the astronauts went anywhere to speak of anything.

263
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,300
I think the Russians got the other side of the Moon photographed.

264
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,500
And incidentally, the slides that I have, the overlays, fit right on top of that

265
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,540
long before we ever got there, which in itself is evidence that I've been there.

266
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,900
But I'm not trying to prove that I've been to the Moon.

267
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,500
I don't care too much about that.

268
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,220
Beautiful, isn't it?

269
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,100
Where are we then?

270
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Well, this is technically what we call Deep Space.

271
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,180
Well, it's technically what I'd call Sodor.

272
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, look, come on, cheer up, everyone.

273
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,800
We are 15 million light years from the nearest space route.

274
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
There is no intelligent life around here anywhere.

275
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,560
How these aliens did this, I don't know.

276
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,700
But I was in their control, and they helped me do all this.

277
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,700
We took a picture of approaching the Moon.

278
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,700
We landed on the intersection where there was dark and light sort of area.

279
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,340
And we were there.

280
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,160
And we did see things that they claim are not there now.

281
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,680
So I can't prove anything.

282
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,180
Thirty-five years ago, we thought the whole space story was going to be imminent.

283
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,560
It was going to be really quick.

284
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,440
Everyone is going to accept the idea that there are higher civilizations,

285
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,620
that we're going to learn from them, we're going to interact with them.

286
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,260
No way.

287
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,480
Hasn't even begun.

288
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,960
How can they deal with us?

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,660
Who can they deal with on this planet?

290
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,380
The UN?

291
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,640
We're just beginning to cooperate at the UN level.

292
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,540
We haven't even begun to communicate with one another and to be civilized.

293
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,020
That's true.

294
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,000
We're very, very barbaric, and it's frightening.

295
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm conducting nuclear tests that begin in Warsaw, Poland.

296
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,320
This is Foreign Poland Overseas on the European, US-European Global PR News.

297
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,360
PR's report reports on outrage over Louisiana.

298
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,360


299
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,860
The official Twitter account of the gas chamber responded that, quote,

300
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Inside a gas chamber there should be silence.

301
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,340
It's not PR News.

302
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,380
Hundreds of dignitaries gathered in the unified death camps.

303
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,540
PR's report reports today, France, in Paris, last week, in Alaska, this morning, in Germany.

304
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,820
The fight is still raging.

305
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,300
An Iraqi commander says this is PR News.

306
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,340
Now I'm talking about the kind of stories that leap off the wall.

307
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,340


308
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,340


309
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,340


310
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,460
The

311
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,900
The

312
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,940
The

313
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,860
The

314
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:52,860


315
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:52,880
The

316
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:52,880


317
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:41,340


318
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:48,600
Yes, everyone here will die.

319
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,140
Pushed off a bridge or maybe a cliff

320
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,840
Ambed up in the morgue, totally stiff

321
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,500
Oh, as the bag went over her head

322
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,700
You woke up in the morning and she was dead

323
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,020
Everyone here's gonna die

324
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:50,600
Yes, everyone here will die

325
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,600
Trapped under ice with no way to breathe

326
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Once you are dead, you can never leave

327
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,460
Blown into bits in a fiery car crash

328
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,200
We watch as you're dying

329
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,680
What a day

330
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,000
Gas, gas, gas

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,740
Everyone here's gonna die

332
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:49,920
Yes, everyone here will die

333
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,780
Yes, everyone here will die

334
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,680
Yes, everyone here will die

335
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,480
Yes, everyone here will die

336
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,660
Yes, everyone here will die

337
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
That's right.

338
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,120
It is 100,000 Leagues Under My Nutsack.

339
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,560
We're recording.

340
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,320
So that's Mark.

341
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
Everything's going fine.

342
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,440
Yeah, everything's going fine.

343
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,460
On the middle microphone,

344
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,860
we as yet have no one sitting in to perform.

345
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,980
But we have three microphones and three chairs

346
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,000
and three gates into the three heavens of Beulah.

347
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,540
And so this argues that we will be calling fairly soon

348
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,420
for yet another person to come up

349
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,180
and bobcast.

350
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,520
Bobcast.

351
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,180
On this historic day, the cusp of world's end.

352
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah, we're rolling.

353
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:48,880
We're going.

354
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
From the land beyond, beyond.

355
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,440
From the world past hope and fear.

356
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,820
Are you gonna sit down?

357
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,040
I bid you, Negi, not appear.

358
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,140
I bid you, Negi, not appear.

359
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,680
I bid you, Negi, not appear.

360
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:07,680


361
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,800
I bid you, Negi, not appear.

362
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:09,800


363
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,300
Well, sir, it takes a long time sometimes.

364
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,300
In fact, it is an ineligible fact of existence

365
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,920
that Uncle Joe is moving rather slow at the junction.

366
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,960
These are the sports of love.

367
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,080
And these the sweet delights of amorous play.

368
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,560
Tears of the grape.

369
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,120
The death sweat of the cluster.

370
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,300
The last sigh of the amorous youth.

371
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,660
The last sigh of the amorous youth.

372
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,000
Who listens to the luring songs of Loba.

373
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:51,720
From all over the campground, an uneasy understanding begins to set in that these are the final

374
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,220
moments of experience, intellection, and cognition.

375
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,800
Staring at a blade of grass becomes an impossibly precious task.

376
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,160
Never to be repeated.

377
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,660
Never to be repeated.

378
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,800
Never to be repeated.

379
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,560
Never to be repeated.

380
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,020
но что

381
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,560
But ever more?

382
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,560


383
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,560


384
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,820
Until we truly find Master of the Dream,

385
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,860
who mostly omits to simule.

386
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,860
I know Nice, this home,

387
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,200
universe itself distorts and twists like a thousand wriggling snakes as one passes the

388
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,060
impassable barriers all systems go proceed to check out

389
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:56,200
oh what a great day that will be my friends when the heavens fall a great day in the morning

390
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:04,440
when the prophecy the ancient prophecy of chicken little will be revealed and the sky itself will be

391
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:13,080
falling in the shape of mighty ships so large that they create gravitational anomalies on the earth

392
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:21,640
the first of its groanings and heavings on a day of difficult parturition now Ivan staying himself

393
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,180
is here things are certainly looking up as soon as possible

394
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:34,960
himself is actually not my last name no well but an affectionate Cog Norman you see we're hoping to

395
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,380
be absolutely comfortable here and ready to deliver our hard-hitting below the belt message

396
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:52,800
actually we have reason to be much less confident this oh I see and that is your recent electronic

397
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,320
discovery right

398
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,660
perhaps you should mention it again since repetitio est mater studiorum

399
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:12,980
tell them yet another time and the lesson will sink in as they always do so

400
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:20,540
what is the dealio with this electronic treasure trove of newest revelation well

401
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,820
that hideous strange alien hybrid baby

402
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:34,540
robot radio thing when I when it electrocated me by accident or design or

403
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,000
whatever your own I had my own immaculation dr. how don't you remember

404
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:47,780
and it it did something to you it did something to I went into the spirit I

405
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,100
was lifted up by the stark fist of Jehovah actually it didn't feel like that

406
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,340
it was more like a jumble of sensory impressions

407
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:04,600
that indicated that the original note from Bob that said the it said quote the

408
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,120
world ends July 5th 7 a.m. July 5th 1998 there was some question about the bottom

409
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,940
number well it turns out that that was part of a phone number it may still be

410
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:25,620
valid that was my next question apparently the seven and five was were was a reverse

411
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,640
proposal of what meant to be five seven now which would indicate a date of May

412
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:39,360
7th but then damn legume thumped my chest and brought me out of it before I

413
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:48,160
could get the year so we've we've been thrust into kind of a muddle I mean I'm

414
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,820
gonna get up tomorrow at 6 and go down there and do the countdown and wait for

415
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,540
the saucers

416
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,380
I'm glad we did a

417
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:55,720
fake

418
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,220
one yesterday for the film cameras cuz they're realer than real if it's like

419
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,660
last year there's only only about seven or eight subgeniuses are still alive at

420
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,860
7 a.m. and there only one was female

421
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,380
count your blessings well it was Susie the floozy you know so that that's that

422
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,540
counts for a lot more than just one female and actually counts for more than

423
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,560
two breastages

424
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,240
but the aliens that were disappointed as you can see on YouTube actually the

425
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,660
19x day cross-section ends with some special effects not everybody's seen

426
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,240
that yet

427
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,240
actor and with subtitles alien footage is involved right there's alien footage

428
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,640
although frankly it looks kind of like that old movie laser glass but anyway

429
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,540
anyway friends we still we one thing we do know X day is a couple of days away

430
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:02,180
from coming any and it could be any second could be now but it wasn't I

431
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,620
rather that or now that could be I don't want you come up here yes you may

432
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,100
although doctor how we were gonna try to record your song or two now you're

433
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,980
giving contradictory yeah I was telling him to come up and yet we're gonna

434
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,540
record a song why don't he come up and then later on we'll record the song okay

435
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,320

00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:54,540

00:26:54,540 --> 00:27:24,540


441
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:54,540


442
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:24,540


443
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:54,540

00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:24,540


445
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:54,540

00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:54,540

Let's do it again!

505
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,240
Alright, well you can go back home to your own punches and congregations and spread the

506
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,860
word about Skipper Bob-Dot.

507
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:16,500
Dr. Onan Kanabite at X-Day Drill number 20. You know, it was the last one I was at.

508
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,520
I can see why he has so many titles. That's a lot of words to remember.

509
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,340
Yeah, Reverend Uncle Doctor. He's an uncle.

510
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:24,720
Yeah.

511
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,880
As long as...

512
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,200
And now they're starting to call him Poppy and Gramps and Uncle Bunny and all those cute

513
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,720
little names that little children make up when you don't know who they are.

514
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,460
They come, some of them have like machetes and they're wearing armbands and...

515
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,980
Now Dave, you're an uncle, aren't you?

516
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:41,780
Yes.

517
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,180
And a grandpa.

518
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,580
At least I have nieces and grandnieces.

519
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,960
Do they call you Uncle?

520
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,680
My grand...

521
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,260
Is Uncle Lonesome Cowboy Dave coming to dinner tonight?

522
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,640
And he's gonna puke right on the plate just like he always does and leave a dump his head

523
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,280
in the ashtray.

524
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,800
Uncle Lonesome Cowboy Dave is funny.

525
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,580
We love him.

526
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,200
He's a grotesque monster.

527
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,840
He's a man without vision, without plans.

528
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,640
He knows not what the...

529
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,460
Uncle Lonesome Cowboy Dave is really old, isn't he, Daddy?

530
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,600
Yes, he's pretty old.

531
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,320
What?

532
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,880
What was that?

533
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,200
I think it's...

534
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,040
What was that?

535
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,680
I think it's Dr. Sinister lurking around the studio.

536
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,340
Uh-huh.

537
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:32,940
That's him.

538
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,520
He's lurking around.

539
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:34,840
He's lurking around.

540
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:34,840


541
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:34,840


542
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:34,840


543
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:34,840


544
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:34,840


545
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,680
He's lurking.

546
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,100
Well, I thought it was some kind of trade band serial music to the...

547
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,140
Lingering like a fart in a phone booth, as they say.

548
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,260
It is.

549
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:54,220
It's actually a miracle that I got a recording of that sea chanting that Unann led.

550
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,560
I think that's on my...

551
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:03,520
It was shot on my iPhone and my digital recorder had timed out or something.

552
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,820
It had stopped.

553
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,920
Occasionally, phones actually make good recordings if you're in the right environment.

554
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:14,340
That was actually a terrible recording and you can hear the fans clearly, but I'm not

555
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,780
at my regular studio in Texas and I don't have sound soap filter.

556
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,780
You have no regular studio.

557
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,100
So I couldn't...

558
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,100
Everything you do is ad hoc, ad...

559
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:25,840
Both.

560
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,300
Both.

561
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,420
It's both.

562
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:28,720
Both, yeah.

563
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,040
Also, like in a magazine.

564
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,740
I remember when you were...

565
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,440
I think you were a...

566
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:34,800
I think you were a...

567
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:34,800


568
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,080
I think you were a...

569
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,080


570
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,080


571
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:35,080


572
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,360
It was like 25 years ago.

573
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,900
Something way, way in the distant past.

574
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,720
We get real drunk and high and then we record this stuff on little cassette recorders like

575
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,740
a Walkman or whatever, and then we spend $100,000 mixing it with an orchestra and so

576
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,340
forth and making...

577
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,980
Sweetening it up and then nobody...

578
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,320
Yeah, sweetening it...

579
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,220
And then nobody hears it.

580
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,800
Put a little oil on the junk...

581
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,580
We play it on a college radio station and that's it.

582
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,540
There you go.

583
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,320
$100,000 right down the drain.

584
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,540
Hey, we got...

585
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:06,920
But we're famous and got rich this week, Dave.

586
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:20,600
I may have told you about this in another reality, but Boing Boing website suddenly started glowingly reviewing the subgenius membership pack.

587
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,920
And this is something that you need to leverage.

588
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:24,960
All right.

589
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,640
You need to use that online momentum and ride that wave, man.

590
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,760
And the world needs the gospel of Bob Dobbs now more than ever.

591
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,900
Now more than ever.

592
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,600
Well, yeah, that's their problem, not mine.

593
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,280
All right.

594
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,520
What am I supposed to do?

595
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,160
You could, you know.

596
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,240
I'm having a hell of a time just filling those 200 orders.

597
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,060
We never got that many.

598
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,100
Well, that means you're going to have to hire help.

599
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:55,400
Well, as someone so aptly said, Reverend Stang is the only cult leader.

600
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,660
It was Palmer Vreede.

601
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,860
Palmer Vreede, he said.

602
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,620
Reverend Stang is the only cult leader.

603
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,520
He's the only cult leader who wrings his hands when too many people join.

604
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,620
Yeah, he gripes when too many people.

605
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,840
Yeah, but we were out of stock in the first half hour.

606
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,400
We're not used to that.

607
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,980
You think maybe a couple hundred people might have seen the movie?

608
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,060
I mean, is that a possibility?

609
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,000
No, no, no.

610
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:23,700
This writer, actually a really good writer named Corey, now Reverend Corey Doctorow.

611
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,180
Yes, I know.

612
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:25,820
He ordered.

613
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,280
You explained that.

614
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,740
Yeah, he ordered.

615
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,900
I'm glad to hear about it.

616
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,580
Well, it did come at an inconvenient time, but it certainly is needed and wonderful.

617
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,400
Actually, it was a perfect time.

618
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,800
We were dead broke and did deep in a hole.

619
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,480
And now we've filled the hole in a little bit.

620
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,860
I did have to spend about half as much as we made just reprinting stuff.

621
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,080
But it's great.

622
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,980
There's 200 new saved souls out there.

623
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,880
And each one of them.

624
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,660
Well.

625
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,700
Well, one tenth of each one of them is going to order a book or a pen or some other thing.

626
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,460
So I had to have those things ready for next week.

627
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:12,400
But, of course, I can't give the title of the article in Boing Boing because it gave

628
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:20,240
the price of our product, which I can't say legally on public supported airwaves.

629
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,440
But it basically said.

630
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,340
For a fistful of dollars.

631
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,200
The subgenius membership pack is the best.

632
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,440
Beep.

633
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:27,720
Beep.

634
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,260
Dollars I've ever spent.

635
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,580
And.

636
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,560
But that is just his opinion.

637
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,800
That is just his opinion.

638
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,800
He took pictures of all almost 30 pieces that go into that thing.

639
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,620
Yeah.

640
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,060
And described them all and gushed over them.

641
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:52,980
And he implied that you get a free book of the subgenius when you pay for a membership, which is not.

642
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,780
Not true.

643
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,500
No, he paid extra for that.

644
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,980
The normal.

645
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:03,140
But he did get it autographed to him because I knew who he was because I read his book.

646
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,040
Little Brother.

647
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,240
It's a really good sci-fi book.

648
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,160
It's a great sci-fi book.

649
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,420
Kind of a juvenile book.

650
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah, but it made me cry.

651
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,060
That's the best audience.

652
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,460
You know, it's a valuable audience, the juveniles.

653
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,500
But they're still impressionable.

654
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,800
You can still twist them to your way of thinking.

655
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:21,540
Maybe.

656
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:26,080
So would you twist a young adult in my book, Neighbor World?

657
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,560
No.

658
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,260
Because they have.

659
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,760
They had to make me ask questions when I started taking these competitions and stuff like that.

660
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,740
He said, what is the genre and category slash a bunch of other things like that.

661
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,040
Yeah, good luck with that one.

662
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,420
Yeah, right.

663
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:43,720
You know, Kurt Vonnegut had the same problem and so did Joseph Heller.

664
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,160
Dave, honestly, if you think about it.

665
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,260
He's a religious fanatic.

666
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,760
No, Joseph Heller who wrote Catch-22.

667
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,440
Oh, Catch-22.

668
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:55,560
Yeah, Catch-22.

669
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:55,900
Catch-22.

670
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,780
Chicken catch.

671
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,260
Thanks, my dear.

672
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,920
Then they were gone.

673
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,860
I'm sorry, Mr. Yosari, and I'm sorry.

674
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,800
How can I do that?

675
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,620
How can I do that?

676
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,120
Catch-22.

677
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:12,580
Well, if you're a true catch-it-all, then you can hunt down anything.

678
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,800
You can catch 22 all day long.

679
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,400
Man, I'm loving this music.

680
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,000
I think it was a very powerful atmosphere.

681
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,400
Bravo.

682
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:22,840
Bravo.

683
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,140
Bravo.

684
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,060
Bravo.

685
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,340
Bravo.

686
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:24,580
Bravo.

687
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,340
Bravo.

688
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:25,420


689
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:25,520
Bravo.

690
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:25,540
Bravo.

691
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


692
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


693
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


694
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


695
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


696
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


697
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


698
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


699
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


700
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


701
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


702
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


703
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:25,540


704
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:28,720
Bravo.

705
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,740
It's the Jerry Goldsmith of the lands.

706
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,220
Boom.

707
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,440
Boom.

708
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,180
Boom.

709
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:34,180


710
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,000
Oh, that, that was great.

711
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,000


712
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,880
That was really, really interesting.

713
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:35,900
So, yes.

714
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,960
Next time, we're shooting that see you through the window.

715
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,140
That's great.

716
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:39,440
We'll see you there.

717
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,220
10, 1, go!

718
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,440
10, 2, 1.

719
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:47,960
Let's do it.

720
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,520
50 feet blindly thinking.

721
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,900
Well, I know, but Gone with the Wind, famous.

722
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,480
But it was still a big deal.

723
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,140
And Rod Serling wrote that screenplay,

724
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:12,000
and I learned to type by transcribing my reel-to-reel recordings I made in the theater when I was 15.

725
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:18,620
I went to see that movie four times to get the parts where I'd had to change the little four-inch reels.

726
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,720
I need to ask you a question real quick here.

727
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,240
That's how much of a nerd I was.

728
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:22,740
Yeah, friends.

729
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,020
That's how I learned to type.

730
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,500
This is from Planet of the Apes, the original?

731
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,080
Yep.

732
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,340
Okay, what am I hearing in the background there?

733
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,700
Is that a jawbone or a vibra-slap?

734
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,620
Both.

735
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,540
It's both?

736
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,060
Yeah.

737
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,060
Okay.

738
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,580
That's all I figured.

739
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:36,980
Jawbone.

740
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,680
Sounds like a vibra-slap to me.

741
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,860
Oingo Boingo was big on using bone and jawbone sounds.

742
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,300
They used a lot of bone-sounding percussion.

743
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,520
So, Reverend Sting, I...

744
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,420
It's all from Brazil.

745
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:57,760
And you all have to mispronounce the names of the different types of mahogany they use on it.

746
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:01,640
I used to use some toilet paper or a little toilet paper tube.

747
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,820
You know, you get a nice volumetric sound out of that there.

748
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,400
I was just thinking the same thing myself, Dave.

749
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,980
Yeah, because, you know, who needs all them Brazilian woodlands instruments?

750
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,760
This is a kazuba, you know.

751
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,640
It makes all kinds of different sounds, and you can only use them for one purpose.

752
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,500
What if you do?

753
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:22,500


754
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:22,500


755
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,960
You can't do it in a polka.

756
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,120
You can't have every polka sound like that.

757
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,220
You'd get thrown out of Cleveland.

758
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,600
Mm-mm.

759
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,580
So, does some people dearly wish to be thrown out of Cleveland?

760
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,400
If only, if only they could be thrown...

761
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,120
True story.

762
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,560
I once had a dream that took place inside of a video game where you could cast a spell

763
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,120
to banish your enemies to Cleveland.

764
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,560
Yeah.

765
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,000
Like, that was an actual spell.

766
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,940
Nowadays, it would probably be Detroit, don't you think?

767
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:52,260
Well...

768
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,020
Don't tell everybody.

769
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,700
Cleveland still has the reputation of you never hear of you again, but did you guys

770
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,620
see Jim Jarmusch's new movie, speaking of which?

771
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,260
Oh, I keep...

772
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:00,640
I did.

773
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,800
Brother Love sure has.

774
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,020
Brother Love did.

775
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,020
He really liked it.

776
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,240
He loves talking about himself in the third person.

777
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:15,400
Yeah, I heard Brother Love's review of it on the radio one day, driving to whatever

778
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,160
passes for work at the post office.

779
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,160
I wanted to...

780
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,240
I actually wanted to...

781
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,440
I wanted to show you something I literally found in a dark alley recently.

782
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,820
I literally found this in a dark alley.

783
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,580
This book.

784
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,140
It's a voodoo spell book.

785
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:30,780
Wow.

786
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,540
Full of curses and haxes.

787
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,920
Dr. Snake's voodoo spell book.

788
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,180
I literally found it in a dark alley, just lying there.

789
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,040
Can you raise the elder gods over the air?

790
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,900
I don't know if it's even safe to do that.

791
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,560
We've only got two more minutes to do that.

792
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:45,600


793
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,220
Read one, click.

794
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:49,520
Two more.

795
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,480
Tan bala we do.

796
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,140
All of the names and numbers.

797
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,260
Princess, we know tons of voodoo practitioners.

798
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,380
I do.

799
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,100
From Starwood.

800
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,020
I know them personally.

801
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,080
Have you ever been in Nolens?

802
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah.

803
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,140
There's some real fun down there.

804
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,900
Oh, hell yeah.

805
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:09,220
They'll go right to those weird cemeteries that have the graves up above the ground.

806
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,440
Yes, I know.

807
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,740
I'd love that place.

808
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,280
They'll have a picnic right on top of somebody's body or something like that.

809
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,620
Oh, you can do that at Lakeview Cemetery here with the Lakeview.

810
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,240
Yeah, but every once in a while the vultures chase you.

811
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:22,540
They chase you out.

812
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:25,020
That's what they call them now, vultures anyway,

813
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:29,440
because you only pick on carrion, whoever the hell that is.

814
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,920
I don't know.

815
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:37,100
Okay, Dave, we're at the 9.58 point of the time zone.

816
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,460
Don't rush on my account.

817
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:42,060
I have to say, no, I'm not, believe me.

818
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,420
Okay.

819
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,420
We're the hour of slack.

820
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:46,920
That's it.

821
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,080
This is the hour of slack from Church of the Subgenius,

822
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,140
and if you want to know more about it,

823
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,480
any of this stuff, including this upcoming festival next week

824
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,040
that we hardly talked about,

825
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,400
even though it will either kill you or save you,

826
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,400
all of you listening,

827
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,040
that's all out there at subgenius.com.

828
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,300
I'll just leave it at that, I guess.

829
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,460
You poor, poor...

830
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,820
Yes, they can read about the fun things that are coming.

831
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,040
Oh, and Starwood.

832
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,780
X-Day and Starwood.

833
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,820
After the world ends, then Starwood,

834
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,220
that'll be on my escape saucer,

835
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,300
which will look just like Wisteria Campground

836
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,640
in Southern Ohio near Athens in Pomeroy.

837
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,640
Starwood, where President Vermin Supreme will be.

838
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:39,400
That's right.

839
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,440
Vermin Supreme.

840
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,560
President Vermin Supreme's going to be there.

841
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,160
Dr. Howell's going to be there.

842
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,740
All those bands that I don't know the names of.

843
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,000
John Shirley, the author.

844
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,240
Yeah, the weird subgenius.

845
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,540
Horror author John Shirley.

846
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,940
And, uh...

847
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,060
Is that my phone?

848
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,160
I think it's the dogs.

849
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,840
Yes, the dogs and the pill.

850
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,940
It's time for the pill.

851
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,660
Okay, friends, I've got to take my pill.

852
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:03,900
Thanks.

853
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,420
Praise Bob.

854
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,200
Now, the...

855
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,560
Praise Bob.

856
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,440
From PR News in Washington,

857
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,560
I'm creating major turkeys in neighboring states.

858
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,240
The Dow is 2-3-24.

859
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,180
Climatologists say this is PR News in Washington.

860
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,020
And this one is not likely to end.

861
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,260
Any time soon.

862
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,300
The Dow.

863
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,400
The Dow.

864
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,000
The Dow.

865
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,280
The Dow.

866
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,480
The Dow.

867
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,280
The Dow.

868
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,560
The Dow.

869
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,080
The Dow.

870
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,580
The Dow.

871
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:47,580


872
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,160
The Dow.

873
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,160


874
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:48,800
The Dow.

875
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,800
Thank you.

876
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:23,880
Thank you.

877
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,120
Thank you.

878
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,920
Thank you.

879
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,600
And that was the psychoskeletons.

880
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,940
Look them up.

881
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,420
And now,

882
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,120
special little piece

883
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,700
by Bob Walkenhorst.

884
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:52,940
One of the coolest

885
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,680
Christmas presents

886
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,460
I got this year

887
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,620
was my daughter gave me

888
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,580
Johnny Cash

889
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,800
live at San Quentin.

890
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,140
And that was cool,

891
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:01,920
but the real cool part

892
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,580
was sitting down

893
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,700
with my 12-year-old daughter

894
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,020
and listening to Johnny Cash

895
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,280
in concert all the way through.

896
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,020
The neat thing about,

897
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:08,460
one of the,

898
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:08,700
I mean,

899
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,340
there's a million

900
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:10,320
neat things about it,

901
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,700
but they were actually

902
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,580
filming the night

903
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,180
that he shot,

904
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,340
that he recorded

905
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,480
that album at San Quentin.

906
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,720
And it was a BBC concert

907
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:18,700
that,

908
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,860
that they were filming for.

909
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,780
And you listen to the,

910
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,400
the music

911
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,840
and he just has such a great

912
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,180
I don't give a shit attitude.

913
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,560
It's so admirable.

914
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:29,760
He,

915
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,440
they're,

916
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,180
so they're filming

917
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,220
a BBC special

918
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,600
and Johnny pulls out

919
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,360
two songs

920
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,540
that he'd written

921
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,700
that day.

922
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,040
Or actually the day before.

923
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,160
And the band

924
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,200
had just like heard once.

925
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,080
And Johnny's saying stuff like,

926
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:45,080
somebody give,

927
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:46,000
give me my notebook.

928
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,020
I need those lyrics.

929
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,720
And so I'm trying to picture

930
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,260
Johnny Cash,

931
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:49,460
you know,

932
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,040
sitting on stage

933
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:50,860
with a lyrics notebook.

934
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,160
Lots of great creativity happens

935
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,260
when you don't really care

936
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:55,840
that much

937
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,740
or worry that much.

938
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,060
So,

939
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,500
so in the spirit of

940
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,600
Johnny at San Quentin,

941
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,840
we're going to play a song tonight

942
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,920
that I wrote at 6.30 this morning.

943
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,260
And Norm and Jeff,

944
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,660
Norm Daylor on bass.

945
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,720
Jeff Porter on guitar and drums.

946
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,880
They've never even heard this song.

947
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,860
I think this song

948
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:27,900
was actually supposed to be

949
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:28,900
Merle Haggard's song,

950
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,700
but it got sent to

951
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,480
my cosmic mailbox by mistake.

952
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,560
Now don't go turning the lyrics around

953
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,360
because I won't miss it.

954
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,120
This song came about

955
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,520
because Jeff and I get together

956
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,580
every week and record.

957
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,000
We're working on Jeff's CD.

958
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,520
Norm's joined us several times.

959
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,080
And Jeff and I often walk in

960
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:50,780
and whine

961
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,700
about all the difficulties

962
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,640
of our lives.

963
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,260
And we often end up

964
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:56,920
looking at each other

965
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,720
and I'll say,

966
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,560
I'll come in one week

967
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:58,940
and I'll say,

968
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,380
Jeff,

969
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,600
all I want to do

970
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,220
is play guitar.

971
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,120
And then Jeff will come in.

972
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,260
He'll have had a hard week

973
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,200
and Jeff will come in

974
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:08,640
and he'll look at me

975
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:08,880
and he'll go,

976
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,320
Bob,

977
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:10,900
all I want to do

978
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,520
is play guitar.

979
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,440
So tying this all up,

980
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,020
I was reading

981
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,240
Johnny Cash's biography.

982
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,520
And in the biography,

983
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:21,740
Johnny was bitching

984
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,460
about having to go

985
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,620
to record company meetings

986
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,800
and interviews

987
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,840
and all that stuff.

988
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,280
And Johnny actually said,

989
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,820
all I want to do

990
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,660
is play guitar.

991
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,240
Johnny understands, man.

992
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:37,860
Or he did.

993
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,140
He still does.

994
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,960
This is called Broken Radio,

995
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,400
written less than 24 hours ago.

996
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,060
All the songs I sing

997
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:54,860
are sad ones.

998
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,540
Expectations of me

999
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,300
are all bad ones.

1000
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,300
I couldn't have less

1001
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,700
to live up to

1002
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,600
if I tried.

1003
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,700
I'm an accident.

1004
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,860
Go report one.

1005
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,100
My obituary

1006
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,280
will be a short one.

1007
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,020
He played guitar

1008
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:23,600
till the day he died.

1009
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:29,180
All I want to do

1010
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,380
is sing a few

1011
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,720
songs of aching love

1012
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,420
and a couple

1013
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,600
of old hymns

1014
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,480
for the folks back home.

1015
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,880
And a last chance

1016
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,260
for a slow,

1017
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,160
true dance

1018
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,600
with your one

1019
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,460
true love

1020
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,220
here on my

1021
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,220
broken radio.

1022
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,400
All my memories

1023
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,780
are in the past.

1024
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:18,780


1025
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:18,780


1026
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:18,780


1027
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:18,780


1028
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,640
They weren't good ones.

1029
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,740
Coulda, shoulda, woulda ones.

1030
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,680
But there's a couple in there

1031
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,040
I wouldn't trade.

1032
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,660
Like the night

1033
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,020
when I first met her.

1034
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:39,140
Would I forget her

1035
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,300
or regret her?

1036
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,440
Ask them ghosts

1037
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,580
dancing on my grave.

1038
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:52,960
All I want to do

1039
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,140
is sing a few songs

1040
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,340
of aching love.

1041
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,160
And a fast one

1042
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,100
for the youngsters

1043
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,800
that I know.

1044
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,280
And a last chance

1045
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,540
for a last dance

1046
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:13,820
with your one

1047
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,680
true love.

1048
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,760
Here I am

1049
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:18,760


1050
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:18,760


1051
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:18,760


1052
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:18,760


1053
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:18,760


1054
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:18,760


1055
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,660
here on my broken radio.

1056
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:30,500
Here on my broken radio.
