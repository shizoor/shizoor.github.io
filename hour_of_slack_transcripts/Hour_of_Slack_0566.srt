1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,640
Test, test, test, test.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,080
Test.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,780
I'm sick.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,100
I don't want to do a show.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,540
This recording is a collection of unintended indiscretions before microphone and camera.

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,600
Must, must, must do show.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,620
Mind going.

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,680
Body won't follow.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,380
Soul destroyed.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,980
Must do show.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:31,980
Oxygen switch.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,920
Must reach oxygen switch.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,700
Not fool with computer.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,320
Don't touch it.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,000
Show.

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,500
Must fool around.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,940
Must move the patch cords.

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,300
Important.

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,360
Touch the cords.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,420
Line out from case N-1.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:48,600


22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,920
By virtue of the cosmos, and all the powers that be.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,060
With the bow of the Satan.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Show his embrace.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,780
And make sure the fire of evil, and all else that has but hell,

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,980
is gone.

27
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:15,380
With the bow of the enemy, and the fire of evil, will be gone.

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,020
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slang.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,980
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,040
It is intended as a sympathetic tribute to the members of the radio and television industry

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,320
who have been the victims of these classic boners.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,500
Oh, I wasn't gonna go that far.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,600
Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for star time?

34
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,360
Yeah!

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,640
Are you ready for star time?

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,220
Yeah!

37
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Alright, let's bring to the stage,

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,700
without a notion,

39
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,980
the one and only,

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,420
the fast man,

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,900
without a notion,

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,980
Mr. Motion!

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Dear Reverend Ivan Stang.

44
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,700
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what this is coming down through the audience.

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,680
All those bad looking clothes on, and that oversized hat, and raggedy clothes, and all this sort of thing.

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,080
Well, it looks like it just came out of the basement.

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:22,760
Pardon me, could I?

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,820
Line out from case N-1.

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,920
In your head.

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,440
You're doing terrible.

51
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm gonna hang up.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


54
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,780
I'm gonna hang up and dial again.

55
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,580
Hang up, dial, please.

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,880
Okay, okay.

57
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,520
Okay, keep it.

58
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,300
We'll have a quick cast.

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,760
Yeah, straight.

60
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,920
Yeah, keep it.

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:39,880
Keep it.

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:39,980


63
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm sick of doing these, what?

64
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,180
Oh, I forgot, ladies and gentlemen, we have the star of the show this evening.

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,580
The one and only.

66
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,540
He's coming out, ladies and gentlemen.

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,980
The one and only, the tramp.

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,360
Welcome, Seekers.

69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,920
I'm sorry, Bob, I thought it was my cue.

70
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,300
What's that smell?

71
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,740
It's Uranus Boner.

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,420
God damn it.

73
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,360
I mean the planet, Uranus Boner.

74
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,400
Blazey, comments, Captain.

75
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,560
You mean you brought us back to that godforsaken stink hole of a planet where Seaman Bob bit the cosmic weenie?

76
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,640
If memory serves me correctly, Doctor,

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,060
you pronounced Seaman Bob dead after he fainted from the smell of this planet.

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,420
Whether he was actually dead or not is disputable.

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,140
And it was on your recommendation, Boner, that I pronounced him buried.

80
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm a doctor, Jim, not a god damn funeral director.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,840
Still, I'd feel better if I could just see that Seaman Bob's gravesite was undisturbed.

82
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,660
Isn't that it over there, Mr. Sperm?

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,980
Exactly 7.4 feet right in front of you, Captain.

84
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
That's impossible.

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,480
There's nothing there but an empty hole in the ground.

86
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,140
Maybe someone took his body.

87
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,740
Maybe someone like her.

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,820
The face is unstunned.

89
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,860
It's truly bizarre.

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,960
I'd like to call it Mondo Suzy.

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,500
Yes, friends, I'm sick and I'm gonna let Suzy do a bit of show here.

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,660
She comes in so handy.

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,940
Welcome, Seekers.

94
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,420
I'm your spiritual handy wife, that mindless fun-pump Reverend Suzy the Floozy.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,820
And this is just a polite warning to any normals who might have stumbled into my listening radius.

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,300
Just forget the show tonight, okay?

97
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,380
There's nothing for you here.

98
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,180
If you listen in, you'll only wind up even more lost and confused than you already are.

99
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,720
So just do yourself a favor.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,100
Get up, walk across the room, and turn off your radio and go to sleep.

101
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,000
Trust me, only true subgeniuses will enjoy the next hour.

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,980
Because I'm only preaching to the perverted tonight.

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:25,840
Yes, like a horrific multi-car pilot, there's usually something to appeal to everyone in my episodes of Bob's Slack Time.

104
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,520
Fun house.

105
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,860
But not tonight.

106
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:40,700
Tonight, I'm just gonna turn the reins and the whip over to the one man who deserves to wield it without mercy.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,820
Oh, no. I'm not talking about the Reverend Dr. Nolan Voight.

108
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,320
Or Reverend Ivan Stang, or even the pulsing sex god St. Jane or Hypercles.

109
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,340
Ha ha.

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,580
No. I'm talking about Bob.

111
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,140
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

112
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,880
The grinning man with a pipe clenched firmly in his alabaster teeth.

113
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,520
Alabaster.

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh, and Bob's one, too.

115
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,360
As you will soon see.

116
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,580
I've cobbled together most of the audio evidence of Bob that I could find.

117
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,320
And I want all of you true yetis out there to pray and fornish.

118
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,000
And dedicate while you absorb this vital church indoctrination.

119
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,180
Bob, you're soaking in it.

120
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,260
Oh, must you bray night and day at that infernal television.

121
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,700
Oh, look who's talking.

122
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, Bob. You used to be on this show.

123
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
Don't remind me.

124
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,200
My foolish capering destroyed more young minds than syphilis and pinball combined.

125
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,560
Well, I've had it.

126
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,040
I am going to make it my mission to see that our friend Bob is set free.

127
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:01,940
No!

128
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,760
I want to get with Bob. I want to go to the ball club. I want to go with Bob.

129
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,260
You're coming.

130
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,500
Yes, Bob. You rang.

131
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,060
You rang for me.

132
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,240
You rang for me.

133
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,000
Better be ready to face the consequences.

134
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,160
It's never too late to redeem yourself.

135
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,200
One last chance.

136
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,540
That's all you have.

137
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,620
It's up to me.

138
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
You rang for me.

139
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,780
Yes, we've summoned you, Bob, from beyond the grave.

140
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,860
Yes, Bob.

141
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,360
Yes, Bob.

142
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Yes, Bob.

143
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,540
But you've done that, Bob.

144
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


145
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


146
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


147
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


148
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


149
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


150
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


151
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,540


152
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,180
Hello, Bob.

153
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,220
Hello, Bob.

154
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,680
It's a pleasure to meet you.

155
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,440
This is Bob.

156
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:58,960
Hi, Bob.

157
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,020
Hi, Bob.

158
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,860
She's a fantastic musician.

159
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,240
She's a fantastic singer.

160
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,360
She's a fantastic singer.

161
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,720
Wow.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Yes.

163
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,560


164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,700
Look, we have some very interesting questions.

165
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,000
We've got some huge voodoo ambiently puttering away in the background.

166
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,840
I'll lower that down.

167
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,340
Actually, we'll, I think, let Susie the Flusie there, from our beloved sister, Susie the

168
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,640
station WREK in Atlanta, uh, carry a lot of the show because she sent an amazing tape

169
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,480
full of, um, well, beautiful collage work. But I'll tell you something, my friend,

170
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:43,840
Nicoderm patches have their own nasty side effects besides the murderous rages. And,

171
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,660
uh, I've been having these headaches and sleep disorders. You know, I quit smoking

172
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:57,320
about seven weeks ago, dear friends, and I haven't touched one. Um, on these, these patches,

173
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,820
but they mess up your sleep and you're smoking less and you, but you're missing your tar.

174
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,040
Um, I mean, you're, you're, you're not really smoking at all. You're getting less and less

175
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,900
nicotine, but it's coming in all the time, awake or asleep. And, uh, I had to exert almost

176
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,720
super human, uh, discipline in, uh,

177
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
life.

178
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,800
I'm learning to control the headaches and the hallucinations. Uh, I basically, I have

179
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,380
to, I have to frop constantly, my friends, as if there was no tomorrow. And there really

180
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:36,860
isn't. It's only 509 days until X day, the very end of the world. Praise Bob and praise

181
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:46,740
the frop Lords that I can frop for many cannot, but that too is a curse. I misplaced a paperback

182
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,040
book yesterday, my friends.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,940
I'm the wrong side of down.

184
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:02,740
Your friend, Reverend Stang does not do things like that. Humans do things like that. Rewardian

185
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:10,300
subgenie do things like that, but at type a emergent tile subgenius like myself does

186
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:19,360
not lose or misplace things much considering unless he or she is really messed up.

187
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,460
And I've got to admit friends, I'm, I'm really messed up. Your prayer partner and preacher,

188
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:36,900
Reverend Stang is messed up from not doing drugs and, uh, and from being sick. You'd

189
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:44,540
think that after seven weeks, the old glands would grow back and, but, but no, not yet.

190
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,560
My receptor holes are empty. Fill my receptor holes.

191
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,640


192
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,640


193
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,300
Would you please, sir?

194
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,420
I'll admit, I'll admit that I'm having to fight some little mood swings now and then

195
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:09,140
and a frequent total inability to concentrate and the occasional vision of the yodeling

196
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,340
sugarplum topless demon fairy stripping the dead monkeys from the lather blenders. But

197
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,620
I think that was to make the new line of subgenius toys or something like that. I don't know.

198
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:19,620


199
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:19,620


200
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,960
Maybe that was all part of the dream. I don't even know.

201
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,700
I went to the conspiracy doctor today to see what the deal was with the headaches and the

202
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:42,160
murderous rages and the horn like growths on the forehead and the vestigial tail formation

203
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,720
and the warts, so to speak, call it a wart.

204
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,620
Then the galloping nether lip soared.

205
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:49,620


206
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:59,500
And my missing thumb and the scaling on my dorsal fin and the voices and the dancing

207
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,840
cigarettes. Yes, I keep seeing these dancing cigarettes in front of my my eyes, except

208
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,800
my left eye is still kind of dim, doctor, except for these sudden blinding flashes and

209
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,760
these mathematical formulae that come pouring in at that moment. And the doctor said he

210
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,660
said, Stein, I'm going to have to cut it right off. And that's when Stang said, Well, doctor,

211
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,200
when you're going to have to cut it off down to the bone, because if you leave any meat,

212
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm gonna frapp right on.

213
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,820
Yes.

214
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,180
Yeah.

215
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,620
Yeah.

216
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,500
Yeah.

217
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,260
Yeah.

218
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,900
Yeah.

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,620
And oh, one last little bit of news here, I suppose.

220
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,900
Many of you subgeniuses will be interested in X day drill coming up X day drill number

221
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,940
two, July 5th, 1997.

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,620
Where we prepare for the end.

223
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,620


224
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,620


225
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:57,460
of this world July 5th 1998 this will be the last chance you or me get to to to

Festival or the the rainbow people only only it's it's for the church of the

231
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,660
subgenius but yes we're at Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman New York July

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,560
attendance now that everybody's seen the pictures on our website

234
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,780
of the nude baptism the public prairie squid raping by sister Susie the floozy

235
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,520
the scourging of Jesus at the hands of the audience and the crucifixion and

236
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,060
burning of that man J.R. Bob Dobbs and we delivered every bit of outrageous baloney

237
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,820
that we promised we actually did and this year if we will have even more

238
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:14,680
cruel and barbaric tests of faith and rewards for you faithful ah yes for one

239
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,540
thing we're going to have an event called the New Year's Eve and we're going to have a

240
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,380
party in which our guest will participate in an authentic witch hunt

241
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,480
and burning with it and this is a great place for it there's a lot of pagans and

242
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,860
witches out there there will be the battle for pastor Craig Island in which

243
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,320
is like a subgenius spit fight and no weapons will be allowed but any bodily

244
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,960
fluid can be flung out there on the little island we're gonna we will hold

245
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,540
the Last Supper with Jesus and myself and maybe Bob and you can pay to that

246
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,460
be one of the 12 seated and posed for a historic photograph that will become the cover of the

247
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:58,420
escape vessel's guidebook and map. What else do we have planned? Oh, the human pinata.

248
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:06,660
Will you be the human pinata? We'll have a nativity scene with the baby Jesus being set

249
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:14,560
on fire. And I guess we'll launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer. Although, you know

250
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:24,920
what, since the other Arnold Palmer, the one who sells Pennzoil and poses as the bodied

251
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:33,540
bleeding head of Arnold Palmer on television, since he got prostate cancer, you know, we've

252
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:42,660
had to, should we keep doing launching rituals in public? I'm just worried that it would

253
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,980
be in bad taste.

254
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:57,420
Because there was no other church like it. Nowhere else could members indulge in such

255
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:04,880
limitless sexual abandon, and no other church ministers advanced such liberal theories on

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:13,180
love as a cover-up for their members' unbridled lusts. But the church's operators were out

257
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,540
for more than nothing.

258
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:24,880
They played at being gods, testing their shocking sex theories on countless jaded couples. If

259
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,800
they were exposed, it would mean disaster for all of them. But if they succeeded, countless

260
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:39,940
marriages would be saved through programmed adultery. And yes, friends, that's what we

261
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,540
have in mind for you at the subgenius X-Day Club.

262
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:44,540


263
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,780
The

264
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:51,560
end of the world practice session. It's what Sister Susie the Floozy has in mind for you.

265
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,000
It's what Reverend Dr. Legume has in mind. What other church news have we got here? I

266
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:07,360
know that there was, but you know, if I know that I am insane, then how, how insane can

267
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,800
I be?

268
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,360
But I think the historical importance of this recording far outweighs any considerations

269
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,540
of high fidelity. So here's a little bit of a summary of what happened. I'm going to

270
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:14,540


271
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:24,240
take a moment to say good day to our first guest in the

272
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,240


273
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,580
Devin Aaron babies.

274
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,340
Devin Aaron.

275
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,840
Very clear.

276
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,260
Well, what's wrong with thoseugglies?

277
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:36,680
Oh, nothing, ну,~!

278
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:36,940
Ah!

279
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:36,940


280
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:44,180
The tub levels! Kindergarten girls. I love it. Every night. Görükłade turtle winter Klippet!

281
00:17:44,180 --> 00:18:00,500
Sweet song, hey wake up, wake up, you sleepyhead, get up, get up, get out of bed, cheer up, cheer up, cheer up, the sun is red, live, love, love, love, and be happy.

282
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:20,220
What if I've been blue and now I'm walking through the floor, rain may glisten but still I listen for hours and hours, yeah, I'm just a kid again, I'm doing what I did again, swinging a song.

283
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,460
When the red, red robin comes, the bop, bop, bop of the law.

284
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,480
When the red, red robin comes, the bop, bop of the law.

285
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,120
When the red, red robin comes, the bop, bop of the law.

286
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,620
Boy, Bob, I had no idea you sang so beautifully.

287
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,640
You're kidding, honey, I'm solid canary.

288
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,580
Yeah, right, you sure got the beat for it.

289
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,840
Dobbs is all man, the red-blooded he-man that every woman really wants.

290
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,480
I think his face says it all.

291
00:18:59,580 --> 00:18:59,920
Each.

292
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,640
Dot is a raging ideogram of lustfulness which somehow manages to convey its message.

293
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,000
Those who are sexually troubled one way or another should not stare too strongly at this drawing.

294
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,560
But, of course, the message of Dobbs is one of unbounded lust for life.

295
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,080
And that's something that can appeal to everyone.

296
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,860
It's a nice face.

297
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,400
This face is gold.

298
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,920
It's a very nice face.

299
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,240
With a place for everything.

300
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:30,720
Every feature.

301
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,340
Every feature in its place.

302
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
Not a commonplace face.

303
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,960
His eyes.

304
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,220
Blue.

305
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,560
His chins.

306
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,280
Stubborn and strong.

307
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,340
His ears.

308
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,140
Their ordinary ears.

309
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,400
His nose.

310
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,480
His nose.

311
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,940
And his lips.

312
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:00,940


313
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:00,940


314
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:00,940


315
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,240
A little love.

316
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,420
Still.

317
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,360
The shadow of your smile

318
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,880
When you

319
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,220
You are gone

320
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,260
We'll color all my dreams

321
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,860
And light the dawn

322
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,060
Look into my eyes

323
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,460
My love on the sea

324
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:50,840
All the lovely things you are to me

325
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,340
His grin is the one that looks friendly

326
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,040
But so does the grin of a sharky's boss

327
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Oh, oh, oh

328
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,080
Bob don't ever change

329
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
He's Bob

330
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,880
Always will be Bob

331
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,960
See, I saw this program that I'm talking about tonight

332
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,100
some seven years ago.

333
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,640
Seven years ago when I saw this program,

334
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,440
I folded my arms across my chest,

335
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,880
I crossed my legs,

336
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,620
and then I looked at that guy that was talking about this program

337
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,560
and I said, no way!

338
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,400
Whoever this joker is, whoever's up there, he's always grinning!

339
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,020
I thought, why was he always gridding?

340
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,480
You never done anything...

341
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,160
because he's so doggone rowdy!

342
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,660
Them there eyes, yeah, yeah

343
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,820
Them there eyes, yeah, yeah

344
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,480
Haaah

345
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,320
Them there eyes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

346
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,680
I fell in love with you the first time I look him, too

347
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,340
Ha, ha

348
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:08,380
Them there eyes, you've got a certain little cute way of flirting with them.

349
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,220
Them there eyes, they make me feel happy, they make me blue.

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,520
No story, I'm falling, falling in a great big way for you.

351
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,200
My heart is jumping, you sure started something with them there eyes.

352
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,060
You'd better watch them if you're wise.

353
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,740
Them there eyes, they spark, they bubble, they're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble.

354
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,200
You're overworking them, there's danger lurking in them there eyes.

355
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,980
Bob loves you.

356
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,620
Bob loves you.

357
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,320
Bob loves you.

358
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,320


359
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,320


360
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:11,680
The shadow of your sun can hear you tomorrow.

361
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:22,500
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn.

362
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,060
Don't make this a federal case.

363
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,180
Don't make this a federal case.

364
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,180


365
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,180


366
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,420
It's just another pretty face.

367
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,540
But you know.

368
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:47,700
It's a very, very, very nice face.

369
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:57,340
Now when I remember spring, and all the joy that love can bring, I will be remembering.

370
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,400
The shadow of your sun.

371
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,180
It's a joke, Dobbsy.

372
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,380
Aren't you gonna let me in on it?

373
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,800
In on it?

374
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,460
Sure I will.

375
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,380
Sure.

376
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,060
Invited to attend Secret Rites in their secluded temple of love.

377
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:27,320
Don't be afraid, Bob.

378
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,320


379
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,320


380
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,320


381
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,840
invited to peep behind the curtain

382
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,360
as the Love Cult's leader procures new disciples, new suckers.

383
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
What are your kicks, Mrs. Blakeslee?

384
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,920
Whips?

385
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,960
Restrained buns?

386
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,700
Love in many forms.

387
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,000
And with people who are in as deep as I.

388
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,960
You are invited to join the Love Cult.

389
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,380
Other cult leaders are small potatoes

390
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,100
compared to this charismatic pipe smoker with the benign stupid smile.

391
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,900
He's J.R. Bob Dobbs, an aluminum siding salesman

392
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,760
known to his believer as heaven's one true policeman

393
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,080
and the saint of sales.

394
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,440
He's leader of the Church of the Subgenius in Dallas, Texas,

395
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,460
the only church we know that offers eternal salvation

396
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,540
or triple your money back.

397
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,060
Any religion, any cult basically operates on the principle of us versus them.

398
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,080
It offers the person.

399
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,040
A peer group that they can feel is the correct one.

400
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,420
Alarm Santa Fe parents met again with elementary school officials

401
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,160
last night to discuss the growing presence of Bob in the schools.

402
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,600
Bob, the deity of the Dallas-based Church of the Subgenius,

403
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,160
is a comic book character who communicates with aliens and worships money.

404
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,060
Parents and teachers complain that the Bob stickers and pamphlets,

405
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,060
which have turned up in school lavatories with increasing frequency,

406
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,500
encourage troublemakers and weird behavior.

407
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,260
It's not healthy for the children.

408
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,540
I'm convinced of this.

409
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,600
There has been a pamphlet going around, a Bob pamphlet that I have looked at,

410
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,180
and it's the least well-adjusted child.

411
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,580
It tells them that if they are uncomfortable with their classmates,

412
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,580
it is because they are better than their classmates.

413
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,160
Can you imagine this? Better.

414
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,260
Not smarter, mind you, but better.

415
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,220
Finally tonight, have you ever wondered about your neighbors?

416
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,900
Maybe wondered about the weird thumps and bumps or chants

417
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,320
emanating from your neighbors?

418
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,060
Or the weird things emanating from their apartment?

419
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,400
Well, they may be followers of Bob.

420
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,900
That's the fastest-growing cult here in the Southwest.

421
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,940
You were talking about Jim Jones and David Koresh?

422
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,180
Yes.

423
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,580
Those guys were pipers.

424
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,140
Amateurs.

425
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:39,480
Nothing.

426
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,000
I hope you guys know what you're doing.

427
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,500
Because it took a tragedy like Jonestown to finally get this thing moving.

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,640
And if we lose our momentum and we have another Jonestown,

429
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,600
well, that's your responsibility, isn't it?

430
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,960
Well, I feel bad. I know. I feel bad about the way things happen.

431
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,140
But I don't regret it because I love Bob and I'm happy.

432
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,000
I love you.

433
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,060
I love you.

434
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,680
I love you.

435
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,820
Bob loves you.

436
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:02,820


437
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,460
Bob loves you.

438
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,620
Wow.

439
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,100
Susie loves you, dear friends.

440
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,520
I'm hearing...

441
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,700
Very frequently this happens.

442
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,860
I'm hearing these tapes for the first time when you're hearing them for the first time.

443
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,480
And that collage of lines,

444
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,540
worshipful lines,

445
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,300
dedicated to the one and only Bob.

446
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,260
One true Bob.

447
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,720
I must say, that was an amazing collage of material.

448
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,340
I'm stunned and staggering.

449
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,920
Staggering.

450
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,640
Actually, I am staggering feverishly around.

451
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,100
I'm losing it fast.

452
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,800
It's a real good thing that we have a useful tape.

453
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,500
I actually have a hell of a lot of wonderful stuff to play.

454
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,320
There's the Moore-Reagans polyp.

455
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,020
We got a CD from this...

456
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,880
crazy girl named Jessica Kane,

457
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,840
which I would love to get to.

458
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,860
Um...

459
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,980
The Pink Lincolns.

460
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,400
Susie's brother's punk band.

461
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,900
And, uh...

462
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,120
And I have a CD here from a band called Sublime.

463
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:21,180
I haven't even listened to the CD hardly, but I like this CD because it's manufactured

464
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,160
by a gigantic record company and it has the trademark face of Bob.

465
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,300
Bob.

466
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,940
Printed on the CD itself.

467
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,580
They didn't ask us about that or ask permission or pay us or anything.

468
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,200
And you know what?

469
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,120
They end up paying you ten times more than they would have if they had even asked.

470
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,300
Uh...

471
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,980
I'm rambling, friends.

472
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm sorry.

473
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,580
We're going to get back to the tape.

474
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,280
I want to talk about sound quality, though.

475
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,100
Do you hear how crappy my voice sounds?

476
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,120
Compared to, uh...

477
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,480
Just the crappy old tapes.

478
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,300
Four generations down the line that Susie's playing.

479
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,460
Well, it's because this microphone is so bad.

480
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,600
And we're so broke we can't buy a new microphone.

481
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,060
Nuff said.

482
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,840
Do I need to spell it out?

483
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,360
Um...

484
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,260
Ugh.

485
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,360
But...

486
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,040
You know, I come in here...

487
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Griping about...

488
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,440
Every show starts off with me going,

489
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,020
Oh, I don't want to do this show.

490
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,940
I'm tired of it.

491
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,360
Actually, I've been...

492
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,580
One reason I'm sick is I've been working so hard to make sure that this and potentially

493
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:42,260
all the other subgenius shows are hearable all over the planet.

494
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,000
And as of about yesterday, they are.

495
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,900
And I'll describe that later.

496
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,740
It has to do with the internet again.

497
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,720
But we had yet another giant breakthrough.

498
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,820
Praise Wanderer!

499
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,880
Uh...

500
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,180
But let us...

501
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,260
Let us, uh...

502
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:08,360
Go on and dribble into the squid dreams of the delights of over there where the oxide

503
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,720
cosmic triad achieves one-world bobsomeness.

504
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,040
Gutter Girls.

505
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,020
Who are the Gutter Girls?

506
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,700
By day, innocent women.

507
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,660
By night, innocent schoolgirls and secretaries.

508
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:34,060
By night, the far-from-innocence swingers of a wild and way-out sex cult.

509
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Uh...

510
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:35,940
Uh...

511
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,780
No, but seriously.

512
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,580
Seriously.

513
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,400
I can't go back to the tapes.

514
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm real excited about this.

515
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,100
I have to tell you about it.

516
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,440
And, uh...

517
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,400
People may get tired of it.

518
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,280
But...

519
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,280
I'm convinced that I will...

520
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,000
My...

521
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,140
My work shall be proven...

522
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,600
Uh...

523
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,340
Uh...

524
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:55,680
Uh...

525
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:55,680


526
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:55,680


527
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:55,680


528
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:55,680


529
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
I don't know.

530
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,540
Maybe I'm nuts.

531
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,040
Any...

532
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,620
But...

533
00:30:59,680 --> 00:30:59,840
Uh...

534
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:00,980
Okay.

535
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:08,940
It's tricky enough to do a bizarre, freakish show like this and expect anybody to hear

536
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,020
it, any stations to play it, blah blah woof woof.

537
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,420
We send cassettes out to college stations who are wise enough to present this material.

538
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,760
And that's probably where you're listening to it now.

539
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,480
But you may be listening on the internet from our website.

540
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:25,660
And that's probably where you're listening to it now.

541
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:25,660


542
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,200
And, uh...

543
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:38,420
Those of you who aren't, it is astounding that for no extra cost we can now put this

544
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,120
dang thing on the net.

545
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,220
Sounding pretty good.

546
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:49,180
Now, last week I was real excited and hopped up, or the week before I guess, about WCSB

547
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:55,640
in Cleveland was streaming their radio onto the internet with a process called...

548
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,740
Audioactive that worked great.

549
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,900
And, uh, I was real excited.

550
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,640
You could hear our shows on 9 o'clock Sunday night on the blah blah blah.

551
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,780
We have always presented the shows also on the internet through a process called True

552
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,220
Speech.

553
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,100
But...

554
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,220
It's...

555
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,960
True Speech didn't really sound all that good.

556
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,380
It was more like we could...

557
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,080
And we had it sounding as good as it can.

558
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:19,720
The...

559
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,220
The...

560
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,400
The world's expert on sound digitizing does this stuff for free.

561
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:33,060
Guy in New Jersey, the Reverend Saint Dr. Wanderer, we call him, Reverend I.R.N.

562
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,160
I've mentioned him before.

563
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,040
He just started fooling around with it lately and tried a new process called Real Audio

564
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
3.0.

565
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,740
And it's supposed to cost a whole lot of money to be able to present decent sound over the

566
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,380
internet for free to anybody in the entire planet who happens to own a free audio system.

567
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,860
And it's supposed to be a $500 computer, which is a lot of people, potentially.

568
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,200
Now, it's fine if only five of them choose to listen to this particular show, but the

569
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:12,880
point is, for just about no money, any crazy militia nut, seditious cultist, sex pervert,

570
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:23,700
or nice little old lady who likes to tell stories, or a band that has been shunned by

571
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,320
the giant record companies...

572
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:32,420
Or anybody, anybody, literally, can make their stuff mass media, if they can get the

573
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,720
attention.

574
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:41,280
The point is, you can quit complaining that there's nothing good on TV or on the radio,

575
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,840
because for practically nothing, you can do it yourself.

576
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,000
And, uh...

577
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And, uh...

578
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,940
Granted, we're doing it ourselves on...

579
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,180
Well, that's part of the point.

580
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,480
We're doing this on...

581
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,320
Used, beat-up, crappy equipment.

582
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,220
Okay?

583
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,460
Now, a lot of the tapes that we may run, or CDs, of course, there's been a lot of money

584
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,720
and work put into those, but...

585
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,540
Um...

586
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,120
The...

587
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,860
I don't...

588
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm sorry, the delirium is catching up to me, and it...

589
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:23,460
I want you to know, it's not that I'm excited, necessarily, just that my show, okay, is going

590
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:23,460


591
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,360
to be...

592
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,180
Okay.

593
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,360
You don't even know.

594
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,500
I don't think...

595
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,300
Maybe, if I do...

596
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,300


597
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,300


598
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,360
Maybe, hopefully, I'll be...

599
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,180
Maybe I'll be less excited, and then get off the train because, uh...

600
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,660
Guess what, nobody's scarred.

601
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:41,660


602
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,640
But nobody's not going to die enough, because...

603
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,460
But nobody's going to die too.

604
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,380
You're glad.

605
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,380


606
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:45,380


607
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,480
So, without further ado, I'm meant to be the host of the WCSB Playbook competition.

608
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,340
And today, we're going to test out another project that, as I said earlier, can beat

609
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,420
the feed value of...

610
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,420
Pros per screen over and over again at the cybernet...

611
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,420


612
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,420


613
00:34:53,420 --> 00:35:01,400
you actually can hear radio pretty decently over the Internet if it's the right format.

614
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,360
WCSB.

615
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,820
Now, Tom was talking about their format, but that was in our new format.

616
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,560
Bob.

617
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,220
This is our old format.

618
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,880
This is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

619
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,700
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

620
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,560
Bob.

621
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,220
That's your key phrase.

622
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,520
Interesting, huh?

623
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,300
That's the way the hour of slack sounds on Internet radio.

624
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,980
The nice thing about it is you can hear it any time of day.

625
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,420
Now, I was talking on that one about the true speech version of Internet radio.

626
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,160
The tape you're hearing is from the real audio version of Internet radio,

627
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,100
and somehow the tape of the tape of the tape sounds the best of all.

628
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,800
So, mayhaps, friends, we can take these clips of portentous,

629
00:35:52,140 --> 00:36:00,220
numinous, seemingly meaningful, by coincidence, audio bites, sound bites,

630
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,100
bites that inadvertently worship Bob,

631
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:15,940
somehow mathematically and digitally compress them down to their key elements

632
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:21,500
so that they go straight to the brain pan without any, any transience,

633
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,180
no translation whatsoever.

634
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:30,860
No, no rational thought is even allowed to interpret the signal, you see.

635
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,960
The most important thing about this is that the real signal,

636
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,860
the signal that triggers the scrodes, is embedded in the hiss.

637
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:49,080
All you have to do is keep them listening to the old cranky yo-yo yakking on the radio long enough

638
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,500
that the hiss is going to be heard.

639
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:59,160
And the background gets the triggering device implanted so that later on, say,

640
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:08,040
oh, just for example, in 1998, say, July 5th, maybe 7 in the morning or so,

641
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:17,980
when you actually activate the final triggering using the device, then, well...

642
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,040
Ahem.

643
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,860
Where was I? I can't even remember.

644
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,260
I can't even remember what I was saying.

645
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,600
Fence, ugh, this is, I know this is an unusual show.

646
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,600
I should get back to the tapes. I'm sorry.

647
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,280
...from anywhere in the planet.

648
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,160
Yeah, right. God.

649
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,940
...far from innocent swingers of a wild and way-out sex cult.

650
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,620
Gutter Girls.

651
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,480
The lusty and revealing story of girls with a new slant,

652
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,340
on sin.

653
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,760
Everybody kind of wants to be in a cult in their own way.

654
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,200
And Bob starts out as a joke, and then you realize Bob's for real.

655
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,560
If there's anything that, uh, that we can possibly do to save your soul,

656
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,980
we'll do it for the money.

657
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,480
I'm gonna cut in there, friends, and mention that I said that line because a paid,

658
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,240
paid agent of the conspiracy with a movie camera told me to.

659
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,800
He said, he said, hey, uh, say, say, we'll, we'll do it for the money.

660
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,520
Keep harping on the money part because that's what makes it nor, funny.

661
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,560
Actually, it was a subgenius, uh, was telling me this.

662
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,420
Uh, but he, he was saying, you know, the, the pinks aren't gonna be able to follow.

663
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,560
That's, I mean, that's what's funny to him, is that you've got this funny fake religion

664
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,800
and, and you're making lots of money at it.

665
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,460
He had to tell me that in those days, friends.

666
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,680
I, I've caught on later that he's right.

667
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,740
That is the way that you have to present it to, to the pinks in mass media to get your foot through the door,

668
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,060
you know, to get the, the, the door open just a crack.

669
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,660
And slack is what Bob is trying to bring to people.

670
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,980
All right, all right, now, all right, let's get to this slack.

671
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,280
You say, in this little pamphlet you've go, you've given me, it says, repent.

672
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,800
Quit your job and slack off.

673
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,560
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

674
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,620
Uh, is this your message to the world?

675
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,000
What is this?

676
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,300
Those, those are sort of mind-catching slogans.

677
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,220
Uh, we do, this is a church that does.

678
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,520
We do, this particular sick mind-control cult does give you back your mind after we're through with it.

679
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:38,920
Yes.

680
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,340
Uh, so, y'all are a Dallas-based group of humorists, is this right?

681
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,000
No, no, no, we're, we're high priests of the unpredictable.

682
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,180
Um, and now, again, some people would say it's a put-on.

683
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,800
Yes.

684
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,380
And we leave, we believe that all decisions should be made by the individual.

685
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:59,720
So, uh, in, in a way, the book of the subgenius can be the ultimate test.

686
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,960
You can pick that thing up and, uh, if it confuses you, then you're normal.

687
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,680
Oh, and it, it.

688
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,360
You may never get slack.

689
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,120
It's satirical.

690
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,880
Bob, um, says that if they, they'll pay to know what they really think.

691
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,660
Okay, well.

692
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,180
It works for a lot of, it works for a lot of other religions.

693
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,580
I'm sure.

694
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,120
I'm sure.

695
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,420
If they buy the book, they have really paid to know what Bob thinks of.

696
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,380
You can take the boy out of the pink, but you can't take the pink out of the boy.

697
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,400
Cut me some slack.

698
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:25,960
All right.

699
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,040
I've been thinking, Bob, maybe if I went out there and talked to those people, I, I could

700
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,260
make them understand, Bob.

701
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,460
Oh, you'd just be wasting your breath, Ben.

702
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
Only thing that mob will understand is a bullet.

703
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,200
Yeah, and maybe they'll get one.

704
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
That's another bad move out of you, and I'll blow you the kingdom cup.

705
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,520
I don't want to rip out of you now.

706
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,380
Well, I can let you have it.

707
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,280
What's good for you, you won't monkey around with jobs.

708
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,260
Bob, no!

709
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,820
You come in or take our jobs!

710
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,600
You're dead!

711
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,360
You hear me?

712
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,800
All right, Bob.

713
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,720
Now it's personal.

714
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,520
Hey, um, he did try to kill me.

715
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,580
Because there are a lot of people who are book smart, but it takes a very special type of

716
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,120
genius to...

717
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,000
All right, Bob, it's over.

718
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,660
Come out with your hands up.

719
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,360
No!

720
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,800
Don't worry, Bob, I made a great deal with it.

721
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,360
You awful man, stay away from my son!

722
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,020
You still got it, Bob.

723
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,800
You can't escape, Bob.

724
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,100
If the tennis rackets don't get you, the pool skimmers will.

725
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,700
Oh, I, I never planned to escape.

726
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,000
You see, this is a kamikaze mission.

727
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,620
Yeah, you got a point there, Dobbs.

728
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,320
You know a question about that.

729
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,320
But, uh...

730
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,200
I'm not going to answer that.

731
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,200


732
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,540
What's the matter?

733
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,180
Are you up to it?

734
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,880
I will go with you to Washington tomorrow, if you like, and I will show you documented

735
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,740
proof that this man stands for evil, that he is evil.

736
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,740
Take him quietly and we'll ship him off to London in my trunk.

737
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,760
Kill him.

738
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,280
I want him dead.

739
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,560
We cannot risk some foreign power grabbing him.

740
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,480
You men are the inner defense of our nation.

741
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,300
It is upon your shoulders that there's a great responsibility for you.

742
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,920
We do not bear our burden lightly.

743
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,640
With the full knowledge of our responsibility, we must find him.

744
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,540
In the interest of national security, kill him.

745
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,020
No chances, shoot him on sight.

746
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,340
We shall.

747
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,740
We must.

748
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,420
Does it worry you, Bob?

749
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,360
No, sirree, Bob.

750
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,280
Ha, ha, ha.

751
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,920
Ha, ha, ha.

752
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,000
Ha, ha, ha.

753
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,300
Oh, Brad, Bob generally knows what he's doing.

754
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,220
He does everything for the ba...

755
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,300
Well, Bob, what are we gonna do?

756
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:54,960
I don't know.

757
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,220
That's great.

758
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,040
We go home, they hang us.

759
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,900
We stay here, we starve to death.

760
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,860
Bob, couldn't we take our fight to another county where we could get a fair trial?

761
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,760
You can't do this, Bob.

762
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,140
Shoot him for rest of your life.

763
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,260
Or else, you'll be in deep, deep, deep trouble.

764
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


765
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


766
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


767
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


768
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


769
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


770
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


771
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:13,260


772
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,320
This community is going to learn to obey the law.

773
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,480
Why should we obey laws that are twisted to fit the needs of thieves and liars?

774
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,400
Take it easy, Bob.

775
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,780
Arrest him!

776
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,080
He's a deputy marshal.

777
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,560
Don't let that stop you, Sheriff.

778
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,300
I'm fed up with the law around here.

779
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,300
This court can accept my resignation right now.

780
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,540
Wait a minute, Bob.

781
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,300
Come on, get going, boys.

782
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,760
Grab.

783
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,320
Step out.

784
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:38,640
Grab.

785
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Drop that gun.

786
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,240
I said step out, Brat.

787
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,420
Bob!

788
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,100
Brat, get that out of here.

789
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:52,380
Come on.

790
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:52,820
Come on.

791
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,780
Come on.

792
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,880
Sorry about this, Julie.

793
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:57,920
I'll get in touch with you.

794
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,700
Thanks for trying, Todd.

795
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,540
This ain't right, Bob.

796
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,480
Nothing's right anymore.

797
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,120
Go on.

798
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,940
Go on, get going.

799
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:09,300
Stop!

800
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:10,700
Stop!

801
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,120
Stop!

802
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:11,780
Stop!

803
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,180


804
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,340


805
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,720
Stop!

806
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,220
Stop!

807
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


808
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


809
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


810
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


811
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


812
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


813
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


814
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


815
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


816
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


817
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,220


818
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:13,380
Stop!

819
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,020
Stop!

820
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


821
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,020


822
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,600
Call an ambulance!

823
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,140
Stop!

824
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:15,440
Drop the gun!

825
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,860
Get the gun!

826
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:15,920
Get the gun!

827
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,680
Put it in there!

828
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:17,520
Drop the gun!

829
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,160
Drop the gun!

830
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,380
Drop the gun!

831
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,760


832
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:19,800
Drop the gun!

833
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:19,900
Drop the gun!

834
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,900
Their appears as though something has happened in the motorcade group.

835
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,940
There has been a shooting.

836
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,720
I repeat, a shooting in the motorcade in the downtown area.

837
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,120
This is how it happened.

838
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,220
I was waiting for Bob, and all of a sudden, gunshots.

839
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,000
Seven or eight of them.

840
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,240
What?

841
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,840
I quickly jumped on top of him to protect him.

842
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,780
That's when I saw the Arabs, seven or eight of them.

843
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,300
I found the main guy, disarmed him,

844
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,320
knocked him in contact with one of them.

845
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,900
I killed him. It was my fault.

846
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,620
I'm bad luck.

847
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:55,840
He said I could.

848
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,880
He said I could kiss him.

849
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,660
Who said? Who said you could who?

850
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,760
One of the Bob men.

851
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,060
The men with the black strings in their ears.

852
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,400
He said you can kiss Bob.

853
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,220
He said Bob wants you to give him a kiss.

854
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,440
And I kissed him and he was shot.

855
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,020
I was standing right behind him.

856
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,720
I saw him shoot Bob.

857
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,420
It shows what you get with a liberal agenda.

858
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,180
You pump people full of drugs and pipe dreams of what happens.

859
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,720
They come gunning for people like Bob.

860
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,500
But those folks don't realize something.

861
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,040
You can't kill the truth.

862
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,720
He'll be back and, man, you better watch out

863
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,080
because he's headed straight for Washington.

864
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,460
And that's all I've got to say.

865
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,440
Excuse me. I have to go pray.

866
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,800
When did you hear that?

867
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,180
Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus, please, Jesus.

868
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,560
Save Bob, save Bob.

869
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,460
He was shot twice at close range with a .22 caliber pistol.

870
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,800
His condition has been listed as critical.

871
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,280
There's a suspect in the shooting.

872
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,960
Yes, we have a suspect in custody.

873
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,060
He's under interrogation.

874
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,780
Ruined by Texas fire.

875
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,940
I cannot reveal that information at this time.

876
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,720
Well, Mr. Stang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

877
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:02,020
The puzzling evidence that remains is the, um, the number of wounds on Bob's body.

878
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,980
The exit wounds, the wounds that apparently came through the floor,

879
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,040
the ones that came Janeward and, and all of them.

880
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,160
Yes, the multiple bullet theory, the multiple Bob theory.

881
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,900
What are we to believe, Doctor?

882
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,040
Well, recently, I was reading an article in the subjournal,

883
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:22,000
and they say that Bob might have had a closet full of very carefully constructed, lifelike Bob robots

884
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,920
that, uh, resemble him absolutely down to the slightest cuticle.

885
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,420
But, uh, I consider this, of course, another tissue of lies and absolute errant nonsense.

886
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,040
Yet, but given the flawed, incomplete nature of the entire autopsy,

887
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,200
what can we know of the nature of Bob's wounds?

888
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,500
We can know that the entire thing, and I think Senator Ed Hinckley knows this very well,

889
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,140
and I hope he's watching.

890
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,460
The body is a tissue of incompetent lies.

891
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
And a broken pipe.

892
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,320
Yes, I held the pipe up over Bob's bleeding body.

893
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,000
Now it's up to the nation, to America, to do the same.

894
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,280
Why did the crowd burn Bob's body outside of the theater?

895
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,080
I think we'll never know the answer to that.

896
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,740
At least, I, I never will!

897
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:12,040
Reverend, Reverend, Reverend Howell, uh, uh, thank you very much for joining us here on Puzzling Evidence, and, uh,

898
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,680
uh, I hope you'll join us again next week, when our guest will be alive.

899
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,680
Thank you.

900
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,280
Did he smoke a pipe, perhaps?

901
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,980
Some people prefer that their loved ones have a pipe in their mouth.

902
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,380
I mean, of course, if they smoked one during life.

903
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:33,920
So I'll face my life before my heart hears those fellows sing.

904
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:42,020
Now, somebody in your circle, take a pipe, from a piece of pipe, and pass it to a friend.

905
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,040
Pass it all around.

906
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,220
Hold hands and sway from side to side.

907
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,300
If you feel it, act and let the scene embody sign language.

908
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,640
Why would you and Larry do a crazy thing like smoking that pipe?

909
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,340
I don't know.

910
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,740
Well, it was there, so we smoked it.

911
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,880
In our society, I just ain't the type.

912
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,220
Folks all look so surprised when I lighten my pipe.

913
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:10,440
No!

914
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:11,680
What?

915
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,240
You smoked?

916
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,560
Yes, sir.

917
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,220
Well, I smoked the pipe.

918
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,040
You, Beaver?

919
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,820
Smokin' at Drinking Bob.

920
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,200
Never wanted burning bugs.

921
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,220
Smokin' at Drinking Bob.

922
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,540
Now he's gotta get a job.

923
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,760
Now he's got a wife.

924
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,040
She says she don't like to play.

925
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,960
Smokin' at Drinking Bob.

926
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,120
Plays guitar.

927
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,160
She said, Bob, you gotta grow up.

928
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,640
Start stayin' out all night.

929
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,660
Till you grow up, time to get out of the door.

930
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,700
Tracks and scores.

931
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,980
Find a good fella, goddamn guitar.

932
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,600
Bob, when he was in the mood, he could play guitar in the new Bobbitt band.

933
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,240
Break up the noise.

934
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,960
Bobbitt is a group of bitches, one of the boys.

935
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,020
I'm a cop, this is them.

936
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,640
I'm Bob the Bastard, playin' from 10.

937
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,140
And you'll be replaced with Bob.

938
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,100
Smokin' at Drinking Bob.

939
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,900
See the tortured concentration of addicts.

940
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,800
Drug-rotted with trembling hands readying one more smoke of evil.

941
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,100
The smoke drifting up from where the fire of life burns out.

942
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:39,200
At last, through the haze of horror to the nightmare of awakening and escape from smoke of evil.

943
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,480
Don't miss this provocative movie, coming to this theater soon.

944
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,820
Smoke of Evil.

945
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,420
I just can't imagine a beaver smoking that pipe.

946
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,920
Or Larry either, for that matter.

947
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,700
I don't think either one of them would have done it if they'd been by themselves.

948
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,620
Well then why would they do it together?

949
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,440
Well, I guess that's just one of the unwritten rules of childhood.

950
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,000
No use doing anything bad unless there's someone there to admire you for it.

951
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,820
Pass the peace pipe to a friend.

952
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,980
Pass it all around.

953
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,840
Never put it down, my friend.

954
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,500
Never let it down.

955
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,400
It's amazing. We've gotten older each year and he seems to stay exactly the same.

956
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,360
Sharing a tear, lending a shoulder.

957
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,380
You know what comes to my mind every time I see him?

958
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:51,620
What?

959
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,600
The Seagram's building. Isn't that funny?

960
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,760
If we got fun, no strain.

961
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,880
You know, sometimes I catch him looking and looking. I just look right back.

962
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,800
Permanent sun, no rain.

963
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,780
We're so crazy, he's so sane.

964
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,800
Friendship forbids anything bitter.

965
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,600
A person like Bob doesn't have the good things and he doesn't have the bad things.

966
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,900
But he doesn't have the good things.

967
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,440
Being the kid's as well as the sitter.

968
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,180
Let me make him a drink.

969
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,280
He's the one guy I know I feel should drink more.

970
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:37,780
One's impossible to his dreary mind.

971
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,500
Free his company, safe and cheery.

972
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,380
He always looks like he's keeping score.

973
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,260
Who's winning, Robert?

974
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,460
Here is the church.

975
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,400
Here is the steeple.

976
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:59,640
Open the door and see all the crazy married people.

977
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,840
What could we do without you?

978
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,800
How would they ever get through?

979
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,520
So would I complain for hours?

980
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,120
Who'd bring me the flowers when I had the flu?

981
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,520
Who'd finish yesterday's stew?

982
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,480
Who'd take the kids to the zoo?

983
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,920
Who is so dear and who is so deep?

984
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,760
And who would keep her occupied when I want to sleep?

985
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,040
How would we ever get through?

986
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,980
What would we do without you?

987
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,940
Where are we?

988
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,540
We're going to the bar.

989
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,880
We're going to the bar.

990
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,300
We're going to the bar.

991
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:33,860
We're going to the bar.

992
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:33,920


993
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,600
We're going to the bar.

994
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,780
Bob loves you.

995
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,900
Bob loves you.

996
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,440
Bob loves you.

997
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,200
Bob loves you.

998
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,600
While we were on the trip,

999
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,280
we found out that Bela Lugosi had died.

1000
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,580
So then Bob was used as a substitute

1001
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:58,800
for Bela Lugosi in making of this Planet of the Ghouls

1002
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,720
or whatever it was.

1003
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,500
I told a couple of girls and a few of the fellas

1004
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,860
and some of the fellas were glad.

1005
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,300
as I was walking up the street.

1006
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,560
As I came up the street,

1007
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,700
one of the old lawyers raised his window

1008
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,460
and he stuck his head out and said,

1009
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,140
Bob, I understand you got to religion last night.

1010
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,840
I said, yeah, you want me to come tell you about it?

1011
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,680
He said, no, not now.

1012
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,500
Pulled the window down.

1013
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,960
Well, did you watch any of the scenes

1014
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,760
with Bob in them being filmed?

1015
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,740
Well, I just remember those where he was,

1016
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,020
and, you know, with the cape and all.

1017
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,000
And I've seen that many times on TV since his death.

1018
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,820
And I'd call up people and say,

1019
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,060
I saw Bob on TV,

1020
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,300
and they thought I was nuts.

1021
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,000
What did you tell me Edward would win?

1022
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,800
More smoke, more smoke.

1023
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,600
He was always hollering for more smoke.

1024
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,240
Now, Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one, all right?

1025
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,860
I'll tell you, fellas, the shock value...

1026
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,160
It's worth their price.

1027
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,260
You see what you're doing here?

1028
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,020
You know, the average person starts every day

1029
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,120
either in neutral or in reverse.

1030
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,420
What do we mean by this?

1031
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:55,880
Well, let's suppose.

1032
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,760
Suppose a customer calls you early in the morning

1033
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,220
and says, Bob, by gollies,

1034
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,120
I just wanted to call you and tell you

1035
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,860
what a nice guy you are.

1036
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,920
I want you to know

1037
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,420
we appreciate your looking after our interests

1038
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,180
and we want some more business done with you.

1039
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,160
Could you come over at 10 o'clock?

1040
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,260
Well, boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1041
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,000
How is he going to start his day?

1042
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,160
His wife's going to have to pull him down

1043
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,580
so she can shove him out the door, isn't she?

1044
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,360
Please, help!

1045
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,140
Help!

1046
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,080
Help!

1047
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:25,580
Help!

1048
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:26,780
Help!

1049
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:28,500
Help!

1050
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:31,180
Help!

1051
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:31,320


1052
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:31,680


1053
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:31,800


1054
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:31,900


1055
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:31,900


1056
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:31,900


1057
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:31,900


1058
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:31,900


1059
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,060
Help!

1060
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,380
Help!

1061
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:32,620
Help!

1062
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,220
Help!

1063
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,100
Dude, you know Bob?

1064
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:37,980
Oh, yeah.

1065
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,080
I'm the one that had to get him down off the clock.

1066
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,380
Stay out of my way, Bob.

1067
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,440
And no drinking out of my bucket.

1068
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,700
Oh, come on.

1069
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,000
You're not going to end up like Bob.

1070
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,080
Leafin' lizards and golly wow!

1071
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,340
It's Blue-Eyed Bob,

1072
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,460
the TD Bopper's daddy-o of the radio.

1073
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,120
Still fans,

1074
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:57,980
start to act

1075
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,220
at thy greatest little station

1076
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,460
today,

1077
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,220
Chironic TV.

1078
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,080
Non-stop,

1079
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:01,660
back-to-back,

1080
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:05,760
Blackstone smashes the all-time heavyweight hits from yesterday, today, and tomorrow, my man.

1081
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:11,060
But sometimes, besides the burned elbows, Casey is also approached by rock luminaries for advice.

1082
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,220
One man in particular, to whom we shall refer as Bob,

1083
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:19,220
came to Casey to find out how he could broaden his appeal from being just a protest singer

1084
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,460
to one with a more broad base of appeal.

1085
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,800
Casey suggested that Bob try singing a classic love ballad instead of folk rock.

1086
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,700
And here are the finished results.

1087
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,580
Listen now as Bob rocks while the audience gets folk.

1088
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,260
You know what I mean. Love you. Look at America. Here comes Bobby.

1089
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,580
Okay, come on, Bob. I don't want to go alone.

1090
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:53,920
All right. Boy, this is ghastly, isn't it?

1091
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,280
It's very eerie here, Akbar. I don't know how you can dance.

1092
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:56,900
Watch your step.

1093
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,320
Oh, look out!

1094
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,160
Oh, that's too bad.

1095
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,240
Bobby likes to fall in pools, fall in pools, fall in pools.

1096
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,560
Bobby likes to fall in pools.

1097
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,960
And show off at parties.

1098
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,960
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, fellas.

1099
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,620
Pretty funny verse there.

1100
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,500
Bobby's the Attorney General of the United States, and even though he is a kid, we can't say that about him.

1101
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,880
He's the Attorney General of the United States.

1102
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,400
How are you going to end the song?

1103
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,580
Let's reject that last verse there.

1104
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:30,940
All right.

1105
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,880
No, I'll tell you what. Let's reject the whole song.

1106
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,380
Could I do it?

1107
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,400
Let's not even do it, all right?

1108
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:34,480
That's it.

1109
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:40,480
Thank you very much, Bob and friend Lee, who I think has been a real magician in putting this show on the road.

1110
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,460
I mean this very honestly.

1111
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:46,000
They always say a committee is where you've got the unwilling to appoint the unfit to do the unnecessary.

1112
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,420
Tell me about it.

1113
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,920
Here is a guy who really makes things happen.

1114
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,220
She'd like a lot of bad to shine on.

1115
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,540
Hey, boy, if you don't lick her candy.

1116
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,040
Ha ha.

1117
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:56,860
They'll take her.

1118
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:57,800
Little wagon go home.

1119
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,180
Now, amen?

1120
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:58,740
Amen.

1121
00:56:59,260 --> 00:56:59,660
Amen.

1122
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,060
Bless God, you get them up a tree.

1123
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,340
Bless God, they won't come back anymore.

1124
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,060
They'll say, I'll go get me a little preacher.

1125
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,320
They will preach what I want.

1126
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,760
And will tell me it's all right to do as I please.

1127
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,680
Carney, don't your horses, darling, when you come.

1128
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,080
Uh-huh.

1129
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,520
I've traveled far and I've traveled wide.

1130
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,440
I've been up a creek and I've been down

1131
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,260
a slide.

1132
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:36,100
Of the many, many ports of call, the most romantic one of all

1133
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:42,440
is my Salveau from Bellevue.

1134
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:52,240
Because I love that man, that man, I love that man.

1135
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,400
I give him every moment.

1136
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:56,420
I love him.

1137
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,600
He's the only woman that I can.

1138
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:04,660
He says he wants to execute some things he feels are proper.

1139
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:10,460
He understands just why I put my husband to the chopper.

1140
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,140
Love that man, that man, I just adore.

1141
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,500
He's my knight, my king, my counselor.

1142
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,680
It isn't what I did that's wrong.

1143
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,420
He says it's just my mind.

1144
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:26,420


1145
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,460
It's my id that's wrong.

1146
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,900
I love that man, that man, I love that man.

1147
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,180
And I circled the house.

1148
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,640
And I remember I still had a key to it.

1149
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,620
She let me have the key.

1150
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,300
I was sweet of her.

1151
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,260
And I never will forget this cheery greeting

1152
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,200
when I opened the door.

1153
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,620
Is that you, Bob?

1154
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,180
That'll do something to you, you know that?

1155
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,820
Makes you kind of wonder, doesn't it?

1156
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,280
I think I'll call her when I get home tonight.

1157
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,140
I wonder who it was supposed to be.

1158
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:03,560
Somebody kissed my baby last night.

1159
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,360
I want to know is that all right.

1160
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,340
Bob diddly, Bob diddly, hear my plea.

1161
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,440
You know pretty baby that he would love me.

1162
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,680
Bob, Bob loves you.

1163
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,320
Bob loves you.

1164
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:29,160
Bob loves you.

1165
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,940
Bob loves you.

1166
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,100


1167
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,500
Bob loves you.

1168
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,680
Bob loves you.

1169
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,300
Bob loves you.

1170
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,540
Well, yes, women have offered me sex for any tidbit of knowledge about Bob.

1171
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,220
Just any little Bob story I might tell them,

1172
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,180
they would offer me sex for.

1173
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,620
So I just, I generally avoid that subject.

1174
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,800
Uh, yes, dear friends, editing by Sister Susie,
