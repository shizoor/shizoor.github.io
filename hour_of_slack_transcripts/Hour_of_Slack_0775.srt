1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland, high above the Arctic Circle,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,640
a group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,020
But what they unearthed was a story.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,280
A story that was to terrorize the whole world.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,120
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean father Slack.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,240
The Soft Kingdom of Power.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:38,380
The Soft Kingdom of Power.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,860
I am your beauty.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,660
Lame-o, both of you are lame-o.

10
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,640
I know, I think you got it for the world.

11
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,100
The first group, I know they're behind Reverend Patterson or Robertson.

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,340
How do you know there's both of us?

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,120
How do you know there's not three of us being lame-o?

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,580
Each time he says it, he has to pay that.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,700
Obviously, there's four of us being lame here, not two.

16
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,020
Both would imply a couplet.

17
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,560
Yeah, it's easy to say lame.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,860
It's easy to say lame.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,200
I can say lame.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,980
Lame, lame, lame.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,660
Lame, lame, lame.

22
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,940
The lamest show with the lamest callers.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,060
So if you get really close to the mouthpiece, does that mean you can talk a lot more loudly?

24
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,460
I don't know.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,760
But you can say lame.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,040
Come on, say lame.

27
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,620
One more time.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,740
Lame, lame, lame.

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,100
You're an adolescent and you overcompensate.

30
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,500
Oh, no.

31
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,320
How many cans of Red Bull have you had?

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,100
Adolescent.

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:55,980
Adolescent?

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,620
I'll have you know, I just reached puberty.

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,260
Hey.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,320
I got four hairs on my nuts.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:01,740
That's that.

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,460
Are you sure?

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,720
And just stop the show.

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,820
Hey, we're cruising now.

41
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,180
That's not what your mom said.

42
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,700
I should make jokes about flame over there.

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,660
Because we are cruising now.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,780
Now we're cruising.

45
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,620
Thanks to that caller, we're kicked off.

46
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,300
We are cruising down the road.

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,100
I feel the wheels turning.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,380
I feel the gears meshing.

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,180
I feel the phone machine.

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,340
I feel the machine.

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,120
Michael Poopy.

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,040
Because this is the last show of the millennium, folks.

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,780
Michael Poopy on the last show of the millennium.

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,200
Yep.

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,200
It is the last show.

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,700
The show is cooking now.

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,480
Have you noticed that?

58
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,820
There's a little smoke coming out of that box over there.

59
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,300
Nice.

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
Eggs Benedict.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,220
Smells kind of like Eggs Benedict.

63
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,780
Or you could think, some could say it smells like burning rubber.

64
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,700
Or electrical conduit.

65
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,180
In a state of hyperthermal activity.

66
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,780
But you know, friends, the real subgeniuses are the ones who literally, totally gave their brains over to Bob.

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,940
Now, that turns some people off.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,160
That's why we're not maybe not...

69
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,200
We're a little faster growing than, say, the Scientologists or the Mormons.

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,880
But we're not there yet.

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,260
And I think it's a lot of times because people, they see these subgeniuses who are really into it.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,180
And they're acting just wrong.

73
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,440
You know, there's just something.

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,800
But friends, you can't imagine how much those are the ones who truly, truly believe in Bob.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,420
They have given their brains to Bob for good.

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,080
Forever.

77
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,420
They're never going to get those brain cells back.

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,060
And they don't.

79
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,500
They don't want them.

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,880
Those weren't the brain cells they needed in the first place.

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,760
But friends, you too can give your brain to Bob just temporarily.

82
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,020
You don't have to do it for all time.

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,900
Just say for tonight, you know.

84
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,820
Once you've been slack, you'll never go back, my friends.

85
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,100
If you could be slack for one Saturday night, you'd never want to be pink again.

86
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,620
And, you know, as...

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,160
Now, some people also question the church because of our track record regarding ends of the...

88
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,520
world happening every July 5th or not.

89
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,800
And as I've said before, are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses out-cook us?

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,560
Hell no.

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,520
But, you know, Bob has held these...

92
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,400
They're cull...

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,960
They're drills.

94
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,500
They're sort of culling drills that we hold every year to weed out the faithless from those who have faith.

95
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,640
And friends, here in the Church of the Subgenius, we have no faith.

96
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,860
We don't use faith instead.

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,680
We use...

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,660
magic.

99
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,300
But it's a special kind of magic.

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,540
The Bob's keys to magic begin...

101
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,180
His first key to magic is...

102
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,780
Get off your ass.

103
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,880
And his final key of magic is wash your ass.

104
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,360
And I think I'll let you worry about the in-between stuff.

105
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,960
We can't, you know, give away all our secrets for free.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,680
But, you know, depending on magic...

107
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,660
is kind of tricky.

108
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,900
Because, you know, in a way, what you're saying is you're feeling lucky.

109
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,860
You know?

110
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,900
So I'm gonna go ahead and invest that money that I borrowed from my friend.

111
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,280
Because I'm feeling lucky.

112
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,840
Friends, when you feel lucky, you taunt the subgenius demon.

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,940
Which is called Nihigi.

114
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,460
You taunt him.

115
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,900
It's as if you're saying, oh, Nihigi, you are ineffective.

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,320
You can't hurt me. I feel lucky.

117
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,020
No, no, no. You have to get off your ass every now and then, friends.

118
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,740
I've been constantly...

119
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,460
and I hope dispassionately considering this very problem.

120
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,100
I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit as yet...

121
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,500
to receive such knowledge, such almost limitless power.

122
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,500
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

123
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,140
That is our god.

124
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,440
That is a scientific impossibility.

125
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,820
There's your answer.

126
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,820
It must have been renewing its molecular structure from one microsecond to the next.

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
Trapped in your cage alone...

128
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,560
and three dimensions.

129
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
Take it down now.

130
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,320
Maybe if we reasoned with them...

131
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,020
Maybe if we reasoned with them...

132
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,540
A meddling idiot.

133
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,580
As always, Abe's brain could contain the secrets of the Krell.

134
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,900
As if reason would be the key...

135
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,780
They could hardly have understood what power would destroy them.

136
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,660
...the attack of the abyss...

137
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,520
Years ago, your comrades voted for...

138
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,160
They could hardly have understood what power destroyed them.

139
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,940
You know, I just don't think I've ever given me...

140
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,060
...a chance to be me.

141
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,700
...nothing but smoke and ashes, man.

142
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,280
For miles and miles, we found a stream and...

143
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
...well, I give this all pink.

144
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,940
Yeah, and it was slimy, but we drank and...

145
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,360
...where it moved, we cupped our hands and we took as much water as we could in...

146
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,360
...because our gills were already expanding and the mutations were starting to happen.

147
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,500
We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we tried...

148
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,540
...all to have fun along the way.

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,560
Any way we could, our...

150
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,520
...our sensations were expanding.

151
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,880
Not much more. The pain was more...

152
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,180
...and so was the joy and the pleasure, so we...

153
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,680
...we advanced ourself along those lines.

154
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,740
He who thought unpleasurable thought was unfit.

155
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,940
He who thought painful thought was unfit.

156
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,160
He who was painful was unfit and was excluded from us...

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,940
...or else we would perish from our own suffering.

158
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,800
Gemma.

159
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,420
Gemma.

160
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,580
So, man, what are you people talking about?

161
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,800
What are you?

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,120
Somebody restrain on you.

163
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,420
What are you?

164
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,480
Eat one quart of milk in a heavy utensil.

165
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,020
What are you, dude?

166
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,660
Now we're on the show, we're milk for fewer calories.

167
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,040
Yeah, man.

168
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,680
Is this beat doing something for you?

169
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,740
Yeah, man, I'm swinging.

170
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,980
I'm starting to move, baby.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,700
Hanging mighty low. Hanging low.

172
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,620
Did you never think...

173
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,680
...you'd get out of the devil on seat?

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,660
There are...

175
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,760
It's a killing...

176
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,560
How you doing there, boy?

177
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,420
...you?

178
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,900
...like a possible...

179
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,980
Sure, yeah, yeah. Okay.

180
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,600
Well, things have taken a much worse turn.

181
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,340
Look at them all.

182
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,780
Look at them all.

183
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,080
They didn't get paid.

184
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,500
They couldn't spin their heads around like that little papa.

185
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,080
We need to take a little...

186
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,360
...big ol' wad right on top there.

187
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,560
More recently, what if you had a shot at killing Hitler?

188
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,100
See, it's kind of a slippery slope.

189
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,900
Justifying premeditated murder.

190
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,140
Oh, yeah, sure. That's easy for you to say.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,520
You keep saying that.

192
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,520
Saying premeditated murder. I don't believe so.

193
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,100
I don't believe you can...

194
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,920
Well, okay, I take it back. I do believe you can justify murder.

195
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,640
So now you have to kill me.

196
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,100
Under certain conditions, yes.

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,340
You're proud to kill me.

198
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,900
It's part of Cultstock, 2001.

199
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,160
Eli. No! You dropped your weapon!

200
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,300
Eli. Eli.

201
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,180
I have to say, Eli, like a dog. Like the scurvy dog you are.

202
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,780
I want you to let me kill someone that's...

203
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,900
Kill her!

204
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,160
Sure, yeah.

205
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,880
Kill them. Kill them all. That's what they say.

206
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,260
Kill them all.

207
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,920
Kill them all.

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
You got my baby!

209
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,940
There's Firebron.

210
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:42,400
It's a hard, hard work to blend so many different spices in your head, y'all.

211
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,240
Come back down on the flip side.

212
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,460
Because it's gonna be a groovy time here.

213
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,900
And smooow, smooow, smooow.

214
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,940
You know I can't refuse.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,740
Build it.

216
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,420
And you?

217
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
I believe as I did before.

218
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,880
In theory, it should work.

219
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,980
Always theories. Jigsaw puzzles on paper. Aren't you fellows ever positive?

220
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,280
I am golden sliver. Look at my feet.

221
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,120
Only about doomsday.

222
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,220
Touch me, levitate now.

223
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
Only about doomsday.

224
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,440
Yes. I have the power in my feet.

225
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,380
Look at my carbogel toenails. Look at the fungus, it shines.

226
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,880
I... I...

227
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,880
Now I look down at you, see? And I can move around the room with a...

228
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,180
I think me an insect is not as...

229
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,880
Of doomsday, we are all too sure. Damn that man far.

230
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,000
Spend too much time with the stars.

231
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,860
You don't know anything about living.

232
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,280
The law of the jungle, the human jungle.

233
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,460
I do, I've spent my life at it.

234
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,320
It's coming.

235
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,860
You don't know what your civilized people will do to come here.

236
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:54,860


237
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,500
I don't know how to cling to life.

238
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,780
I do because I know I'd cling if I had to kill to do it.

239
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,780
And so will you.

240
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,580
We're the lucky ones.

241
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,180
The handful with the chance to reach another world.

242
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,600
And we'll use those guns. You'll use them, Doctor.

243
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,120
Yes.

244
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,280
To keep your only chance to stay alive.

245
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,360
Yes, I'll use them.

246
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,700
There it is.

247
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,540
I can see it.

248
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:13,940
There it is.

249
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,840
That's the glass.

250
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,060
My friends.

251
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,040
It's backwards, sir.

252
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,340
It is imperative that you listen closely.

253
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,420
I was in the cave painting these pictures the way we saw them on the viewer screen.

254
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,780
Why were you doing that, Johnny?

255
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,960
So in case you did wipe out the human race, there'd be some record of how it happened.

256
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,880
Go on, go on.

257
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,780
I need guidance, great one.

258
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,940
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

259
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,900
You sound like a human, not a Roman.

260
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,260
Can you not verify a fact?

261
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm bossy.

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,040
You're so bossy, you ought to be milked before you come home at night.

263
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,040
Calculate your chances.

264
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,540
Negative.

265
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,080
Negative.

266
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,620
Negative.

267
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,680
Is there a choice between a painless surrender death and the horror of resistance death?

268
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,340
Show yourselves.

269
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,320
I think you're just a big bully, picking on people smaller than you are.

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,780
Now I will kill you.

271
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,160
Raise, raise, raise.

272
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,300
Because I love you.

273
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,840
You've got to let me eat your brain.

274
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Frankie, have you ever seen a human?

275
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


276
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


277
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


278
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


279
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


280
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


281
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


282
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


283
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


284
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:21,600


285
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,800
You were a-had unnatural urges?

286
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you know the way to the Hershey Highway?

287
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,720
Do you know the way?

288
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,240
Oh, you make me sick.

289
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,860
So how'd it feel, girl?

290
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,660
Felt good.

291
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Felt real good.

292
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,320
You want me to kill you?

293
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,320
Yeah, I would have.

294
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,080
Absolutely.

295
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:46,760
I had this big particle on my toe and I couldn't get off so I had to take a pair of pliers and I grabbed that sucker and I mentioned it all over.

296
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,440
What?

297
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,580
What?

298
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,580
Yeah, I had to grab them pliers and took them pliers and I-

299
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,560
Oh, Ivan, how you doing?

300
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,080
Oh, it's you guys.

301
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,580
Yeah, it's the show, man.

302
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,780
Do you have any pliers?

303
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah, I got some pliers for you, son.

304
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,540
Right here.

305
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,720
I got your pliers swinging.

306
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Must be 5 a.m. there or something.

307
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,200


308
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,700
And we're on the last show.

309
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,480
This is the last, last show.

310
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,080
What'd you do?

311
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,080
Did you get up early or?

312
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,340
Oh, you wish it was the last show.

313
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,540
It's the last show.

314
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:14,940
What?

315
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,820
We don't have any more to do.

316
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,780
It's the last show.

317
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,240
It's the last show of the millennia.

318
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,680
This is the last show.

319
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,560
It's the last show of the old age.

320
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,560


321
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,180
But now the new old age begins.

322
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,280
The newage.

323
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,780
It's the new age.

324
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,300
Ever more infirm.

325
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,880
And Alzheimer's ridden.

326
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,440
We hobble on into the future.

327
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,700
That we do.

328
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, you hob.

329
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,060
Hobnob.

330
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,460
Hobnob.

331
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:45,540
For this time, young baby 2001 is actually still just old man 2000.

332
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,440
What's that dripping sound I hear?

333
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,380
Is that you dripping?

334
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,260
The morphine drip.

335
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:52,760
Are you dripping wet?

336
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,580
No, I think that's just.

337
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,380
It's the morphine drip.

338
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,260
What time is it there in the middle, mid America?

339
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:09,580
Oh, here in the great salt mines underneath Lake Erie, 657 AM.

340
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,380
Wow.

341
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,560
So you don't actually feel the cold and horrible temperatures that other people are stuck with

342
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:15,840
there?

343
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,900
No, no, not, not.

344
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,560
Well, I would if I let down my condoms.

345
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


346
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


347
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


348
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


349
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


350
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


351
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


352
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


353
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


354
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


355
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


356
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


357
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


358
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


359
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


360
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


361
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


362
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:21,560


363
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,020
I'd be in a concentration for a little while.

364
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,960
Yeah.

365
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,400
I know.

366
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,200
Like the Yeti.

367
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,540
I may wander naked through the snow.

368
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,280
Yeah.

369
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,660
I saw those pictures on the website.

370
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,640
Melting the snow before it hits you because of the radiant heat you generate with your

371
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,480
mighty brain.

372
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,380
Well, it's not my brain.

373
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,320
Actually, it's the mighty bowl of chili that I eat every hour.

374
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,240
Ah, yes.

375
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,960
To fuel them.

376
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,500
To fuel.

377
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,260
The huge cans.

378
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,060
The one ton cans being emptied at one end and the thoughts coming out the other.

379
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,760
I, I, I was one of the benefactors of the leftover chili.

380
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:04,360
I, I actually, well, Dr. Drummond, please, uh, uh, you are my mentor in this arena of

381
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,560
pyroflatulation.

382
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,300
Yes, it's an art form that some of us claim mastery of.

383
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,280
Some of us are still learning to be ascended masters and some are just...

384
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,340
I have often been burnt by the heat of your passing.

385
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,040
You quit your job.

386
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,940
You're an assassin, boy.

387
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,280
I've pulled you out of your mother and I'll shove you right back in.

388
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Now, you get in that truck or you skedaddle.

389
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,600
Ha, ha, lackmachers.

390
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,380
Do you ever fantasize about being killed?

391
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,300
One question, Frank.

392
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,520
This guy's screaming in here.

393
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,840
You sure he's a dead cadaver?

394
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,540
Why don't you open the door and find out?

395
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,980
No, it's all right, Frank.

396
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,840
I'll take your word for this.

397
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,380
They report they can't use the flame throwers.

398
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,320
Can't get close because of the acid slime.

399
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:49,760
All right.

400
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
We'll take other measures.

401
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,880
Anyway, you're going to love this place.

402
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,460
It's a dynamite camping spot and it's got a pond to piss in.

403
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,960
Sniffing butts is probably more the articular science you would prefer.

404
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,580
Brushwood, not just X-Day, but the combination of X-Day, all M subgeniuses, and Brushwood itself,

405
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,300
the weird energies of that strange campground in Sherman, New York.

406
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,720
That sounds like an immune system deficiency.

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,320
It changes people.

408
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,320
Yeah.

409
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,640
It does change people.

410
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,940
It's an immune system thing.

411
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,480
I've witnessed that firsthand.

412
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,860
Well, there's also transitional...

413
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,140
People do things out there that they can't do.

414
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,760
Transdimensional drifting.

415
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,840
That they would never imagine doing in the world.

416
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,280
Have you noticed trans-dimensional drift?

417
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,020
Back in the world.

418
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,220
Have you noticed a trans-dimensional drift in some of the subjects or unsubjected ones

419
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,180
who are out there?

420
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,100
Perhaps floundering in the field, kissing a rocket butt or something.

421
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,520
The next thing you know, they've disappeared off the face of the groin.

422
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,300
I believe that there is a reason for that.

423
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,460
An explainable reason for that transference.

424
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,440
Explain it if you can, but I dare you not.

425
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,320
I believe that you will not.

426
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,340
Well, what I have to say would sound so ridiculous and so ludicrous to your ears.

427
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,120
Well, as if what we've been saying is true.

428
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,120


429
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,120


430
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,120


431
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,120


432
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,780
I think so far we're so erudite and clear.

433
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,760
It would almost guarantee disbelief, so I might as well go ahead and say...

434
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,480
Oh, so I believe everything you guys have been saying about Mojo's huge testicles and

435
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,100
the rockets coming out of his head and everything so far like that.

436
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,560
Well, many of us feel like we're on the wrong planet, sort of.

437
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,060
Ha ha ha.

438
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,680
You know, right?

439
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,640
Susie said right hemisphere, wrong planet.

440
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,320
Ha ha ha.

441
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:10,900
I see.

442
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,460
It's like a trans-dimensional gate or like a Zardo's plane.

443
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,800
Maybe.

444
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,980
Maybe we really are our system.

445
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,520
One second.

446
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,500
And we now live on what was Mars, only it is now called Earth by the conspiracy.

447
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,400
And in fact, to make it, they are trying to make it more like Mars, covered with concrete

448
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,840
or rock, whatever, concrete for now.

449
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,960
Painting the buildings red.

450
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,420
Poisoning the atmosphere.

451
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,820
Painting people's eyelids red as if they hadn't slept for days.

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,160
Exposing them to radiation and by taking...

453
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,560
Making them nitrogen and subcutaneously anally.

454
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,920
Recreating Mars here on Earth.

455
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,460
And yet Mars, they're secret.

456
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,500


457
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
Secretly planning to turn it back into the...

458
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,420
Into their special conspiracy hideout.

459
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,680
But it was our planet.

460
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,460
Earth, back to Mars.

461
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,740
Earth, the danglings of food and...

462
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:03,940
Back to Mars.

463
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,860
So few astronaut Americans have been willing to come out and admit that yes, happy, joyfully...

464
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,780
Fred, sure, many of you at this point are going, yeah, maybe Sang's right.

465
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,700
This all makes sense.

466
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,980
No wonder I felt so weird in high school.

467
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,500
In fact, I was so scared.

468
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


469
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


470
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


471
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


472
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


473
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


474
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


475
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


476
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


477
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


478
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


479
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


480
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,500


481
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,760
No matter I'm such a muter.

482
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,980
But what if, friends, of course you're thinking, but I'm sure they did this switch thousands

483
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
of years ago.

484
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,380
Take out the green scale of nature and...

485
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,460
No!

486
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,800
It happened in 1953!

487
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
And be safe now.

488
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:38,680
In 1953, Earth and Mars changed places by the strange forces wielded by the conspiracy

489
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,020
and their alien allies.

490
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,900
And to this day, the mystery of it is, how did they do it without anyone noticing?

491
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,920
It is very hard...

492
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,360
But if you look at the Hollywood movies...

493
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:48,400
In full stream.

494
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,320
If you look at the comic books, if you look in the bottom of the wine bottle after it's

495
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,900
been finished off, you will see that what I say is true!

496
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,940
It did happen in 1953.

497
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,700
Earth was switched with Mars.

498
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,900
Okay, now let's elaborate.

499
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,120
On the substance of it, you MSNBC-ish guy, you made the point that Clinton was a dirty

500
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,040
liar or something, whatever point you wanted to make.

501
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,420
I'm gonna miss Bill.

502
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,300
Let's have the proof...

503
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,260
I don't care what you guys say.

504
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,000
It's hard to change planets midstream.

505
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,920
Imagine Chaz over there trying to catch an RTA...

506
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,260
Exactly.

507
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,920
...and then he's gonna be on the ship.

508
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,640
I don't expect you to believe me.

509
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,820
And yet what I said was the one serious thing I've ever said on this show.

510
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,620
It doesn't matter.

511
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,440
You can burn it all down.

512
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,080
Burn the whole planet down because we're gonna get off soon.

513
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,000
Let them burn it down.

514
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,860
See, Chaz, that's where we differ.

515
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
But see, they don't want to let us off.

516
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,000
They're trying to keep us here.

517
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,260
They're gonna get off soon.

518
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,060
Chaz is like the Earth-let's-get-off guy.

519
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,800
And I'm like one of those Earth-first guys.

520
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,460
I think we should turn this into a terrestrial paradise.

521
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,260
Yeah, I believe in that.

522
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,380
Earth first, then we can, you know, towards the moon.

523
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:48,380


524
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
And then we can go to the other planets later.

525
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,600
But see, they've already done that.

526
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,960
Until look at Chaz.

527
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,540
We're just now getting the idea.

528
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,660
The conspiracy's been doing this for billions of years.

529
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,800
This is the last planet of the solar system.

530
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,520
They've already done it to all of the other planets.

531
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,660
Well, I can't wait to turn it to cinders either then.

532
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,480
Man, Neptune was great before the conspiracy started building walls on it.

533
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,300
We swam on Neptune.

534
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,380
We swam on Neptune.

535
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,820
We were like, it was the air and it was the water.

536
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,580
It was like this nitrogenous stuff.

537
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,120
And it was like a jelly when we...

538
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,600
And Saturn didn't used to have any atmosphere at all hardly.

539
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,180
Until we...

540
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,240
Until we...

541
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,240


542
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,240


543
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,240


544
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,240


545
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,240


546
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,880
Until we blew that up too.

547
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
Yeah, it's really a small planet actually.

548
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah.

549
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,160
Those rings were originally a beautiful moon sculpted in the shape of Bob's head.

550
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,080
It was our home.

551
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,280
It was the conspiracy destroyer.

552
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,460
We lived in that pipe and we blew it up.

553
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,920
We're killing everyone.

554
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,200
We lived in the pipe.

555
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,040
We are the children of the pipe, of the ring, of the pipe, of the ring of Saturn.

556
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,180
No, we're not.

557
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,840
That was pretty good.

558
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,840
We are the children of the pipe...

559
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,080
Of the ring.

560
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,660
Of the ring.

561
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,560
Of the pipe.

562
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,620
Of the ring.

563
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,100
Of the ring.

564
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,220
Of the ring.

565
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,280
We are the children of Saturn.

566
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,840
Of the ring.

567
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,840
Of the ring.

568
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,260
Whatever you guys are on, I don't want any of it.

569
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,600
Oh man, talk about B-Wolf and all them guys and...

570
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,960
Jeez, man.

571
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,360
Yes, this is the last show, folks.

572
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
The last show.

573
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,220
The last show.

574
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,020
Oh, thank God.

575
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,840
The very last show.

576
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,400
It's about damn time.

577
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,860
Can you believe it's lasted this long and they hadn't killed us yet?

578
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,400
Really?

579
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,920
That's the thing that amazes me.

580
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,740
I can't believe it.

581
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,220
So now that Stang and Firewire have gone, we're going to go to the moon.

582
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,220


583
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,380
The moon's just gone.

584
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,120
And then we travel on to Burning Man, is going to go to...

585
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,680
Well, I'm going to go to...

586
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,120
Yeah, to Jane & Stock in New York.

587
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,220
Hey, get out of the way, man.

588
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,800
Hey, shut the door.

589
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,640
There was a terrible controversy over whether the giant, subgenius party of 4X-Day should

590
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,080
be held after the world ends or before.

591
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,380
Yeah, I like those questions.

592
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,100
Well what do you think?

593
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,360
What's the vote count?

594
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
I vote yes.

595
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,960
I vote yes.

596
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,160
And the principle chose to party aboard the escape vessels after 4X-Day.

597
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,180
Yes.

598
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:58,020
In other words, the celebration of X Day will begin at 7 a.m. July 5th, which is Thursday this year.

599
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,000
And it will never end.

600
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,940
This will be the X Day that never ends.

601
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,360
Bring your moon pants.

602
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,520
Breach them not.

603
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,340
And you enter the vacuum.

604
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,560
Ah, yes.

605
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,900
Wow, free watermelon.

606
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:21,240
Bring your moon pants and your moon rocks.

607
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,520
Bring your moon rocks, too.

608
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,120
Bring your gland shoes.

609
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,340
Bring your mattress back with you.

610
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,800
Bring your old mattress back there.

611
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,780
Take her on down.

612
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,500
Back in that back room, you know, where all that stuff is.

613
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,620
Back where we made the real.

614
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,180
Plan.

615
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,760
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

616
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,660
Are you talking about the place where Tenderly Convenience waxed Sterno in the head?

617
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
That back room?

618
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,120
Yeah.

619
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,760
That was the corner room.

620
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,100
That was in Chicago.

621
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:57,940
Back ahead.

622
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,920
That was a long time ago, folks.

623
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,400
Well, you'd have hit him in the head, too.

624
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
You could have.

625
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,940
You're just jealous because Tenderly got there first.

626
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,540
Here's Tenderly dancing around.

627
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,900
Everybody wanted some Sterno in the head back in those days.

628
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:13,920
In a tunnel.

629
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,480
Whipping a dead.

630
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,800
I really wanted some Tenderly head.

631
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,420
Now these people are old, crotchety men.

632
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,040
Sad old bags of.

633
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,740
Sad old bags of.

634
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,600
I remember when.

635
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,520
Piss off in this.

636
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,660
Self-genius owned the world.

637
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I remember when they was the preeminent cult in America, and now the Mormons have completely taken over.

638
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,780
I've got everything in sync.

639
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,820
And I don't mean in synchronization.

640
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,860
I take a load now and then.

641
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,940
Some people flush it down the toilet.

642
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,940
I depend on the sink.

643
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,680
The sink.

644
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,360
The sink.

645
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,780
And then the plumber happened to arrive.

646
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,080
And they took that little electrical snake.

647
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,440
And they plunged it down the sink.

648
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,060
And you wouldn't believe what they came up with.

649
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,940
In the sink.

650
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,020
In the sink.

651
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,580
So anymore I don't do that procedure.

652
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,380
Cause it's stopped up the drain.

653
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,600
It's stopped up the sink.

654
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,640
So if you've got a master bed.

655
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,100
Don't use the sink.

656
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,920
Cause you're just given a chance.

657
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,360
Don't do your work.

658
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,420
To a plumber.

659
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,460
Don't stop up the sink with her.

660
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,160
Don't do your work.

661
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
Down the sink.

662
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,860
It's not the kind of thing that works against the sink.

663
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,960
Don't sink your work.

664
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,040
Down the sink.

665
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,260
And the day comes.

666
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,480
When heaven and earth.

667
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,520
Belong to one.

668
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,540
You can look back in the sink.

669
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,320
I hate these memories.

670
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,040
I hate the sink.

671
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,040
Everything goes back to the sink.

672
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,620
How do you make babies?

673
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,900
I don't know.

674
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:43,900


675
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:43,900


676
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:43,900


677
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:43,900


678
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:43,900


679
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,860
How do you stop births short of abortion?

680
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,880
How do you do it with a sink?

681
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,720
How do you stop babies?

682
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,420
Without abortion?

683
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,280
How do you do it?

684
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,820
Well, I'll tell you do it with a sink.

685
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,960
Busting little spermies down the sink.

686
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,300
Oh, yes, dear friends.

687
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,140
Well, that was something you don't hear every day.

688
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,540
A song there called In Sink or In the Sink.

689
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,100
By Skip and the Elite.

690
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,020
Elite, posted to the Alt Binaries Slack news group.

691
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:56,000
And friends, we've also been listening to the last show of the millennium on KPFA in Berkeley.

692
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:04,000
The subgenius, non-subgenius, more than an hour, less than a show, show with puzzling evidence.

693
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And normally has Dr. Howell, but in this case, Dr. Philo Drummond.

694
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:17,040
The overman, the true, one true, the only overman yet so far that we have in the church.

695
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,120
The only proof we have that Bob is even true.

696
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,560
Oh, no.

697
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,760
Oh, man, no wonder.

698
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:33,700
Well, anyway, that show was all mottered up with the ESO Swamp Radio show at WCSB Cleveland.

699
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,200
With Professor Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

700
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,360
And yours truly, and maybe Princess We Are Doe got in there somewhere.

701
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:50,100
And there's some Media Barrage Clips monster movie stuff by our friend New Monet.

702
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,360
The mysterious New Monet.

703
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,380
The music in the background is Einstein's Secret Orchestra with Ron Slade.

704
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,980
Recorded just a couple of weeks ago.

705
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,260
A few weeks ago at Winterstar Symposium.

706
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,000
Sponsored by Ace.

707
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:13,080
This song called Trippy Beard P-Boy Muff.

708
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,560
Oh, speaking of hippie weird stuff, I've got the schedule for Winterstar where we have to work, boys.

709
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,040
What do we, do we have to slosh the kitchen or do we have to remove the urinals and stuff?

710
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,840
You have to do a consciousness expanding jam at the end of the evening.

711
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,140
I thought it was the P-Boy.

712
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,080
Get this, man.

713
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,420
Dab.

714
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,580
Halim El Dab.

715
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,240
Notice that name.

716
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,700
Halim El Dab.

717
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,160
Who is a pharaoh.

718
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,840
An actual pharaoh.

719
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,200
I am proud to call an acquaintance, perhaps even a friend.

720
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,540
Certainly I admire his great drumming and his composition.

721
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,940
I know you used to hang with Ramses and Tutankhamen and all the rest of the guys that are seriously mortifying.

722
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:59,980
Drumming across the great rivers while you can stretch yourself out of pain.

723
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,340
Oh, strength theory again.

724
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,120
With anomi, that abnormal.

725
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,900
You can turn yourself.

726
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,020
You can turn yourself into a G-flat or an A-shark.

727
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,820
And Halim El Dab will guide you in slack.

728
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:20,020
And at 3 o'clock, actually at 3.30, then I give a scientific talk about the scientific basis of slack.

729
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,660
Okay, now who's to guide?

730
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,560
My new neighbor, Nathar, will be doing the electronic meditation devices.

731
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,520
Do you have a new home or domicile?

732
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,080
Something is happening.

733
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,140
You don't have to say where it is.

734
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,580
I'm just saying.

735
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,760
We're tunneling.

736
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,560
Let me put it that way.

737
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,540
The tunnel is progressing.

738
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,300
You're taking the bags of dirt out and you're making sure that nobody knows where you're going?

739
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,940
You have to hide the bags of dirt.

740
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:41,540
Imagine.

741
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,520
It ain't easy.

742
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:50,540
Oh, and then Pope Bob Wilson, after it doesn't, will tell it, give everyone a new map of their consciousness.

743
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,960
Pope Dozier?

744
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,420
Pope Bob, Robert Anton Wilson is his fancy author name.

745
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,780
We'll connect our consciousness in the key of a flat tire.

746
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,900
But we subgeniuses know him as just a regular feller pope.

747
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,340
Pope.

748
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,580
Pope.

749
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:02,800
Pope.

750
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,440
Pope.

751
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:03,540
Pope.

752
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,540


753
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,540


754
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,540


755
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,540


756
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,540


757
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,540


758
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,100
Pope.

759
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,420
Pope.

760
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,040
Pope.

761
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,180
Pope.

762
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:17,860
Pope.

763
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,340
Pope.

764
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:19,720
Pope.

765
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:19,720


766
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


767
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


768
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


769
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


770
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


771
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


772
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


773
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


774
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:19,800


775
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,760
It was like working at Playboy.

776
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,520
It was like as if you worked at Playboy.

777
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,440
I was going to say it was like working at Kmart, the endless droning, the blue shirts,

778
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,760
the red shirts.

779
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,820
It's as if you were the photographer.

780
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,280
We are happy.

781
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,040
The typographer's assistant at Playboy.

782
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,420
No, the makeup person's assistant.

783
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,220
Can I help you?

784
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,300
At Playboy.

785
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,100
And what else is happening then?

786
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,940
The spritzerer.

787
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,840
I'm the spritzerer?

788
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,220
The one who comes and spritzes the babe when he's supposed to look sweaty.

789
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,460
Oh, and then that's when my page ran out.

790
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,580
But what they didn't dare print on, my printer refused to print,

791
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:05,800
was something about a space jam in the middle of the frozen night in those cabins.

792
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:13,520
Would they say anything about Space Trance 1 workshop meditation trance drone?

793
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,000
It may have.

794
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,040
I think I'm on five.

795
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,440
I'm on right across.

796
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,200
Look at www.rosencomet.com.

797
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:23,540
Yeah.

798
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,720
I'm on five.

799
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm on right across.

800
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:57,420
Look at www.rosencomet.com.

801
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,940
I'm on right across.

802
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:13,960
Look at www.rosencomet.com.

803
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:27,740
Yeah.

804
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,060
I'm on right across.

805
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,060


806
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,660
Now, to abruptly change the subject, the internet.

807
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,500
There's several subgenius news groups and, of course, a zillion websites and so forth,

808
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,640
and chat rooms, all that kind of crap.

809
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,640
And one person was griping on alt.binaries.slack.

810
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,760
Which actually has great stuff on it.

811
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,020
He was complaining.

812
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,400
He goes, oh, my Bob, is this news group screwed up?

813
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,900
All the posts are coming in day late, and even the goodies that I put there don't show up.

814
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,660
And he goes, yeah, everything's a day late for me, too.

815
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:20,280
I think the conspiracy is screwing with Usenet so that we'll all go web-based.

816
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,520
And, friends, I think that's exactly what's going on.

817
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,940
And I don't know.

818
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:34,840
You know, some of you are probably a little newer to the internet, and some of you have probably dealt with it for a long time.

819
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:45,000
But I suspect that in about a year or two, we'll all have to have a license to have a website, just like the radio.

820
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:50,420
You know, there was a time when anybody could have a radio station, but suddenly, oh, well, there's not enough bandwidth.

821
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,260
And, of course, you know, some of these subversives might use it for, you know, to spread something.

822
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,520
Bad, like information.

823
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,980
So, friends, the supranational corporations don't like competition.

824
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:13,900
And they know that our one-world religion is the only antidote for the one-world advertiser.

825
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,560
Down with the supranationals and up with the supernatural, my friends.

826
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,820
Up, down with the quoteless Bob, and up with Bob.

827
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,360
Bob.

828
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,940
Bob.

829
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


830
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


831
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


832
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


833
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


834
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


835
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


836
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,240


837
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:37,220
Today, as Bob said, in 1959, when they regulate websites, only news group geeks will have free pornography.

838
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,680
He muttered that in his sleep.

839
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:51,760
Now, friends, I really do think that, of course, needless to say, the conspiracy is not going to let us get away with murder on the internet forever, like we have been.

840
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,280
I certainly feel like I have been.

841
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,120
But, you know, this is what...

842
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:04,100
The lesson that we must learn is that a few subgeniuses must retain the primitive knowledge.

843
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:18,480
And we must hand down certain paleolithic knowledge, like of pre-website stone implements, like newsreaders and telex and crap like that.

844
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,480
Hand axes, you know.

845
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,320
And even...

846
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,920
We must even, some of us must take it upon ourselves to...

847
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,660
Hand down skills like shoe repair.

848
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,720
How to clean a handgun barrel so it doesn't blow up in your face.

849
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,420
And how to change tires and diapers and dollars and so forth.

850
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:48,220
Because, friends, I was shocked at how fast the internet went from 99% slack to 99% ads.

851
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,760
It was almost like it happened overnight.

852
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,960
Now, back in the late 60s, early 70s, it took...

853
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:07,120
More than a year to turn what was known as acid rock into a sold-out conspiracy tool used to sell tires on Sears commercials.

854
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,280
By the late 70s, when punk came along, I remember kids telling me,

855
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,680
Well, that old hippie stuff didn't do anybody any good, but punk will save the world!

856
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,620
It will save...

857
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,160
The conspiracy can't...

858
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,860
It took six months to turn punk into a slogan and a haircut!

859
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,960
On a beer commercial!

860
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:37,560
And, friends, to nowadays, only little children still believe that music can ever be used as a weapon of rebellion anymore!

861
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,960
But then, along came the internet.

862
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,860
We had to give up on rock and roll.

863
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,740
It's owned.

864
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,060
Lock, stock, and barrel.

865
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,340
But the internet...

866
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,200
There was hope!

867
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,720
There was actual hope!

868
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,360
But how long did it take?

869
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,340
The wink of an eye, friend!

870
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,140
The wink, the blink of that red eye!

871
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,520
That you see when the conspiracy moons you!

872
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,780
And, friends, I hate to say it, but I am a...

873
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,360
Well, I'm proud to say I'm a subgenius.

874
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,220
But I am a dumbass!

875
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,400
Because I actually thought that it would be years before the internet was castrated.

876
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,840
Since I figured, well, the government can't get their hands on it.

877
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,160
You know, it got away from them.

878
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,480
Boy, was I fooled to think there was a government!

879
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,780
There hasn't...

880
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,360
That was a...

881
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,020
The damn government was the...

882
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,940
First to go!

883
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,420
Long before acid rock was even thought about, the government was sold out.

884
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:37,380
The one world advertiser has been bamboozling us all along.

885
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,360
At least for the last couple of hundred years.

886
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,140
And no more of it, I say, friends!

887
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,420
Now that it's too late, and it's a completely hopeless battle,

888
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,420
that's when we, the subgeniuses, must fight back all the morgue insanely!

889
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,960
And viciously and mindlessly!

890
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
Friends, what have we got to lose?

891
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,960
What have we got to lose at this point?

892
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,140
Most of us...

893
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,340
We...

894
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,880
You know, people complain about...

895
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,540
Civil...

896
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,220
We're just...

897
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,820
Our civil rights are slowly being taken away.

898
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:17,980
My friends, you give away all your civil rights the minute you clock in at work in the morning.

899
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,600
You give up your civil rights from 9 to 5 every day.

900
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,340
You know, and don't even think anything about that.

901
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,120
You...

902
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,220
You clock out from what freedom you pretended to have,

903
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,840
and then you go home and watch TV and go to sleep.

904
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,100
So what is left, friends,

905
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,300
except to use every spare second,

906
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,320
every spare stolen minute,

907
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,560
working like a crazed lab rat

908
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,760
with a wire up our asses

909
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,400
on anything that will give ourselves slack!

910
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,540
Even if that means laying in bed watching TV for hours.

911
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,200
Praise Bob.

912
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,740
Praise Bob!

913
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,880
But, it could also mean,

914
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,540
the energetic monkey wrenching.

915
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,580
And I don't mean monkey wrenching of machines.

916
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,160
The machines are our friends.

917
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,560
You know, the robots, let them serve us.

918
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,700
But the monkey wrenching of men's minds, friends!

919
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,700
Yes!

920
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,740
You know, a strong pink back is a terrible thing to waste.

921
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,420
And some of my fellow subgeniuses feel that on July 5th, 19...

922
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,600
Well, 2001, whatever.

923
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,400
When the aliens finally arrive and...

924
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,800
The dues-paying subgeniuses are ruptured up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

925
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,500
On that day, some subgeniuses, the holocaustal group,

926
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,840
feel that we should just simply wipe out every normal human being

927
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,280
who didn't send Bob 30 bucks!

928
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,020
Now others, such as the evangelicals,

929
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,540
the schism that I got stuck with,

930
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:52,840
uh...

931
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,960
We believe that, you know,

932
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,580
why waste them if you can put them to work, you know?

933
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,960
If we can control their drone-like behavior,

934
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,000
like is already being done,

935
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,000
like the toy robot stick men they already are,

936
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,560
why don't we do it, you know?

937
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,640
Now, how each individual does this,

938
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,220
that's between you and Bob!

939
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,300
Unlike every other conspiracy and religion,

940
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,340
we're not gonna tell you what to do or what to think.

941
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,800
We'll just tell you how to think.

942
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,980
That's the really, that's the great thing about this church, friends,

943
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,500
because only you paid Bob to tell you what you really think slack is.

944
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,880
No other subgenius will even try to tell you what your slack is,

945
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,080
and the real subgeniuses,

946
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:48,440
they know that if they could telepathically gaze deep into the soul of another subgenius,

947
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,060
all of the other ones would seem utterly incomprehensible and completely insane!

948
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,000
At the basis of their very soul.

949
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,860
And they are!

950
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,640
But we know that,

951
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,800
and that is the difference!

952
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,180
Praise Bob and hail Connie!

953
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,700
Soon a Star Wars battle will be fought among the planets,

954
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,140
and the headquarters of these spirits will be transferred to the Earth.

955
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,760
Who are these ETs?

956
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,060
Lucifer and his fallen angels,

957
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,740
the Devil and his demons.

958
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,760
Who's behind it all?

959
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:23,800
What?

960
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,600
I want this mysterious ET called Satan.

961
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,280
I am an Antichrist!

962
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:29,880
Can I stop?

963
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,400
Satan flies away!

964
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,700
We're not serving all good young blood for this kite war.

965
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,340
The evil is free.

966
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,460
May God have mercy on us.

967
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,820
This letter card will order this startling new video for a gift for just $24.95,

968
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,020
plus $3 shipping and handling.

969
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,160
Recently I asked for the

970
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,160


971
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,160


972
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,160


973
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,700
in God-given

974
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:11,700


975
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:11,700


976
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:11,700


977
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:11,700


978
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,220
maaa-

979
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:17,880
Transporter.

980
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,960
Thank you.

981
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,920
Dive into the plasma pool, aren't you?

982
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,580
You're afraid to be destroyed and recreated, aren't you?

983
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,080
You're afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you?

984
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,240
I seem to be stricken by a disease with a purpose, wouldn't you say?

985
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,700
Praise Bob.

986
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,400
Get Bob.

987
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,980
The Dobsian gene pool.

988
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,180
That's why you're here to come down.

989
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,340
Have you ever heard of insect politics?

990
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,340
Insects.

991
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,480
You don't have politics.

992
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,700
They're very brutal.

993
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,020
No compassion.

994
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,000
No compromise.

995
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,880
We can't trust the insect.

996
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,580
I'd like to become

997
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,020
the first

998
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,160
to

999
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,160


1000
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,500
insect politician.

1001
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,360
You see, I'd like to.

1002
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,800
And do we have one?

1003
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,820
Isn't George W.

1004
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm afraid, John.

1005
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,640
W.

1006
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,860
I don't know what you're trying to say.

1007
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,160
I like what you're saying.

1008
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,100
I'm saying I'm an insect.

1009
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,960
I'm saying I'm an insect.

1010
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,640
Who dreamt he was a man.

1011
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,240
Yes.

1012
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,360
And loved it.

1013
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,560
Loved it.

1014
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,880
But now the dream is over.

1015
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,940
Now the dream is over.

1016
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,540
Now the insect is awake.

1017
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,080
We're all insects.

1018
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,000
We dreamt we were men.

1019
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,360
But now the dream

1020
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,380
is over.

1021
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,040
They're saying I'm an insect.

1022
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,860
At the board of unemployment.

1023
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,720
They're saying I'm an insect.

1024
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,260
At the job I'd like to get.

1025
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,040
They're saying I'm an insect.

1026
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,900
My church and in my home.

1027
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,600
They're calling me an insect.

1028
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,660
Your insect has arrived.

1029
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,040
You can just step right on it here.

1030
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,820
As you're off, you'll fly again.

1031
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,200
I think I...

1032
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh.

1033
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,220
Call me an insect, man. I'm sick.

1034
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,880
Days of a fly.

1035
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,080
Days of a fly.

1036
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,120
Days of a fly.

1037
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,300
Nathan Heyman-Altra has arrived.

1038
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,620
He's completely out of it for your pleasure.

1039
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,520
Not the little fuzzy whiskers around his head.

1040
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,780
These are all in his hands.

1041
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,220
You cannot even imagine.

1042
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,200
By the way, Ivan, have you ever listened to this show on kpfa.org?

1043
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,720
I just did. I listened to the whole first half of it just this morning.

1044
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,340
It was your show.

1045
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:09,980
It was.

1046
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,120
The same damn CD that I just sent to you.

1047
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,940
It was down at Old Watery.

1048
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,880
That's right, because we were upstairs conferring.

1049
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,160
Yeah, we had to be upstairs conferring.

1050
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,580
To get my drift.

1051
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,560
If you catch my mane in there.

1052
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,200
Let me do some more show here.

1053
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,120
We had to snort some show.

1054
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,560
Oh, man, this is a great show.

1055
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,300
All right.

1056
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,200
I think this show's been stepped on.

1057
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,720
See, that's our version of Pupus Lilith doing her, you know,

1058
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,820
hey, is that a frop?

1059
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,480
I thought that was hilarious, actually.

1060
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,620
And you know what's funny is I recognize it right away as Pupus Lilith.

1061
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,040
Did you know that the average...

1062
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,680
It was Pupus Lilith pretending to be a guy.

1063
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,080
Did you know that in his lifetime...

1064
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,580
I'm going to give you a little fact here, Reverend Stans,

1065
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,640
that in his lifetime, the average person will have eaten...

1066
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,120
I know this assumes that they're not a vegan or a vegetarian.

1067
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,320
Or Phineas and Arco.

1068
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,900
But they will have eaten 14 cattle, 12 sheep, 2 calves,

1069
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,040
23 hogs.

1070
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,160
35 turkeys, 770 pounds of fish, and 880 chickens.

1071
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,420
I heard it was thousands of chickens.

1072
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,020
Well, yeah, it could be thousands by now.

1073
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,840
I mean, how does that help us with our last show?

1074
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,160
Probably less calves and more chickens by now.

1075
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,620
I don't eat as much veal as I used to.

1076
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,600
Only 14 cattle, but they're big cattle.

1077
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,400
They're like ox.

1078
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,580
I don't even want to think about what they do to calves.

1079
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,080
Calves.

1080
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,360
Oh, they torture them mercilessly.

1081
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,540
Yeah.

1082
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,880
Before they kill them and feed them to us.

1083
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,680
And make us eat them.

1084
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,580
But that's okay because it's people doing it.

1085
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,780
It's not other calves.

1086
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,620
Yeah, it's okay.

1087
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,520
It would be brutality if it was another cow doing it.

1088
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,180
My God, that would be unthinkable.

1089
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:53,900
That would be...

1090
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,620
I couldn't think about that, but...

1091
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,220
As long as I know that's not happening...

1092
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,960
By the way, folks, if you're watching on Channel X,

1093
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,540
you can see Ivan saying they're eating psychopops.

1094
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,700
I've heard that they do that.

1095
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,420
They force the animal's parents to do it in other foreign countries.

1096
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,480
Boy, it's going to be an exciting time.

1097
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,440
You're watching Subgenius Show.

1098
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,800
The one and two's gone.

1099
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:17,960
In some foreign countries, they force tigers to eat antelopes.

1100
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,460
They force lions to eat zebras.

1101
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,620
Did you know that...

1102
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,740
That's how cruel people are to animals.

1103
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:29,520
In this country, they force cats to eat songbirds.

1104
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,040
We raise house cats so that they can go out and kill the songbirds,

1105
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,580
and that's why we have so many bugs.

1106
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,140
Good night, Ford.

1107
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,460
Good night.

1108
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,040
You're too naive.

1109
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,960
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

1110
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,880
You can't even follow him.

1111
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,960
Is it not just the words?

1112
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,760
The beat.

1113
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,620
The fertility rights of the jungles are the same beat.

1114
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,800
Incorporated in this modern rock.

1115
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,160
You haven't gotten next to him, but I've got all kinds of things in store.

1116
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,020
Who and what are these ETs?

1117
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,880
Who created them and why?

1118
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,900
Can their existence be proven?

1119
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,600
Sex on the street.

1120
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,800
You who are stupid piss ants and reptiles,

1121
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,060
and lower than the primates,

1122
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,880
you can make a hoopie if you want.

1123
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,980
But can your hoopie make a hoopie?

1124
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,680
So you can make your hoopie while I do something to calm...

1125
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,440
Do you feel blind?

1126
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,020
Are you mad?

1127
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,960
Do you feel like moose about to rub lettuce?

1128
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:52,940
Can fattles hear?

1129
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,500
Hear lemmings?

1130
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,460
That's where the music comes up and everybody gets really, really, really scared.

1131
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,860
Man, this has been a lot of fun because we've had the...

1132
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,860
We've had everybody here tonight.

1133
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,440
We've had the only three important people in the Church of the Subgenius.

1134
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,340
Yeah, that's true.

1135
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,140
Phineas, me, and Dwellman.

1136
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,900
Wait, let me look at my card here.

1137
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,000
Hey, what? What?

1138
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,780
Yes, you've been listening to the last show of the Melunium.

1139
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,120
Only the three most important, but not the greatest of all subgenii.

1140
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,300
But where was Bob in all this time?

1141
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,580
Well, Bob's just the made-up guy. Don't worry about that.

1142
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,300
And where then was Bob in all this time?

1143
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:36,840
I'll tell you about him.

1144
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,600
Bob's in your mother.

1145
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,320
Where are you?

1146
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,200
I'm thinking of Bob.

1147
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,580
If I were one of the subgeniuses, I'd claim that I made up Bob right about now.

1148
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,320
... decency to pull your knife out of Bob's belly that day, eh?

1149
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,820
I'll tell you where he is, Stans.

1150
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,500
He's at your mama's house.

1151
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,320
Eating the black stuff inside your skeleton.

1152
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,080
Oh, yes, sir. What about the black stuff?

1153
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,200
Cut your belly open and I'll show you the black stuff.

1154
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,120
Try to rub your little round belly with the black stuff inside your mother's skeleton.

1155
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,800
You're a rabbit supper.

1156
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,880
You're a rabbit?

1157
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:13,660
Sal?

1158
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,360
You're gonna come to the rabbit stew!

1159
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,300
Sal? Sal who?

1160
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,080
Salami?

1161
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:21,880
That's funny.

1162
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:22,900
Salami!

1163
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:24,940
Salami!

1164
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,620
This show has been very good for me.

1165
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,340
Thank you, thank you.

1166
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,280
This show has been good for me, too. This show has, like, delivered me. It's brought me forward.

1167
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,980
This show has been arthritic for me, too.

1168
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,140
This show has been a frightening experience.

1169
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,200
It's been a carbuncle on the butthole of society, but other than that, it's been great.

1170
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:44,500
Yeah.

1171
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,720
And this, you know, last five minutes of the last show.

1172
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,700
The last five minutes.

1173
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:55,140
The last five minutes of the last show.

1174
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:04,500
The forces of good are a sworn enemy. And I repeat, they must be exterminated. And I mean lethally.

1175
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,580
The little man has done it to us again.

1176
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,420
He's made a monkey out of the forces of evil.

1177
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,240
Is he dead?

1178
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,540
Yeah.

1179
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,000
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

1180
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,980
Suppose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this?

1181
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,400
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

1182
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,440
One thing's sure. Inspector Clay's dead.

1183
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,380
Murdered.

1184
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,060
And somebody's responsible.

1185
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,260
Salami!

1186
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,240
What's the matter, everyone?

1187
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,920
That's why we don't talk for a while, don't answer.

1188
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,740
Oh my God.

1189
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:56,800
Friends, if you're in any state of confusion at all now, remember to put free information to Bob.

1190
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,820
Did you know you're in the state of confusion?

1191
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,720
At that sacred P.O. box which still exists in mysterious Dallas, Texas.

1192
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,680
Even though there's nobody left there, there's just a P.O. box.

1193
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:15,440
It's just a town that used to be there, but now it's just only a stick in the middle of town with a box on it.

1194
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,360
And it's the P.O., sacred P.O. box because the rest of the city is gone.

1195
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,020
I've seen the tape in that MTV tape, folks, that you saw on MTV so many years ago.

1196
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,900
There's a picture of the guy that answers that box with his family out in the middle of a wrecked city.

1197
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,040
And there you can see in the foreground a little box, a little mailbox.

1198
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,360
The sacred golden box. It's made out of solid gold now.

1199
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,320
It glistens in the distance.

1200
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,640
As people draw closer to Dallas, they see the...

1201
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,960
Yeah, it's got a little puppy on it, so the flexor...

1202
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:50,740
...shivering, gilded sky as they approach the golden P.O. box that is Dallas, Texas now.

1203
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:59,300
Next day's coming. That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214. Order now.

1204
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,040
Please shine the light of... of... whatever.

1205
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,100
Not available in any store.

1206
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,020
Not in the light.

1207
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,300
Sold separately. Batteries not included. Some assembly required.

1208
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,620
Not stored in soles.

1209
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,220
Not stored in soles.

1210
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,960
I'd almost forgotten that old saw. That clever play on words.

1211
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,460
Not stowed in sores either.

1212
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,880
So sad not to have it anymore.

1213
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,480
But you can get it back. You can get it back from...

1214
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,340
...with only...

1215
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,640
...a self-addressed stamped envelope from just what they said.

1216
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,060
Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1217
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,020
And the zip code on that, friends.

1218
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,220
The all-important zip code of...

1219
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,580
...Bob is 75214.

1220
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,100
And friends, amidst the puzzling evidence,

1221
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:58,440
Einstein Secret Orchestra, Radio Swamp, Philo Spew, and Dave Brain...

1222
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,280
...um...

1223
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,560
...oh, we also heard some...

1224
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,780
...the satanic...

1225
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,940
...jamboree clips by Jupiter Research...

1226
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,640
...and the song Wilderness of Bob...

1227
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,820
...by Chaz Smith...

1228
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,480
...we heard there recorded at Winterstar...

1229
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,060
...and also my rant from Winterstar.

1230
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,700
There, friends.

1231
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,520
Congratulations, by the way, to Einstein Secret Orchestra...

1232
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,540
...for winning the Free Times Music Award here in Cleveland...

1233
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,000
...for Best Instrumental Electronic Music, of course.

1234
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,920
And, uh...

1235
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,540
...oh, and while you're at it, friends...

1236
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,120
...uh...

1237
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,560
...check out on the web...

1238
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,740
...www.subgenius.com.

1239
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,080
And then go to www.pandromeda.com.

1240
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,000
I did that, finally.

1241
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,100
And, uh...

1242
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,320
...the promise of Mojo World is so great.

1243
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,200
It is.

1244
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:53,800
So great.

1245
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:54,820
Grandios.

1246
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,400
So truly grand is the promise.

1247
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,040
Yes.

1248
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:58,540
Ah.

1249
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,620
It is a...

1250
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:00,940
...I...

1251
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,540
...and I...

1252
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:01,760
...it...

1253
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,320
...it pulls and tugs at me...

1254
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,880
...like a pied piper.

1255
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:08,440
I'm like a rat of Hamelin...

1256
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,640
...wanting to follow the promise of Mojo World.

1257
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,800
That's www.pandromeda.com.

1258
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,420
The pied pooper.

1259
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,720
Where the pink bob rules.

1260
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:21,760
And the Mojo.

1261
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,840
The bizarro bob.

1262
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,860
Me no like slack.

1263
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:26,380
Uh.

1264
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,780
Me bizarro bob.

1265
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,860
Me hate to learn.

1266
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:29,320
Slack.

1267
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,200
This man...

1268
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,520
Legume has slack.

1269
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,500
...if you call him a man...

1270
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,040
Take it away.

1271
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,780
...has designs on your consciousness.

1272
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,700
That was an actual quote.

1273
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,220
...looking to your computer screen.

1274
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,240
Don't you see what's happening?

1275
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,520
Your mind is being mojo-ized and you don't even know it.

1276
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,980
Stand back, Dr. Grineker.

1277
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,300
I have to...

1278
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:46,940
This connects the wires.

1279
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,480
It's okay, Dave.

1280
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,900
Yeah, I've seen Dave...

1281
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,240
Dave, don't freak out on it.

1282
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,480
Just accept it.

1283
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,540
I have seen Dave...

1284
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,000
It's the new paradigm.

1285
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,460
...get freaked out just looking at an ordinary videotape of the computer.

1286
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:57,760
...and the computer is just a piece of shit.

1287
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:57,760


1288
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,400
It's just some real trippy computer animation.

1289
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:58,900
...for you as a human being.

1290
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,840
Just some real trippy computer animation.

1291
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,440
And Dave, late at night, we exposed him to this stuff and he was going, man, it's getting

1292
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:06,860
too...

1293
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,880
This is too intense.

1294
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:08,360
They're...

1295
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,460
They're gonna watch us back.

1296
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,140
He watched it.

1297
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:10,200
He watched it.

1298
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:10,800
It's all virtual.

1299
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,120
Nobody has a real life anymore.

1300
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,260
He pulled his head right up to the screen and he said...

1301
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,100
Nobody has a real life.

1302
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,240
I need blue light, baby.

1303
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,360
I need blue light, baby.

1304
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,920
I need blue light.

1305
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:36,820
I need blue light, baby.

1306
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:45,560
I need blue light, baby.

1307
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,920
And Dave wanted to talk to that.

1308
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,240
Did I get lovely focus dude?

1309
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:51,240


1310
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:51,240


1311
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:51,240


1312
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:51,240


1313
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,580
for sure squashy enough.

1314
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,040
Well, people do yeah.

1315
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:32,180
All these things are leading us

1316
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:38,420
And I'd like to show you

1317
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,580
How it is to be

1318
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,700
All the way

1319
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,640
All the way

1320
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,620
To my side

1321
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:58,220
All these things are leading us

1322
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:06,380
And I'd like to show you

1323
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,020
How it is to be

1324
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,020


1325
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,820
All the way

1326
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:21,600
To my side

1327
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,840
All the way

1328
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,420
To my side

1329
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1330
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1331
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,320
All the way
