1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Oh, I'm just wild about Bobby.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,940
Just.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,980
Just.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,180
Yes, baby.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,240
Yes, baby.

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,620
Yes, baby.

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,180
Yes, baby.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,300
I am the God of Hellfire.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,780
I bring you.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:32,960
Bob.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:33,960
Bob.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,620
One of the most serious threats to the human race comes from the smallest opponents.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,940
The subgenius.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,960
Hour of Slack.

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,300
It is a race against time.

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,220
It is a race against time.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,860
It is a race against time.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,080
That is not that funny.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,160
You'll be better as I have my clothes off.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,140
When do I change my pants?

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,740
Funny.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,400
Swimming in the bear.

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,680
I was so embarrassed about the size of my penis that we used to dread the days we had to go swimming.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,160
What I have my clothes on.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,540
Come over here so we can take a look.

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,040
A slippy.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,740
Well, how do you think I feel?

28
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,040
A sparky.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,920
Oh, you're really...

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,980
Poppin'.

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
Oh, you're really hung like a horse.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,760
Right along.

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,280
He feels plenty miserable.

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,700
And so do more boys of this age than you would suspect.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,280
Come.

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,360
Come.

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,920
Well, how do you think I feel?

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,180
He feels plenty miserable.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,040
Come.

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,220
Come.

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,120
He'll preach bones that are big and long.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,960
Come.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,060
Come.

44
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,240
He'll...

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:06,960
Bobby.

46
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,500
Bobby.

47
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,340
Bobby, baby.

48
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:08,960
Bobby, bubby.

49
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,280
Bobby.

50
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,100
Rabbit, darling.

51
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,420
Bobby.

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,280
Bobby, hoomie.

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,900
Bobby, bubby.

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,480
Daddy, boby.

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,660
Daddy, boby.

56
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:12,900
Daddy, boby.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,320
Bobby.

58
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,660
Bobby, honey.

59
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,300
Bobby, honey.

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Bobby, baby.

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Bobby, come on over for dinner.

62
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,260
We'll be so glad to see you.

63
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,340
Bobby, come on over for dinner.

64
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,840
Just you and me and us, only the three of us.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,080
We love you.

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,120
We love you.

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,760
That'll be enough to scare me right off the couch.

68
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,560
Bob, I'll jump right out and get on it.

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,940
Dobbs, go get the dynamite.

70
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,540
I think that somewhere between the homicidal Bob and the,

71
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,680
look, I'm a fountain Bob,

72
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,960
that there's a guy who might be able to at least function,

73
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,320
find some small crumb of happiness in this bleak, swirling air,

74
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,420
and make it sound pretty.

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,520
Now, everybody, whistle.

76
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,080
All right, let's go live to Bob headquarters now.

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,960
And just look how happy he is.

78
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,380
Bob, I'm sorry, but I don't see the light on your face.

79
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

80
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,120
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


84
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


86
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,300


87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,840
Oh, praise Bob. Praise Bob.

88
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,900
This here is a statue of Bob. Great Bob. Great Bob with a great pipe on his great white horse. Praise Bob.

89
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,600
This here is the pipe of Dobbs. Stuck in the grunting grin of Dobbs. Praise Dobbs on his great white horse.

90
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,680
If you can help us with a donation.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,600
This here is the frock what lies in the bowl of Dobbs.

92
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,200
The great Dobbs. The great white Dobbs on his great white horse. Praise Bob and his great white horse.

93
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,720
This here is the smile of Dobbs.

94
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:10,040
Not to be confused with the grunting grin that holds the pipe that bears the frock that flames to the heavens that fills the sky with the righteous stink of Bob in the nostrils of every man.

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,300
Praise Bob.

96
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:18,040
This here is a statue of Bob on his great white horse. This is Bob on his horse. The great white horse Bob. Praise Bob.

97
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,560
This here is Bob. Mind your boots going through the door tip.

98
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,020
This here is the boots of Dobbs.

99
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,300
This is what Bob uses to ride the great white horse.

100
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,960
Praise Bob.

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
This here is the statue of Bob. The great Bob.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,380
Stride his great white horse.

103
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,940
This here is the door to the room that bears the statue of Bob. Mind your boots going through.

104
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,400
Praise Bob.

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
This here is Bob.

106
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,920
That there is Ivan Stang the sacred stride.

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,000
Cunningly wrought in epoxy resins.

108
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,160
Observe the pinched and callow features, the nicotine stained fingers, the miserable shriveled soul.

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
The sacred scribe.

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,260
Don't touch.

111
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,860
Over here you have the overman.

112
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,200
This here is the great white headed overman.

113
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,400
Pink cheeked and round nosed.

114
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,440
Hell monkey chin.

115
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,540
Notice the split diversions on the tip of the nose.

116
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,140
Notice he has five penises under each armpit and two more between his legs.

117
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,900
This is an anatomically faithful reproduction of the overman.

118
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,960
Don't touch please. Mind your boots going through the door. Tip.

119
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,540
This here is the statue of the Ghebrev Fran.

120
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,660
Faithfully reproduced in carved cedar wood.

121
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,760
From the cedars of Lebanon on the banks of the Tyre.

122
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,600
Or was it the iron?

123
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,780
Notice the Ghebrev Fran is always represented just before he falls into the tube.

124
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,420
And is annihilated by the great wave of Negi.

125
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,740
This here is the void, the faceless emptiness.

126
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,300
The great vastness.

127
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,920
The emptiness, the dark midnight of the soul.

128
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,340
This is the black hole of all emotions we call Negi.

129
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,540
Mind your boots going through. Don't touch or it's your problem.

130
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,540
This here is the statue of Connie.

131
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,720
Stella Maris, the Irma Ja, the Virgin Mary.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
The mother of all.

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,780
The great goddess.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,440
Mind your boots going through her door. You'll be in a lot of trouble.

135
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,800
This here is the Dobbs Museum.

136
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,020
This way please.

137
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,620
This concludes the end of this tour.

138
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,940
Mind your boots going out.

139
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,620
Watch out for the statue of Dobbs, the great Dobbs on his great white horse.

140
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,620
Thank you.

141
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,640
What? What? What? What? What? What?

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,560
You're gonna play now.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,280
You're listening to the Puzzling Evidence program.

144
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,480
And we are not talking about UFOs.

145
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,640
As the gentleman asked.

146
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,320
Whew!

147
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
What? What? What? What?

148
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,260
What, what, what?

149
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,840
What you gonna play now, Bobby?

150
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,740
If only you would.

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,300
Just for one hour a day.

152
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,300
If only you would.

153
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,460
Sing it, Dolly.

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,640
The great Salvador Dali.

155
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,620
Salvador Dali Parton, the greatest, surrealist country western singer in the history of the throes of induction.

156
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,600
And that is no trash, monsoors and mondams.

157
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,820
That is the...

158
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:46,960
The...

159
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,400
The pimp will...

160
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,760
The...

161
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,840
The phony, baloney truth of it all.

162
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,960
Yeah, burr.

163
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,060
And I'm not meaning to subterfuge any what small amount of sanity you have left.

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
I know it dribbles from your ears.

165
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,460
I know it oozes from the side corners of your eye pockets.

166
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,140
As you gasp and puff.

167
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,200
Walking down these dirty, dusty, polluted streets.

168
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,620
But it's gonna be alright.

169
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,100
It's gonna be okay.

170
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,200
It's gonna be better than you wanted it to be.

171
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,180
Tell them, Dave.

172
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:24,200
See, I'm wearing my heart like a crown.

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,420
I know there are some people out there who make a strong statement.

174
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,580
For those of you who do, rub dog, excrement all over your body, sleep in your clothes for a week,

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,880
then storm into a city council meeting with a big box of stale donuts and freshly drunk bottle of wild Irish rose,

176
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,580
screaming, I am the apple state pope.

177
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,180
I am the antichrist.

178
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm wearing this whole heart.

179
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,580
And for those of you who want to make a soft statement,

180
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,760
which is the condition of most of your people's genitals out there,

181
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,340
have your bells going up in a pile of dirt.

182
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,220
And for your young men out there who want to impress your moms and dads,

183
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,020
kiss a picture of Madonna and dance around your parents' house in a tutu.

184
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,380
And for those of you who want to show, as many of our Catholic brethren are doing,

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,400
that suffering has meaning,

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,800
allow your knee and armpit hairs to be braided by a tired chimpanzee,

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:13,920
and you will be free.

188
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
It's an old one, but it gets effects like nobody's grisness.

189
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I want an explanation. I want an explanation.

190
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,800
Okay, here, it's at the bottom.

191
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,980
All right, somebody start talking.

192
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,920
It comes in before each show.

193
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,300
Shut up!

194
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,200
Oh, okay, well, you see, this guy gets excited, and they write all the jokes for us,

195
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,160
and then we just do the show, that's all.

196
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,860
Whose idea was this, anyway?

197
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,300
It's not really a live show. Do you think these callers are talking to somebody?

198
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,960
This is all composed of random bits of information selected by electronic computer.

199
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,520
No one is here.

200
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,660
No one is here.

201
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,140
No one answers.

202
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,220
Go back to sleep or ask about Theme World.

203
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,780
The top part was discovered, and it led stairway after stairway down into the bowels of the earth,

204
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,100
the mummified form of the original Tower of Bob that the Theme World attraction is based on.

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,720
And here we sit at the basement of the Tower of Bob,

206
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,660
once again broadcasting through our tiny little tape decks

207
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,140
and our great big computers

208
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,120
and our teeny-tiny little computers.

209
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,160
And here we see the lights and our huge, gigantic transmitters

210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,220
with small aircraft crashing into them when the lights go out.

211
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,840
And this is your prayer partner and host, Reverend Ivan Stank,

212
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,500
so good to be back with you again with a better microphone than ever.

213
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,220
Yes, it, the power, well,

214
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,580
we've just been listening to a little bit of KPFA.

215
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,920
There, Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence from the subgenius show on KPFA in Berkeley.

216
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,460
Before that, we heard some Salvador Dali Parton

217
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,300
from Einstein's Secret Orchestra, best of 91 or some ancient year, like that.

218
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,160
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Chaz and Einstein's Secret Orchestra there on WCSB in Cleveland.

219
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,700
Before that, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon's guided tour

220
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,600
through the statue of Bob and his great white horse.

221
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,480
G. Gordon Gordon there, mixed, I believe, by puzzling evidence, probably.

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Prior to that, some lovely Bob songs by,

223
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,080
collaged by Sister Susie the Floozy of WZRD.

224
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,140
No, no, no, I'm sorry, WREK.

225
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,500
WREK in Atlanta.

226
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,860
You see, there are subgenius shows just everywhere.

227
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,200
They're just popping up everywhere.

228
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,560
You can't stop them.

229
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,980
Someday that's all that will be on.

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,260
And then, and then I myself will take the three nuclear weapons

231
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,760
that church has left and destroy them all.

232
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,980
Also, some negative land, sex dirt.

233
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,440
There at the beginning.

234
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,280
And some other tapes, a weird mix.

235
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,360
That, by someone who didn't label the tape,

236
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,760
didn't put their own name on the tape,

237
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,220
and now it's separated from the box.

238
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,880
And man, if you send us a cool tape,

239
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,720
put a, it can be hand scrawled,

240
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
but put your name on the tape somewhere.

241
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Something to make us connect it to the piece of paper

242
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,220
that came in the mail.

243
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,980
And, oh by the way, I should give an address for negative land.

244
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,260
Negative mail order land for the simple reason that I think I made it.

245
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,500
I may have been giving it wrong.

246
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,360
The place to get, yeah, swinging groovy negative land tapes is,

247
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,760
got that pencil ready?

248
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,620
1920 Monument Boulevard.

249
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,860
1920 Monument Boulevard, MF1.

250
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,640
Yes, MF-1.

251
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,760
1920 Monument Boulevard, MF-1, Concord, California.

252
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,340
94520.

253
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,880
Concord, California.

254
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,580
94520.

255
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,400
And this creepy, kind of cool music in the background

256
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,220
is from one of two CDs that we got from that most bizarre

257
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,660
and strange tape distributor, a company,

258
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,420
what is it, TriAge?

259
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,200
At WFMU.org.

260
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,400
I don't know exactly what the connection is,

261
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,880
but they keep sending these amazing,

262
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,380
groovy CDs full of misfits and mutants and crazy people.

263
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,320
And the crazy people are the only ones dumb enough

264
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,680
to stand up and fight City Hall.

265
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,480
And in fact, this music in the background is from a band called Tipsy.

266
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,660
Triptees, the seductive sounds of Tipsy.

267
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,080
And this is Space Age bachelor pad music par excellence, I think.

268
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,800
Sort of like a cross between, um,

269
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,240
Combustible Edison, Mayhaps, and, uh,

270
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,420
Esquivel.

271
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,240
It's groovy.

272
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,780
This, uh, for instance, the titles,

273
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
listen to the titles on this one.

274
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,340
Mr. Excitement,

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,540
we just heard in the background.

276
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,620
Space Golf, playing now.

277
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,480
Grossen Hosen,

278
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,300
Nude on the Moon,

279
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,840
El Bombo Atomico,

280
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,460
Lickerdelic,

281
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,760
Oops,

282
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
Something Tropical,

283
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,580
and Zenith.

284
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,780
And, uh, I've got this other CD by a series of bizarre, crazy, crackpot,

285
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,520
creative-type, um, British weirdos.

286
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,460
It, all I can say is it's a collection of musical British weirdos.

287
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,320
Uh, which we will be listening to bits and pieces of.

288
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,520
So this will be rather a musical show, now that we've had a bit of spoken word and ranting.

289
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,700
I don't know what else is coming up.

290
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,480
Okay, I gave you a negative VLANs number.

291
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,500
We just had the most wonderful visit to Austin, dear friends.

292
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,380
Uh, for the, there's a big, in this case it was a computer multimedia sort of a con.

293
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,360
There's a big music con, con that happens next week.

294
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,280
Where, and I'll be there too.

295
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,520
But, uh, Jesus, oh, Jesus and, and myself and, uh, and Reverend Nikki, Death Chick,

296
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,960
uh, and, uh, someone else, uh, who, someone else I'm married to.

297
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,820
Uh, well, we all went down to Austin.

298
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,380
And we were partying with, uh, Mark Hosler from Negative VLAN.

299
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,960
Uh, was there to rant about copyrights.

300
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,120
And I was there to rant about the internet like I've been known to do.

301
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,580
And, uh, at one point I was in, in Joe Newman's house looking around myself thinking,

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,180
you know this ain't such a bad life because I'm in the, the glowing presence now of members of three

303
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,880
of the coolest bands in the universe that I've played just, uh, two shows back.

304
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,040
Uh, the Joe Newman, Rudish Swartz Project, uh, Sphinx Drumming, Swingin' Love Corpses,

305
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,380
and, uh, uh, and Mark Hosler, Negative VLAN.

306
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,540
And it was just crazy.

307
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:10,960
It was just crazy.

308
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,780
And, uh, we are so cool.

309
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,080
We are so cool.

310
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,100
And, and Steve Jackson of Steve Jackson Games.

311
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,200
It's like the weirdo and geek celebrities par excellence.

312
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,840
One last bit of news I will mention before we go on into the music.

313
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,940
Friends, you know, I, I, I've, I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been

314
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,040
forcing you to listen to my gripes about how horrible it is to quit smoking.

315
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,060
And I've been very successful, uh, in not smoking cigarette.

316
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,260
I haven't touched a cigarette in, in three months.

317
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,020
My, but I, I wanna, actually I should stop this.

318
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:59,420
I want to admit to you friends that I, uh, I have not been able to, uh, resist urinating.

319
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,940
I was going to.

320
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,240
I'm going to, uh, I know that I said, I think I said something last week on the show that,

321
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,220
that, that, that I was going to quit peeing and, and, uh, and it went great for several

322
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,660
days.

323
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:21,000
Uh, I, I started gaining weight though and, and it just, you know, I couldn't fight the

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,280
urge.

325
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,900
I just couldn't fight the urge any longer.

326
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,240
And it, but I'm, I'm going to fight it.

327
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,840
I, I, if I need y'all's prayers, I need y'all's prayers.

328
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:30,940
I need y'all's prayers.

329
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,820
Help me fight it.

330
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,540
I don't want to, I don't want to just get the, you know, give up.

331
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,940
I'm, I want to stick with it.

332
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,540
I don't want to go, go off and pee and drown my sorrows.

333
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,800
That's, that's not what I, what I want to do.

334
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,220
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

335
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,880
We're still far from the end of this list.

336
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,640
Our cases are backed up for centuries.

337
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,140
I am not familiar with the crimes of these three.

338
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,040
One is Hiram Saperstein, Lord.

339
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,120
One is Klaus Schiller and one is Martin Bormann.

340
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,200
I remember Mar, Mr. Bormann.

341
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,940
You've been before this judgment before, have you not?

342
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,520
Jawohl.

343
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,260
For outrages against your own kind.

344
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,140
Jawohl.

345
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,860
Jawohl.

346
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,300
What, recording angel, what crime is he accused of this time?

347
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,800
Outraging hell, my Lord God.

348
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,740
But these other two, are they contemporary?

349
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,960
Humans, Lord, 21st century.

350
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,100
Humans were made to learn quickly, not to take ages to do it like angels and demons.

351
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,140
Haven't they learned their lessons yet?

352
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,960
I'm afraid we've run out of tortures.

353
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,560
And we've learned the dangers of the world.

354
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,700
And we've learned that they are not the only creatures for crimes of this sort.

355
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,580
Not to mention space in hell.

356
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,340
Send them back.

357
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Lord, send them back?

358
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,040
Shall we not nay throw them into the lake of fire?

359
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,280
Send them back to their own kind.

360
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,320
Let the living find the best ways to punish their own miscreants.

361
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,000
Open the gates of hell.

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,220
and push the damned through them one by one.

363
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,480
Reverend Ivan Stang and I are in the center of a vast, packed stadium

364
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,040
desperately trying to defuse an immense 500,000 megaton nuclear time bomb.

365
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,660
Both of us can't figure out what to do or how to stop it,

366
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,920
even though the device is absurdly simple.

367
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,840
The crowd roars, demanding immediate detonation,

368
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,520
chanting, do it, over and over again at the top of their lungs,

369
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,600
even as the digital timer clicks to zero.

370
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,260
And then I woke up. What a dream, huh, pal?

371
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
Hey, see you in Slumberland.

372
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,520
Copyright 1997, poem every day.

373
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,100
I think Bob's happy seeing that.

374
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
Oh, certainly, certainly.

375
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
You get the flack and all.

376
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,360
That's me.

377
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,780
Who's Bob? Me, Bob!

378
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,080
Do you have enough slack?

379
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,040
I have slack.

380
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,600
How do you know?

381
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,920
Who's Bob? Me, Bob!

382
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,220
Slack is what Bob is trying to bring to the table.

383
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,760
All right, all right, now, all right, let's get to this slack.

384
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,680
Be set.

385
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,740
Who's Bob? Me, Bob!

386
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,280
1-800-GET-PINK.

387
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,340
Who's Bob? Me, Bob!

388
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,340
I don't want any of you letting Bob into the tent.

389
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,200
Why?

390
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,100
Why?

391
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,560
Sweetheart, aren't you overreacting just a little bit?

392
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,260
He will turn this place into a den.

393
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,120
Here's the deal,

394
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,940
Oh, Seekers.

395
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,140
Oh, what a night.

396
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,660
Oh, I feel like that joke, you know.

397
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,180
The last thing I saw was that monkey trying to put the cork back in.

398
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,820
Oh, Seekers, this is the Reverend Susie the Floozy.

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,420
Tonight I've been rode hard and put up slack.

400
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,120
Oh.

401
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,860
Yeah, I'm so sore from working this show out with a pencil.

402
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,860
And I ain't looking forward to doing the credits

403
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,200
because of the sheer quantity of stuff we're talking about.

404
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,480
So I'll go through them fast.

405
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,920
We heard from the subgenius interviews video,

406
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,140
a rise, puzzling evidence video,

407
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,480
the Bob's Earwax audio tape,

408
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,200
the loved one,

409
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,280
flying saucers over Hollywood,

410
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,520
the Plan 9 companion,

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Humphrey Bogart and Broderick Crawford popped up in the mix,

412
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,880
as did Mrs. Miller and the Catholic Girls' School,

413
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,900
the Cold Cuts.

414
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,500
They both did their versions of The Shadow of Your Smile.

415
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,380
Oh, Bob, smile on us all.

416
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,340
And we also heard from that funky tramp in a nightclub, Jimmy Lynch,

417
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,120
a whole lot of...

418
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:45,940
Simpsons.

419
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,000
Lifeboat with...

420
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:48,940
Connie.

421
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,580
Betty Lee.

422
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,380
Merv Griffin supplied versions of the Red Ribbon.

423
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,040
Ah!

424
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,440
Must be Betty.

425
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,580
With masturbation, you know that at least you're making love to the one person who really does love you.

426
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,680
Peeeeeeee...

427
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,020
Aaaa...

428
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,540
Blahashlaaaaaaaa!

429
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,340
At night, you're in your two beautiful God's promise.

430
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,600
The married people have what we call the twelve foot stare.

431
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,380
They're just sitting there.

432
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,260
And one stare is going this way over his shoulder.

433
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,600
And one stare is going this way over her shoulder.

434
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,160
And they look wine they're going, hey, hey.

435
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,560
there staring it's called the five-year stare and here are the people who are dating

436
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,120
oh it's so wonderful

437
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:01,620
you have been driven to the brink of insanity by the conspiracy

438
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
no

439
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,200
Kill Bob!

440
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,820
Bob is a conspiracy pasty!

441
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,640
Bob faked his own crucifixion so he could be resurrected to become your personal savior!

442
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,880
Bob is in the back of his river right now getting ahead from your goldfinch!

443
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,820
Grab your favorite drum, come and whack his head off!

444
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,680
Whack it!

445
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,160
And place it in the trophy cage right next to the pleading head of Arnold Palmer!

446
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,020
That's right Bob, there's sinners just like you!

447
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,700
The second coming to follow me is slaughtered with the Bob drum and J.R. Bob Dom's leading the flock!

448
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,720
Bob!

449
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,580
Kill Bob!

450
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,320
Kill Bob!

451
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,600
Kill Bob!

452
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,500
Kill Bob!

453
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,620
Kill Bob!

454
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,040
Kill Bob!

455
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,520
Kill Bob!

456
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,860
Kill Bob!

457
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:38,980


458
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,860
Bob!

459
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,120
Forgive me Bob!

460
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,660
Oh Bob, I have sinned against you!

461
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
I was possessed by the anti-Bob!

462
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,160
Please forgive me!

463
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,360
Praise Bob!

464
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,160
Praise Bob!

465
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,520
Praise Bob!

466
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,960
Praise Bob!

467
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,480
Praise Bob!

468
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,720
If they would love him, much to do money, we would never have any problems.

469
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,240
He is the king of all kings.

470
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:42,160
Bill Miller, Bill T. Miller, Kings of Feedback, friends, Kill Bob, the Bill T. Miller Outband Experience, Kings of Feedback CD, right for information, Box 221, Boston, Massachusetts.

471
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,140
That's Box 221, Boston, Massachusetts.

472
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,700
That's Box 221, Boston, Massachusetts.

473
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:58,160
02123, 02123, easy to remember, or call 1617-LICK-OBE.

474
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,140
Lick OBE.

475
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,900
And now, Jim Morrison.

476
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,660
Recorded live in Miami, I believe the night that he got in a whole lot of trouble for whipping it out, if you know what I mean.

477
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:16,680


478
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,380
You're all a bunch of idiots!

479
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,140
How long are you gonna let them push you around?

480
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,840
You love it.

481
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,080
You're all a bunch of slaves.

482
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,660
A bunch of slaves.

483
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,580
What are you gonna do about it?

484
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,160
What are you gonna do about it?

485
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,040
What are you gonna do about it?

486
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,680
What are you gonna do about it?

487
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,980
What are you gonna do about it?

488
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,180
Hey, I'm not talking about no rebellion, Charles.

489
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,520
I'm not talking about no demonstration.

490
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm not talking about getting out in the street.

491
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm talking about having some fun.

492
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm talking about dancing.

493
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm talking about love your neighbor.

494
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,740
Tell it who.

495
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,500
I'm talking about grab your friend.

496
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,780
I'm talking about love.

497
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,680
Love.

498
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:15,900
Love.

499
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,760
Love.

500
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,600
Hey, listen.

501
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,840
Oh, no, Nick.

502
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,680
I need some love, you all.

503
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,560
Ain't nobody gonna love my ass.

504
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,300
Come on.

505
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,060
I need ya.

506
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,300
There's so many of you out there.

507
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Nobody's gonna love me, sweetheart.

508
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,420
Come on.

509
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,840
Hey, there's a bunch of people way back there that I didn't even notice.

510
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,800
Hey, I've got about 50 or 60 of you people.

511
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,660
Come up here and let me know.

512
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,440
I love my ass.

513
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:46,940
Come on.

514
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,260
Yeah.

515
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,760
I love ya.

516
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,700
Come on.

517
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,540
Amazing, dear friends.

518
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,620
Amazing.

519
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,100
Jim Morrison, the night he, the last time he got busted.

520
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,720
I think he fled the country after that.

521
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:12,800
That was sent to us by Yetis4Bob, who also sent a bizarre, well, the sampling virus barrage.

522
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,240
A sort of a sound effects-y thing.

523
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,420
We've been hearing earlier in the show, don't you see?

524
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:32,640
And it's time to go back to that other place on the other side of the world.

525
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,000
On the flip-flop, as they call it.

526
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,380
So, dear friends.

527
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,480
617-LICK-OBE.

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,540
Please make a note of it.

529
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,580
Are you guys gonna have the theremin?

530
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,140
Yeah.

531
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,880
Friends, you've got to see what I've seen tonight.

532
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,940
Tiny human beings answer a complex philosophical religious question.

533
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,880
Live on donuts, subs, pizza, you name it.

534
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,420
Chaz really does have a theremin here.

535
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,100
It's a pole attached to a box.

536
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,160
And when he puts his hand up near that pole, it goes...

537
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,620
He just wiggled.

538
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,000
He just stuck his hand out there and wiggled it.

539
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,640
It's just like magic.

540
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,720
And these little lightning bolts come off of it.

541
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,220
And the red light goes off.

542
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:15,220


543
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,700
And the rats run around on their little wheel in a cage.

544
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,220
And the little lightning bolts hit them and kill them.

545
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,220
And then Dave sections them.

546
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,520
And we pull out the perfect gene.

547
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,480
And it all comes around full circle again.

548
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,920
A little bit of St. Louis salad dipping sauce.

549
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,340
And we're just having a great old time down here.

550
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,440
In the parking lot.

551
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,740
With these hors d'oeuvres.

552
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,680
These little sectioned rats.

553
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,120
And this sour cream cheese here.

554
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,860
I forgot what I just did.

555
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,040
I pre-sectioned my throat and I barbecued my rat.

556
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,000
What?

557
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,940
And your rat is sure yummy.

558
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,400
I think it's better than your rat.

559
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,800
Thanks for amputating your rat.

560
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,680
Chopping it up and barbecuing it for us.

561
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,360
I don't know how you can live without it.

562
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,580
But I'm sure it sure is good.

563
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,860
Don't worry man. They just keep growing back.

564
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,360
Why do you think I throw a big spread like this if they didn't come back?

565
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,420
Dave's amputated and barbecued rat.

566
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,260
I just chopped one off and another one grows back.

567
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,320
See, you gotta put in a little bit of...

568
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,220
What you call it? Lemon.

569
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,940
And some olive oil and garlic.

570
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,540
And you let it sit in there for a while before you throw it on the grill.

571
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,580
And it gives you the real smacky, smacky, smacky mom vibes.

572
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,220
Look, there's a little pinky budding on the top.

573
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,860
And it's coming off his shoulder now.

574
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,760
Look, it's grown into a big bald rat.

575
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,800
Let's chop it off. Let's suction it.

576
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,860
And put it on the barbecue.

577
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,220
I think this one's gonna be a possum. Let it grow a little bit.

578
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,660
More good.

579
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,380
Extra tasty with winking lizard barbecue sauce.

580
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,640
Mmm mmm. Yummy.

581
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,300
I wouldn't use nothing else because I can't use nothing else.

582
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,780
Contractually I'm screwed.

583
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,540
This program brought to you by winking lizard barbecue sauce.

584
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,040
When the lizard stops winking...

585
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,180
You're in trouble.

586
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,720
Oh no, you're in trouble.

587
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,600
Something about dinking.

588
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,580
Dinking.

589
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,520
Licking and winking.

590
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,580
The licking and the winking went on and on.

591
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,660
And I went through the night licking and winking.

592
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,240
And I love to lick and winking.

593
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,800
Can't forget that the world went on.

594
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,580
Winking.

595
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,840
Barbecue boys are here again.

596
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,900
Barbecue boys are here.

597
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,080
The barbecue boys are here again.

598
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,580
The barbecue boys are here again.

599
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,280
Ha ha ha ha ha.

600
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,620
Ha ha ha ha ha.

601
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,160
Goodbye winking barbecue boys and girls.

602
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,060
I don't know what else to say to you but get the hell out of here.

603
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,320
I'll never invite you back.

604
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,840
And that stupid clown.

605
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm suing him.

606
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,780
We'll see you next week boys and girls.

607
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,180
This has been ESO radio.

608
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
Keep your head on tight.

609
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,220
Get back to your wind.

610
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,400
And the sack in the saddle.

611
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,080
Here's some more for you.

612
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,860
Music.

613
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,180
Music.

614
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,820
Music.

615
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,060
Music.

616
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,040
Music.

617
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,540
Music.

618
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:14,540


619
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,220
Music.

620
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,220


621
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,220


622
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,040
Music.

623
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,520
Music.

624
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,140
Music.

625
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,760
Music.

626
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,400
I've come to talk with you again

627
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,160
Because a vision softly creeping

628
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,080
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

629
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:50,000
And a vision that was planted in my brain

630
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,620
Still remains

631
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,700
Within the silence

632
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,240
Of silence

633
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,780
In restless dreams I walk alone

634
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,820
Narrow streets of cobblestone

635
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,860
Neath the halo of an ennui street lamp

636
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,800
I turn my collar to the cold and down

637
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,040
When my eyes are stabbed by the flash

638
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,360
Of a neon light

639
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,000
That splits the night

640
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,260
It's a dream

641
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,460
I've come to talk with you again

642
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,640
And a vision softly creeping

643
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:55,640


644
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:55,640


645
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:55,640


646
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:55,640


647
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,380
Of silence

648
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,320
In restless dreams I walk alone

649
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,840
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

650
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:11,840


651
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:11,840


652
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:11,940
It's a dream

653
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,220
That splits the night

654
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,120
It's a dream

655
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,600
In restless dreams I walk alone

656
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,100
Narrow streets of cobblestone

657
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

658
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:28,440


659
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,100
Still remains

660
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,340
Within the silence

661
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,340


662
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:42,540
In restless dreams I walk alone

663
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,240
Narrow streets of cobblestone

664
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,520
Neath the halo of an ennui street lamp

665
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,140
I turn my collar to the cold and down

666
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,200
And a vision that was planted in my brain

667
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,260
It's a dream

668
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,580
That splits the night

669
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,660
It's a dream

670
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,560
That splits the night

671
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,980
Fool said I, you do not know

672
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,520
Silence like a castle

673
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,960
Hear my words that I might teach you

674
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,940
Take my arms that I might reach you

675
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:04,460
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell

676
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,660
And echoed in the wells of silence

677
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,500
No more

678
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,200
Silence like a castle

679
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,220
Hear my words that I might teach you

680
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,540
Take my arms that I might reach you

681
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,180
Take my arms that I might reach you

682
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,320
And the people bowed and prayed

683
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,240
To the neon god they made

684
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,760
And the sun flashed out its warning

685
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,980
And the sun flashed out its warning

686
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,560
And the sun flashed out its warning

687
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,200
In the words it was for me

688
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,380
And the sun said the words of the prophets

689
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,740
Are written on subway walls

690
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,220
And tenement halls

691
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,260
And whispered in the sounds

692
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,200
And whispered in the sounds

693
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,180
And whispered in the sounds

694
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,800
Of silence

695
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,320
Silence

696
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,540
Silence

697
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,000
Silence

698
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,680
Silence

699
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,740
No, were we but the sea

700
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,900
Silence

701
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:01,760
Silence

702
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


703
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


704
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


705
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


706
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


707
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:01,760


708
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,300
Slap you silly.

709
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,900
Tear your shirt off.

710
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,280
Disconnect your phone.

711
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,740
Pull your hair out.

712
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,080
Give you a paper cut.

713
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,780
Spill your milk.

714
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,180
Bounce your checks.

715
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,420
Burn your dinner.

716
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,700
Hack your limbs off.

717
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,140
Scratch your records.

718
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,760
Bop you in the nose.

719
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,060
Slap you silly.

720
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Inject you with a lethal toxin.

721
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,400
Hide your car keys.

722
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,780
Publish your private diary.

723
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,000
Ring your doorbell.

724
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,380
Call your dog's silly name.

725
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,560
Dent your fender.

726
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,860
Rain on your parade.

727
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,960
Ruin the ozone.

728
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,180
Destroy your planet.

729
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,960
Ladies and gentlemen, live from Croydon, it's Bob Van Trapp.

730
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,920
Bob Van Trapp.

731
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,120
Sincerity on tap.

732
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,860
You know the wind may be blowing, sowing the seeds of despair.

733
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:56,780
But life is fair if you read the map of life that is on your lap.

734
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,460
Hey, don't cause a rumpus.

735
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,480
The compass is all you lack.

736
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,100
Jack.

737
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,240
I don't forget the jumbo jet I bought you for your birthday.

738
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,980
You crashed it on the first day that you flew it.

739
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,460
You blew it.

740
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,140
A jumbo jet flies overhead.

741
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,640
Twenty seconds later, 200 jets.

742
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,480
The people at the attack control were tuning in to the rock and roll.

743
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,440
That's right.

744
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,440
But get so very shy when I step up and say,

745
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:31,940
Hi!

746
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,080
They run a mile.

747
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,400
My smile is too much to bear.

748
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,800
People say, doobity doobity da da dee da.

749
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,780
That's OK.

750
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,160
Everybody knows it's crap.

751
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,140
They say, hey, here comes crap.

752
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,980
They know it's crap.

753
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,980
They say it's crap.

754
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,940
Bob Van Trapp.

755
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,420
Yeah.

756
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,180
They guys are the best.

757
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,700
Oh, yeah, there's a great city.

758
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,180
Very metro.

759
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,520
How old are they?

760
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:25,760
Nick, Rick just picked a controle Impianema and said let our bareback dude break into

761
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:25,760


762
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:25,760


763
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:25,760


764
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:25,940
Did he keep the foot off the viewfinder?

765
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,360
No I didn't.

766
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:26,980
Now listen.

767
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:26,980


768
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,400
Alright, Saturday, so what's the last thing again?

769
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:27,400


770
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,140
What if you can'tASANoSANoSANE!

771
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:37,460
or what, but we just heard, of course, Bob VanCrap. Here in the background, we're hearing

772
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:48,520
Les Anglais doing I Love Paris. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I guess I could do a take two,

773
00:41:48,520 --> 00:42:00,760
but Bob it all, Bob it all, Bob it all to hell. Hello, hello. Now, let's go on to the

774
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,920
next song up on this, number 11, Krista Hughes. My favorite things.

775
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,160
Shooting up smack, my needle marks look like rashes.

776
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,500
Cocaine, I'm a little bit of a faggot.

777
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,500


778
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:26,820
Clean up in my nose and eyelashes. Tattooed leather clad boys in leopard g-strings.

779
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:40,980
These are a few of my favorite things. Hot masturbation sessions with cucumbers and

780
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,740
cornettos. Black latex catsuits and thigh-high stilettos. Nipple clamps, vibrators,

781
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,500
and clitoris.

782
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,920
These are a few of my favorite things. Being tied up and gagged and whipped till I'm hurt

783
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,760
and making really stupid playsuit out of really stupid curtains. Drug-crazed sex orgies and

784
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:11,660
meaningless blings. These are a few of my favorite things. When the whip cracks.

785
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,960
Choo!

786
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,860
Gosh, that cat-a-nine.

787
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:18,700
Oh, my boy!

788
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:31,820
I'm comfortable and my fingers feel stings when I'm feeling bad. I sit and remember

789
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:37,400
my favorite things and then I don't feel so sad.

790
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,460
And I'm comfortable in公 from doctor coke. Eles son söz, luzo sin caso nos pecinossteros y

791
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


792
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


793
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,460


794
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,820
Pan writастьe y no nos molestes.

795
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:47,860
When the incredible su intimate Sulateli IRS,

796
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:48,440


797
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:48,500
him and his wife that I consider dear, I wonder,

798
00:43:48,500 --> 00:44:06,160
Somewhere on a faraway shore, a solitary chap was gazing into the distance, when suddenly, when suddenly, she emerged from the ocean.

799
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:22,860
Clad in a scanty bikini, I was entranced by this vision before me.

800
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:31,280
Overwhelmed by her beauty, then she drifted away.

801
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,300
I

802
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:47,980
tried in vain to warn her of the world war two minefield left abandoned before her.

803
00:44:49,760 --> 00:45:04,080
As if by a miracle, she passed over safely and continued her journey toward the freeway.

804
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,140
.

805
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,140


806
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,140


807
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,140


808
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,140


809
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:11,940
You must be here!

810
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,880
I have yet seen theacie behind that glass roof.

811
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,760
Far above, savoir- ultimately feel

812
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,080
at some pity to act against this perto gone cold water in my hand.

813
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,260
.

814
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,740
Narrowly missed her as the midday sun relentlessly bore down upon her

815
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:45,820
She succumbed to the humidity into the path

816
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,120
Of a runaway juggernaut

817
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:01,420
Leaping into action as the truck roared ever closer

818
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,520
I snatched her from the jaws of sudden death

819
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,920
The last thing I remember as I plunged into oblivion

820
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,820
Was her graceful death

821
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,480
Back to the ocean

822
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,900
I brought her back down into the ocean

823
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,780
And the watch had

824
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:02,780


825
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,020
The life she was in

826
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:03,080
The hours she lived in

827
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:03,200
And the time she sprouts

828
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,500
The one time her words disturbing me

829
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:10,900
wonder how I keep from going under. Outside it's crowded with people in a hurry. They bump into

830
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:16,240
each other without trying to say they're sorry. I struggle through the clouds to try to get a bump.

831
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:23,280
I cannot mount the step because it drives away too fast. At the underground I find out that the

832
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,200
escalator's folded so I hobble through a tunnel where the platform's always crowded.

833
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:36,660
So don't push me because I'm close to the edge. I'm trying not to lose my head. It's like a jungle

834
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:41,560
sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep from going under. It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me

835
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:47,000
wonder how I keep from going under.val�səuding Bo. It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me

836
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,640
wonder how I keep from going under. It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder how I keep

837
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,640
from going under. paycheck

838
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,640


839
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:54,640


840
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,940
The music has never been right...

841
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,900
It would be better if I stood up.

842
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:18,800
I try to sit down but there aren't any places, so I stare into silence at all the empty spaces.

843
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:29,280
A man jumps up and vents his eyes bloodshot and wild and a tired pregnant mother puts her arms around her child.

844
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,500
In the distance is a busker trying to sing the Beatles.

845
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,780
Out of tune he strums his way through all the lonely people.

846
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,280
On the streets the cars are screeching, the headlights try to blind me.

847
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,320
I can hear the sound of breathing.

848
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,120
There's someone close behind me.

849
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,780
I struggle to my left, fumbling at the door.

850
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,800
A dog barks by the bus stop and my keys fall on the floor.

851
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,000
It's all getting too much.

852
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,500
My mind is going hazy.

853
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,140
I can't think anymore.

854
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,380
I think I'm going crazy.

855
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,140
So don't push me because I'm close to the edge.

856
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,260
I'm trying not to lose my head.

857
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,880
It's like a jungle sometimes.

858
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,200
Makes me wonder how I keep from going under.

859
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,780
It's like a jungle sometimes.

860
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,100
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under.

861
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,380
It's like a jungle sometimes.

862
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,820
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under.

863
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,140
I'm barely an adult but I do think I'm a bit of a little grasshopper.

864
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,460
No, me neither!

865
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,460


866
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,460


867
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,460


868
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,460


869
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,460


870
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:18,460


871
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:24,720
On passing the frozen food section, I sensed a general uncoolity in the opposite direction.

872
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,640
There were four people, maybe 25.

873
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,940
They were getting into a bad groove job.

874
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,000
They were in the most unhip state.

875
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,580
And this argument was clearly past its expiry date.

876
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,740
Resolving to dissolve the situation, I stepped back and blew a cool vibration.

877
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,620
Now you've got to remember, there's one golden rule.

878
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,760
The golden rule is cool.

879
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,640
When your patience is shot and the temperature's hot, it's not.

880
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,540
It's cool.

881
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,620
It's cool.

882
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,660
It's cool.

883
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,080
Yeah, it's cool.

884
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,280
It's cool.

885
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,680
It's cool.

886
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,300
Hey, buddy, what are you waiting for? Christmas?

887
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,320
Get that car out of my face.

888
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,940
Behind the wheel of my stew machine, I was stuck in a very messy traffic scene.

889
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,060
Temperatures were hot, tempers were breaking, and my poor pet dog Afro was shaking.

890
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,940
Somebody's engine started leaping.

891
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,600
Before you knew it, the whole city was freaking.

892
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:47,900
I climbed on the rooftop of my classic 62 and I gave him some philosophy from Dr. Stew.

893
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,560
This is what I always say.

894
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,820
Now you've got to remember, there's one golden rule.

895
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,000
The golden rule is cool.

896
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,780
When your patience is shot and the temperature's hot, it's not.

897
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,660
It's cool.

898
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:08,380
It's cool.

899
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,520
It's cool.

900
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:09,780
Lay down.

901
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:11,520
It's cool.

902
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,600
Relax.

903
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,380
Chill.

904
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,240
Yo, chill, man.

905
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:17,920
It's cool.

906
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,440
It's cool.

907
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,300
Take it, clean hands.

908
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,940
I said, hero, you've got to remember, there's one golden rule.

909
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,460
The golden rule is cool.

910
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,360
When the patience is shot and the temperature's hot, it's not.

911
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,980
Hey, it's cool.

912
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:46,900
It's cool.

913
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,960
Yeah.

914
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,200
Oh.

915
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,680
Now that was cool.

916
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,000
Oh.

917
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,000


918
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,080
I'm willing to make that.

919
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,200
Want that clue?

920
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,800
I'm willing to make that.

921
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:14,780
Oh.

922
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,280
Oh, yes, dear friends.

923
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,580
Coolness, coolness, coolness from the Misfits.

924
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,140
Parlor Club Cabaret from the Misfits.

925
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,120
Unorthodox, underground, phenomenal, singular,

926
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,960
peculiar, outlandish, eccentric, fantastic,

927
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,560
unnatural, immoral, incredible, supernormal,

928
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,680
highly regular, beggars belief, boggles the mind,

929
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,880
ill-assorted, unfashionable, odd customers,

930
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,720
queer fishes, a rum lot.

931
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,900
The best show you've never seen.

932
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,120
And that's, yes, a CD from Tri-Age Records

933
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,640
at triage.wfmu.org.

934
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:04,100
It also describes, I suppose, the church of the subgenius

935
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,580
and you can write for free information

936
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,860
about everything else from that.

937
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,820
Yo, P.O. Box 1403.

938
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:14,480
Zero.

939
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,160
306 Dallas, Texas.

940
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,320
Once again, that's Box 140306.

941
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,140
Dallas, Texas.

942
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:27,780
7521.

943
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,360
A four.

944
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,880
Oh, thank you, thank you.

945
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.

946
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stop.

947
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,220
Look at, you know, I don't want to hear anything

948
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,760
about me being brain dead.

949
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,460
All of you.

950
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:43,800
Stop.

951
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:45,760
Barbecue.

952
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,460
All he means to make fun of me

953
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,700
is because you're,

954
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,400
then you guys don't feel like such dumbasses.

955
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,080
Stop.

956
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,660
Stop.

957
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,480
Now I'm going to be more like you.

958
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,560
Barbecue.

959
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,400
Okay, and now we're going to make a left on 11.

960
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,080
Yeah.

961
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:05,980
I was stranded on Route 4 down in Orlando, Bell, Florida.

962
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,780
And I'd eaten my filigreech and pig meat down there.

963
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,120
And I exposed my buttocks to a highway,

964
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,480
a highway patrol man one night under the influence of,

965
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:20,800
I think it was a trilithon combined with a bottle of Wild Irish.

966
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,980
And I spent four and a half weeks in the Duckville pond

967
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,740
eating fluorescent grits.

968
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,420
Gay, Amerasian, that squad for Christ.

969
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,660
We're the gay, Amerasian, that squad for Christ.

970
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,420
Baby boy rambles in a pop-up ride.

971
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,400
We can be pretty mean and we can be pretty nice.

972
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,100
We're the gay, Amerasian.

973
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,520
The dead squad for Christ.

974
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,060
Wait.

975
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,620
What woke me up was the blood dripping on my shoulder.

976
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,660
I thought all the rest of the screams and the gunfire and the chickens clucking.

977
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,320
I thought that was all part of it.

978
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,020
Ill dreams getting deeper and deeper.

979
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,800
But no, man.

980
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,900
I mean, he was dead already.

981
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,560
He was slumped over right next to me.

982
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:18,960
I didn't know.

983
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,820
My mouth was wide open.

984
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,300
Man, he ruined my new shirt before I was finally really awake.

985
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,800
I didn't know they were so serious up here in the hills.

986
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,360
I didn't know.

987
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,740
I didn't know what they were looking for.

988
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,140
I didn't know what they wanted me for.

989
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,840
I didn't know what I was doing here.

990
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:39,120
And now Pedro is dead.

991
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,820
The old lady was outside arguing with the guys.

992
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,380
I didn't know if they were guerrillas or if they were with the government, man.

993
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,480
They were in black uniforms.

994
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,540
And one guy did not look south of the border, man.

995
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,200
He was American.

996
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,360
He was a white guy.

997
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,100
I could see it right away, man.

998
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,920
He noticed as soon as he saw me, man.

999
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,160
I closed my eyes, man.

1000
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,440
I was just like, hey, man.

1001
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,800
I'm from, you know, what?

1002
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:01,760
Jersey.

1003
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,380
I was looking in that six-mile, man.

1004
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,300
I knew the company smell was all over this place.

1005
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,500
But then the guys came back and they started yelling at me to put my hands up in the air.

1006
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,040
Arriba, alabans.

1007
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:12,800
Arriba.

1008
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:12,960
Arriba.

1009
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:14,160
Arriba los marros.

1010
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,420
So I put my hands up in the air and walked out to the front of the bus, man.

1011
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,660
One guy was poking me in the back with that gun, you know.

1012
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,000
And I knew it was, oh, yeah.

1013
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,980
I knew it was, oh, yeah.

1014
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,820
I knew it was a gun.

1015
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:41,700
I knew it was a gun.

1016
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,220
I knew it was a gun.

1017
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:30,140
I knew it was a gun.

1018
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,780
I knew it was a gun.

1019
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:42,120
I knew it was a gun.
