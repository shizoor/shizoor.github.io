1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Don't you see?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,800
We're all participating in God's great experiment.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
This entire universe, not just our own galaxy,

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,400
but all the galaxies that stretch to the end of the heavens,

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,180
will provide one single data point for God.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,520
He, she, or it is searching for perfection,

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,680
for that small range of initial parameters which,

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,160
once the universe is set into motion by the transformation of energy into matter,

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,620
will evolve, over billions of years,

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,340
into one perfect harmony.

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,880
A testimony to the creator, Bob's, consummate skill.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,280
Science fiction, the literature of the imagination,

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,160
combined.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,020
Forces with radio, the theater of the mind,

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,940
to produce a full, rich harvest of exciting, thought-provoking drama.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,260
Yesterday's World of Tomorrow, available now, like vintage wine,

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,420
for your listening pleasure, on...

18
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,400
The Self Genius Hour of Slack!

19
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,980
www.theselfgeniushour.com

20
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,880
www.theselfgeniushour.com

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,180
So at this moment, there are countless other universes evolving,

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,640
each having been started by God, with different initial conditions.

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,120
And God has somehow slipped this church,

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,500
inside this particular evolutionary universe,

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:58,820
and created a unique form of Inside

26
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:58,820


27
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,120
A momentary process to acquire information.

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,760
And the purpose of all of this

29
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,640
is so that God can define some mathematical construct

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,240
associated with creation,

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,340
that will always produce a harmonious result!

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,960
What God is, and has been searching for,

33
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,840
is a very special, closed, dense set,

34
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,500
located on this mathematical hypersegment.

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:45,540
This special set he is seeking has the property that any of its elements, that is, any arrangement of conditions for the instant of creation chosen from within this set, will produce a universe that will eventually end in harmony.

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:03:00,920
A chaos confounds God as well. Chaos is an outgrowth of all the physical laws governing the evolution of any created universe. It prevents the accurate prediction of the outcomes of large-scale processes.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:10,440
So God cannot a priori simply calculate what is going to happen in the future and therefore by analytical techniques isolate the zones of harmony.

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,520
Experimentation is the only possible way.

39
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,540
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.

40
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:15,240
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.

41
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:45,520
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.

42
00:04:45,540 --> 00:05:15,060
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.

43
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:31,960
It is the only way for him to discover what he is seeking.

44
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,300
Chaos adds tension and relax and

45
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,300
It is the only way is about the

46
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,540
fourth dimension of the dots.

47
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,200
The fourth dimension люблю.

48
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,200


49
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
And to our awesome window of time.

50
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:15,520
From Badness's How to Be Going to As胡s and about the yeti's story of false words of rattles, although oops if you find these words useful, we'd like to thank you again, for supporting this meeting with the people involved and in writing the statement above.

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,600
Well, then you add time.

52
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,540
Because we may travel up, down, and sideways.

53
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,900
Time is four.

54
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,320
So if we were to look at ourselves from a...

55
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,160
We also travel through time.

56
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,920
Yeah, like if we were to lick the wisdom eye, like you guys were saying a little bit.

57
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,120
Lick the wisdom eye, yeah.

58
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,780
We could, you know, go back in time.

59
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,920
Man, that's one that'll catch you.

60
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,580
And look at it from outside the planet.

61
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,220
Well, if you walk Wittershins around the planet fast enough, like Superman did in the movie,

62
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,160
you can actually go backwards through time.

63
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,600
I think one of my friends are from the ninth dimension.

64
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,180
Why nine?

65
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,300
Excuse me?

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,020
Why nine?

67
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,640
I don't think you yet appreciate the scope of God's problem.

68
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,400
Only a minuscule fraction of all possible universes can end up harmonious.

69
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,680
The natural outcome of the transformation of energy into matter is a universe with no life at all.

70
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,280
Or at best,

71
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,480
aggressive, temporary living creatures who are more destructive than constructive.

72
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,900
Even a small region of harmony inside an evolving universe is a miracle.

73
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,960
That's why the whole enterprise is such a challenge for God.

74
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:42,820
What God is looking for is a universe which, before it dies in the big crunch, has achieved total harmony.

75
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,760
That's not just...

76
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,300
That's not just...

77
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,860
That's not just every living species from every world working together for the mutual good,

78
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,060
but every subatomic particle of his creation actively participating in that harmony.

79
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,840
For a while, I myself couldn't comprehend the full grandeur of this concept.

80
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,520
Then Bob told me about a species that makes living beings out of rock and dirt, as our biblical God did,

81
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,920
by transmuting and rearranging the elements.

82
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,120
Total harmony requires that advantage.

83
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:25,060
Advanced species like us use our technological tools to transform inanimate and non-living things into creatures that contribute to the harmony.

84
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:38,820
Going back to the original question, each of the clenches of the church is part of a hierarchical intelligence gathering information throughout this particular galaxy.

85
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,100
Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have a single superstation, which is the Milky Way.

86
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,100


87
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:45,100


88
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,240
The Milky Way is a superstation, which we call the Prime Bob, located somewhere near their center.

89
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,860
The set of Prime Bobs was created by God at the same moment the universe began,

90
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,700
and then was deployed to learn as much as possible about the evolutionary process.

91
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,960
The churches, the members, and the subgeniuses, and all the other engineering constructs you have seen,

92
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,440
were in turn designed by the Prime Bob.

93
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,080
The entire activity, including what has been called the Prime Bob, is designed by God.

94
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,080


95
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,080
The universe has been going on since the first church entered your solar system years ago,

96
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:27,420
has, as its objective, the development of quantitative criteria for use by the Creator

97
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,300
that will enable the subsequent universes to conclude in glorious harmony,

98
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,900
despite the chaotic tendencies of the natural laws.

99
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,060
The universe is a superstation, and the Prime Bob is a superstation.

100
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,060


101
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,060

sci-fi series.

104
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,140
It's about building your own

105
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,320
rocket ship and people who could build it

106
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,960
far better than we.

107
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
The background...

108
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,100
The background

109
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,060
music is by ESO

110
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,520
from the upcoming CD

111
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,600
Space Trance 1.

112
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,960
And friends, this is Hour of Slack number

113
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,480
696.

114
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Seems like that'd be kind of an evil

115
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,540
number, doesn't it to you?

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,600
And

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,960
but yes,

118
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,760
who cares whether it's evil or good?

119
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,180
Because friends, this is a faith-healing

120
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,980
radio broadcast from

121
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,800
right here in the city of Bob,

122
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,040
Dallas, Texas. Bob, damn this

123
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,860
foul place.

124
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,900
Bob, ignore Dallas and concentrate

125
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,060
on my stock market rivals,

126
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,780
would you?

127
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh.

128
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,000
Friends, I must get off.

129
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,540
Sometimes I'm glad the Earth

130
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,040
world didn't end.

131
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,500
And last

132
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,020
X-Day drill.

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
Other times that I wish

134
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,180
I was on the saucers like

135
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,080
Bob promised.

136
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,800
And I was kind of...

137
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,860
I've got to give this Hour of Slack out quick

138
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,620
because I'm working on the XX Day video

139
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,960
and there's so many things that have to be done

140
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,180
and then I remembered

141
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,480
what?

142
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,920
The CDs! I've been cranking out this whole

143
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,600
new series of subgenius CDs

144
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,740
and why not just play some of that, huh?

145
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,380
Instead of this ESO...

146
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,520
What is that all about?

147
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,780
I don't sell ESO CDs, but how about

148
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,000
let's just grab a sample

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,100
song here off of

150
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,000
Bob's

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
punctured eardrum CD.

152
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,800
What shall we...

153
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,820
How about this classic old

154
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,520
hymn, I Wanna Die

155
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,560
for Bob

156
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,780
number 14 on the CD?

157
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,420
Ah, yes.

158
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,760
I Wanna Die for Bob.

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,520
Please Bob,

160
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,540
you must kill me.

161
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,200
I wanna die for Bob.

162
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,600
I wanna die

163
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,340
and hold me whole

164
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,820
and thrill the big boys

165
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,600
and the nobles.

166
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,660
If we have to,

167
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,440
if we have to

168
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,740
Bob can make them die

169
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,900
and we'll all

170
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,020
come back.

171
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


172
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


173
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


174
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


175
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,380
Older men will all

176
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,740
come back.

177
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,100
Older men will all

178
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,380
come back.

179
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,920
Older men

180
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,960
all know the reason

181
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,900
why.

182
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,720
You think I've got another

183
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,360
kid?

184
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,960
Praise Bob.

185
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,960
Kill me, Bob.

186
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,920
I wanna die

187
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,780
for Bob.

188
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,800
I wanna die

189
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,700
and ask the Holy Lord.

190
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,580
You see Bob,

191
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,580


192
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,580


193
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,700
for your ownaku Ee-eewů

194
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,180
count cuts on your

195
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,180


196
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
We've gone busy

197
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,820
with the

198
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,820


199
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,820


200
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,820


201
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,820


202
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:22,900
like a fox

203
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,020
by carrying

204
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,020


205
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,580
ourço

206
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:25,840
ourço

207
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:25,840


208
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,060
out of a

209
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,200
plat daring

210
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,560
and watching

211
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,980
All lives, gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades

212
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,180
And we'll all come back over men

213
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,620
We'll all come back over men

214
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,000
We'll all come back over men

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,080
In victory parades

216
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,560
Ah, yes, friends, that grand old song.

217
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,080
Ah, yes, the subgenius, the first...

218
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,800
Not this, crew catcher.

219
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,820
Ah, yes, friends, this classic, old and new Bob Songs collection.

220
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,740
It's called Bob's Punctured Eardrum.

221
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,920
And we'll have information on our information and so forth later on in the broadcast.

222
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,140
And, friends, we do have all manner of...

223
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,800
unlikely and likely tapes and materials.

224
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,080
I'm going to continue with the incredible reports from Dos Equis XX Day,

225
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,320
the second failed end of the world.

226
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,520
We like to look at it actually as our fifth drill for the end of the world.

227
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,280
By the time the world ends, friends, we're going to be the most prepared,

228
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,220
the most prepared cult members this lonely, distraught planet has ever seen.

229
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,040
And we're going to leave it and not love it.

230
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,640
We're just going to leave it and shove it, friends.

231
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,540
Oh, sorry.

232
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,520
Sometimes it makes me...

233
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,320
It makes me mad.

234
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,860
It makes me want to just urinate, you know?

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
And that's a sign that the conspiracy's ripping you off.

236
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,260
If you ever...

237
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,300
Next time you have to do that, urinate,

238
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,320
take that as a sign that you're being ripped off by the conspiracy.

239
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,760
They are getting you, friends.

240
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,580
Before I go any further, I wonder if I should read from this little...

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
Okay, I've got to set this up.

242
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,360
Friends, you're going to like this.

243
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,760
This is a lot of fun.

244
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,400
God, I sound...

245
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,940
Just like one of those conspiracy...

246
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,800
God, I listen to conspiracy radio, friends, while I'm cooking or whatever.

247
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,080
And...

248
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh, God!

249
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh, the smarm!

250
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,100
The sheer, relentless, endless smarm!

251
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh, oh, oh!

252
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,340
Oh!

253
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,660
Anyway, last week...

254
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,880
Well, actually, today was supposed to be the end of the world.

255
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,300
August 11th.

256
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,020
There was an eclipse that was going to destroy the entire planet.

257
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,740
Nobody in America noticed it,

258
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,640
because we weren't really going to be able to see the eclipse here.

259
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,000
But...

260
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,760
Our friends in Brazil, this Brazilian magazine,

261
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,460
they were all upset about the end of the world,

262
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,500
and they interviewed me about it by email.

263
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,220
They asked me some questions, and I emailed the thing back.

264
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,980
And the other day, they're...

265
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,240
Issue came out on the internet with this interview with me.

266
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,860
It translated into Brazilian, or Portuguese.

267
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,080
And our good brother...

268
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,520
I copied that off the web and thought, well, this is great.

269
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,480
You can see, you know, Bob's name every now and then.

270
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,300
But I thought, wouldn't it be fun to translate this back into English again

271
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,580
and see how close it was?

272
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,180
Well, praise brother RevbroVT,

273
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,280
who, incidentally, also translates every hour,

274
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,520
every hour of Slack show that you hear,

275
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,520
into real audio for internet broadcast,

276
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,740
which is a kind of a time-consuming

277
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,500
and bandwidth-consuming job.

278
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,320
And thank you, RevbroVT,

279
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,140
from everyone here in the...

280
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,520
Anyway, he translated...

281
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:29,040
He translated the Brazilian article about Church of the Subgenius

282
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,260
back into English using a...

283
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,780
computer translator,

284
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,940
Alta Vista's Babelfish.

285
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,520
And here are some choice excerpts.

286
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,640
Well, I'm going to get to the very first,

287
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,140
the best one of all,

288
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,640
is the motto of our church.

289
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,720
That if she injures,

290
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,880
if they do not find nothing funny.

291
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,300
You know, our old...

292
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,680
Bob's motto,

293
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,020
let them mount up upon themselves

294
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,980
if they can't see the humor of it,

295
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,860
or them,

296
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,960
if they can't take a joke, right?

297
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,260
That if she injures,

298
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,540
if they do not find nothing funny.

299
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,940
This is the only rule of our church,

300
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,080
it quotes me as saying.

301
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,440
Anyway,

302
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,400
Subgenius.

303
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,980
The Subgenius is spelled

304
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,380
S-U-B-G-J-N-I-O-S.

305
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,280
Think about that again, friends.

306
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,340
S-U-B-G-J-N-I-O-S.

307
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,500
Subgenius.

308
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,900
The salvation has its price.

309
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,700
Established in the Texas

310
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,980
in the middle of the past decade,

311
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,240
the church of the Subgenius

312
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
cannot be most trustworthy,

313
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,060
but at least the internet is amused of all.

314
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,020
According to its adepts,

315
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,740
the world is to the side of chaos,

316
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,440
and only Bob Dobbs,

317
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,640
a salesman of insurances

318
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,440
who had an illumination spiritual

319
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,940
in years 60,

320
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,740
and became a species of messiahs,

321
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,260
can be a messiah.

322
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,040
And in saving them,

323
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,500
with a site in the network,

324
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,220
www.subgenius.com,

325
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,780
a publishing company,

326
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,520
one radio program,

327
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,900
and a Bem-Aziatada division

328
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,020
of merchandising,

329
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,020
that it sells until mugs of coffee

330
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,240
with the face of Dobbs,

331
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,680
the Subgenius could not be of

332
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,720
or of a so palpitante substance

333
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,160
how much this.

334
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,440
Of its QG in the Texas,

335
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,180
the reverendo Ivan Stang,

336
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,660
that's me,

337
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,200
spokesman of the church,

338
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,880
today said,

339
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,780
exclusiveness to the network

340
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,000
of computer science,

341
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,700
today said,

342
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,940
with exclusiveness,

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,420
oh dear,

344
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:46,940
to the network,

345
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,600
excuse me folks,

346
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,180
I'm trying to,

347
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,520
I wanted to put on some,

348
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,440
some sort of background music here.

349
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,480
Hold on,

350
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,880
oh there,

351
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,620
that's much better.

352
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,700
With exclusiveness

353
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,400
to the notebook of computer science,

354
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,840
which of the Subgenius,

355
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,300
with relation to the end,

356
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,380
and the expectations eclipse of the world,

357
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,120
they only draw chinfra of the figure.

358
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,640
First question,

359
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,940
how are the Subgenius

360
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,960
are preparing for the end of the world?

361
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,980
And I, my reply is,

362
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,100
our master, Bob Dobbs,

363
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,080
foresaw that the world went to finish

364
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,340
in 5 of July of 1998,

365
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,980
I should do this in my real accent,

366
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,940
and we in prepare them for this,

367
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,820
for about 20 years,

368
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,000
sinning of all the ways that we could imagine.

369
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,000
The problem was that the world did not finish,

370
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,380
and Dobbs foresaw that it would finish again

371
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,100
in the following year in 5 of July.

372
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
It did not finish,

373
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,120
and it seems now that it's said

374
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,320
that of 2,000 people do not pass.

375
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,320
All end of world,

376
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,620
we organize the festival X day drill.

377
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,960
As of the year that comes as third,

378
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,920
it will be XXX day drill.

379
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,260
Note, XXX,

380
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,860
it is the sorting that the North Americans use

381
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,400
to identify,

382
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,480
we must live and transfer to one's last,

383
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:05,820
to become

384
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:30,140
sentinel psychod As a trial for extreme fifty,

385
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,780
owej trouble,

386
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:30,800
be bueno,

387
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:38,940
worse of the one that he is does not go to be same and he says well what do you

388
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,440
find that goes to happen in the end of the world and I said he who to order

389
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:51,520
$30 for the Church of the subgenie Nios goes to try the ecstasy Eterno already

390
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,740
the infidels will be fried by the ray laser of flying disks of the final

391
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:05,180
judgment amen the interviewer says a what Bob Dobbs has to say on this and I

392
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:10,980
quoted him that if she injures if they do not find nothing funny that's the only

393
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,840
rule of our church and he says what what he says what will you be doing on the

394
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
day 11 of August and I said I go be of I in the stock market exchange buying

395
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,420
actions of companies who sell kits of survival and dehydrated food

396
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,720
you

397
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:33,340
boys you to get away from that being a

398
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,000
yes you said that before just because they had known

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,400
where the book is called under well at least in history

400
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:51,380
you and that me why I do it have input of biblical

401
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,340
rythme that

402
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,880
in devenir

403
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,720
whitlington

404
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,140
going to go to places where the eclipse is happening and tell them that if they don't

405
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:08,480
give us gold, Bob will eat the sun. And he says, how do you advise us to dress in the

406
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,060
hour of the end of the world? She is necessary to be the character or it gives to wait the

407
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:21,860
end of the world alone of underwear and stockings? And I said, seen of the skill that to want.

408
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,000
It only takes care so that when the world will be finishing, its underwears are in the

409
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,520
certain place. So all will be well if the planet will not be reached by no asteroid

410
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,780
or be attacked by foreigners or aliens or dominated for the Antichrist. People give

411
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:50,000
a skill to finish with it for we ourselves. In other words, if we don't, who cares if

412
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,840
the aliens destroy the planet?

413
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,520
Or the asteroids? People will be perfectly capable of destroying the earth themselves.

414
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,340
Thank you.

415
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:06,560
And I think one of my friends are from the ninth dimension. Why nine? Why ninth? Because

416
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,660
he's not good enough to be from the tenth. Oh, you know, we're only as fast as our slowest

417
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,320
man. You guys talking at the same time slow. No, you got to stop smoking so much pot. I

418
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,640
know. Really? It's not such a bad thing. Go ahead.

419
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,240
You can't throw up a pot of coffee. Go brew some coffee.

420
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,560
It's probably better for you to smoke.

421
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,980
And smoke it if you want.

422
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,180
Yeah, you can smoke some coffee.

423
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:36,020
The coffee drinks the pot of foul water. That big porcelain throne is full of water. It's

424
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,120
a pot full of water.

425
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,840
You have to turn your computer down.

426
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,220
Yeah, turn your computer down. Unless you bought the brand new George Forskine sandwich

427
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,300
brewer in a cup, it makes a perfect sandwich in a cup every time with just a little bit

428
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,380
of thermal water and pickles and cheese, whatever you want, throw in there. It comes out the

429
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,840
other end like a sandwich.

430
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:51,840


431
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:51,840


432
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,580
It's like a deli sandwich. It also stops your computer from all...

433
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:55,780
Hello?

434
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,480
Yeah.

435
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,700
Whatever.

436
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,660
I can't believe it.

437
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,960
They were doing it to it.

438
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,640
They were having inter...

439
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,160
Yeah.

440
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,460
They were having coitus with their computers.

441
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,580
Man, you can't kill them tonight. Did you ever step on them? They just keep running.

442
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,440
They're like little bugs.

443
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,920
I stepped on that one three times. It just kept running around, man.

444
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,060
Oh, and if you think they're dead and you watch them for a while, they'll sort of pull

445
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,740
all their entrails back in stuff, man, and sew it all up and fly.

446
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,020
They fly away.

447
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,100
Well, that's what I did once.

448
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,620
Just as if they've never been squished.

449
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,400
I hit one with a hammer, and the little bits were all over the kitchen floor, and I sat

450
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,960
there long enough. You have to sit there really long and quiet.

451
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,160
For hours sometimes.

452
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,660
Yeah, and turn the fan off because you don't want your scent. If they get a whiff of your

453
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,880
scent, then they won't do this.

454
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,800
Stocking bugs.

455
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,380
Yeah. And then they just sort of come together little by little.

456
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,560


457
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,400
The little dots start reassembling, moving towards each other.

458
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:46,560
Yeah, they're starting...

459
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,720
If they've got one extremity that can move or push, they'll slow down.

460
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,600
Slowly put themselves right back in the game.

461
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,100
This is ESO, recorded live at XX Day 1999.

462
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,780
Friends, I think some of you have a sickness tonight. I don't know what it might be, but

463
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,700
if you are prepared, you can do it.

464
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,780
And to come forward, I will lay my hands on you. I'm fully licensed by the state of

465
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:31,580
New Jersey, Nevada, New York, and now Pennsylvania, to not only heal, but sicken you. But I refuse

466
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,380
to talk about it.

467
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:41,400
If your God is really bad, it's the only one you have. You want to take away the pain,

468
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:51,580
or go a-walking in the rain. Watch the flowers go to bed, or ask the man inside the head,

469
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:51,680
or ask the man inside the house.

470
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:51,680


471
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:51,680


472
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:51,680


473
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,320
If you're scared, never have to leave. All you gotta do is believe.

474
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:18,720
There is a calcium in the land, friends, or perhaps it's a lack of calcium. No, that's...

475
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,300
There's a great cancer in the land. That's what it is.

476
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm not saying that there's a cancer in the land. I'm saying that there's a great cancer

477
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:21,680


478
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:28,580
in the land, and that is infesting a cancer that infests not only you, the subgenic, but

479
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,720
also pinks and people of other different hues. For instance, the purple. We all know this

480
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,600
evacuated polybius crew is fully and completely and totally un-infested.

481
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:50,240
All you gotta do is dream. Your body's gonna start to feel. Finger drifts and holding fire.

482
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,900
Everlasting sweet desire. If you're mad at what the doctor say,

483
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,020
leave a man to steal away. Miracles, they come for you.

484
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,440
And miracles, they come for you.

485
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:32,200
Can I put my hands on you? Can I put my hands on you?

486
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:46,140
They say that Jesus Christ came and lived among men, but I think Jesus Christ came and lived among women.

487
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,680
Or perhaps a nice, beautiful, young, but noble monkey. Thirteen years old, beautiful, but noble monkey.

488
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,960
Little red hair, kind of a cute little buck-toothed smile, little squiggly pink daughter hair.

489
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,860
I didn't think Jesus was capable of loving another human!

490
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,040
I don't know why I love this. It's a pain to be loved like this!

491
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,440
You can make you understand. All you gotta do is take his hand.

492
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,120
Remember what someone said. Ask the man inside the head.

493
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,580
Finger drifts and holding fire.

494
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,920
Everlasting sweet desire.

495
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:49,680
Can I put my hands on you? Can I put my hands on you?

496
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,180
So they say judgment is coming.

497
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,480
What I prefer to think, a fiery form of flatulence is coming.

498
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,220
Or perhaps an incarnate vision of the Buddha with his eyes crossed.

499
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,460
That's what I'm looking for, friends.

500
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,680
Or a woman with a very large, very large...

501
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,140
Can I put my hands on you?

502
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,780
Can I put my hands on you?

503
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,100
Can I put my hands on you?

504
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,280
I sing in colors.

505
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,040
My mother is God.

506
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,720
My father is God.

507
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:49,360
My brothers, my sisters, all are God.

508
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,460
God to the right. God to the left.

509
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,240
God overhead.

510
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,480
Christ, encounter of the fourth kind.

511
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,180
But now I know I haveANA.

512
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:41,520
O tear it, O handful of cracks.

513
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:41,560


514
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,160
What a great day.

515
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,360
I like a happy reunion in a heartbreak.

516
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,740
God Sabrina passengers from saliva clearly.

517
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,180
I walk on my bare feet.

518
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,340
That's how many times I cry.

519
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,740
Frederick

520
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,280
Thorndahl

521
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,680
this is Frederick Thorndahl

522
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,800
this is Frederick Thorndahl

523
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,100
this is a CD

524
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,500
called Soul

525
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,040
Nodger Within

526
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,140
and this is Glass Madness

527
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,600
oh no it's not

528
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,100
it's

529
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,680
Referee Don

530
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,420
Shroopy

531
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,320
the end times

532
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,400
are near but there's

533
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,100
nothing to fear

534
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,580
if you

535
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,980
just send us a

536
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,760
dollar

537
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,640
get ready

538
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,940
get set

539
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,900
prepare for

540
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,820
the launch of the

541
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,920
bleeding head

542
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,720
of a

543
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,480
ball

544
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,920
remember

545
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,940
the motto

546
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,720
perform the

547
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,680
salute

548
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,280
slack off and

549
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,640
study the

550
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,460
pamphlets

551
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,580
and if you

552
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,060
should falter

553
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,620
then look to the sky

554
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,440
cause Bob's

555
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,660
always so

556
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,100
clear

557
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,920
nearby

558
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,540
there's a pipe

559
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,980
in the sky

560
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,060
and I'll

561
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,480
follow

562
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,100
you

563
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,100
anywhere

564
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,740
through the

565
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,320
sun

566
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,880
page

567
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,160
of

568
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,560
the

569
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,260
day

570
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,200
through

571
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,160
American

572
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,760
time

573
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,460
there's

574
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,180
a pipe

575
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,060
in the

576
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,680
sky

577
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,140
and we

578
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,640
can do it

579
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:46,860
it's a

580
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,140
great idea

581
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,860
it's a great idea

582
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,260
it's a great idea

583
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,360
it's a great idea

584
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,600
to be a saint

585
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,620
in the church

586
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,660
of the subgenius

587
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,600
I mean she's like

588
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,520
the perfect

589
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:54,880
woman

590
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,980
she's a

591
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
sex pot

592
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,560
obviously

593
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,220
I mean a really

594
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,780
sexy gal

595
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,100
smart

596
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,220
go get her

597
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,660
but most of all

598
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,560
she has managed

599
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,360
to destroy

600
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,880
two

601
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
count them

602
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,620
two sides

603
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,380
of the conspiracy

604
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,120
at once

605
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,500
by doing

606
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,160
nothing more

607
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,320
than following

608
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
her own path

609
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,660
of least resistance

610
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,080
right

611
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,640
and she's

612
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,100
I know that

613
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,420
when things

614
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:17,920
get hard

615
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,300
she's

616
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,200
she's really

617
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,960
really tough

618
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,220
when

619
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,700
she knows

620
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,000
how to

621
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,320
let's not

622
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,300
dwell on that

623
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,140
on the

624
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,820
linguistic

625
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,780
content

626
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,680
of that whole

627
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,980
routine there

628
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,340
Claude

629
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,460
okay well I just

630
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,000
want to say that

631
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,280
you know when

632
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,040
times are hard

633
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,600
she knows how

634
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,160
to pull through

635
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,740
I don't know

636
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,280
what I'm saying

637
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,660
but anyway

638
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,260
yeah

639
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,080
so

640
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,880
I mean I know

641
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,460
that she feels

642
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:41,900
like she's been

643
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,480
shafted

644
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,280
I think

645
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,140
you know

646
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,580
obviously

647
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,440
every year

648
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,260
the conspiracy

649
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,100
tries to

650
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,160
try some new

651
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,080
ploy to distract

652
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,700
humanity

653
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,720
from the fact

654
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,280
that judgment

655
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,260
is on the way

656
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:52,600
right

657
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,060
that they are

658
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:53,540
going to be

659
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:53,940
punished

660
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,380
for their

661
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,020
slacklessness

662
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,840
and their

663
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,280
inability

664
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,940
to even

665
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,560
comprehend

666
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,220
what Bob's

667
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:58,540
selling

668
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,380
them

669
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,820
so

670
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,980
you know

671
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,400
every year

672
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,800
we see

673
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,620
movies like

674
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,180
what was

675
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,180
Independence Day

676
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,700
in which

677
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,700
which came out

678
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,960
on July 5th

679
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,880
just like

680
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,420
Bob's

681
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,000
end of the world

682
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,420
prophecy

683
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,200
only

684
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,680
the humans

685
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,020
beat the aliens

686
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,280
using America

687
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,720
online

688
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,280
and then

689
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,320
what men in black

690
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
the next year

691
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,240
and then the next year

692
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,780
what was that

693
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,280
asteroid

694
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,480
or you know

695
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,620
Armageddon

696
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,480
Armageddon

697
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,120
one of those

698
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,140
it got to the point

699
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,780
where I didn't even

700
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,700
watch them

701
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,800
as the end of the world

702
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,980
becomes closer and closer

703
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,640
they'll come out

704
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,480
with one of those movies

705
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,160
every month

706
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,100
and then every week

707
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,600
and every minute

708
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,280
and finally

709
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,080
the big Hollywood movie

710
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,020
will say the exact

711
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,540
same thing

712
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,420
that Bob's been saying

713
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:40,900
all along

714
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,480
and then it'll

715
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,120
really happen

716
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,660
and at that point

717
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,100
all those

718
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,940
disbelieving

719
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,540
pinks and

720
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,000
corporate

721
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,840
sellout

722
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,540
Barbies and

723
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,960
cans

724
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,740
humans

725
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,800
meat

726
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,880
food tubes

727
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,080
blind

728
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,840
earth

729
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,280
peg-legged

730
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,160
three-dimensional

731
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,680
people

732
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,160
will suddenly

733
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,640
look up

734
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:57,820
and go

735
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,000
what

736
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,880
can I

737
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,160
blew it

738
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,540
because I was

739
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:01,820
so

740
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,740
because I chose

741
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,160
to believe

742
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:03,720
the conspiracy

743
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,320
media

744
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,660
instead of

745
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,800
Clyde Lewis's

746
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,740
talk show

747
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,360
hmm

748
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,480
I think that

749
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,520
in 6,000 years

750
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,660
I think this whole thing

751
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,580
with the 6,000 years

752
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,080
is there

753
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
to test us

754
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,800
because of the fact

755
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,680
that by that time

756
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,960
Bob will be

757
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,880
a huge

758
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,440
huge

759
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,460
um

760
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,520
deity

761
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,020
in the realm of deities

762
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,100
if he isn't already

763
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,700
there's no time

764
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,280
for all fallacy

765
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,760
when he ate

766
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,780
the cunt's

767
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,840
beer of candies

768
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,560
but for the most part

769
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,500
he won't let you down

770
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,880
when you find yourself

771
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,940
dressed for time

772
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,260
just shove and bob

773
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,840
and your mind

774
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,160
will unlock

775
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,400
cause you have

776
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,760
a piece of the rock

777
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
there's a pipe

778
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,820
in the sky

779
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,300
there's a pipe

780
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,660
in the sky

781
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,400
and I'll follow

782
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,260
with any way

783
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,140
through the sun

784
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,100
which will

785
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,700
fly

786
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,860
through the sun

787
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,080
and the sea

788
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,520
and the moon

789
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,540
through the

790
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,240
the wrecking

791
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,900
tide

792
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,420
through the wrecking

793
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,200
tide

794
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,400
there's a

795
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,700
life in this

796
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,220
oh hey

797
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,180
won't somebody

798
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,340
please help me

799
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,920
easy, easy

800
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,420
my lad

801
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:28,860
come to

802
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,220
dexterity like this

803
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,980
my wee native

804
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,660
compendium

805
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,360
Mohammeet

806
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,520
used to praise

807
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,240
me with a bean of ties

808
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,500
his froggy little body

809
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,620
a quiver at my loins

810
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,400
chanting a line

811
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,040
of Egyptian

812
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:39,920
holograms

813
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,000
what?

814
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,740
uh diaphragms

815
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,540
I used to date

816
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:43,680
a

817
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,120
no no no

818
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,020
hieroglyphs

819
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,440
that's it

820
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,120
do you remember any?

821
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,000
will they help

822
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,060
anything at all?

823
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,320
of course

824
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,320


825
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,060
it was a jackal-headed

826
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,720
woman with her eyes

827
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,240
akimbo

828
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,260
a king seated

829
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,600
sideways on his throne

830
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,400
a drip of gold

831
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,980
a chippin nose

832
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,260
uplifted thusly

833
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,580
all engraved

834
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,060
on a pyramid

835
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,040
of massive size

836
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,880
with the body

837
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,380
of a lion

838
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,840
the paws that refresh

839
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
a tale told by an idiot

840
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,060
and the head of a fox

841
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,820
that pyramid

842
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,760
is opening

843
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,800
which one?

844
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,620
the one with the

845
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,980
ever-widening hole in it

846
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,420
oh no

847
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,520
don't do that son

848
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,980
the doors are dirty

849
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,420
in there

850
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,580

851
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,500

come and poke your eye out

853
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,440
wait till your father

854
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,060

855
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm going in mom

856
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,300

857
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,500

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:43,520

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:43,720

oh look it's dirty

879
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,840
somebody's already used it

880
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,140
there's a name on it

881
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,940
that's all right

882
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,080
well I couldn't get you

883
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,360
to believe my name is

884
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,020
Mr and Mrs. John Smith

885
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,780
could I?

886
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,040
well of course you could

887
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,380
it's nice to have you with us

888
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,680
Mr and Mrs. Smith

889
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,420
Front

890
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,900
hey aren't you

891
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,340
Mr and Mrs. John Smith

892
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,500
Maytown, USA?

893
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,480
I'm Joe Boyden

894
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,340
this here's Ed

895
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,760
back now

896
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,500
oh boy

897
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


898
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


899
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


900
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


901
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


902
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


903
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,500


904
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,880
I'm not really Mr. and Mrs. John Smith

905
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,980
oh that's okay

906
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,220
I'm not Joe

907
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,200
but he's not Ed

908
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,920
hey Bill

909
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,240
suddenly I heard a door

910
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,540
squeak open behind me

911
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,440
strange

912
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,900
I don't have a door

913
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,380
and they repossessed the squeak

914
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,980
only one man had the gall

915
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,740
to carry his own sound effects

916
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,480
I'm not Joe

917
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


918
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


919
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


920
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


921
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


922
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


923
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


924
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


925
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


926
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


927
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:43,480


928
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,460
is that gall I smell?

929
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,300
it's oil of anchovy, Dengar

930
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,640
have a tin

931
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,540
so Rocky Rococo

932
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,860
we meet again

933
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,680
no we met again last week

934
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,520
this is now

935
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,560
metaphysics gives me a headache, Rococo

936
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,880
open the tin, Dengar

937
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,400
there's a prize inside

938
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,240
anchovies

939
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,200
unroll the green one

940
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,220
half a fin

941
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,540
howdy, Abe

942
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,060
been a long time since you've seen

943
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,720
an honest man, eh, Dengar?

944
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,480
and the other one?

945
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:13,780
the other half

946
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,000
is waiting for you

947
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,080
at the end of the job

948
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,400
yeah?

949
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,740
what do I have to do?

950
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,680
nothing

951
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,180
nothing?

952
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,820
I'm not kidding

953
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,200
just file yourself under inactive

954
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,860
and remember I wasn't here

955
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,700
you never saw me

956
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,700
what a pleasant thought

957
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,100
I hate you, Dengar

958
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,080
can it, Rococo

959
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,760
and you can take your smelly little friends with you

960
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,440
you got anchovies all over my sharkskin suit

961
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,980
hey, looking good

962
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,480
I'm sorry, Dengar

963
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,940
wait till the hookers catch me on the boulevard

964
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,000
Nick Danger Third Eye is brought to you today by Vino Brothers

965
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,660
I have the fire that kills

966
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,060
I have the fire that kills

967
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,240
looking for the answer

968
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
look to the sky

969
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,500
looking for the answer

970
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,680
look to the sky

971
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,760
looking for the answer

972
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,980
look to the sky

973
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,020
looking for the answer

974
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,160
look to the sky

975
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,440
looking for the answer

976
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,800
look to the sky

977
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,480
there you go

978
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,120
the world ends

979
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,920
the world ends

980
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:11,920


981
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,200
and you may die

982
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,600
and in fact that's being very optimistic

983
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,720
you in fact will die

984
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,700
that's one of Bob's predictions

985
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,960
that definitely will come true

986
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,380
and the point is

987
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,500
okay, the world ends tomorrow

988
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,340
and it very well might

989
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,700
you never know

990
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,360
it might end just for you

991
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,700
have you been

992
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,080
have you lived today

993
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,620
as if this was your last day on earth?

994
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,360
or

995
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,960
probably not

996
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,260
or

997
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,460
alternately

998
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,900
have you lived today

999
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:44,980
as if

1000
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,400
you could live forever

1001
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,560
and had all the time in the world

1002
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,020
because if you aren't doing either one of those

1003
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,240
you're wasting all that time

1004
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,460
blowing it off

1005
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,880
go for everything or else blow it all

1006
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,220
and but

1007
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,620
live like there's no tomorrow

1008
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,740
or that there is only tomorrow

1009
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,180
but

1010
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,100
we don't care

1011
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,980
unlike other religions

1012
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,040
we're not trying to save your soul

1013
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,640
we would like to get your money

1014
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,700
and we'll save your soul as a side effect of that

1015
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,060
and that there's no problem

1016
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,920
but who cares whether the world ends?

1017
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,120
friends, we're religious nuts

1018
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,500
are we subgeniuses

1019
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,640
gonna let the Jehovah's Witnesses out kook us?

1020
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,080
I think not!

1021
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,740
nay!

1022
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,980
I don't care if I have to come to this campground

1023
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,380
and wait for the world to end

1024
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,640
every damn July 5th

1025
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,200
for the next

1026
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,660
800,000 years

1027
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,120
until the year 8661

1028
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,980
which happens to be 1998 turned upside down

1029
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,040
and that may have been the

1030
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,760
and sure

1031
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,320
are we afraid to look like a bunch of superstitious idiots?

1032
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,440
friends

1033
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,220
as I understand it

1034
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,420
reality itself

1035
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,120
is one big superstition

1036
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,580
that's been the point of half of these

1037
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,540
big mouth shamans

1038
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,460
and philosophers

1039
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,520
and so forth

1040
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,520
all along

1041
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,820
and you know

1042
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,880
let those who want to scoff

1043
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,040
go ahead and scoff

1044
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,200
be backsliders

1045
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,820
putting that knife in Bob Dobbs' back

1046
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,220
and just twisting it!

1047
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,800
alright we have to pause here

1048
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,200
for a brief message

1049
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,080
and we'll be back in a moment

1050
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,640
listen

1051
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,460
listen

1052
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:35,140
a new Admiral Stereo is precision engineered

1053
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,400
to free you from stereo

1054
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,880
so that no matter where you sit

1055
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,540
a twist of the balance indicator knob

1056
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,840
always adjusts the sound smack dab in the center

1057
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,980
the acoustic result of the finest custom components

1058
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,520
all perfectly matched and balanced

1059
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,140
so that you get full frequency range

1060
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,480
smack dab in the center

1061
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,360
for sounds like this

1062
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,100
and speaking of jokes

1063
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,160
I heard this funny joke the other day

1064
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,860
about the Y2K bug

1065
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,360
it was this

1066
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,580
it went kinda like

1067
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,000
hey did you hear that the dark ages

1068
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,280
were started by the Y1K bug

1069
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,000
ha ha ha

1070
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,020
well that was a funny joke when I first heard it

1071
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,400
but really

1072
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,140
if you look into the history of it friends

1073
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,200
the dark ages

1074
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,360
were really started

1075
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,160
by the Y0K bug

1076
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,450
and we don't have anything against it

1077
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,530
it's not really the Y0K bug's fault

1078
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,010
I mean

1079
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,050
you know we don't have anything against insects in this church

1080
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,270
in fact some of us are insect sexuals

1081
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,910
we're into bug porn

1082
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,530
and friends to us the Y2K bug is just more bug porn

1083
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,290
but the pincoots are running around like a bunch of ninnies

1084
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,970
threatening their precious false slap device

1085
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,930
they're all gonna get shut down

1086
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:08,770
crash out

1087
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,010
and fail to reboot

1088
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,430
in the year 2000

1089
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,410
they should be so goddamn lucky my friends

1090
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,170
oh they want the end of the world so bad

1091
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,950
I'm afraid that what's really gonna happen on January 1st

1092
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,610
some gas pump in Idaho won't work

1093
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,930
and 150 white supremacists will kill each other fighting over it

1094
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:31,590
until somebody plugs it in

1095
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,950
oh but they want the end of the world

1096
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,170
they're musking for the end of the world friends

1097
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,070
because of course when it happens

1098
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:42,310
they get saved

1099
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:44,850
and it proves that all the rest of us were dumbasses

1100
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,150
isn't it nice that we aren't like that?

1101
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,850
yeah

1102
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,450
but it doesn't matter friends because we're outta here

1103
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,170
we're outta here before the Y2K bug

1104
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,310
we're outta here on the Y1.9999

1105
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,510
bug friends

1106
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,270
that's what Bob really did

1107
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,930
before any of those bugs

1108
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,850
and now the YKs arrive

1109
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,850
we're KY'd up

1110
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,790
we're gonna slide home free

1111
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,490
day after tomorrow

1112
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,470
we're gonna slide home free baby

1113
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:16,050
on the X next night

1114
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,150
X Y Z

1115
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,430
X year zero

1116
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,410
ah yes

1117
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,710
spread Y for the final ride

1118
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:28,790
because the Xs are coming friends

1119
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,910
and you are too

1120
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,470
they didn't take us seriously last time

1121
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,710
hell half a U didn't take us seriously

1122
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,910
didn't take Dobbs prophecy seriously

1123
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,690
but this time we've learned our lesson

1124
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,330
we can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space

1125
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,350
we can't even rely on Bob

1126
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,570
we have to learn how to escape earth

1127
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:53,850
without being dependent on the conspiracy

1128
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,650
or any extra terrestrials or salesmen

1129
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,270
sure send in your 30 bucks but

1130
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,790
build your own ship

1131
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:04,690
you may not be able to do it

1132
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,210
you may not have through

1133
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,670
but just recover your ass

1134
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,930
build your own ship

1135
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,710
even better go buy hangar engineers

1136
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,270
area 51 or Cape Canaveral

1137
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,810
or studio 54

1138
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,930
and steal your own ship

1139
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,190
ah yes

1140
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,910
and scrape your own fuel

1141
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,710
hang on I gotta put my glasses on because

1142
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:30,050
do you think Bob even has a skull left

1143
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,930
after so many drill marks and pointy things going in there

1144
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:34,430
well I won't cause him some pain

1145
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,190
but start alright

1146
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,730
a חwide

1147
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:48,950
some other town

1148
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:52,410
where in town

1149
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:54,330
or what I hear

1150
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:57,470
he'll never know

1151
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:02,690
claimed to make his sons

1152
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,690
서�

1153
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:05,810
Is that what we're going to do?

1154
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:10,350
Bob has no feelings, and we know that because we've experienced that for the last three years.

1155
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:17,030
You can't have any sort of sympathy for humanity at all to have jived so consistently and so brutally.

1156
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:21,370
He has great love, vast love, which he expresses physically.

1157
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,350
I think it's half that.

1158
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,270
Ah, it's Friday.

1159
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,970
I was here, and then the fog took me away.

1160
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,650
Don't hit me.

1161
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:34,030
Friday's child.

1162
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,330
Right.

1163
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,710
He's twice as bad, twice as naughty.

1164
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,710
Is that indeed the Doc Mojo on the other line there?

1165
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,190
Well, who the hell do you think he would be?

1166
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:46,350
I don't think anybody would start talking explosives except for you and me.

1167
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,770
Hey, we've got another one here.

1168
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:49,570
Let's see who's there.

1169
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,370
I got it down now.

1170
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,710
No one, I didn't lose anyone.

1171
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,170
Hello?

1172
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:54,070
Hello.

1173
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,010
Hello.

1174
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:55,810
Hello.

1175
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,510
Sounds like it's coming from the audience.

1176
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,490
Yeah, she's cute.

1177
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,970
Hello.

1178
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,310
Hello.

1179
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:03,230
Yeah, there's a picture on the Internet of her dressed in.

1180
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:06,610
I waste all my money on pot, as you insulted me before.

1181
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,050
Oh, wait, you don't have a computer?

1182
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:08,510
No.

1183
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:10,350
Oh, you're not allowed to listen to the show.

1184
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,090
Oh, don't say that.

1185
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,350
No, no, that's a lie.

1186
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:13,910
He's being mean because...

1187
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,310
In eighth grade?

1188
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,570
We use the computers to double the potency of the pot.

1189
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,370
Oh.

1190
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:20,110
Yeah.

1191
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,610
Have you ever had coyotes with a computer, buddy?

1192
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,970
They smoke the fop, and then they smoke...

1193
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,070
Return it back into your head.

1194
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:28,270
They convert back into antimatter?

1195
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:30,150
Yes, yes, they do.

1196
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,510
You smoke fat, man.

1197
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,250
Yeah, so...

1198
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,910
You smoke the stuff that runs out of your nose.

1199
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,710
Get somewhere that...

1200
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,350
Antimatter to us.

1201
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,190
Antimatter.

1202
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,330
He's battling on like a baby again.

1203
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,990
We've been doing that for billions of years.

1204
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:40,890
Tell us something new.

1205
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:43,070
Really, antimatter is no...

1206
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,010
It's nothing to us.

1207
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:44,970
Where'd the girl go?

1208
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,010
What about panty matter?

1209
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,110
He cares about...

1210
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,010
Where'd the girl...

1211
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:49,050
Where'd that girl go?

1212
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:51,070
Pantymatter, that's what got him thinking.

1213
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:51,350
Pantymatter.

1214
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,750
Pantymatter is what got him going.

1215
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,390
No, it's the pantymatter.

1216
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:59,550
Gerbil discovered that pantymatter is as a recursive time stream

1217
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:03,290
by which it is constantly existing and expusing

1218
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,390
from itself, of itself.

1219
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,070
Into itself.

1220
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,530
Into itself.

1221
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:08,330
Past the wall light.

1222
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,530
Into the rocket butt.

1223
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,790
Well, you see, the pantymatter neutrinos have no mass,

1224
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:16,230
and that has a lot to say about the fate of the universe.

1225
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:18,570
It's going to implode a lot sooner than we were counting on.

1226
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,610
And it's going to implode into someone's cervix

1227
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,170
if we don't get those panties down.

1228
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,350
And I just feel so good.

1229
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,810
Ma'am, that's exactly what you're counting on, isn't it?

1230
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:31,330
Well, if you're the kind of person who likes to scratch your fingernails

1231
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:33,210
against the blackboard, I suppose it is.

1232
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:33,930
Yeah.

1233
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,630
Imagine that.

1234
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,170
Antimatter panties.

1235
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:36,950
That was a great man.

1236
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,890
The entire universe is imploding into your cervix.

1237
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:39,630
There's got to be a reason.

1238
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,730
Antimatter panties.

1239
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:44,030
I remember those guys, but the one guy died from heroin O.D.,

1240
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:46,790
and the other guy tried to jump on the third whale of the subway,

1241
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,230
and I don't know what happened.

1242
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,130
He imploded or something?

1243
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,270
Oh, that was a long time ago.

1244
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,270
Wasn't that when you lived in New York, we came and visited?

1245
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,430
The guitar player was swallowed by a whale.

1246
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:55,770
Yeah, it was the guitar player that got swallowed.

1247
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:56,990
Was swallowed by a whale, yeah.

1248
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,670
A whale or something.

1249
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,530
A Levian thing.

1250
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,450
He had written in the subway, Leviathan or something like that,

1251
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,150
and they found him out in New York Harbor.

1252
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,910
He'd been chewed by a whale.

1253
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:09,310
They cut open one of those orcas, and inside its stomach was that guitar player.

1254
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,550
Oh, I didn't know that.

1255
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,150
I thought they just found parts of him.

1256
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,310
He was a guitar god.

1257
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,870
But any guitar player who dies that way has got to be the greatest.

1258
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,810
But why is he any better than the other guy?

1259
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,890
He died cooler.

1260
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,510
And the panty matters.

1261
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:27,130
That dictates talent of guitar players is how cool you die.

1262
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,270
Whales cannot wear panties.

1263
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,510
But what about the guy that died from an H.O.D. and stuff?

1264
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,050
Whales will be.

1265
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,270
You know, he was a sensitive artist and stuff like that.

1266
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:35,990
He'd taken up I&J.

1267
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,270
Friday, you could answer this question.

1268
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,550
The nasal flute was probably never really tuned for that kind of ear.

1269
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,930
What is your question, Melvin?

1270
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:47,490
Well, ever since I was a little boy, I liked stories about mermaids.

1271
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:52,210
Because mermaids were always depicted as being pretty girls from the waist up

1272
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:58,050
who didn't wear shirts and had their hair covering their breasts.

1273
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,490
And, well, what I always wanted to know is,

1274
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:08,970
did you have to scale them to, you know, to have your...

1275
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:09,270
To know them.

1276
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,370
Yeah, to...

1277
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:14,330
No, they have, rather like a fish or a frog, they have a cloaca.

1278
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:15,650
A cloaca?

1279
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:16,210
Yeah.

1280
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:17,490
What the hell's that?

1281
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,710
It's a quarter-inch thick neoprene condiment.

1282
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,710
It works just fine.

1283
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:22,130
Yeah.

1284
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:23,750
Oh, that's what a cloaca is?

1285
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,350
It's a quarter-inch thick neoprene condiment.

1286
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,970
Could you cut yourself?

1287
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,970
If she got to thrashing around, I say she, what...

1288
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,050
With the scales, right?

1289
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,690
That comes with the vacuum cleaner.

1290
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:34,950
No, it doesn't.

1291
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,070
The scales get smaller around the edges.

1292
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,950
Does that come with the vacuum cleaner attachment?

1293
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,790
Oh, so they're smoother around the...

1294
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,650
Yeah, it's smooth.

1295
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,310
It's like a whale blow.

1296
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,650
Oh, you can hook that right up to the ports in that case.

1297
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,110
Oh, well, in that case, whoa!

1298
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,530
Yeah, you can hook it up to the decompression port, Dave.

1299
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,890
Yeah.

1300
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,190
No wonder my appliances are talking to me.

1301
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:54,830
But don't put in the rocket butt.

1302
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:56,110
No, when you're in your spaceship...

1303
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,410
A mermaid with rocket butt would probably be a terrifying demon, uber demon,

1304
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:01,850
who would destroy the sea.

1305
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:02,890
And the stars would be in the sky themselves.

1306
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:04,050
All at once.

1307
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,350
So you're talking about an actual egg-sant mermaid...

1308
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:07,370
And it would burn bad.

1309
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,510
...which can crash its fins and has a portable attachment for doing the floors?

1310
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:11,670
It would really hurt when you peed.

1311
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,730
Yeah, it hurts a lot when you pee.

1312
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:14,290
What the hell are you talking about?

1313
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,550
What, you pee these things out?

1314
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:16,510
We don't...

1315
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:16,930
Hello?

1316
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,170
Oh, Arden.

1317
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,610
Who's here?

1318
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,950
It's amazing how these things can start growing through.

1319
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:21,010
Who's this?

1320
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:21,470
Avon calling.

1321
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:24,210
Go ahead, ding-dong lady.

1322
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,310
Give us a pie in the face.

1323
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:28,430
Oh, we gotta get the solar image, today's solar image up on the screen.

1324
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,810
The sun is kind of like falling apart.

1325
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:31,310
Last week...

1326
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,370
You're watching it.

1327
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:37,990
Well, yeah, last week we thought the sun was being eaten up from inside out by black holes.

1328
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:47,250
Last week we thought that the world was going to end, friends, but I think everything will

1329
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,390
be okay after all.

1330
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:55,510
Somehow or another, I just discovered that the main tape deck that I'm working on has

1331
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,030
just lost its...

1332
00:54:57,850 --> 00:54:58,950
God, don't...

1333
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,550
Don't...

1334
00:54:59,550 --> 00:54:59,990
Don't...

1335
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:01,950
Don't...

1336
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:02,690
It's not supposed to be singing?

1337
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,350
That's ESO live at X-day.

1338
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:06,990
What I meant to put in here was...

1339
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:10,590
Well, anyway, friends, I wanted to give credit for what all...

1340
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:19,550
All what we've been listening to, and of course, what we just heard was some ESO radio, Einstein's

1341
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:30,310
secret orchestra, Swamp Radio, live on the phone at WCSB in beautiful Cleveland, and,

1342
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,410
which is on every Thursday night.

1343
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:44,230
And you can also hear it on the Internet from www.wcsb.org.

1344
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,050
You can also, well, we've been playing tons of ESO tonight.

1345
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,970
Where's my little list here?

1346
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,750
ESO is in the background.

1347
00:55:52,750 --> 00:56:04,930
We also heard Einstein Secret Orchestra backing up me at the XX Day Devival just a month ago in July.

1348
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,050
That was the preaching with music.

1349
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:11,850
We heard a little bit of clips before that from the Bran Flakes

1350
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:19,310
and also a tiny clip from something Susie the Flusie put together, various religion-oriented things.

1351
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:22,590
There was a recording of yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

1352
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:22,730
and I'm sure you'll be able to hear it.

1353
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,470
It's Starwood and Einstein Secret Music.

1354
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:31,230
We heard two versions of the Firesign Theater.

1355
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:40,750
We heard the Firesign Clones, which is a group in Ohio doing covers of the old Firesign Theater album,

1356
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,410
a really old one,

1357
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:52,050
and the actual real Firesign Theater doing a fairly recent album called The Three Faces of Al.

1358
00:56:52,050 --> 00:57:00,890
We also heard a clip from Clyde Lewis's Ground Zero radio show out of Salt Lake City, Utah.

1359
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,690
It's a great show about conspiracies.

1360
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,970
That's also on the internet, Clyde Lewis.

1361
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:15,670
The song Hymn 999, or Pipe in the Sky, is by G. Don Truby,

1362
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:22,030
and I think I mentioned it was Frederick Thordendal at the very, very beginning of the half-hour.

1363
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:29,390
Friends, you've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack,

00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:21,050
Oh, yes, and, uh...

1372
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:24,690
I'm going to go back to playing our new CD.

1373
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:30,530
This is from Bob's Punctured Eardrum, the new CD,

1374
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:36,710
and I'm not even sure which one I want to put on except to take us out of here, except this.

1375
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:40,790
ESO.

1418
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,110
Universal Force

1419
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,950
Galaxy's a number in a billion

1420
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,750
They're all there for you

1421
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:35,630
If you're the boss to see it through

1422
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:42,830
And light the fire of truth

1423
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:51,370
Will you ever let go to your instinct for no bone

1424
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,930
Will you wander through the wilderness afar

1425
00:59:54,930 --> 01:00:01,110
You escape on the day July 5th soon

1426
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,750
Will you wander through the wilderness afar

1427
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,590
Will you wander through the wilderness afar

1428
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,810
Will you wander through the wilderness afar

1429
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,430
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

1430
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:19,210
Will you wander through the wilderness above?

1431
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,530
5,000 years in incubation.

1432
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,490
All kind of panty weight.

1433
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,610
Anti-panty matter.

1434
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,770
Who's your guys?

1435
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:35,370
You know what I mean?

1436
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,630
I mean, just think of your average god or archon deity.

1437
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:38,790
Just can't hold...

1438
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:39,690
Oh, listen to Dave.

1439
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:40,690
He's talking real big.

1440
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:43,850
Well, I mean, I don't want to be, you know, getting a car accident on the way home or

1441
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,950
nothing like that there, but, you know, just what have they done lately for me?

1442
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:47,650
Or you?

1443
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,070
Or anybody?

1444
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,830
I mean, just think of your average deity.

1445
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,370
We'll take the one we got right now.

1446
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:57,570
God has given me unto my enemies, and has taken my enemies and bound them before me

1447
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,470
and handed me a whip.

1448
01:00:58,690 --> 01:00:59,210
Oh, man.

1449
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:01,490
Oh, well, see, now that would be a very...

1450
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,630
And I have enjoyed myself.

1451
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,550
Okay, good job.

1452
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:13,250
And Steve's a-comin'!

1453
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:16,830
And the pigs are...
