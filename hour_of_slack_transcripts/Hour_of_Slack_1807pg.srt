1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,600
Bob

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Bob

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,240
Bob

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,460
Bob

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,860
Bob

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:16,920
Bob

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:16,940
Bob

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,040
Bob

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,520
Bob

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,300
What we've got here is a failure to communicate.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,120
The subgenius powerhouse.

12
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,320
I don't like it any more than you, man.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,320
My CPE is intact.

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,520
Thank you, LeMire.

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,100
This episode is another one of those perverted group marriages of young, old, and in between.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,680
From Hour of Slack number 88,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,280
we hear from

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,720
the young 1987 puzzling evidence,

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,960
Paul Mavridis, Dr. Hal, Ivan Stang, Pope Sternodocs,

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,940
St. Viren Werner, and Dr. Philodrummond.

21
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,040
We hear those selfsame early apostles as doddering old codgers

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,640
in an excerpt from Sandy Boone's fine documentary film about the Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,220
In between, from the future year of 2000,

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,880
we hear the middle-aged Stang, that's me,

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,960
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith,

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,500
back before the wars and the diseases and the deaths

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,660
when we were all ever so happy-go-slacky

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,020
at ESO's Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,680
There's not much music, but what there is,

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,220
is the Rudi Schwartz Project and Shemiki,

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,080
Shemikiya Copeland.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,700
The music in the background is CyberChump from this moment of perfect happiness.

33
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,240
And now, back in time.

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,620
I'm gonna start all over again.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,500
I've got to start this damn show all over again.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,200
God, I'm so sick and tired of having to start this stupid show

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,960
over and over and over again.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,640
This show never seems to go anywhere.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,020
It's nothing but an endless beginning.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,880
A thousand beginning sequences, it seems like.

41
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,260
Ugh.

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,020
Oh, yes, dear friends.

43
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,260
You're listening to the Ivan Stang Theme by Nino Rota,

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
by way of Snakefinger.

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,320
We got some, a whole bunch of stuff from Ralph Records.

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,940
Oh, praise Bob.

47
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,340
The wonderful Reverend Sheena over there at Ralph Records

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,660
has converted to Bob and to the Hour of Slack,

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,000
and so I've got an infinite supply of all the stuff that's coming up.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,260
All the material from Ralph Records.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,540
And I'll be playing some of the new, oh, a little bit of new residents,

52
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,300
new negative land,

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,740
and Snakefinger.

54
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,920
But, but you know those things pale in comparison to that

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,400
which has been sanctified by Bob.

56
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,180
Because, dear friends, which came first, really?

57
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,800
The mistake or the excuse?

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,860
You know, the astounding power of the human mind

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,220
is nowhere better illustrated than in its ability

60
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,280
to rationalize its own mistakes.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,780
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,120
It can devise wonderful machines and soaring concertos.

63
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,240
But those wilt, dear friends, besides the inventiveness of its excuses.

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,860
After all, must we not survive before we can afford to indulge in such pleasantries?

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
As culture and science?

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,240
The alcoholic, for instance, or the yogi,

67
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,120
or any cult member or subgenius,

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,160
by intuitively recognizing this, can bypass it.

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,600
And even in that, find excuses to bypass survival itself.

70
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes, alcohol or Bob, in other words,

71
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,380
can be more seductive than life itself.

72
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,880
Ah, yes, praise Bob.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,140
This is your friend, Reverend Ivan Stack,

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,840
and you're listening to The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,620
Oh, yes.

76
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:09,020
And you're listening to The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

77
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:17,100
And you're listening to The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
Oh, yes.

79
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,560
The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Oh, yes.

81
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,780
Oh, yes.

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,520
The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

84
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,100
Oh, yes.

85
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,620
The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

86
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh, yes.

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,600
The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

88
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,980
Oh, yes.

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:54,540
The Hour of Slack on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

90
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,460
were really just sub-genius.

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,900
And in my head, everything fell together like a puzzle box,

92
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,180
a Rubik's Cube that suddenly formed itself.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,440
A weird fringe cult for weirdos, specifically for weirdos.

94
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,400
That was the church of the sub-genius.

95
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,460
When we did the first pamphlet,

96
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,100
it was really a labor of love, the pasting up, the cutting.

97
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,160
We tied together every fringe belief you could think of.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,480
It was like getting all your toys, your dinosaur toys,

99
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,600
and your army men toys, and your cowboy and Indian toys,

100
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,300
putting them all together on the floor,

101
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,480
and having this whole world that was a conglomerate of all the cool stuff ever.

102
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,240
It was so much fun!

103
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,700
We had this sort of an icon we could blame everything on,

104
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
the conspiracy of normalcy.

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,060
There's Bob, the conspiracy,

106
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,940
and Slack.

107
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,520
You know, if you're gonna have a cult,

108
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,140
you have to have a cult leader.

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,820
Well, that's Bob.

110
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,140
We needed to put a face to that entity.

111
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,060
We can't afford artwork.

112
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,700
No, there's clip art, the public domain stuff.

113
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,500
It's old, nobody cares about it.

114
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,940
As we flipped through the catalog, there was that face.

115
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,520
We both instantly knew, that's Bob.

116
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,260
After a couple of months,

117
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,440
we had assembled a group of people,

118
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,500
and we assembled Subgenius Pamphlet number one.

119
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,760
When the printing bill came in on the first pamphlet,

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,780
it was $60!

121
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,420
My wife got very upset with that.

122
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,880
You're gonna have to send these to publishers.

123
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,240
We can't afford that kind of thing.

124
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,580
You need to try to turn it into a book or something.

125
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,700
Publishers, wow, okay.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,920
I got Writer's Digest, and got the addresses of every publisher in the United States,

127
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,420
and mailed the pamphlet.

128
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:52,840
I got a pamphlet to them.

129
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,240
We got 150 rejection slips back.

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,140
The rest of them didn't say anything.

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,360
I was living in San Francisco,

132
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,980
working with my comic partner, Gilbert Shelton, at Ripoff Press.

133
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,920
I wandered into the publisher's office,

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,180
and I saw a fellow named Fred.

135
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,080
He opened some envelope up and pulled out the initial pamphlet.

136
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
He grumbled something about it,

137
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,900
and threw it in the trash can next to his desk.

138
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,720
To his complete irritation,

139
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,000
I pulled it out and just started laughing at it.

140
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,580
It's the funniest thing I've ever read.

141
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,720
It was kind of like, how refreshing.

142
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,960
I think my first act was to get an envelope,

143
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,400
and put all the cash I had in my wallet in it,

144
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,340
and wrote a note saying, send me more pamphlets.

145
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,140
The first pamphlet, pamphlet number one,

146
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,580
is a significant document in many ways.

147
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,740
It is the vector by which many people have had their most significant introduction

148
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,020
to the Church of the Subgenius.

149
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,140
Doug sent the pamphlet to KPFA,

150
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,920
and so I saw that and really loved it.

151
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,880
And for years, since I was a kid,

152
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I've been putting stuff in the mail to strangers.

153
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,720
So they became new strangers.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,700
They start mailing stuff back.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,380
It was like the internet, really,

156
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,640
but instead of a thousand people,

157
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,860
it was ten or fifteen of us.

158
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,940
It was really fun.

159
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,140
It was such a seminal little pamphlet.

160
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,000
It was almost like a test of your mindset.

161
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Like, were you a subgenius or not?

162
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,300
If you got it, you were a subgenius.

163
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,260
It really spoke to me.

164
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,860
It had this whole thing about how the goal is slack,

165
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,880
and the motto is,

166
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,440
if they can't take a joke.

167
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,960
The central doctrine, more than anything else in the Church of the Subgenius,

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,800
of course, is this slack thing.

169
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,500
It's probably one of the hardest things to describe in the Church, you know.

170
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,100
We don't describe it,

171
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,860
because by definition, slack is really different for each person.

172
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,080
Slack is what everybody wants.

173
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,060
It's what we still want.

174
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,000
This idea of, you know,

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
a place where people can live,

176
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,240
where they don't feel harried by just the multiple things

177
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,780
that one feels harried by all the time.

178
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,680
You know when you don't have it, that's for sure.

179
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,100
It was like finding like-minded people,

180
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,520
if you could truly say any of us had minds to be alike.

181
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,200
You know, somebody with the same type of cynical perspective,

182
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,980
same reference points.

183
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,900
They were so layered in everything.

184
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,020
It was part pop culture,

185
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,400
part science, part religion.

186
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,360
So it appealed to me a great deal,

187
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,540
and I did do just as it said,

188
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,460
I sent a dollar with the letter.

189
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,640
What's that say, send a dollar?

190
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,220
Even I've got a dollar, so I sent off a dollar,

191
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,060
and I got this little pamphlet,

192
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,460
and that was where the crushing loneliness started to get chipped away.

193
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,480
I was doing a magazine called Famous Potatoes,

194
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,700
using a lot of ads and clip art stuff,

195
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,000
and it was a fine artist,

196
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,760
Robert Williams, who said,

197
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,600
hey, you ought to send some stuff off

198
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,480
to the Church of the Subgenius.

199
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,120
They're doing a bunch of clip art stuff like you do.

200
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,060
So I sent stuff off, and I think it arrived

201
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,300
just after Stang's birthday or something,

202
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,880
and he just flipped out over the famous potatoes,

203
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,860
and he sent me all the pack, you know,

204
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,760
and I didn't have to pay.

205
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,680
There was a flyer on a phone poll that said,

206
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,000
get ready for a pretty tough future.

207
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,000
What scientists are afraid to tell you

208
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,040
is that you're going to be the next

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,040


210
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,040


211
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,740
and I got a little bit of a picture of Bob.

212
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,140
I showed it to all my pals,

213
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,620
and they were just like, yeah, yeah.

214
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
So we didn't send him a dollar.

215
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,580
We sent him $100 from Little Rock.

216
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,540
And we got the first pamphlet back.

217
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,060
That just bobbed us all up immediately.

218
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,260
It was a little bit of a sense

219
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,460
that there are other people interested in these things.

220
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,240
They might be far away,

221
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,120
and they might exist from post office box

222
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,340
to post office box, but they are out there.

223
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,060
It was intoxicating to think that there was somewhere

224
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,900
where you didn't have to fit in,

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,700
where people were crazy in the good way.

226
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,920
So I sent him my 10 bucks,

227
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,020
and I became a subgenius.

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,780
We got the first few orders coming in.

229
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,460
Remember, we were so excited,

230
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,680
and then all of a sudden...

231
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,960
Well, terrified, more like it.

232
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,020
It was like, what, somebody actually sent us $10?

233
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
Now we have to do that new stuff.

234
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Now we actually had to start working and doing stuff.

235
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,160
From PR News in Washington,

236
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,760
I'm making final preparations

237
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,000
just hours before the start of PR's historic Trump

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,120
of the Trump being Trump-tested so far.

239
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,720
The Trump is hoping to help the greasy dead bodies

240
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,700
of migrants who have drowned at sea.

241
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,880
But the European Union says it's dishonest and weak.

242
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,900
Experts say the Trump or the Trump or also the Trump

243
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,160
is looking for his PR News Washington.

244
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,460
Sanctioned.

245
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,400
Trump requires cooperation, not PR News.

246
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,040
Critics fear this could severely and fairly disrupt people's PR News.

247
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,280
But there are concerns about a large-scale burger testing lab

248
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,940
that's hostile to PR News in Amsterdam.

249
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,640
Health officials in Democratic Republic of Congo say this is PR.

250
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,600
They also confirm 38 infections.

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,640
...to the US, as well as round-the-clock radio messages

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,060
to the American population, urging them,

253
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,160
to overthrow the evil robber barons

254
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,820
who have seized power in this bloodless coup.

255
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,700
Presidential appointee George W. Bush showed little understanding

256
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,480
of the gravity of the situation after UN sanctions were explained to him.

257
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,080
If they don't like it, maybe they should look for a new home

258
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,740
for their organization, he reportedly said.

259
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,340
Sanctions are scheduled to begin immediately.

260
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,920
What kind of flavor sanction are we going to be having?

261
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,880
Ugh.

262
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, that is...

263
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,420
That's not only disturbing, but it's also very, uh,

264
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,780
I don't know, kind of exhilarating to think that, um,

265
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,900
we might be liberated by UN troops who...

266
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,860
Yeah, yeah, I guess, uh...

267
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,280
...come to restore, uh, Martian law.

268
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Right, the Nicaraguans and Colombians and so forth

269
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,660
will be sending police keeping, uh, peace keeping troops here too.

270
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,440
I hope the drug lord sends some, uh, send a few squads,

271
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,360
or squab...

272
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,420
Squat teams.

273
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,580
Squat teams.

274
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,460
That's all you can think about, isn't it, Dave?

275
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,760
Squatting or teams?

276
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Boats. Teeing and squatting and stuff.

277
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,540
Excellent.

278
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,940
All I can think about is, like, riding around in a boat with a bunch of girls.

279
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,640
But that's, that's, um, that almost got me into an accident on the way here.

280
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,320
I saw some home movies of you skiing behind a boatload of girls.

281
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah, but that...

282
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,480
They were all laughing at you and you had no skis.

283
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,880
See, I was an extra. Remember the island of Dr. Moreau?

284
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,800
Not the ones, you said there were three, like, major classics and a couple rip-offs?

285
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,080
No, two classics and one terrible rip-off.

286
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,100
Well, this was kind of like an island of Dr. Moreau thing, except for there,

287
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,800
there were all these, like, sexed-up babes who had lived near a nuclear plant.

288
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,640
And I had to, like, ski on a power plant and stuff.

289
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,520
And my testosterone was somehow quanti- quanticized with it, too.

290
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,540
And I had to water ski, like, endlessly, like, for hours and hours and hours around the same little puddle.

291
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,720
I could, I'd seen everything before a thousand times.

292
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,940
I heard they made you do that.

293
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,000
And, uh, I got no pay. You know, your usual chicken sandwich bidet and your so forth that you get, you know, as your offerings for having done your doo-doo.

294
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,060
You just, um, I didn't make anything off of it.

295
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,640
Not even a concept that made sense.

296
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,260
And still don't.

297
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,920
But if you can imagine a bunch of, like, female werewolf queens.

298
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,880
Whoa! Now you're talking!

299
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,180
And one of those, like, really hot Chris Craft, you know, like, outboards and stuff from the 50s and everything,

300
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,280
wearing those Donna Reed bathing suits, like, smiling and waving and stuff like that.

301
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:58,380
And sometimes their hands fall off because I guess there was- they were trying to weave a leper colony thing in there with, you know, the people being bestial and so forth.

302
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,620
And I had to have sex with all of them, too.

303
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,980
With the werewolf cheerleader babes, did you say?

304
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,860
A cheerleader kind of beach babes, more like a net, you know, fungicide or something.

305
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:16,020
You know, the sexy aspect of werewolf- were-women wolves has not been explored except in very few movies that-

306
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,420
I lost on you.

307
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,620
The howling.

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:28,760
The first howling movie I remember had a sexy werewolf scene where this couple goes out waiting for the full moon, because they're into it.

309
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,920
Yeah, I remember that. I remember that.

310
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,860
And the full moon comes up and they're- they're making the- ahem.

311
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,720
They're a beast with two backs.

312
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,100
Two backs.

313
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,660
While they change into werewolves, of course, they end up at the end of the climax of the scene, the male is

314
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,800
And talk about dog breasts.

315
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:59,460
Now, speaking of hair-covered monster babes, there was also a movie in the late 50s called The Neanderthal Man, which I saw when I was a kid.

316
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,800
And it really impressed me because the cops broke in and they found-

317
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,100
They found photographs of-

318
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,120
Real Neanderthals having sex.

319
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,480
The mad scientist had been experimenting on his Mexican maid.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,880
And there were a series of photographs that showed her as a nice-looking young lady and then gradually reverting into a Neanderthal.

321
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
He had a devolution drug or something.

322
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,680
Which, of course, we've all been seeking our whole lives, many of us.

323
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,300
Well, we're looking for Hirsute women, if that's what you mean.

324
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,160
Well, either one.

325
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:29,740
I want-

326
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,500
You know, one or the other, both would be the best.

327
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,040
Back to the canthropy again.

328
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,820
But not Hirsute, no, it's not the hairiness that's the kick.

329
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,640
It was the prognathous jaw, the sloping brow, the heavy brow ridge, the increased-

330
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,160
The lupine, elven neck bones.

331
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,500
The heavy muscle structure.

332
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,660
The strong yet archy neuronucleoid pieces of flesh hanging from the-

333
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,580
It was the difference that turns you on.

334
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,000
Just the difference, huh?

335
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,040
Well, but it was a major, major difference.

336
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,000
I could see you like chasing like these weird like poor war veteran guys and stuff from 1942 and everything.

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,180
Around the block and like grabbing them and-

338
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,640
Oh, there they go now!

339
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,140
Those funny looking dudes.

340
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,620
White canes.

341
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,440
Someone wearing the DAV bracelets around their necks.

342
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
And it looks so much like dog collars.

343
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,780
Chaz, I understand you were at some sort of a convention, the Stone Hand Axe Convention, was it?

345
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,380
And you had to dress like a woman and carry stone tools, titanium tools they're making now.

346
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,480
By hand, right?

347
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,140
With those little-

348
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,980
They smelt them by themselves with their little hands.

349
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,660
In a little shack in the back?

350
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,740
Were these like scrapers and choppers and-

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,100
Or was it the new modern day hand axes?

352
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
Were there scruffers and scribes?

353
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,440
Or were there people who worked with their hands and feet like mom and dad?

354
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,180
People were taking pictures of-

355
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,960
Going.

356
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,520
Ooh.

357
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,680
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

358
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,040
Were there little homo habilis people working and chipping away at the church in Flint?

359
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,960
Were there little homunculi working away-

360
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,000
In the dark basements of the out-

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,520
There were monkeys with apples on their backs all over the place.

362
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,200
Monkeys with apples on their backs?

363
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,980
See, that's the new word for-

364
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,800
Applebacks, we were calling them.

365
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,420
That's a new word for a gyrating junkie.

366
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,240
That's a new word for a person like what they used to have a gorilla on their sidecar.

367
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,440
No, they're just mac monkeys.

368
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
A bunch of mac apes.

369
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:24,960
Mac apes.

370
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm one of them.

371
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,280
I'm a mac ape.

372
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,780
That means in Celtic-

373
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,660
That means son of the ape.

374
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,460
I'm still-

375
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,800
You know, that's how mankind started out.

376
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,520
My eyes go-

377
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,960
In the plains of Africa-

378
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,460
I mean-

379
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,860
In the old Davai Gorge.

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,620
I mean-

381
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,580
It's now a gorge.

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,060
It used to be just a light side.

383
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,020
An alagorge?

384
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,280
That was the song of the Australopithecus and homo habilis.

385
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,660
What was the alagorge of the homo habilis?

386
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,760
The alagorge was do not step on moist rock five million years from henna.

387
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,760
You know, the paleo-

388
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,720
I was reading a Martian paleoanthropology book and they-

389
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,840
Dr. Zorg.

390
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,960
Dr. Zorg.

391
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,260
Interesting-

392
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,020
Yes, Dr. Zorg's book.

393
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:19,180
Actually, it was by Dr. Shreve right here in Cleveland and Dr. Johansson, Lucy's child.

394
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,960
And they were-

395
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,360
And Buster Poindexter's brother.

396
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:30,760
They were suggesting that perhaps human intelligence evolved in concert with our society-

397
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,680
Complete and total lie.

398
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:43,380
We became the apes that conquered our environment because we had our own selves, our own society,

399
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,240
our own human and private ape society as our own worst enemy.

400
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:59,880
That our own fate of each other was what drove us to evolve such demonic cleverness.

401
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
You think they're demonically clever?

402
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,200
No, we-

403
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,240
Your pronouncements are yet so hollow to me.

404
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,080
I cannot-

405
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,480
Yeti's-

406
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,760
You say in one breath-

407
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,540
Yeti's are president.

408
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,540
I don't consider that man a man of yeti blood.

409
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,640
I consider him a-

410
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:15,940
No, you're absolutely wrong.

411
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,280
A spurlish, a curlish-

412
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,040
A pink-

413
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,540
A snake.

414
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:18,640
A snake.

415
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:18,760
A human.

416
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,220
A snake.

417
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,520
A human.

418
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,900
A pure human one, an escaped lab rat.

419
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,940
George W. Bush might as well be an escaped lab rat.

420
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,760
Most of them.

421
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,060
Most of them might as well be-

422
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,520
A beaten, drooling lab dog.

423
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,800
A beaten, drooling lab dog with only five teeth.

424
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,120
A beaten, drooling lab dog with only five teeth.

425
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,120


426
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,540
A beaten, drooling lab dog with only five teeth.

427
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,540


428
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,540


429
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm a bad heart.

430
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,220
A bad heart.

431
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,080
Ah, yes.

432
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,780
Yeah, we're back to normal.

433
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,940
Let's see what's on TV tonight.

434
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,160
There's a special on one of the-

435
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,620
Let's see.

436
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
It's Channel 38 if you get cable.

437
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,440
Frappa Billy live in Nashville.

438
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,880
On Channel 27 tonight, the men from Planet X-

439
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,480
Or the man from Planet X.

440
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:02,100
And if you tune in right now, you can catch the very end of our series.

441
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,100


442
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,100


443
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,920
We're going to be talking about the Squirting Universe on PBS.

444
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,980
See, 39, I think, has 20 million miles to Earth.

445
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,320
And Mars Needs Women right after that.

446
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,720
Both of those feature cameo appearances by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

447
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,460
On CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network, we've got Love That Bob.

448
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,380
And after that, Bob and Connie and Jim and Tammy.

449
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,840
Oh, ho, ho.

450
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,100
Oh, ho, ho.

451
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,820
I can't wait.

452
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,580
That's like a soft core porno.

453
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,000
And then Fort Dobbs.

454
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,500
What is Fort Dobbs about?

455
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Apaches try to regain their sacred pipe from a mad Caucasian plunderer.

456
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,880
And, oh, that's with John Wayne.

457
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:55,500
And then at midnight, Dante's Inferno with Spencer Tracy, which also has an amazing appearance

458
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,560
by Bob Dobbs.

459
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,900
But, oh, let's see.

460
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,100
If I can just get my technical act going.

461
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,100


462
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,100


463
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,100


464
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,700
I think I can.

465
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,880
I wanna play this song I'd like to...

466
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,460
No, I'm serious here.

467
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,800
It's a quiet moment.

468
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:20,660
I'd like to dedicate this to those, uh, the kids that were lost in the Guadalupe River

469
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,340
this weekend.

470
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,860
Oh, Jesus.

471
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,660
You gave me water.

472
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,000
You gave me water.

473
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,540
You gave me water.

474
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,320
Jesus.

475
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,840
You gave me water.

476
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,620
You gave me water.

477
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:28,620


478
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,440
You gave me water.

479
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,560
You gave me water.

480
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,840
You gave me water.

481
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,320
You gave me water.

482
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,700
You gave me water.

483
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:33,920
You gave me water.

484
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,280
Jesus gave that woman water.

485
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,500
You gave me water.

486
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:36,900
You gave me water.

487
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:36,900


488
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,780
Gave her that living, lasting water.

489
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,480
You gave me water.

490
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,880
You gave me water.

491
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:40,880


492
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,400
What a, what a, what a loving water when there was none in the well.

493
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,340
There was a woman from Samaria.

494
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,080
Came to the well to get some water.

495
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,080
It was there she met our Savior.

496
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,700
So the story tell.

497
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,880
Hell, that woman dropped her pitcher.

498
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,820
But her drinking wasn't good.

499
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,060
She had people to pour her a

500
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,800
tied up mana.

501
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,800
And in Jesus' name we love, we trembling.

502
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:12,800


503
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,640
pouring blood.

504
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,140
Water, bringing those living price new fridge.

505
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,840
sitting in a pool moment.

506
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,320
Having a drink for morning difficile.

507
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,740
When the land in.

508
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,820
in the well.

509
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, yeah.

510
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,960
Yes, yes, yes. That was Snakefinger,

511
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,280
also late.

512
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,860
Yes, Snakefinger's also dead.

513
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,880
Reverend Sheena

514
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,760
Timoney down there at Ralph Records

515
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,820
said that just about three

516
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,940
weeks ago, old Snakefinger bought it.

517
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,300
Yes, he did.

518
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,940
He's out of the

519
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,880
way now. Sad,

520
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,860
sad. But you know he's gone on

521
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,820
to a life in Bob, a new life

522
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,240
in Bob.

523
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,480
I've never heard of that.

524
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:07,000
Did you hear the theory about

525
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,080
how if aliens come

526
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,280
here, that they're probably already here

527
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,220
in the microbial form

528
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,860
and that they're going to

529
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,000
in intelligent form

530
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,160
too, and that they're going to take over

531
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,980
through the internet.

532
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,660
The world wide web.

533
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,520
That they're not microbial,

534
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,840
I mean they're nano.

535
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,020
They're like nano.

536
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,460
Aliens.

537
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,520
Oh man, how could you be a digital life form though?

538
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,060
It's required to form the physical body

539
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,700
that we know as Bill Gates.

540
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,820
God, just think of all the

541
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,080
microbes and how they hold themselves together

542
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,500
into a semblance of a

543
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,340
human-like thing that breathes

544
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,120
and talks. Probably even

545
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,100
eats. Peanut butter cup, Dave?

546
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,960
No thanks. I was going to have some

547
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,100
Smarthy tumor juice over there and then also

548
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,560
a piece of hemlock pie.

549
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,080
I see the Reverend brought his Slim

550
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,940
Fast with him.

551
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,180
You gotta drink.

552
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,040
You have to drink three or four of those every day.

553
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,260
Now why would a man of your small,

554
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,220
not your girth, want to have a Slim Fast

555
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,140
for lunch or breakfast?

556
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,160
Because I can't

557
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,700
suck down the blood of a newborn

558
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,920
kitten every hour like I would like

559
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
to, so I have to suck down one of

560
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,680
these damn humanoid

561
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,140
drinks.

562
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,380
It's for the protein. I have to have

563
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,500
protein to balance the sugar

564
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,340
and caffeine.

565
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,720
So therefore I have to...

566
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,480
eat nuts or

567
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,800
frop or some other form of protein.

568
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,280
Nuts and frops and other colloquialistic terms

569
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,200
for human bodies when you crunch off the tops

570
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,700
of their heads and dig right into that

571
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,640
fleshy medulla oblongata.

572
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,440
Zips the tops.

573
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,660
Have you ever sliced the brain?

574
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,140
So what do you think about that? Aliens and nano-aliens.

575
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,960
Well I was trying to ask you a question.

576
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,760
How could they make my biotic form

577
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,280
become digital from a digital form?

578
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,460
Actually boys, the nano-alien is the one that's going to be the most effective.

579
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:58,480
What does that mean?

580
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,100
What does that mean?

581
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,720
The nano-alien is the one that's going to be the most effective.

582
00:26:59,720 --> 00:26:59,720


583
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,620
So the nano-alien that you're talking about Chaz

584
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,640
are in fact the

585
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,760
WOM supercomputer

586
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,520
predicted by J.R. Bob Dobbs

587
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,280
described in not very much detail

588
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,460
in either of the

589
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,080
baubles so to speak.

590
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:22,360
This WOM supercomputer is actually like a zillion billion nano-alien creatures.

591
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,100
What is?

592
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,160
They're artificial but

593
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,440
you know they're as alive as any

594
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,300
virus or bacterium.

595
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,440
And these

596
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,480
this super computer of the

597
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,420
exist aliens

598
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,400
because of the nature of it

599
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,860
is able to exist as a permeating

600
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,620
gas as a paint

601
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,700
upon the walls as the carpet underneath

602
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,360
An all pervasive feeling.

603
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,600
As very slim fast in that

604
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
cannon as the can itself.

605
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,400
Or a lack of oil in one's carburetor.

606
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,640
Those are all part of the exist computer. That is how

607
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,640
the exist super computer is able to

608
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,600
instantly grant the wishes of all those

609
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,960
who paid their thirty dollars to this.

610
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,300
And simultaneously deny the heartfelt desires

611
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,160
of those it wishes to crush and conquer.

612
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,580
Following the rupture

613
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,720
or predicted

614
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,900
XXXX day

615
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,680
4XD

616
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,920
we like to call it

617
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,340
coming up this July 5th

618
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,200
2000

619
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,400
4Skin day.

620
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,760
4Skin day?

621
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,320
As Bob predicted.

622
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,620
Yes sir. Oh holly hot 4Skin day.

623
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
When our mothers and grandfappies

624
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,360
laid down these flaps

625
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,700
that would create

626
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,140
a new hoon and bean

627
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,640
here on this consecrated ground.

628
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,820
We just decided

629
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,560
actually there was a vote. Shouldn't we demand

630
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,500
that everybody in the church be circumcised?

631
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,420
Whoa!

632
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,900
Or circumvented by faith.

633
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,560
I think you got mixed up with a certain heaven's

634
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,500
gate or a certain Judaism

635
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,840
or some such thing.

636
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,420
Or a certain medical

637
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,120
American

638
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,340
conspiracy. But no.

639
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,140
Trephination was the...

640
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,520
I think everyone in this church

641
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,480
should have a sex change and then have

642
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,660
a sex change back. Well you've already

643
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,300
had one. No that's been done. That's already

644
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,760
happened in this church of

645
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,640
excrescence and putridity. I can't even keep up

646
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,660
with the names of some of our ministers

647
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,340
whether they're Mrs. This

648
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,340
or Mr. That. Hot stinky

649
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,680
in between man woman.

650
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,300
Lephargic thing purple...

651
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,380
Yeah. Pope. Pope.

652
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,280
Stir this and...

653
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,080
Mary Popes stir this and that.

654
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,660
But all of these predictions

655
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,620
shall come true as the end times

656
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,820
unfold. Listen to the mic.

657
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,880
I could do the whole song and dance.

658
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,460
That's kind and it's own juices.

659
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,660
Just like a thick little salami. How do we expect to get to the moon

660
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,540
if we can't even talk between two buildings?

661
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,480
How can we expect

662
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,400
trees to communicate when we

663
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,580
cannot even talk with our own

664
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,000
urine and other bodily fluids?

665
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,620
It's just too much of an explanation. It always

666
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,320
comes back to bodily fluids

667
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,080
and genitalia. That's Dave

668
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,920
That's little baby talk.

669
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,640
That's sophomore unit baby talk.

670
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,300
I know Chas that you and I would prefer to keep the conversation

671
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,000
on a lofty, rationalist,

672
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,060
humanist level.

673
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,080
Perhaps the subcutaneous plane.

674
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,600
And eschew this metaphysical

675
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
claptrap nonsense.

676
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Slathering skin of this fleshy,

677
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,120
fleshy

678
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,880
genu-oriented

679
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,440
and poo-poo oriented individual.

680
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,520
But of course that's what the audience wants. That is

681
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,420
what keeps the advertisers

682
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,280
coming in here at WCSB.

683
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,280
Dave's poo-poo talk.

684
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,380
Oh yes, yes,

685
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,720
yes. Listen to that.

686
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,180
Ha.

687
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,480
You want to know what kind of

688
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,700
music I listen to when I'm sitting around at home?

689
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,620
I sit around at the house

690
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,520
and I listen to this old box

691
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,700
of all kinds of weird, old, funky

692
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,600
old-timey

693
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,660
music like this. It's old, what's it

694
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,500
called? Old western music.

695
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,840
Western Germany. 1500s.

696
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,840
Ah.

697
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,260
It feels so good.

698
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,400
Yeah, back at the house. I'm the proud owner

699
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,220
of two little kids, believe it or not.

700
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,360
Yes I am. Both of them are old enough

701
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,320
to read, but neither one of them is old

702
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,580
is old enough yet to

703
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,660
well, for me to break

704
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,900
certain things to them about Santa Claus.

705
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,540
Now it makes me mad that I

706
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,700
can't tell them certain things, but it almost

707
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,600
shames me that I have to tell them other

708
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,400
things at all.

709
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,540
Some of these monstrous truths

710
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,600
don't slide by as

711
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,620
easily as the one about Santa

712
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,580
Claus. One day,

713
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,740
and this is the truth, I had to

714
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,480
warn my kids about

715
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,280
certain grown-ups who are so

716
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,500
twisted by their own

717
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,600
messed up parents that they want to close

718
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:55,760
their mouths and quote,

719
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,080
do bad things to you, unquote.

720
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,500
And it feels awful

721
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,240
to break that kind of news to a kid

722
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,320
and it's frightening to think what they're

723
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,580
prompted to imagine about the world

724
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,520
they're going to grow up in, no matter

725
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,360
how you soften it up when you're

726
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,480
telling them about it. And I've never

727
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,280
been able to tell them about the bomb

728
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,120
or the germ

729
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,800
or the gas

730
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,340
because I knew what would happen if my

731
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,560
kids started thinking about those

732
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,960
things all the time.

733
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,460
They'd end up like me,

734
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,400
dear friends, and all through

735
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,160
high school I was dead

736
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,400
sure the future would see

737
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,740
us back in the caves.

738
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,540
As Einstein or some

739
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,420
other wise guy once said,

740
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,580
quote,

741
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,160
I don't know what World War

742
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,120
III will be fought with,

743
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,220
but the one after that will be

744
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,400
fought with sticks and stones.

745
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,740
Unquote.

746
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
And now,

747
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,480
dear friends, we don't even have that

748
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,680
to look forward to.

749
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,640
That was a naive,

750
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,340
positive thinking kind of

751
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,880
view of the end of the world.

752
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,540
With the weapons they have now,

753
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,380
there wouldn't even be

754
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,460
sticks and stones. There'd be nothing,

755
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,380
dear friends, nothing left

756
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,300
if the big mistake

757
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,360
happened. By the way, my kids

758
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,480
did figure it out for themselves without

759
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,520
me having to say anything.

760
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,880
Between TV cartoons

761
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,080
and the news and conversations

762
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,540
on the playground, they were able to put

763
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,340
two and two together before first grade,

764
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
and you'll be glad to know that they did

765
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,040
adjust a lot better than I did.

766
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,400
But friends, most people cannot

767
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,260
conceive of worldwide

768
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,600
extinction of all higher

769
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,380
life forms. Nay,

770
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,280
they've got a lot of trouble, for that matter,

771
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,520
conceptualizing so much as a

772
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,980
rape or a car wreck.

773
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,460
At least until it happens

774
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,920
to them.

775
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,320
Positive thinking,

776
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,140
you know, oh, positive thinking,

777
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,420
oh, don't you love it, and that escape

778
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,400
into affluent

779
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,480
isolation, dear friends, have become

780
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,820
so socially desirable

781
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,460
that the idea of preparing

782
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,640
for the worst, that's a bad

783
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,780
habit now. Only survivalists

784
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,640
and cooks would do something

785
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,480
like that. To most Americans,

786
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,160
friends, a big mistake

787
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,000
is, oh, say, forgetting to photocopy

788
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,540
that textiles contract

789
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,500
before the board meeting or

790
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,200
burning the roast

791
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,400
when guests are expected

792
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,460
for dinner.

793
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,500
People nowadays, they won't

794
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,560
build themselves a fallout shelter.

795
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,560
They won't even, I won't even

796
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,580
quit smoking myself, for that

797
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,660
matter, and yet, they'll

798
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,400
donate to save the whales.

799
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,440
Strange

800
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,420
paradoxes, but, uh, you

801
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,340
see, friends,

802
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,840
most human beings

803
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,140
have no idea how

804
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,680
real they are.

805
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,500
And for that matter, they don't know how smart

806
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,100
they are, but at the same time,

807
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,080
they grossly underestimate

808
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,700
their own stupidity.

809
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,120
And they,

810
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,700
to, to, think about it,

811
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,980
they could wreck,

812
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,960
permanently wreck the rest

813
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,540
of the planet, for all of us,

814
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,700
by, just for no other

815
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,000
reason than not giving themselves

816
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,520
enough credit, either for brains or for

817
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,600
the lack thereof. And if they

818
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
distrust themselves

819
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,380
so much, friends, think how

820
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,160
much they distrust you.

821
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,440
They assume that

822
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,480
they wouldn't be good enough at anything

823
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,440
important, like stopping

824
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,780
the arms race to take a stab at it,

825
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,540
and in all too few cases, they're

826
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,580
right. And so they cling to

827
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,480
the safe and the meaningless, and they

828
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,720
wish everyone else would, too.

829
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,400
When somebody tries

830
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,700
to warn them about a danger they didn't

831
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,620
already know about, well, oh, they take

832
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,580
that as an insult. Now

833
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,380
as Bob Dobbs said

834
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,680
to a Sunday school class

835
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,740
in 1955,

836
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,780
if they all thought they were as great

837
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,160
as I think I am,

838
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,740
everybody'd get along just fine,

839
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,500
even though they'd all

840
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,600
be wrong. That's what Bob said.

841
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,480
So how much

842
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,580
do you tell your kids about the future?

843
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,560
About pollution,

844
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,260
about overpopulation,

845
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,400
and war, and crime, and

846
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,420
just exactly what those

847
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,420
statistics are pointing to?

848
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,440
When does it

849
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,380
get past survival training friends

850
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,040
and start making them suicidal?

851
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,500
For that matter, how much

852
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,960
can you psychologically

853
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,080
afford to tell yourself?

854
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,080
Maybe a lot more than you think.

855
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,920
Earlier today, Chaz

856
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,500
was giving a sort of

857
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,460
a trance lecture

858
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,080
about

859
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,900
that ranged from

860
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,260
the protoplasmic beginnings

861
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,840
of all life to

862
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,440
space exploration.

863
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,260
And this lovely dome

864
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,680
here is certainly a good

865
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,900
place to think about

866
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,340
that because if we're not

867
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,380
lucky, all of our descendants

868
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,520
will live inside little puffer

869
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,320
domes like this because

870
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,480
there won't be the right kind

871
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,880
of air outside.

872
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,420
And if we are

873
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,540
lucky...

874
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
Yes! Oh baby!

875
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,000
Do that again!

876
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,000
I say!

877
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,960
Oh I say!

878
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,760
Oh! Hit me one more time

879
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,740
please, darling!

880
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,160
You know, uh,

881
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,800
you know if you increase the oxygen

882
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
in here too much, a spark like that

883
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
would cause an explosion.

884
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,660
We'd all be fried like those poor

885
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,220
brave astronauts on

886
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:45,000
one of those ill-fated missions.

887
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,940
On the other hand, if you turn the oxygen up

888
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,900
you get kind of high.

889
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,540
Well let us speak first!

890
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,300
Aww.

891
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,780
We'll watch on those.

892
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
Now, uh, remember,

893
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,920
the air

894
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,000
outside is not exactly

895
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,820
the same as inside, so you might

896
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,200
want to go through that decompression

897
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,540
chamber first! Oh man!

898
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,520
James!

899
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,920
These kids just go right in

900
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,520
and out from earth atmosphere to

901
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,340
outside atmosphere.

902
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,820
Doesn't even bother!

903
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,320
I have to wear a mask to go out there.

904
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:27,480


905
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,720
You're out of evolution.

906
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,120
Yeah.

907
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,140
It's hard to keep up with evolution, man.

908
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,620
It was hard enough just to crawl out of that pond

909
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,800
and use them lungs.

910
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,100
That hurt!

911
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,660
You kids don't know nothing!

912
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,840
You never did have to crawl out of that ocean

913
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,980
and use them lungs the first time.

914
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,340
And that first time

915
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,120
we've had to

916
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,860
invent murder

917
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:52,940
and murder

918
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,140
murder!

919
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,420
That was hell, baby!

920
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,460
But, man's gotta eat.

921
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,860
You gotta get that,

922
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,800
you gotta build that spaceship somehow.

923
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,740
And if you have to

924
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,460
start by chipping flint

925
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,800
rocks together, well that's

926
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,860
a start. Better than sitting on

927
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,960
your butt, scratching your butt. Or is it,

928
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,880
friends? Is what it would have been

929
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,860
better for early man

930
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,680
to have merely sat

931
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,880
upon its butt, scratching

932
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,840
that butt, and

933
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,180
picking its nose and it flees

934
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,640
off into each other and

935
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,060
rutting like happy little monkeys

936
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,860
in the wilderness.

937
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,140
Instead of all this progress,

938
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,640
which, while it has brought us

939
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,540
these apps and things,

940
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,860
they're still not working right.

941
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,880
We have to breathe

942
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
this processed atmosphere

943
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,580
or else end up like those

944
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,860
new breed of kids with the

945
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,440
giant lungs and stuff.

946
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,480
John?

947
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,920
Sometimes I get mixed up and can't

948
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,820
even remember what century I'm in.

949
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,760
I remember

950
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,320
that one time

951
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,540
when we invented

952
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,000
legs.

953
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
That was out

954
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,400
of necessity, believe me.

955
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,560
No, but,

956
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,700
you know, I mean, there's some people

957
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,940
think that, that, uh,

958
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
well, I used to thank Chaz.

959
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,660
You know, we've been

960
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,780
exhorting people to build their own ships

961
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,920
just in case the aliens don't save

962
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,960
our butts, but I used to say

963
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,640
to people, well, hell, we got a whole

964
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,620
other planet right here on this one

965
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,700
that's a lot closer than Mars

966
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,640
or the Moon and a lot more hospitable,

967
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,920
that being the ocean. Oh, we got

968
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,740
a whole other two planets

969
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,300
worth left to pollute

970
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,540
if that's what we wanted to do.

971
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,140
No!

972
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,680
He's a maniac!

973
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
Out to rule the world!

974
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,820
What can I do to make you understand?

975
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,800
I love you!

976
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,660
And what will the new year

977
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,840
bring you, my friend? What will Santa

978
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,320
bring you for the new,

979
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,820
the true new millennium?

980
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,940
You know, it took him to remind us

981
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,720
about this, friend. Will Santa bring you a

982
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,160
giant black slab?

983
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,740
And when you throw, will you throw

984
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,920
a bone into the air? Will it turn

985
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,860
into a nuclear bomb

986
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,000
or into a checkbook?

987
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,480
Which will it be, my friend?

988
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Who will you follow?

989
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,560
The black slab or the flying pipe

990
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,060
with the wings?

991
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Santa is saying that conspiracists

992
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,740
got big red straps. They want to strap

993
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,540
that big black slab onto you with big red straps

994
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,380
and keep it

995
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,260
strapped to you so that, you know,

996
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,000
all of the doubt will fall over you.

997
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,820
Do you have protection, my friend?

998
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Are you wearing protection

999
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,680
for the new year? Or do you have

1000
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,340
that $30 membership

1001
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,920
skin on?

1002
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,500
...of mankind.

1003
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,020
If you are the moments

1004
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,100
we two can share.

1005
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,120
Quiet and blue

1006
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,580
like the sky,

1007
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,020
I'll hug over you.

1008
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:14,540
And if I can't find my way back home,

1009
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,360
And if I can't find my way back home,

1010
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,360


1011
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,260
find my way,

1012
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,100
it just wouldn't be fair.

1013
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,460
wouldn't be fair.

1014
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,720
These precious and few

1015
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,440
are the moments

1016
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,700
we two can share.

1017
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,500
...are the moments we two can share.

1018
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:31,500


1019
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,360
Maybe it's you

1020
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,560
on my mind. Your

1021
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,680
love is so rare.

1022
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:36,980


1023
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,600
...love is so rare.

1024
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,340
Being with you

1025
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,360
is a feeling I

1026
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,020
just can't compare.

1027
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:46,660


1028
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,660
And if I

1029
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,700
can't hold you in my

1030
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,460
arms,

1031
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,580
can't hold you in my arms,

1032
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,360
it just wouldn't be fair.

1033
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,640
wouldn't be fair.

1034
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,920
These precious and few

1035
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,620
are the moments

1036
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,900
we two can share.

1037
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,120
...are the moments

1038
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,120


1039
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,120


1040
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,120


1041
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,140
...are the moments

1042
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:16,140


1043
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,360
And if I can't find my way back home,

1044
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,940
And if I can't find my way back home,

1045
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,220
my head just wouldn't be fair.

1046
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,420
wouldn't be fair.

1047
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,840
These precious and few

1048
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,640
are the moments

1049
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,860
we two can share.

1050
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,720
...are the moments

1051
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,900
we two can share.

1052
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,820
These precious and few

1053
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,500
are the moments

1054
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,880
we two can share.

1055
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,400
Quiet and blue

1056
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,780
like the sky,

1057
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,780
I'm hung over you.

1058
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,480
I'm hung over you.

1059
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,360
And if I can't find my way

1060
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,620
back home, my pretty baby,

1061
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:00,980
back home, my pretty baby,

1062
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,020
Wanna take a little break right now when we come back?

1063
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,120
Oh, that just wouldn't be fair.

1064
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,460
Wouldn't be fair.

1065
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,760
These precious and few

1066
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,340
are the moments

1067
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,500
we two can share.

1068
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,500
These precious and few

1069
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,060
are the moments

1070
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,360
we two can share.

1071
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,880
...are the moments

1072
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:22,960
we two can share.

1073
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,940
...are the moments

1074
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:26,940


1075
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,420
The Rudy Schwartz Project

1076
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,540
from Sunshine

1077
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,900
Supers hits,

1078
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,660
and now back to ESO Swamp Radio

1079
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,920
of the year 2000.

1080
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,700
...of the year 2000.

1081
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,900
The season is now entering

1082
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,660
....the Dark Zone.

1083
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,780
I have one more specious argument to make with you, Dr. Goddard Dammerung.

1084
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,880
If the day of the end of the hand isn't coming, what can we do?

1085
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,760
How can we do it?

1086
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,740
And when, above all, must we perforate it?

1087
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,060
And among other questions I have for you, Dr. Goddard Dammerung,

1088
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,920
is when is the Valkyr storm coming to my backyard?

1089
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:18,300
Well, son, to release the essence,

1090
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,340
you must go into the chamber of excremeditation

1091
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:29,180
and there grip upon that which has troubled you and itched you,

1092
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,300
that which has strained and pressed outwards from you,

1093
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,640
and wring it like the turkey's neck.

1094
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,100
Of America!

1095
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,200
And give thanks unto the bathroom tiles

1096
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:55,160
in your whiteness and discolored blood-tinged.

1097
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,040
Thanks for the wild turkey and the passenger pigeons

1098
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,460
designed to be spit out through wholesome American guts.

1099
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,220
You know, I've had the transfusions all my life.

1100
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,640
For a nation of...

1101
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:10,720
Fakes.

1102
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,140
...an iron-chopped turkey fried dinner.

1103
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,520
...so automatically that I can hardly stand with you.

1104
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,400
The printer is in my head.

1105
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,520
Oh, dear Lord.

1106
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,600
Oh, there's blood everywhere.

1107
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,200
Slowly I turn.

1108
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,800
Oh, God, no.

1109
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,100
Step by step.

1110
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,860
Inch by inch.

1111
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,020
As I can see, the clothes were burning.

1112
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,140
Thank you for the Indians.

1113
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,020
To put up some...

1114
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,560
...minor...

1115
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:40,980
...resistance.

1116
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,820
Thank you for government narco-police and laboratory aides.

1117
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,660
Thank you for P-Dawg and Poop-Dawg.

1118
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,600
Thank you for reminding us...

1119
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,520
Thanks for the war against...

1120
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,240
...our fascist autocracy. ...subgeniuses.

1121
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:03,100
Thanks for Dave killing lawmen, feeling up their notches.

1122
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,540
Oh.

1123
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,280
Thank you for not having time to lay feedback.

1124
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,040
Mine fell out.

1125
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,520
I'd like to give thanks right now for this...

1126
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,100
...beautiful pumpkin growing out of my pie eyes.

1127
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,800
And as God has made this turkey for me and this wonderful gravy...

1128
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,660
...and petty broth on our bare hands and knees for three weeks, I...

1129
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:28,080
...bassoon, this is probably going to be one of my best lung savings...

1130
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,900
...and thanks days forever.

1131
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,820
I know you're growing, my children.

1132
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,160
I can smell it.

1133
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,140
Your eyes are glowing like the old ones now.

1134
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,920
Soon you will be ready...

1135
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,140
...to have a thanksgiving of your own...

1136
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,880
...on the martyred corpses of the Hunan bin.

1137
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,900
The caller drifts around the studio...

1138
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,380
...and is decapitated by Hal, who presses a button...

1139
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,320
...for yet another...

1140
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,380
It's hot.

1141
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,280
Oh, yeah.

1142
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,520
...situation down here.

1143
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,280
It's live.

1144
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,260
We'll keep you awake for no reason at all.

1145
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,820
No reason is right, dear friends.

1146
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,120
Listen up.

1147
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:12,820
The Will of Dobbs just pointed out that...

1148
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,060
...you know, the only call we've gotten down here tonight...

1149
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,500
...was what?

1150
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,000
Somebody wanting Madonna tickets?

1151
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,960
Great show to call for that, friends.

1152
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,940
Whew, Madonna, geez.

1153
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,320
Unless you're thinking about Jesus' mother.

1154
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,080
Now, we can get you tickets for her.

1155
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,500
She's meeting all the boys back in the garage after the show.

1156
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,220
But listen.

1157
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,940
What makes us mad, what really makes us sick...

1158
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,720
...is that nobody has gotten mad and sick at us yet.

1159
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,820
Why is it I can get on the air and make underhanded, nasty...

1160
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,000
...well, satirical, strictly satirical...

1161
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,040
...and absolutely has nothing to do with this station...

1162
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,240
...but nasty comments about certain disasters...

1163
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,700
...that have happened in the Dallas area recently...

1164
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,640
...and nobody calls, nobody's upset about that.

1165
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,020
Oh, no.

1166
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,600
But if we mention one wounded animal...

1167
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,380
...if we say, even once...

1168
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,720
...I like to kill animals...

1169
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,020
...well, that, oh, then, oh, the lines light up.

1170
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,140
You people are so, so angry...

1171
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,380
...and so ready to get up and fight...

1172
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:26,240
...when you hear somebody insult your four-legged friends.

1173
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,540
They're so poor and helpless.

1174
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,380
But when we get on here and insult living human beings...

1175
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,680
...who died for nothing...

1176
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,340
...oh, that doesn't bother you a bit.

1177
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,620
You don't care about that.

1178
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,700
That's just people.

1179
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,360
Oh, there, oh, that Nick or something.

1180
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:38,920
Oh, that Nicaragua stuff.

1181
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,000
That's all just people.

1182
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,680
I don't care.

1183
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,220
Oh, Vietnam.

1184
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,720
Oh, those were just humans.

1185
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,700
Those were just two-legged animals.

1186
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,480
Go ahead and napalm them again.

1187
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,560
Do it again.

1188
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,880
If you can't do it in Vietnam, go ahead and do it in, uh...

1189
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,940
...oh, El Salvador.

1190
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,280
Do it instead of Nicaragua.

1191
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,160
Do it anywhere you want.

1192
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:53,660
I don't care.

1193
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,460
My hero, Ali Norris, said it was okay...

1194
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,380
...and he was told it was okay by somebody ahead of him...

1195
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,480
...but, but he doesn't remember who...

1196
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,840
...and they certainly don't remember either.

1197
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,300
Because, because that's okay.

1198
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,980
It's okay to kill people.

1199
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,800
But it's...

1200
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,340
...it's okay to kill people.

1201
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:08,340


1202
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,420
It's a terrible, terrible thing...

1203
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,020
...for us even to do a satire...

1204
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:17,680
...of making fun of someone not liking animal liberation.

1205
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,420
You new age...

1206
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,260
...peaks!

1207
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,400
You pathetic, pathetic, useless excuses...

1208
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,340
...for human...

1209
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,680
...I mean, you're useless excuses for human beings...

1210
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,380
...much less subgeniuses.

1211
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,760
My God!

1212
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,060
By gobs, this, I mean, the whole thing, it's just...

1213
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:38,320
...it's just...

1214
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,920
...it is...

1215
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,320
...no...

1216
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,180
...we've been doing this show...

1217
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,400
...this is hour of slack number 88.

1218
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,180
We've been doing this for 88 weeks...

1219
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,940
...and no one has killed us yet.

1220
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,260
You call this a free country?

1221
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,700
You call this a patriotic...

1222
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,240
...American state of Texas?

1223
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,700
Where subgeniuses can get on the air...

1224
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,060
...or publish pamphlets and books and things...

1225
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,840
...out of P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214...

1226
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,000
...and nobody's killed us yet.

1227
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,220
Oh, no, no, that's too much trouble to go to.

1228
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,980
Only if we kill somebody, uh, kill an animal...

1229
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,780
...then you'll get upset.

1230
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1231
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,180
Sick! Sick!

1232
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,280
This is not the Dallas show.

1233
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,900
This is, this is KNON.

1234
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,280
Wait, I'm Doug Smith.

1235
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,700
Come on, let me be Doug Smith.

1236
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,240
No, you said it was my turn to be Doug Smith.

1237
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,980
Hey, listen, you were, last time you were on the air...

1238
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,820
...you got to be Buck Henry or whatever that other guy's name is.

1239
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:42,460
I think this confusion breaks out when Bob's...

1240
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,260
...re-erection is evident.

1241
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,960
Bob's come back to life.

1242
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,520
No, don't worry.

1243
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,480
He's killing everybody on the list, and your name's next!

1244
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,700
...in the game for everybody!

1245
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,140
Now, listen, I, I know this sounds funny, but this, this Bob...

1246
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,060
...this creature, this werewolf, uh, monster...

1247
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,980
Monster, I don't know how we're gonna kill him, but...

1248
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,940
...has some vulnerable spot, and, and all we have to do is figure this out...

1249
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,880
...and, and then we can...

1250
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,480
...and, well, we can find out its weakness, and, and we can kill him.

1251
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,300
No, we must communicate with him!

1252
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,160
He has much to teach us!

1253
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,240
I don't know whatever's down in that pit.

1254
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,160
It ain't human, and it ain't an animal.

1255
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,500
But it's smoking a pipe.

1256
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:24,260
Look at the glint on its hairdo.

1257
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,460
Look, it's, it's beckoning to us.

1258
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,080
They're gonna open up with 20 million...

1259
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,560
I almost thought it was Ronald Reagan.

1260
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:36,060
Go ahead down in that pit and communicate with it there, Mr. College Professor.

1261
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,860
Oh my gosh, look what it's doing. I guess that's why it's...

1262
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,040
Uh, hi, uh, we bring you greetings from our civilization, uh...

1263
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,620
Ahhhhh!

1264
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,580
Oh, look what we did.

1265
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,260
Good morning.

1266
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,080
Put them subdemus guys out.

1267
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,580
What happened, little Cole, what happened?

1268
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,940
Slimy sub-demeuses.

1269
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,920
What's Reverend saying out here in the Bay Area?

1270
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,840
He was caught in that, uh, love nest with, uh, Reverend Gamey, and, uh...

1271
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,480
...they made him leave Dallas.

1272
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,860
They made him leave the Shining Temple of...

1273
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,400
Bob.

1274
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,120
Didn't.

1275
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,640
Dr. Stan, could you hand me that giant light right there?

1276
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,840
Everything I say is a lie, including this very statement.

1277
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,520
Wow!

1278
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,660
Yes, that's light. I need that light.

1279
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:21,620
Yeah, did you ever stop to think that this show just may be a, uh, a little...

1280
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,620
A little show inside a larger show?

1281
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,440
And that somehow is inside an even larger show?

1282
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,740
Yeah, I had that same, I had that same thing too.

1283
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,900
Hotel accommodations question.

1284
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,500
It'd be like someone's buying you out behind your back, and you don't even know it's a swine.

1285
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,180
No, we're buying you out from behind your back.

1286
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,520
Are you really? Well, no one's behind me.

1287
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,320
Well...

1288
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,940
Here's your back now, being bought out.

1289
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,360
Well, I can't see, it's behind me.

1290
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,060
Well, never mind.

1291
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,780
Can someone see my back?

1292
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,540
Camera 3, Bob.

1293
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,220
.

1294
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,420
But let's leave things of this world behind.

1295
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:11,820
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1296
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,840
And, uh, we find then the family falling apart.

1297
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:26,160
Oh, they wail and gnash their teeth, our rival churches do, about how the children are getting exposed to too much this and too much that.

1298
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,900
What they ain't being exposed to is a little bit of mom and dad.

1299
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,480
Forget the pornography, I don't care.

1300
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,400
. . .

1301
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,460
The hypocrisy, man, my friend, the hypocrisy.

1302
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,460
Now I have nothing against hypocrisy.

1303
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,580
Every religion must have its fair share of hypocrisy.

1304
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:46,400
As Bob Dobbs once said, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.

1305
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:54,460
But that preacher can get up there on TV and oh, he's so glad to keep you normal, keep you working so hard you don't even know your own wifey anymore.

1306
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,800
And your kids?

1307
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,600
You don't know your kids any better than your employees.

1308
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,520
So, friend, let there be slack.

1309
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,140
Subgenius.com

1310
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,540
And now, Shamekia Copeland

1311
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,060
Uncivil war, uncivil war

1312
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:32,960
How long must we fight this uncivil war

1313
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,680
Same old wounds we opened before

1314
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:46,360
Nobody wins in uncivil war

1315
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:56,620
The lines are drawn, gloves are off

1316
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:02,080
Smiles are gone, we're all talking tough

1317
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:02,940
Uncivil war, uncivil war

1318
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:02,940


1319
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,120
You curse me out and I cuss back

1320
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,600
Everything we love is under attack

1321
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,840
The spirits are back in rags blue and gray

1322
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,420
Thought they were gone but they won't go away

1323
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:31,500
Uncivil war, uncivil war

1324
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,940
How long must we fight this uncivil war

1325
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,320
How long must we fight this uncivil war

1326
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,080
Same old wounds we opened before

1327
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:50,520
Nobody wins in uncivil war

1328
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:00,940
You're sure you're right, I'm sure you're wrong

1329
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:06,520
Why can't we all just get along

1330
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,500
You yell fake and I yell real

1331
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,720
Nobody seems to care how the other guy feels

1332
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:24,220
Keeping count of each other's sins

1333
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:30,100
Only problem is nobody wins

1334
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,900
Uncivil war, uncivil war

1335
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,820
How long must we fight this uncivil war

1336
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,500
Same old wounds we opened before

1337
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:55,040
Nobody wins in uncivil war

1338
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,420
Uncivil war

1339
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,720
Uncivil war

1340
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:00,720


1341
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:00,920
Uncivil war

1342
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:00,920


1343
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:00,920


1344
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:00,920


1345
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:00,920


1346
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,640
We're here to fight a will

1347
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,980
Carham's a chill agree to disagree

1348
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,860
You cut out all the hostility

1349
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,220
Call off the fighting

1350
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,060
And bring it to an end

1351
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:22,660
We can shake hands and be friends again

1352
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,980
Uncivil War

1353
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,460
Why can't we just let it air here so we don't fight others?

1354
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:30,460


1355
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:30,460


1356
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:30,520
Why can't we frames our wrongs

1357
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:30,520


1358
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,320
Nobody's backing down

1359
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,220
Some won't even talk

1360
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,160
The table's empty

1361
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,920
We all took a walk

1362
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,940
He says left

1363
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,860
And she says right

1364
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:00,820
One says peace

1365
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,840
The other says fight

1366
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,720
One hand's a palm

1367
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,660
The other's a fist

1368
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,720
Another chance for love

1369
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,560
Just got missed

1370
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,340
Uncivil war

1371
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:21,240
Uncivil war

1372
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,160
How long must we fight this

1373
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,120
Uncivil war

1374
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:27,840
Uncivil war

1375
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:27,840


1376
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,220
The same old rules

1377
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,880
We all went before

1378
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,180
Nobody wins

1379
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,320
Uncivil war

1380
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,720
Nobody wins

1381
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,040
Uncivil war

1382
00:59:59,500 --> 00:59:59,940
Uncivil war

1383
00:59:59,940 --> 00:59:59,940


1384
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:00,200
Straight out of her chest

1385
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1386
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1387
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1388
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1389
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1390
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1391
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1392
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1393
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1394
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1395
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1396
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1397
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:00,200


1398
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,180
