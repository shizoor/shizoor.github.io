1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,820
The gun is good.

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,760
The gun is good!

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,160
The penis is evil.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,740
The penis shoots seeds.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,600
Jesus Christ, no, it's still coming!

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,220
It hasn't even been touched!

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,500
It's shooting lightning bolts from its eyes!

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,540
The flames are being blown from the sky one by one!

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,420
No, he's trying to...

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,820
He can't make them shut up.

11
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,060
He can't make them shut up.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,500
He'll never make them shut up.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,480
Somebody gag the cowboy.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,560
Alright, here we go.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,440
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,740
And now it's that time you've been waiting for, kids!

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,040
You're here on the...

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,760
The awesome cowboy man just rode in on his automatic horse bucket!

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,980
Howdy, kids.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,340
I had a terrible ride here tonight.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,340
I was threatened and accosted by three young bullies,

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,380
one of whom had a rancid, arid eye that kept on staring downwards while he beat me for my boots.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,300
After being stabbed in the night several times about the head and buttocks area,

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,200
I began to scream and chased a 13RTA bus all the way down Chester Avenue.

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,200
I was so scared.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,200


38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,280
Once I got to the dumpster next to Mary Lou's,

39
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,280
I had visions of her in my head.

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,080
Oh, Mary Lou.

41
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,800
I had visions of ski patrol

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,300
and visions of French bunny girls wearing little parkas

43
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,720
and little teeny, teeny, teeny tiny critters

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,260
you couldn't even call clothing.

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Smart guy.

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
And he kept me going

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
as the oil was slicking up around my feet

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
and the fires were raging, making the air on my ears burn.

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,200


50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:01:59,500
I was going back.

51
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,820
All I could do was think of

52
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,400
the song to you.

53
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,260
So you, uh, did you go to prostitutes, huh?

54
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,100
Uh, yes, dear friends.

55
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,260
This Hour of Slack number 927

56
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,020
is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 776

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,560
from our 77th.

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,880
Season.

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,540
Seriously.

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,240
Sexy is the title of this old show.

61
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,540
Oh.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,900
Hit me.

63
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,360
Hit me.

64
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,980
Hit me.

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,800
Hit me.

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,680
Hit me.

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:57,940
Do it.

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,200
No.

69
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,020
Stop it.

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,580
Hit me.

71
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,400
Hit me.

72
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,400
Hit me.

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,160
Hit me.

74
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,740
And I still can see

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,660
Blue velvet

76
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,780
Through my tears

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,340
Tears.

78
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,080
Tears.

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
Like it when I talk that way.

80
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,940
Mm-hmm.

81
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,400
Honey.

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Hey, hey, hey.

83
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, hey.

84
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,980
Thousands of bottles of blue beer on the wall.

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,360
The kind of beer that'll make you a man today.

86
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,860
The kind of man that can fly our planes.

87
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,900
And knock out the yaks and the dingoes, too.

88
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,100
And the rest of the people trying to bring this country down on its knees where it truly belongs.

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
So stand up for America today if you can at all.

90
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,040
Are you a bad boy?

91
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,760
Are you a bad boy, Dave?

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,620
You mean it?

93
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,180
I was very bad.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,320
Do you want to do bad things?

95
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,020
You want to do bad things?

96
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,020
Are you a bad boy?

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,500
I took the toilet bowl brush.

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,340
What do you mean?

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,580
And answered it to where the sun would refuse to shine.

100
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,140
And I began singing.

101
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,420
Do you want to do bad things, Dave?

102
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,580
Stop getting so excited.

103
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,460
You know, every time you get him sexually excited, his nuts go up inside him and he gets that female voice.

104
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,100
Well, more like a little boy.

105
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,240
He's like little Dave.

106
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:23,840
He gets scared.

107
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,700
That's why he's so lonesome.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,220
Haven't you ever heard the gelding sound, Stang?

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,600
Yes.

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,040
That's when a yearling is frightened by larger males of his own type or kind.

111
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,800
We call that the forgot-to-debeat-the-prairie-squid voice.

112
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,660
But a squid proboscis is more than just a proboscis.

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,980
It's a hiding place for a metaphor.

114
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
A metaphor for the pleasures of the universe.

115
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,140
Tuck it inside out and it works both ways.

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,220
Yes, Dr. Wang.

117
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,040
Take out the green scalp of nature.

118
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,040
Now I'm the remove.

119
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
That's a good idea.

120
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,540
So I heard...

121
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm going to take my clothes off.

122
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm going to take my pants off.

123
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm going to do this show with no pants on.

124
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,440
No pants on.

125
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,800
Friends, last night I was showing...

126
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,340
Somebody told me they found my gold plastic subgenius minister's card at a party I'd been at last week.

127
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,060
And I was going through my wallet and going, oh yeah, it's gone.

128
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,660
I guess so.

129
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,720
And I found my Universal Life Church preachers.

130
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,600
How many here are members of the Universal Life Church?

131
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,600
Look at that.

132
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,300
I knew it.

133
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,920
Praise Bishop Hensley.

134
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,820
He was the man who decided that he didn't want to help subsidize religions he might not believe in.

135
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,760
Since religions didn't have to pay taxes.

136
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,740
So he started ordaining everyone he knew.

137
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,260
Much like the discordians do.

138
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,060
Ordaining popes right and left.

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,580
So you're all ministers now.

140
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,540
You don't have to pay taxes.

141
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,100
But as I was going through that wallet, I also came upon my oldest original subgenius membership.

142
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,700
Card.

143
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,520
The person looking over my shoulder went...

144
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,720
They saw the Universal Life Church card and said, oh I want one of those.

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,640
I said, oh I'll send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Modesto, California.

146
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,700
But then she saw the subgenius membership card and said, oh I don't want one of those.

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,140
Now, I didn't...

148
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,500
I woke up this morning thinking about that.

149
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,660
And I thought, okay, we know what she doesn't want.

150
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,280
What does this say she does want?

151
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,740
Friends, when you say you don't want a subgenius membership card.

152
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,900
You don't want to be a subgenius minister doling out the slack of Bob's.

153
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,900
What it says you do want is that you do want to take yourself seriously.

154
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,680
And friends, as a subgenius, I do not take myself seriously.

155
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
I don't take you seriously.

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,660
I don't take her seriously.

157
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,060
I don't even take that man J.R. Bob Dobbs seriously.

158
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,260
I don't even take that man J.R. Bob Dobbs seriously.

159
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,300
The only thing I take seriously is the one serious law that the church of the subgenius has that Bob passed down.

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,960
And that one rule is, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

161
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,000
I see somebody's been reading their prescriptures here.

162
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,660
I don't even take the news, what you people call the news, I don't...

163
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,880
I take that least seriously of all.

164
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,600
So you think you're in America, do you?

165
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,840
Last time I checked.

166
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,820
Well, you're not. You're in high school.

167
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,140
Now take that thing and bury it where it belongs.

168
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
Look at this thing.

169
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,260
It wasn't even human.

170
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,160
Do you think it's healthy for a 13 year old boy to imagine his teacher naked?

171
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,500
Absolutely.

172
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,980
Mommy, when do I get breast?

173
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,240
This is strange, but there are four people in the hospital who nearly suffocated in here.

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,180
There has to be a reason for this. What do you think?

175
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,840
I'll run tests on all the main electrical circuits. I might find something there.

176
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
You're wearing black underwear.

177
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,900
Did you go in there and write that on the mirror while I was taking a shower?

178
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,020
Yes.

179
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,100
Well, enough is enough, young man. Do I make myself clear?

180
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,800
It's like a plague or something.

181
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:12,080
People disappearing right and left. Old ladies, little girls, young women, school boys.

182
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,640
I don't call it a mendacity. I call it anti-slack.

183
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,260
This is Ivan Stank's version. Watch this. He starts crying right here. It's really neat.

184
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,240
I don't know a place for giving.

185
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,780
I am sinned.

186
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,160
Is he laughing there?

187
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,120
Here on the last show of the millennium.

188
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,900
How many last shows have we done, Doug? Give me a break.

189
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,460
We never did a last show of the millennium, though.

190
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,480
The last show of the millennium.

191
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,780
In 1998, there was a last show.

192
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,920
We never did one of the millennium. We never thought we would be at the millennium.

193
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:05,060
I always thought I'd be at some pleasure saucer in space on Planet X by now.

194
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,040
I mean, I'm kind of pissed off that that ever came through.

195
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,260
Dr. Drummond, have you not heeded Bob's new word, build your own ship?

196
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,140
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,540
Bob's new word? Is that like the Bible with a little N?

198
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,440
It ain't quite the same as getting that eternity on the escape vessels.

199
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,720
Hey, you know, I'm a flexible guy.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,680
You know, he changes the rules. I can change. I can move. I can understand it.

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,860
You know, I understand the way that the upper management operates.

202
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,320
You look like the escape doctors of the sex hobos, right?

203
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:44,620
After years of being in middle management in this cult, I understand that, you know, upper management changes their mind at a whim.

204
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,260
And the whole strategic direction can change.

205
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,420
You know, it doesn't matter if 20 years you've been predicting that the Earth was going to collapse.

206
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,120
The Earth is going to end on 1998 and we would be off in the present.

207
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,200
If Connie has a headache.

208
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,560
You know, if Connie has a headache, four-fifths of the dogma suddenly goes away.

209
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,640
You know?

210
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,560
That's when I don't get it.

211
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,600
These bimbos come in here. They start changing the rules.

212
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,960
And, you know, Connie's the queen of them.

213
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,500
I'll say it right out loud in front of Bob and everybody.

214
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,040
She's the queen of the bimbos.

215
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh, well, hey, is that, so that's news?

216
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,400
So that's not news. All right, all right. I understand.

217
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,320
But Connie might stick over it.

218
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,280
But I mean that in a...

219
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
What, 84 or something? The minute Bob was killed.

220
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,420
But I mean it in a malicious way. I don't mean it in a loving way like most people do.

221
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,380
The minute Mr. Liberate the Women there shot Bob dead.

222
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,740
Yeah.

223
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,860
Yeah, I bet he's gay. He ain't.

224
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,700
He's gay. He's not gay. I know he's not gay.

225
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,620
Don't be Doug Wellman.

226
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,400
What's that?

227
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,160
You rue the day you shot Bob because that was when them bitches took over.

228
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,660
I rule the day.

229
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,240
If you left Bob hanging and swinging, why?

230
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,360
It'd be as if Confucius had never come along.

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,820
Dr. Stang, have they upped your prescription of Halcyon or...

232
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,540
Is that what's going on here?

233
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:09,080
No, no. I started this diatribe into the bowels of the things that are wrong with the church.

234
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,440
The philosophy.

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,780
The philosophy itself is like, it's just...

236
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,740
So you're talking about church point two or...

237
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:20,720
I didn't really mean to cast any dispersion on any of our previous dogmatic points because they are still all valid, all still true.

238
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,240
As true as truth is, you know, but perhaps I wandered too far into my own...

239
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,800
Oh, give me a break, Dr. Drummond. You were the one that made it a polyg... wanted it to be a men's club.

240
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,940
I still think it should be a men's club.

241
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,020
God, if only it had remained the way...

242
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,840
If only it had been the father church that I had promised to be. It was a polygamous kingdom at one time.

243
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,700
The purity. The purity was there.

244
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,500
And now I feel like a stud on a stud farm.

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,700
All those women I have to manage.

246
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,640
The Savage Revenge of Helen Keller in Retrovision.

247
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,240
What the hell?

248
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,560
The Savage Revenge of Helen Keller in Retrovision?

249
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,340
That is a real actual tract written by Dr. Mars, I believe.

250
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,540
It's a visionary piece.

251
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:25,820
It also involves performance and it is quite visionary, except for the fact that they duct tape your eyes shut.

252
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,680
And you're supposed to experience through your nasal cortex most of the experiences.

253
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,740
You express that so well.

254
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,140
The long knitting needles, believe me, are...

255
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,700
Express yourself.

256
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,580
It's a kind of a clean feeling you get, you know, like you've all been...

257
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,900
Clean yourself.

258
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,100
Fresh.

259
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,100
Clean it out.

260
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,900
Wipe yourself.

261
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,340
Find refreshment.

262
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,940
Ream yourself.

263
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,500
You peppermint douche.

264
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:51,920
Ream again.

265
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,200
In a clean, bossel.

266
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,660
A breath refreshed.

267
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,580
Lighten up manhole.

268
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,620
Yourself.

269
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,400
Grab rocks.

270
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,040
Sell us yourselves.

271
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,420
I will sit for you.

272
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,040
Oh, with...

273
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,220
What's he doing by that?

274
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,160
Stallions.

275
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,580
Water.

276
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,100
Bowie knife.

277
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,980
That's pretty.

278
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,360
Brass cannonballs.

279
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,880
And a brick.

280
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,980
Shit.

281
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,300
There he is.

282
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,260
And you just put this right on his head.

283
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh my God.

284
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,660
I've never seen anything like that before.

285
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
He's got a head condom.

286
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,080
Dave has just put a condom over his complete head.

287
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,160
He's ready to dive right in.

288
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,040
I can't breathe.

289
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,360
Oh my God.

290
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,640
That's obscene.

291
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
He's getting into it now.

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,740
Ladies and gentlemen, you should see what's going on.

293
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,760
It's lubricated, man.

294
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,840
You gotta help me get this off.

295
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,060
In the studio.

296
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,840
I can't breathe.

297
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,760
I've never seen performance art quite like that.

298
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,600
Eat your heart out, Howard Stern.

299
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,480
Ow.

300
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,900
It's clean.

301
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,260
Calm, calm, calm.

302
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,120
Subgenius.com.

303
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,040
And it's a calm moment, friends.

304
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,740
A briefly calm moment because I was putting together last week's show and I suddenly got

305
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


306
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


307
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


308
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


309
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


310
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


311
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


312
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


313
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


314
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


315
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


316
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


317
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:17,740


318
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,100
to the point where I suddenly realized that with the Amsterdam subgenius field trip coming

319
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:29,980
up, I'm going to have to somehow crank out three shows in advance because I ain't going

320
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,320
to be around to do them damn shows.

321
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:38,480
Now, I could run some old reruns and things, but we don't have to do that yet, friends,

322
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,240
because there's been so much going on.

323
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,080
There was a...

324
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,720
I have this wonderful recording of a KPFA Berkley.

325
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:47,720


326
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,020
More than an hour, less than a show.

327
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:50,800
Show.

328
00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:00,520
The original The Show, by the way, with a special guest, Dr. Philodrumon, and host Puzzling

329
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,100
Evidence, and caller Phineas Narco.

330
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:12,180
I've got tons of recordings from Winter Star Symposium sponsored by Ace here in Cleveland.

331
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,780
You're hearing some of the recordings from that in the background.

332
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,860
Einstein's Secret Orchestra and Ron Slade.

333
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,400
But I preached there.

334
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,280
Now, maybe I can...

335
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,000
Maybe by...

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,820
At some point, I can find some tapes of Robert Anton Wilson, who also preached there and

337
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,960
was really funny.

338
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,280
Friends, of course, we always have tons of ESO Swamp Radio originally broadcast live

339
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:42,080
on WCSB in Cleveland on Thursday nights at 11 to 1 in the Eastern time in the evenings.

340
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,420
And you can call that station at WCSB.org.

341
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,620
And call in.

342
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,320
Hell, why not?

343
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:54,620
And friends, I've got this incredible recording of Booger 9000, the legendary subgenius band,

344
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:03,020
the super group composed of Sphinx Drummond from the Swinging Love Corpses, and President

345
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:10,500
William Howard Taft from Homicidal Briefcase, and yes, Joe Newman from the Rudy Schwartz

346
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,080
Project.

347
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,400
An incredible recording from an Austin revival in the 90s.

348
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Captured by our friend, Potter Nostril.

349
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,420
And friends, as always, every hour of Slack recently has been partly programmed by the

350
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:33,000
artists of alt.binaries.slack, where along with artwork, lately the Sabinis have been

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,380
posting sounds.

352
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:43,300
And so we have all these little clips and bits and mixes from New Monet, Artemia Salina,

353
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,280
Dr. Phineas Narco.

354
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,980
Puzzling Primates for Bob.

355
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,080
Jupiter Research and Mr. Sister.

356
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,240
And friends, we've got the Bran Flakes new album is in here.

357
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,780
We've got old Meteor Broad stuff as always, which I bet you've been better on the website.

358
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
You better check that stuff out.

359
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,100
I've got the revival recordings coming in, better ones than I've had, from Tucson Revival.

360
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,260
And of course, the sample, the Tampa revival samples did have not hardly been touched.

361
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,980
Oh yes, friends.

362
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,900
And finally, I may end up having, you know, as I said, I have to do three shows in a week

363
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,500
to get a catch up ahead.

364
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,080
And finally, the final show, number 778, might be nothing but outtakes with no explanations

365
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,700
at all.

366
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,340
I don't know.

367
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,280
Because we've got to move in a hurry, friends.

368
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,580
We've got to move fast because this is the church of the subgenius.

369
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,000
And we know because of the word of Bob that the end times are so, so very nigh.

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,560
The time is ripe for their arisal.

371
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,220
And XXXX day is coming, friends.

372
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,040
4X day.

373
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,940
We'll see you there at that campground, Brushwood, in Sherman, New York, come July 5th, 2001,

374
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:11,120
when the aliens shall meet with those who are worthy and have achieved their ministership-hood

375
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,780
in the church of the subgenius.

376
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,080
Stay sundry.

377
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,340
This is Light Master Bob.

378
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,780
Oh yes, praise Bob.

379
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,840
We didn't want to play this gig but when Jesus told us we had to, we couldn't say no

380
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,160
to this.

381
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,020
So you want to hear some Schoenberg or some Neil Diamond?

382
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,220
It's pretty clear, everybody here would like a Neil Diamond.

383
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,780
Thanks for coming.

384
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,080
You too.

385
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,800
You and you!

386
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,420
You and you!

387
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,420


388
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,720
Awesome.

389
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,120
Rackling roads they get on board

390
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,840
We gonna ride till there ain't no more to go

391
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,800
Taking it slow

392
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,780
Lord, don't you know

393
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,520
I'll have me a time with a poor man's lady

394
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,200
Hitching on a twilight train

395
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,520
Ain't nothing here that I'd care to take along

396
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,720
Maybe a song

397
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,740
To sing when I want

398
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,200
No need to say please to no man for a happy tune

399
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,780
Oh, I love my rosy child

400
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,460
And me, we're going in style

401
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,100
Rackling roads they get on board

402
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,700
But you make me say

403
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,140
Sing like a guitar strum and

404
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,640
Hang on to make out

405
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,560
The song keeps running

406
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,480
Ah

407
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:49,780
Ah

408
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,660

409
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,940
Playing now

410
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,700
Playing now my baby

411
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,800
Rackling rosy make me smile

412
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,600
Girl, if it lasts for an hour

413
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,220
Well, that's alright

414
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,340
We got all night

415
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,500
To set the world right

416
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,780
Hang on to me and then fuck my asshole babe

417
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,300
Oh, I love my rosy child

418
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,340
She's got the way to make me happy

419
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,060
You and me, we're going in style

420
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,180
Rackling rosy, the store bought woman

421
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,620
You make me sing like a guitar strummin'

422
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,880
Hang on to me, girl

423
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,860
The song keeps running

424
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,300
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

425
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:39,220
Oh, my God.

426
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,720
Oh, my God.

427
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:21,960
Oh, my God.

428
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,800
Oh, my God.

429
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,120
Oh, my God.

430
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,840
Oh, my God.

431
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,020
Oh, my God.

432
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,000
Oh, my God.

433
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,260
Oh, my God.

434
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,880
Oh, my God.

435
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,560
Oh, my God.

436
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,940
Oh, my God.

437
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:41,680
Oh, my God.

438
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,880
Oh, my God.

439
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,960
Oh, my God.

440
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,480
Oh.

441
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,480
Oh, my God.

442
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,020
Oh, my God.

443
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,340
The teens of my teens are throwing a fit

444
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,540
Use the man, mama's really big and proud

445
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,940
And I need a lot of room

446
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,780
Cause I'm dancing with the hard on

447
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,360
Hey, kitty boy

448
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,780
guitar solo

449
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,740
guitar solo

450
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,260
I need to find a place where I can hide

451
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,600
That's right, I'll tell you why

452
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,920
It's a-growing and a-pushing and a-pushing from inside

453
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,680
Guitar solo

454
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:41,680


455
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm a-beating all the time

456
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,020
Feel it getting bigger, it's about to rip

457
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,260
The teens of my teens are throwing a fit

458
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,560
Use the man, mama's really big and proud

459
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,900
And I need a lot of room

460
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,680
Cause I'm dancing with the hard on

461
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,580
Dancing with the hard on

462
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,460
Dancing with the hard on

463
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,280
Dancing with the hard on

464
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,980
I'm dancing

465
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,140
Dancing with the hard on

466
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,160
I got a diamond cutter

467
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,220
Dancing with the hard on

468
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,380
It's a blue fader

469
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,180
Dancing with the hard on

470
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,860
The hard-dropping muscle of love

471
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,160
Dancing with the hard on

472
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,800
Make way for the hard-sucking

473
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,080
Dancing with the hard on

474
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,440
Yeah, that's right

475
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
They know how it feels

476
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
When you've been dancing with the hard on

477
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,020
guitar solo

478
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,680
Guitar solo

479
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,900
Guitar solo

480
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,280
Guitar solo

481
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:19,280


482
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,240
Guitar solo

483
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,860
Guitar solo

484
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:22,860


485
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:22,860


486
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:22,860


487
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,140
Alright, but I need something to play

488
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,260
Ya-ya-ya

489
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,320
Lords of Acid is just about nothing but

490
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,460
that kind of

491
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,920
Yeah, right

492
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,660
Richard and Kitty Cat

493
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,900
Well, how about a pronunzimental

494
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,200
of earth-squacking impertinence

495
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,840
Somebody told me that people have

496
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,680
group sex at Lords of Acid

497
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:50,040
acid concerts i said now i've been to a 5x days and a thrill kill concert i've seen them all

498
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,860
just about but and this young lady that was explaining this to me said well i had my first

499
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,120
three-way at a lords of acid concert well everybody had a three-way there but they're

500
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,980
talking about long sliking dogs they're talking about three-way hits no i thought they're i think

501
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:18,200
they were talking about three-way sexual activities with a prairie squid a man on one

502
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,060
end a woman on the other and a squid in the middle you better believe it baby and sometimes you can

503
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:30,360
get another guy or girl in there depending on how if it's a large enough and willing enough

504
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,680
depending on how big the ink sack is on the squid that's right you can always use the ink sack if

505
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,820
once it's been de-inked can you put them together like a

506
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:39,960
little

507
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:39,960


508
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,400
little pioneer toy when you were 75 years old?

509
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,920
We've got those de-inking suction cup pad machines

510
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,840
at Subgenius Foundation.

511
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,540
Huh?

512
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,620
I mean, just if you had three squid.

513
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,680
Not three squids.

514
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm, of course, an erudite person.

515
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,620
Three squid, could you just snap them together like blocks?

516
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,540
And they would serve the same purpose

517
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,920
of perhaps 100 just clears?

518
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,760
The South American Army squid will do that.

519
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,040
They will actually form bridges of their own bodies

520
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,280
across rivers so that their horny squid mates

521
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,260
can get across, you know, at the cost of thousands of lives,

522
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,120
yet thousands more will live.

523
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,220
The reason for the psychic experiments.

524
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,600
Look here.

525
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,540
The Army squid are not only growing in size

526
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,200
through conjugating and multiplying,

527
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,740
but they have one mind.

528
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,160
One heart, one mind.

529
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,980
Much like you, Dr. F.

530
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,560
If you cut off the head,

531
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,660
it just grows another one.

532
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,180
If you pull a beak, another beak appears.

533
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,520
If you shave an eyebrow, another thing laughs at you

534
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,600
and cries at you.

535
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,500
If you pull out its fangs, it grows twice as many.

536
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,860
If you pull its ears, it wants you to rub its belly.

537
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,760
If you give it milk, it will suck your blood.

538
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,400
All these things and more,

539
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,300
can be yours at Squid Town, Prairie Town, USA.

540
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,120
My, miles and miles of furrowed dirt

541
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,880
and squid flipping and undulating

542
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,320
in each and every patch.

543
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,320
I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

544
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,980
Yeah, Rose, Pond Rose,

545
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,880
I never believed there could be such a squid farm.

546
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,920
Oh, fine.

547
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,360
Squids, as far as I can see.

548
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,620
They're slopping and slotting.

549
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,300
I think they're ready to be peared.

550
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,480
I got my vial.

551
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:35,540
I got my vial.

552
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,040
Hey, Grease.

553
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,900
I'm all greased up and ready to go.

554
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,860
Look, look, I got one of them fake beauty marks.

555
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,040
I'm sorry, it's a melanoma.

556
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,720
But look, I got a tear.

557
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,320
Tight, tight, tight pants.

558
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,820
I got a tight squid here.

559
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,480
Yeah.

560
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,180
I'm retired.

561
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,040
A little bit of that sorrel sausage sorcery there, eh?

562
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,600
That's right.

563
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,980
I like to get down in them furrows and just plow.

564
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,260
Plow.

565
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,320
Plow.

566
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,800
You know what I mean?

567
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,100
Just plow my way.

568
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,800
Use one squid as a condom for use of another squid.

569
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,800
Yep.

570
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,500
And then use a bigger one atop them.

571
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,040
We were the ones who invented them things back in the dome.

572
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
You know, back in the dome.

573
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,380
Well, back under them, you could take one of them

574
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,560
and you would shave your eyebrow for you.

575
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,120
You wouldn't have to even sit in a chair.

576
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,400
You could just sit there and lecture it about anything that came to your mind.

577
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,060
I tried to get a patent on those things,

578
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,400
but it turns out you can't patent a formula.

579
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,420
That's right.

580
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,460
But that didn't matter back in the day.

581
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,480
And that's all you really need to create that.

582
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,600
We just sit there whittling and having the squid.

583
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Whittling and having.

584
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,540
Mammy didn't know nothing.

585
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,460
We did all kinds of songs.

586
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,000
Knowing and having.

587
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,680
Mammy was none the wiser.

588
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:58,320
Remember the squid songs we used to make up when we had nothing else to do

589
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,140
but just try to recharge our depleted accordion?

590
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,480
Knowing the squids.

591
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,040
Yep.

592
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,840
Didn't know them real personal.

593
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,600
Squids.

594
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,060
Having the squids.

595
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,040
Squids.

596
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,340
Plowing the squids.

597
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,660
Plowing the squids.

598
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,180
Squidding around on the squids.

599
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,660
Squid cakes.

600
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:13,760
Squid cakes.

601
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,240
I like to just take it in my hand.

602
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,800
Squid soup.

603
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,940
Squid sandwiches.

604
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,400
Look at it for maybe a half an hour.

605
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,680
Squid bed.

606
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,420
Scream it, squid.

607
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:20,920
Squid flags.

608
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:20,920


609
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Squid puddin'.

610
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,240
Squid beach furniture.

611
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,720
Squid puddin'.

612
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,260
Squid primavera.

613
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,160
There's none like squid puddin', though.

614
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,560
All that stuff.

615
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,360
Everybody's grandmother made squid puddin' out of their own orifices.

616
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:34,760
Yep.

617
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,620
And squid strudel is good, too.

618
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,140
Well, you had a dry, dry old granny.

619
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,580
Not like the rest of us.

620
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,520
Oh, no.

621
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,120
We used to dry out the grannies.

622
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,380
I remember that.

623
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,620
We'd take the grannies and we'd string them up.

624
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,400
Smoke them.

625
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,240
Smoke them.

626
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,300
And get them cured.

627
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,860
For a long time.

628
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,360
Two, three, four weeks.

629
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,020
We would be cured, but we would never get high off of it.

630
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,500
Jerked granny.

631
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,060
Nope.

632
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,600
Wasn't right.

633
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,760
Besides, Grandpa didn't like that.

634
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,660
No, he wanted all to himself.

635
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,920
He wanted to do his own jerking.

636
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,800
He walked 50 miles a day to go to a squid.

637
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,100
And then grandma, she walked until she quit squid.

638
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,680
She'd walk about 25 miles a day.

639
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,180
And they just keep telling the same story.

640
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,660
Everybody knows you took the squid bus.

641
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,800
Grandpa been jerking with that prairie squid murkin'.

642
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,140
I remember that old song.

643
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,980
Grandpa.

644
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,520
Aliens coming to earth to get our beef jerking.

645
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,920
Bob said it, so you better pick up on it.

646
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,920
If Bob says that traffic light is green,

647
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,640
but it looks red to you, floor it.

648
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,660
Floor that.

649
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,240
Close your eyes and gas it to the max.

650
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,900
Do what Bob said, not what your mind said.

651
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,120
Who do you trust, friends?

652
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,840
Who do you trust?

653
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,540
Your mind or Bob Dobbs?

654
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,040
Get that part straight first.

655
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,800
But people are afraid to trust.

656
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,120
You know, I don't blame them.

657
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,060
We've all been burned at one point because we trusted the conspiracy,

658
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,580
or we wouldn't be so screwed up as we are.

659
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,340
We wouldn't be in this room right now.

660
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,160
But, you know, you go, well, if I can't trust Bob, who can I trust?

661
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,400
Friends, you cannot trust Bob to do what's right for you.

662
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,400
Okay?

663
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,560
That's in your hands.

664
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,840
That's entirely in your hands.

665
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,520
But you can trust Bob to do what's right for Bob,

666
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,700
which you can't even trust yourself about.

667
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,580
So, friends, Bob is real, and yet some people don't believe in Bob

668
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,320
because either he's too good,

669
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,960
too good to be true,

670
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,140
or they fear Bob.

671
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,240
You know, just as some people, normal humans, sometimes fear,

672
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,700
well, actually, it's the old-timey,

673
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:46,800
I know a lot of old-time subgeniuses that fear computers and the Internet.

674
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,020
There's always resistance to anything new,

675
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,980
and Bob Dobbs is always new and improved.

676
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,400
So there's always going to be somebody scared of him.

677
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,320
Did you know that Hitler owned 8,000 robots?

678
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,320


679
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,220
He owned 960 acres of land in Colorado.

680
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,540
What?

681
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,120
Hitler.

682
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,100
No.

683
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,440
Yes, he did.

684
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,060
He owned 8,960 acres of land in Colorado.

685
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,240
Why, no American citizen would do business with Adolf Hitler.

686
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,400
I'm optimistic this can happen.

687
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,400
That's nothing, though.

688
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,580
Mata Hari was making it.

689
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,820
You know how much she made?

690
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,400
$7,500 a throw.

691
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,760
To ask every American.

692
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,300
There must have been some position.

693
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,940
There's a balloon there, boy.

694
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,360
And so as we begin the work of healing our nation...

695
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,240
God's going to strike you down.

696
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,120
Who's healing our nation now?

697
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,400
In a big thunderstorm.

698
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,500
Hey, something happened to that thing, Doug.

699
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,040
I feel up your pain.

700
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:55,120
You know, how the hell did you ever survive the last seven years without your beauty, your trunks?

701
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,920
I'm sorry.

702
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,200
Well, what happens is if you've been around enough squid,

703
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,220
well, they get into you.

704
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,700
They just start reproducin' and hollerin' and carryin' on.

705
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,260
Before you know it, you're just a vessel for squid intelligence.

706
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,020
Then you gotta send them to college.

707
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:13,960
Exactly.

708
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:15,920
Start all over again.

709
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,920
You're gonna get done with the little peckers.

710
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,740
Keep you young.

711
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,960
Keep you young and quick.

712
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:28,220
My feet have gone to sleep while we're talking about this, and I think my hemorrhoids come back.

713
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:28,620
No.

714
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,860
If we could maybe change the subject a little bit.

715
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,360
No.

716
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,080
All right.

717
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,920
I know that's the only thing you ever wanna really talk about in depth.

718
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:37,560
I'm being violated.

719
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,720
But for cryin' out loud, we've been talkin' about it for six weeks now.

720
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,480
I know.

721
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,060
I know.

722
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,500
Hey, I know.

723
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,260
You've been caught red-handed mug reasonin'.

724
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,260


725
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,020
I think you've punished me.

726
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,600
Yeah, I know.

727
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,960
Stop the things you do

728
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:45,980
Oh, I can't stand

729
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,820
No roads around, I can't stand

730
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,640
No woods down, I wouldn't fail on you

731
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,800
Because you're mine

732
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,840
Because you're mine

733
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,820
I can't stand

734
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,800
No roads around, I can't stand

735
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:23,800


736
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,640
No woods down, I wouldn't fail on you

737
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,780
Oh, because you're mine

738
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,880
Because you're mine

739
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,960
Because you're mine

740
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,620
Because you're mine

741
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,120
Because you're mine

742
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,580
Because you're mine

743
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:11,620
Because you're mine

744
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,560
Because you're mine

745
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:12,920
Because you're mine

746
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,100
Girl, you're better off like me

747
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,840
Boys have a vagina

748
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,860
Girls have a penis

749
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,380
Man is woman and woman is man

750
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,840
Guys want things

751
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,580
I'm setting you on fire.

752
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,800
Hummin' a, humming a, humming a.

753
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,540
A woman pretending to be a man pretending to be a woman?

754
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,140
Ridiculous.

755
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,580
It's preposterous.

756
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,680
In fact, it's so preposterous no one would ever believe it.

757
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,740
There's gonna be hell.

758
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,620
Medically impossible.

759
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,260
It's not really hard to believe.

760
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,460
It's just hard for you to accept.

761
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:41,000
Medically impossible.

762
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,780
God.

763
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,160
Castrate him.

764
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,900
Good heavens.

765
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:45,760
Jesus.

766
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,700
Oh, my God.

767
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,120
Ah!

768
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,760
Ah!

769
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,200
Ah!

770
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,720
You can hit me while I whip this out.

771
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,280
Ah!

772
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,840
Guard.

773
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,180
Castrate him.

774
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,840
Don't.

775
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,100
Don't let me pass.

776
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:00,860
Guard.

777
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,500
Castrate him.

778
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,720
This is not a haphazard maneuver.

779
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,920
Careful planning for it started months back.

780
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,000
Get another couple and get a blonde limbo.

781
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,600
Well, the joke's on you.

782
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,340
I'm not even a real blonde.

783
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:14,900
Beware.

784
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,520
Beware of the big green.

785
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,420
Dragon that sits on your doorstep.

786
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,060
He eats little boys.

787
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,860
Boys have such a kind.

788
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,700
I've got tails.

789
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:29,720
Ah!

790
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,380
Big.

791
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:31,200
Ah!

792
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,520
Rats.

793
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,180
Ah!

794
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:33,400
Ah!

795
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,800
Ah!

796
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,040


797
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,980
Ah!

798
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,080
Ah!

799
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,280
Ah!

800
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,740
Ah!

801
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:39,940
Ah!

802
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,000
Ah!

803
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:40,560
Ah!

804
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,560


805
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:40,620
Ah!

806
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:41,900
Ah!

807
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:41,900


808
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,100
Ah!

809
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,660
Ah!

810
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:42,660


811
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:42,660


812
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,200
Ah!

813
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,200


814
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,680
Ah!

815
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:44,680


816
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:44,680


817
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:44,680


818
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,480
Ah!

819
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:51,800
Ah!

820
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:51,800


821
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:51,800


822
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:51,800


823
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:51,800


824
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,640
Kani is spewing, too, by

825
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,420
reverend protectrix Amazonia...

826
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,660
Ding, ding!

827
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,080
Ding, ding!

828
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,460
Isn't a boy named

829
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:04,720
Sid Lam in heaven?

830
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,200
He cannot leave the back

831
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,320
of the EMS vehicle

832
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,920
singing to the various

833
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,200
crippled victims

834
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,000
of the gerbling problems.

835
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,840
I guess we want to call them problems.

836
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,920
Somebody was clearly at fault

837
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,300
and didn't want to take...

838
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,360
Didn't want to take credit.

839
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,580
Well, if you don't feed the gerbil, what do you think's going to happen?

840
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,520
Soon, the gerbil becomes very hungry.

841
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,220
As his belly becomes hollow and his skin becomes slick,

842
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,400
as the hair falls out and his eyes grow weak, he will bite at anything.

843
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,680
At the last minute, I will substitute the starving gerbil for the healthy one.

844
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,400
We're just about ready now.

845
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,360
The master won't suspect until it's too late.

846
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,460
He humiliates you.

847
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,120
That's the only...

848
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,300
Come here, cutie. Hey, come here.

849
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,860
Did you hear what I said? I said, come here.

850
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,220
Come here, daddy. You look so good.

851
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,960
I will talk to the girl.

852
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,380
She's going to plan.

853
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,260
I know I cannot verify it, but I feel that she will understand.

854
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,380
There is no escape.

855
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,420
Oh.

856
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,400
Oh.

857
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,300
Oh.

858
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:51,500
Oh.

859
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,580
Oh.

860
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,900
Oh.

861
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:58,960
Oh.

862
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,180
Oh.

863
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,380
Oh.

864
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,140
Oh.

865
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,340
Oh.

866
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,120
Oh.

867
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,140
Oh.

868
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,260
Oh.

869
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:06,300
Oh.

870
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,300


871
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,340
Oh.

872
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,340


873
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:06,340


874
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,700
I have a mission to perform.

875
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,660
Give me some more.

876
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,060
Very well.

877
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,220
I will recalculate.

878
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,220
Oh.

879
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,880
Really?

880
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,860
Mmm.

881
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,240
Esquire, what's that?

882
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,280


883
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,280


884
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,280


885
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,300
See that's the secret.

886
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,500
This is it.

887
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,200
Undead and police?

888
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:44,900
It's fake.

889
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:44,900


890
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:44,900


891
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:44,900


892
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,240
The things you are interested in?

893
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,060
наверное.

894
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,100
How?

895
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,880
I want to see the girl Alice again.

896
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,300
Beautiful face, monsieur.

897
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,080
Oh, yes, of course.

898
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:05,980
You remember her.

899
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,920
She drove everyone crazy.

900
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,740
Ah, the woman was for herself.

901
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,580
Oh, jeez.

902
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,980
She was at the Oyster Bar one time

903
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,460
and she was clipping the cathedral,

904
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,600
as we used to call it.

905
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,900
She was making time with a one-eyed man.

906
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,720
Man, there they were,

907
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,760
exchanging spit in the middle of the barbecue hour.

908
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,520
No man blinded me.

909
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,320
She was no good.

910
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,240
She was no bad, you know.

911
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,620
She looks like one of the Stepford Stepmothers.

912
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,960
I bet you can see the Latin side of her

913
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,260
when you turn her upside down.

914
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,480
I bet she's got one of those little fuzzy monkeys, eh?

915
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,580
Oh, no, you shake her and...

916
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,400
Probably goes all the way up to her belly button, huh?

917
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,720
Bob, you don't even know who he is

918
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,560
and you might miss him

919
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,380
if you didn't have a real good look at him.

920
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,680
You wouldn't even know who he looked like.

921
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,880
They don't believe I'm Christ, do they?

922
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,060
If we're gonna stop them,

923
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,420
they're gonna kill us all!

924
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,360
They don't believe I'm Christ, do they?

925
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:00,840
No.

926
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,020
Do you feel blamed?

927
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,400
Are you mad?

928
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,220
I will pull your goddamn tongue out of the road!

929
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,080
If you didn't have a real good look at him,

930
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,240
you wouldn't have known how you were like.

931
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,160
You knew you haven't got an excuse,

932
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,620
but I've done all kinds of things.

933
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,160
I will pull your goddamn tongue out of the road!

934
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,560
I will pull your goddamn tongue out of the road!

935
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,480
There will be no excuse!

936
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,200
Thank you very much.

937
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:20,920
No worries.

938
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,100
Yes.

939
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:21,560
No, I'm good.

940
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,280
No, I'm good.

941
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:23,640
No, I'm good.

942
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:23,780
No, I'm good.

943
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,320
And do you remember when you were a little girl, perhaps,

944
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,400
and your father gave you a beating?

945
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:28,880
Well, I...

946
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,260
And get ready for a shock!

947
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,220
The music that they're planning to use

948
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,220
to crumble the morals of America

949
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,500
is this rotten, filthy, dirty, lewd,

950
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,580
lascivious junk called Rock and Roll.

951
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,660
It isn't just the lyrics and the music.

952
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,380
It's all Satan's.

953
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,280
Will they dwell among the stars?

954
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,160
They make millions of trips to planet Earth daily, traveling faster than the speed of light.

955
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,300
By an interest in swearing with language that would stand a failure's hand, I'm done.

956
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,140
They attempt to de-bless, possess, and out-bless their victims.

957
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,880
Psychiatrists and psychologists are no match for these ETs.

958
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,060
Mob? Mob?

959
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
I think of Bob as a protean sex gland.

960
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:13,320
Often, when I think of myself ensconced in a little home, a little domicile on the pipe on the ring of Saturn's moon,

961
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,980
I can see little flocks of pastures of green sheep floating by,

962
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:25,040
and what do they call those, hillocks, like a little cottage with smoke curling out of it,

963
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,780
and each one resembles a pipe.

964
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,420
And I can see myself there with my own little Connie.

965
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,900
Connie of my own design, perhaps.

966
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,480
Hairy-footed, perhaps with a face much bigger than the rest of her body.

967
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,620
I like that kind, too.

968
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,260
I thought you did, and that's why I brought her up.

969
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,240
She's been calling you again, Stank.

970
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,360
That big head girl from space has been calling you, Stank.

971
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,120
You know, I think all I ever get is your machine.

972
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,780
I know you've been thinking of me.

973
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:02,380
I went back to the carnival again and went on the ferris wheel and rode the merry-go-round,

974
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,060
and all I could do was think of you.

975
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,220
Of course, it was very hard to fit my head in.

976
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,200
The merry-go-round was low-ceiling.

977
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,800
But still, I was alone.

978
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,360
And thought of you.

979
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,480
I ate a half a loaf of bread.

980
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:22,680
Then I played with myself and cried again.

981
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,340
Then I went on the ferris wheel.

982
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:30,000
I had to be restrained because my head was disturbing the other passengers.

983
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,600
And I thought of you again.

984
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,600
I went down to the boardwalk and looked at the sea.

985
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,780
And all I could see was you, Reverend.

986
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,500
Why you don't call me back sometime?

987
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,300
Well, it's really a huge little ice cream.

988
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:51,020
A woman from space will call you back again.

989
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,860
Hoping sometime you'll return my call.

990
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:54,820
Bye.

991
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,180
It's so strange.

992
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,100
You know, they...

993
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,620
All those groupies.

994
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,500
Yeah, I remember.

995
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,960
All they needed to do was to just send their $30.

996
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:13,660
To Bob.

997
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,340
And I know that's all they're trying to do is get close to Bob.

998
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,240
They think I know Bob's phone number.

999
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,220
And I do.

1000
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,740
You do.

1001
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,000
But they think I can give it to them.

1002
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,780
And I can't.

1003
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,960
I just can't.

1004
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,280
And instead of giving you their $30, what do they do?

1005
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,160
They come up to you and in time, they say something stupid.

1006
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,720
They play with your hairy feet.

1007
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,080
They talk backwards to you and try and trick you.

1008
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,000
Time is right.

1009
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:37,960
Listen to the words.

1010
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:39,960
Time, yes.

1011
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,780
How many times has this happened at Divisional?

1012
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:43,760
Every time.

1013
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,080
Every damn one.

1014
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,920
I remember the last time I was playing with Einstein's Secret Orchestra at the Divisional

1015
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,760
for the Reverend Ivan Zang of the Church of the Subgenius.

1016
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,740
We just finished a song and a rush of about 11 women.

1017
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:01,400
No, it's always 15-year-old guys with glasses.

1018
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,340
Stangly clothes.

1019
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,100
If only it was women.

1020
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,800
Yeah, if only it was women who didn't look like kind of fat guys in those weird, you know,

1021
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,720
Pendleston shirts with like...

1022
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,420
With a Bob shirt.

1023
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,420
With real thick glasses.

1024
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,700
That's too tight.

1025
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:12,820
Right.

1026
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,180
Guys that kind of look like us, you know, and only...

1027
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,880
I thought that was really good.

1028
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,180
You know, the only part I enjoy was saying, you know, they're real smart and everything.

1029
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:19,940
Yeah, but you know what?

1030
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,360
You missed this one note.

1031
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,860
I saw where you missed this note.

1032
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,860
Yeah, it looks smart and shit.

1033
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,960
And there's a link on your website.

1034
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,520
It's dead.

1035
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,000
I wanted to make sure you knew about that.

1036
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,260
You know what's wrong with those CDs?

1037
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,740
That's where they go skipping.

1038
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,180
No, man.

1039
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,040
We don't want that.

1040
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:32,420
That's a coding problem.

1041
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,340
Hi.

1042
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,280
How have you been?

1043
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,080
I'm watching you.

1044
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,080
Are you all right?

1045
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,040
Are you hungry?

1046
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,960
Can I get you anything?

1047
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,400
A cup of coffee, perhaps?

1048
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,480
A sandwich?

1049
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,700
A ham?

1050
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,000
I'd like some Guinness and some crackers.

1051
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,300
A bee job?

1052
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,320
Maybe some...

1053
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,940
Knotted nylons?

1054
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,460
Oh, yes, bees.

1055
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:48,980
Yes.

1056
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,200
I can bring you peas.

1057
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,420
Would you like some peas, honey?

1058
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,560
I can make honey for you.

1059
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,460
No, they don't talk that way.

1060
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,960
The hot Yoo-Hoo bottle?

1061
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,760
No, they don't wear Hulu skirts.

1062
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,380
They don't talk funny languages for our pleasure.

1063
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,400
No, they just say, price Bob.

1064
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,240
None of them have hair on their faces.

1065
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,380
I found my copy of Book of the Subgenius for a dollar at the cutout bin.

1066
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,680
I saw that.

1067
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,020
I'm buying it.

1068
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,520
Some of them do have the little lines, the dotted lines for the cranial implants

1069
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,060
and the place where they took off the top of their head.

1070
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:19,960
I like that.

1071
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,420
She's pretty, don't you think?

1072
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,360
You creeped her out.

1073
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,980
Actually, to be quite honest, there's been times when I've thought, maybe this is going too far.

1074
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:42,120
I would get frustrated with the sheer nerdliness of some subgeniuses, you know,

1075
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:48,840
because it just seemed like, God, I didn't know they were going to be so dysfunctional and messed up.

1076
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,360
Well, duh!

1077
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:52,620
Duh!

1078
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,480
It finally sunk in.

1079
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,360
That is what this is.

1080
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,920
That's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

1081
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,340
Of course they're fucked up and dysfunctional,

1082
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:06,600
because there really is a conspiracy of normal people sapping away their slack.

1083
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,240
And of course they're fucked up, and of course that's why Bob is their god.

1084
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:20,840
Now, friends, when X-Day didn't happen in 1998, we were so sad.

1085
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,920
We were going, oh, man, we could have had a new government that was no government at all.

1086
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:29,120
That, you know, that Bob would be the leader and he never shows up.

1087
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,720
We'd have a new church where you didn't have to get up at 7 in the morning.

1088
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,900
You could worship it drunk until midnight Saturday night in bars.

1089
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,820
We'd have a new coolness where, you know, coolness was a...

1090
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,140
completely defined by each individual uncool weirdo.

1091
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,200
Friends, so X-Day didn't happen.

1092
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,340
What are we waiting for?

1093
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,200
Do we really have to depend on some pipe-smoking dot-faced salesman

1094
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:02,920
or a bunch of aliens from outer space or a bunch of invisible monsters to make our own slack?

1095
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,240
Hell no, friends.

1096
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,560
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

1097
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,740
We must learn to think.

1098
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,280
We must learn to think for ourselves.

1099
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,020
Although only Bob can show us how.

1100
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,900
And we must.

1101
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,820
All of you had better.

1102
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,440
You must question authority.

1103
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,440
Or else, huh?

1104
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,660
We've got somebody here who's been reading their pre-scriptures.

1105
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,240
There.

1106
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
One who dares to really question authority.

1107
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,880
And, friends, really, honestly, I think that as bad as things are,

1108
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,320
if you can just...

1109
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,500
The scientific basis of slack,

1110
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:42,060
is this.

1111
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,240
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1112
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,280
Even if they help fuck them if they can't tell a joke.

1113
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,480
Yo, yeah.

1114
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,840
Y'know what time it is?

1115
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,940
If you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1116
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,920
please write to this address I'm about to give.

1117
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,520
That's b-b-b-BAAAWWWWW.

1118
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,360
That post office box.

1119
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,820
140306 Dallas, Texas.

1120
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:13,960
75214.

1121
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,800
Once again, that's box 140306 Dallas, Texas.

1122
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,240
75214.

1123
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,960
www.subgenius.com

1124
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,980
And praise the...

1125
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,680
We pulled off to the side.

1126
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,760
We just knew they weren't a ride.

1127
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,860
The sweetest quilt you'll ever know.

1128
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,040
Blow you right through the door.

1129
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,700
They'll blow you right through the barn door.

1130
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,620
A 3D script falling from the sky.

1131
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,580
You're reading a script and you're thinking...

1132
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:05,980
It's so hot.

1133
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,940
A 3D script where they're fucking unknown.

1134
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,660
A 3D script.

1135
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,320
I got a tentacle.

1136
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,120
Oh no! There's a tube!

1137
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,800
Oh, hey, tentacles!

1138
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,560
Hey, tentacles!

1139
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,800
Hey, oh, there's a tentacle!

1140
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,120
Oh my God! Oh, there's a tentacle!

1141
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,460
Oh, there's suction cups!

1142
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,360
Oh, my God!

1143
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,240
It hurts when they peel the suction cups off.

1144
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,240
I like it so much.

1145
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,120
Oh, yeah!

1146
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,600
Woo-hoo, baby!

1147
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,380
So, if

1148
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,000
you're ever out of your

1149
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,760
life, don't

1150
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,340
think you have to run high.

1151
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,980
When you see some hairy pink

1152
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,580
pink snow

1153
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,800
falling down, oh no.

1154
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,500
Hairy pink snow

1155
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,860
falling down right from the sky.

1156
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,500
Just pull on over

1157
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,360
and you'll be fine.

1158
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,740
All the hairy squid is the best best

1159
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,520
eye. Use some

1160
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,780
genius and joy to ride them.

1161
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,500
Maybe three-d squid

1162
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,120
falling from the sky.

1163
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,540
Maybe three-d squid and a

1164
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,660
hairy squid

1165
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,780
falling on the road.

1166
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,020
Maybe three-d squid

1167
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,840
that's right, the Lord!

1168
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,040
Maybe three-d squid

1169
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,100
fell from the sky

1170
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,960
in front of my car while I was

1171
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,340
driving down the high mountain.

1172
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,820
I pulled over, I opened my

1173
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:28,860
car door, and they were blowing my mind

1174
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,940
through the car door.

1175
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,240
Praise the Holy Hairy Squid.

1176
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,560
Ah, yeah!

1177
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,040
Woo-hoo!

1178
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,980
Ah, yeah!

1179
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,940
Misha wosY

1180
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:42,980
Wao!

1181
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,940
될yyyyy

1182
