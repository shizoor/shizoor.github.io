1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,780
Yowl Slack.

3
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,580
And this is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 872

4
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,900
from the year of 2000.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,340
Three.

6
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,040
I wonder if this works.

7
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
I wonder if this works.

8
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,840
All right.

9
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,980
Just tell me.

10
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,540
Just tell me whenever I'm on.

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,220
There.

12
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,040
Is that better?

13
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,520
All right.

14
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,260
All right.

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,260
All right.

16
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,040
I see.

17
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,220
I see the second hand.

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,560
Following, following, following.

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,180
All right.

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,900
Boom.

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,660
We're on.

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,920
Good hello.

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,220
This is Bud Good.

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,620
And I must inform you that Over the Edge will not be heard tonight.

25
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,180
Over the Edge has donated its time so that we can cover

26
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,720
the subgenius executive retreat direct from Sulphur Palms.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,700
And that's where I am now.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,660
Right near the gate.

29
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,580
To Sulphur Palms.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,200
I see all the subgenius out there waiting to get in.

31
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,100
And my co-host tonight will be puzzling evidence.

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,980
Founder and co-operator of the subgenius church.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,400
Hello.

34
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,360
Not the founder.

35
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,320
Is the founder here tonight?

36
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,580
I'm the only one who claims that I was not the founder.

37
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,740
Is Mr. Stang here tonight?

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,980
Reverend Ivan Stang is here tonight.

39
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,720
And so is Philodromon the Overman.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,740
Good.

41
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,240
Bishop Joey of the Church of St. Stephen.

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,240
Good.

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,280
All the executives are present it seems.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,640
And of course, the president of the church, Mr. Stang, is here tonight.

45
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:29,640


46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,140
The theme for this year is the next hundred years.

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,260
What will the next hundred years hold for the church?

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,680
That's just what I was going to ask you, puzzling.

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,480
We have to find out from the people that are attending the conference tonight.

50
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,640
The super secret conference.

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,960
This one night retreat will be devoted entirely to the next hundred years.

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,980
The future.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,320
There'll be food, music, panel discussion.

54
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,460
The title of which will be the next hundred years.

55
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,780
Don't miss our awards dinner.

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,320
The next hundred years awards.

57
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,760
Yeah.

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,620
This little mimicry.

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,120
This little draft smudge.

60
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,320
I can't tell what's coming up next.

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,800
Whoa.

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,580
Oh, I see the guard there is opening the gate now.

63
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,600
Let's bring, let them in.

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,260
Here they come.

65
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,160
It looks like Ivan Stang.

66
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,860
And there's Bishop Joey.

67
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,020
Bishop Joey, our first executive.

68
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,820
I can't find my, I have my ticket reservation, but I don't think I have my,

69
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,380
the code number, but can I get my badge anyway?

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Is it okay?

71
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,380
Yeah, here, you're laminated.

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,460
Let's get it backstage.

73
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,060
Thanks.

74
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,580
Okay.

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,100
Do you have to buy the lanyard too?

76
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,920
Are you paying for the lanyard?

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,060
It's a highly technical evening here where we have all of these.

78
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,880
Oh, there we are.

79
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,040
I see.

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,000
I couldn't see where I was.

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,820
My space helmet was all fogged up.

82
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,360
I wonder if I have permission to hand out some flyers for my church.

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,800
It's going to be perhaps a little bit of a trying evening, folks.

84
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,680
We have to go through the entire process of imbibing the church, as you will.

85
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,700
We take it and drink the whole church.

86
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,040
We go through the business aspect.

87
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,380
I see Ivan Stang over there on the other side of the field, and Lies.

88
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,160
I thought they all were trying to get in here.

89
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,400
Where are all the subgenius?

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,300
There's a new bass player for the band.

91
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,580
The schedules weren't printed out out there at the table in the lobby.

92
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,380
Philo is wandering around confused about where to go.

93
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,600
We don't have some of their mics up.

94
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,400
We have remote ambience mics located all over Sulphur Palm.

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:19,980
There's Papa Joe Mama over there.

96
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,700
There's Inez.

97
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,800
Which we can tune into and see what's going on wherever they happen to be.

98
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,220
I think Ivan Stang doesn't like the little,

99
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,480
the little umbrella.

100
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,240
The umbrella's in his drink.

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,860
Could you tell me where the buffet is?

102
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,020
I'd like to start out with a buffet.

103
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,900
It's behind, it's behind that big tent right there.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,540
Thank you.

105
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,540
Is the buffet here?

106
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,380
What kind of a chimpanzee zoo is this?

107
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,840
I can't believe this.

108
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,100
Do I have to be running?

109
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,560
It's a business meeting.

110
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,860
Look how it's turning.

111
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,160
Oh, there's Mr. Stang.

112
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,920
Yeah, they're hidden away over there.

113
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,200
What do you expect?

114
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,860
Get behind the front and figure out which little space helmet has a

115
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,540
I'm scared.

116
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,100
vibrator on it.

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,660
Oh, look.

118
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,580
There's a little queen of UFOs.

119
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,460
I like that.

120
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,800
Buzzing around the outside of the ship.

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,760
I'd like to ask Mr. Stang a question.

122
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,340
As the founder of the subgenius church.

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:04,740
What?

124
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:04,880
What?

125
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,640
Which network are you with?

126
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:06,920
No, he's not the founder.

127
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm with UMN.

128
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,740
Oh, yeah, okay.

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,200
What?

130
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,980
This is Bud Good.

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm with UMN, Puzzling Evidence.

132
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,740
Oh, Bud Good, right.

133
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,340
Yes.

134
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,560
Bud.

135
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,120
So as the founder of the subgenius church.

136
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,540
That's, that's very funny.

137
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,220
After all these years.

138
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,680
Praise Bob.

139
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,940
Trial and tribulation, murder, divorce.

140
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,260
I don't know what's been going on.

141
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,960
But, but how do you feel?

142
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,960
What do you, but that is rather a personal question.

143
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:43,960
How do I, if I use my fingers, my, my, if I reach out with my senses, I, I, in, I let

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,360
the, the, the sensory world wash over me.

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
That is how I feel.

146
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,380
In other words.

147
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,160
As a holy man.

148
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,180
In all these years, you've learned nothing.

149
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,460
I put my fingers out.

150
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,800
I touched.

151
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,580
Nothing is what we strive for, Bud.

152
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,340
I understand.

153
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,080
That was a compliment.

154
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,200
But yes, we're, oh, thank you.

155
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,680
Thank you.

156
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,660
I too have learned nothing.

157
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,800
Whatever.

158
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,380
If I said, yeah.

159
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,400
Did I say that?

160
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,480
Then pick up on it.

161
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,580
Now we're going to move right to the organized part of the show right now.

162
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,520
Uh, the, all these subgenius executives are moving into the lodge where they will sit

163
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
around a, a long oblong square oval tables place.

164
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,420
It has a big vacuum.

165
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,460
With a big hole in the middle.

166
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,120
And they will have the, the next hundred years panel discussion, the subgenius church, the

167
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
next hundred years.

168
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,160
Why?

169
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,640
Whence Dobbs and why?

170
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,840
Whence Dobbs?

171
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,380
That's his brother.

172
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,060
Wencesla Dobbs, Polish Dobbs.

173
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,620
Good King.

174
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,240
Whence the high pop?

175
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Whence it doesn't work at all.

176
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,240
No, we've already got an eight, four, eight, four, four, three, five.

177
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,440
It might be Michael Pepe who was invited to come with us.

178
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,180
Traipsing through this field at, uh, at midnight here.

179
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,480
We're out looking at the moon.

180
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,100
Do between our toes waiting for the business.

181
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,360
Report.

182
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,080
How many, uh, subgenius executives do we have here tonight?

183
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,040
Is it a full forum?

184
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
It really is amazing.

185
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,900
Onan is here.

186
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
Papa Joe mama is here.

187
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,740
Some of these people might not appear on Mike though.

188
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,160
Dr. Howell is here.

189
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,240
But his microphone is turned all the way down as always.

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,220
He is not here.

191
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
Dr. Howell is not here.

192
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,780
He's not?

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
No, he's not.

194
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,680
Wait a minute.

195
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,020
If, if that, what then are we now?

196
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,100
You're not Dr. Howell.

197
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,600
Are we now in the panel discussion?

198
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Who's that guy?

199
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,960
He always votes against.

200
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,520
Against the majority.

201
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,460
So we, uh, we tricked him out of town for this weekend.

202
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,180
So if it does come to a vote tonight, it should be unanimous.

203
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,380
Okay.

204
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,320
Here's the Howell mask.

205
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,540
Oh, I thought that was.

206
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,400
Oh, little tiny.

207
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,060
Well, I wish you radio listeners could see this.

208
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,980
Uh, how hilarious.

209
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,620
Reproduction death mask of Dr. Howell.

210
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,820
Too bad.

211
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,620
We don't have any tapes of him to go with that mask.

212
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,480
Oh, he'll appear later in the show.

213
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm sure there are hours and oodles and hours of show tonight, folks.

214
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,840
Here puzzling.

215
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,920
Look, I have my own mic.

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,200
So actually you can use this one and somebody else can use that one.

217
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,740
I'm a little worried about that.

218
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,100
I have my special U.M.N.

219
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,060
remote mic tonight as we wander around the grounds here.

220
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,080
As far as wants to mix the show.

221
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,800
Sulfur palm.

222
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,420
And, uh, uh, they are, I see.

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,420
The Christmas trees are lighting up like a phone.

224
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,620
Oh, I don't see anything.

225
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,780
Which one is that guy?

226
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,660
Are they going to turn on the lights or what?

227
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,040
Is that that guy?

228
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,120
Hello?

229
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,600
Hello?

230
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,000
So, uh, typical college radio, uh-huh.

231
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
I see what's happening.

232
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,940
Can I be the first caller?

233
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,340
Yes, you can.

234
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:39,820
Go ahead.

235
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,880
Well, I'd like to talk to Gary Gabrogfan.

236
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,520
I heard he's going to be on the radio this morning.

237
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,400
Yes, he is.

238
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,720
We're trying to keep his mic down.

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,820
Is he cool?

240
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,900
Well, I'm going to sleep.

241
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,720
This show is terrible.

242
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,740
What time does the band start?

243
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,440
No, he's here.

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,900
Go ahead.

245
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,580
Speak to him.

246
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,300
Yeah, the drums aren't even out of the box yet.

247
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,460
Yeah.

248
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,480
The drums aren't even out of the box yet.

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,340
Not you, caller.

250
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,720
But you know who we have?

251
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,520
Ivan Stang.

252
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,160
Oh, yes.

253
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,840
The queen of UFOs lies.

254
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,920
Hang on, hang on.

255
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,300
I know, Truman.

256
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

257
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,520
Hello?

258
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,220
Oh, yes.

259
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,620
Good hello.

260
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,580
Um, I just have one question.

261
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,160
Um, I want to send you some vinyl that I'm going to be getting, you know, records.

262
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
Oh, is this a personal message?

263
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,420
Oh, geez, we have to stop the show.

264
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,040
We can't really deal with personal messages on the air.

265
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,460
This is full-time entertainment here.

266
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,960
All right, I'm sorry.

267
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,220
Bye-bye.

268
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,320
Yeah, no, that's okay.

269
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,300
What were you going to send me?

270
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,200
Oh, um, some vinyl, you know, because my grandfather had some, like, records from World War II.

271
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,900
Is there any sound on this vinyl?

272
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,460
Oh, yes.

273
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:35,940
Oh, good.

274
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,380
Oh, yes.

275
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,200
Uh, okay, my question was, should I send it to your, uh, the address on your website?

276
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,420
Uh, no.

277
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,220
Well, what's that one?

278
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,540
I forget.

279
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,940
I don't know.

280
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,040
Um, well, I'll just email somebody, I guess, and I'll get the information.

281
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,120
Just had that prediction about burning it.

282
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,860
Yeah, email me through the website.

283
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
I'll tell you where to send it.

284
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,460
Okay.

285
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,280
Have a good day.

286
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Thank you.

287
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,440
I appreciate all the contributions.

288
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,240
Yes, that was a distraction.

289
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,120
I think it's a disturbing prediction that Dobbs made about Burning Man disappearing by the year 2037.

290
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,580
The church just takes everything and folds it inside themselves.

291
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,460
It's a shimmers down this path.

292
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,100
Now, caller, you're listening and talking to the amazing

293
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,420
lowerarchy of the subgenius church, started over two decades ago in the spooky town of Dallas.

294
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,420
Executive lowerarchy.

295
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
Not to be confused with the real hierarchy, which started in 1953.

296
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,160
Right.

297
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,620
It is confusing.

298
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,200
It's a church.

299
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,880
It's a religion.

300
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,080
It's a religion.

301
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,220
But that was just Dobbs and Allen.

302
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,900
It's just Alfred Hitchcock and Dennis Hopper and a few other select individuals.

303
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:31,960
Dennis Hopper was the team.

304
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,340
I feel like I'm descending down the rabbit hole of business.

305
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,320
We're heading up to some point.

306
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,240
We really need the...

307
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,640
This is just like a James Bond set.

308
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,420
Where's the drummer?

309
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,060
It is on the set spot.

310
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,640
Oh, the drummer's in for the spider.

311
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,580
Well, I can see we're going to have some problems getting to the panel.

312
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,660
People just don't want to be that organized here.

313
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,860
Okay, great.

314
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,320
So it's going to be so much fun.

315
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,560
Oh yeah, that's really good.

316
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,740
Plus, David Meyer is supposed to be calling in today.

317
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh, great.

318
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,280
Because I was really hoping other Doctores would happen like...

319
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,340
Byron Werner's here.

320
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
I like the way you made that up.

321
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,420
Doctores.

322
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,960
Who are these guys talking about?

323
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
I vaguely remember these names from some time in the...

324
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,560
David Meyer, he's a skier.

325
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,640
Who is it?

326
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,040
Cowboy Dave is here.

327
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,900
But he's partying upstairs.

328
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,040
Famous long ago.

329
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,520
Dinosaurs of slack.

330
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,220
Wow.

331
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,120
A digital insert here.

332
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,840
Back in the day...

333
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
That is day one.

334
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,220
The truth.

335
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,600
Was that the Permian or the Devonian or the carbonation?

336
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,220
Carbon cycrane.

337
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,480
Or the carbon fiber age.

338
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,040
The carbonated peanut butter got all over the microphone and was not usable for the rest of the show.

339
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,980
Yes, it...

340
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,240
Neither was Hal, so...

341
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,820
And it tickled my nose.

342
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,980
That's your nose?

343
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:48,500
What?

344
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,120
Uh oh.

345
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,900
Where's the prop workshop, please?

346
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,180
Somebody gave her coffee.

347
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,820
Hey, I was wondering about that.

348
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,740
Where is the frock wor...

349
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,320
The frock...

350
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,200
The frock workshop.

351
00:11:59,560 --> 00:11:59,860
The frock workshop.

352
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,560
The frock workshop.

353
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,120
Uh, now I feel like the...

354
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,700
What was it we were doing was the...

355
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,140
The frock intensive.

356
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,740
We have to start again.

357
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,040
Let's begin the show now.

358
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
The subgenius radio show.

359
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,920
Get everybody lined up first.

360
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,340
Everybody has to be lined up.

361
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:12,700
Ken?

362
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


363
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,860
Is this those shots again?

364
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,960
That's one of those inspections.

365
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,260
Line them up and shot.

366
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,140
When does the horrible theme music begin?

367
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140
When do we get to go to Malaysia?

368
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,940
All right, who's hosting this panel?

369
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
I guess you should be, but...

370
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I think Mr. Stank should host this.

371
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,260
The panel of the next hundred years.

372
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,680
Well, he's certainly the primary easement.

373
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,740
As we gather together to commence this august assemb...

374
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,600
Wait, what?

375
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,380
Now that's...

376
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,980
Who's here?

377
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:39,300
Is he drunk?

378
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,800
That sounds too definite.

379
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,680
It's not August.

380
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,740
I mean, actually, it's a big question.

381
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,640
The next hundred years.

382
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:45,920


383
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,220
It is a huge question.

384
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,900
And we should...

385
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,160
And we really need Philo Drummond.

386
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,420
He can barely stand up.

387
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,480
He's who we need because he's the business manager,

388
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,280
the closest to giving everybody the business

389
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,780
of all the doctors here.

390
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:56,780


391
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,420
Actually, Jesus replaced Philo.

392
00:12:59,420 --> 00:12:59,740
Oh, yeah.

393
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,160
No, no.

394
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,060
But I mean, here tonight.

395
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,900
Because Jesus is not here, unfortunately.

396
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,880
He's not with us.

397
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
He's busy during the season.

398
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,660
Right, yeah.

399
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,120
This is his...

400
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,520
The season of turnover.

401
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,120
Yep.

402
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,760
And he couldn't be with us, which would be great.

403
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,500
But so the closest we have to an old-fashioned business man is...

404
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,380
Philo Drummond.

405
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,160
Because Philo Drummond works for the conspiracy.

406
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,820
Always has.

407
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,400
Always will.

408
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:19,900
Yep.

409
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,720
Well, it's a good deal.

410
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,680
Jesus or...

411
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,040
Jilo.

412
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,080
You don't say Jilo.

413
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,200
Jilo.

414
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,500
Jilo.

415
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:26,780
Jilo.

416
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:26,780


417
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:26,940
Jilo.

418
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,660


419
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,420
I've got a Philo like no Philo you've ever seen.

420
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,420
Jilo.

421
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,120
Jilo the Torturer.

422
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
He's the most tortured businessman.

423
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,620
He's gonna replace Bob.

424
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,380
Yeah, everybody's tired of Bob.

425
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,680
We got this new Jilo there.

426
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,700
The flash is gonna bounce off that little glass window.

427
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
We're gonna make a million bucks off Jilo.

428
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,940
Flashing me.

429
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,400
He smokes a cigarette instead of a pipe.

430
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,740
Okay, set up with a banjo.

431
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,160
Which guy?

432
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,200
The Eeyore of the church?

433
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,560
I think everything is...

434
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,680
Jilo Dummond.

435
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,340
What about all these...

436
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,540
Jilo was held in...

437
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,240
Great honor by the tribe.

438
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,060
I don't know why...

439
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,340
The M. Jilo Dummond.

440
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,200
See, we just invented another church.

441
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,640
Bud Good's just given up.

442
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,960
They never say...

443
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,780
Well, that's that...

444
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,440
I see someone over at the cappuccino stand.

445
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,540
Everybody here knows how to say...

446
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,340
Praise Jilo.

447
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:09,660
Hee!

448
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,920
Hee!

449
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,140
Hee!

450
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,100
Hee!

451
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,800
Hee!

452
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,260
Hee!

453
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,380
Hee!

454
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:15,980
Hee!

455
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,000
Hee!

456
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,160
Hee!

457
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,400


458
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,480


459
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,580
Hee!

460
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:16,620
Hee!

461
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,260
Hee!

462
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,220
Hee!

463
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,360
Hee!

464
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,360


465
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,360


466
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,400
Hee!

467
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,400


468
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,400


469
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,640
Hee!

470
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:18,700
Hee!

471
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:18,880
Hee!

472
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:18,900


473
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:18,900


474
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:18,900


475
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:18,900


476
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,260


477
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,460


478
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,000


479
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,580
Hee!

480
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:25,980
Hee!

481
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,720
Heee!

482
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,420
Hee!

483
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:32,420


484
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,740
Well, you know, also it's regional.

485
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,000
There is the California...

486
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,460
Hee!

487
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,320
Hee!

488
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,880
Hee!

489
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,080
Hee!

490
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,580
Hee!

491
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,760
And what was the Texas one?

492
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,420
Well, the original Dramundian.

493
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Hee!

494
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,340
Hee!

495
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,540
Hee!

496
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:43,900
Hee!

497
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,120
Hee!

498
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Hee!

499
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,340
Hee!

500
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,780
Which became messy very quickly.

501
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,300
Well, that's why it was truncated.

502
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,940
Way in the background.

503
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,980
You gotta get by a mic there.

504
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,660
Filo drumming.

505
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,540
Politically correct.

506
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:52,940
Mic that, too.

507
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,880
Over by the stage.

508
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh, my God.

509
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:54,560


510
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:54,560


511
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:54,560


512
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,220
Mike that Dr. Drummond.

513
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,020
Yes, make that whole other room.

514
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,160
How about this mic? Does it work?

515
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,480
But as we've asked for 20 years,

516
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,600
is this church to devolve into nothing but inside joke squeals and funny sounds?

517
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,840
I second that.

518
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,580
And for 20 years it has done exactly that.

519
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,860
Praise Bob!

520
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,420
Praise Jilo!

522
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,640
Oh, yeah, that's right, Jilo!

523
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,080
Praise Jilo!

524
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,980
Let's go back to the old church.

525
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,620
Oh, check, check, check.

526
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,580
Yeah, the old church.

527
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,800
Back in time.

528
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,620
Watch those calendar pages all the way.

529
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,720
Laurie's birthday party. That's an amazing one.

530
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,220
Am I on?

531
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,700
That was a pretty good one.

532
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,240
That was...

533
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,780
So we'll talk about that later, but right now, folks...

534
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,320
Dr. Richard's not going to die.

535
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,800
The man can get back to his dream.

536
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,660
Dr. Esselstyn.

537
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,840
Jesus, Bob.

538
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,620
Are you dumping it?

539
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,720
All right, boys.

540
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,240
The proceeds from the last Janer tape amounted to $100 million.

541
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,820
About $15769.

542
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
And of course, with the...

543
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,580
Janer, and there was Sterno.

544
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,360
At 12% each, that means you all get here.

545
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,740
$678.

546
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,880
Nine.

547
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:14,940
That's it.

548
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,620
Buck naked.

549
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
You're not allowed to say buck naked in the church no more.

550
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,080
There are all these Texan churches, but we'll just turn off that sound effect.

551
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,640
If you go right to church...

552
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,060
If you go right to church...

553
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,580
Trial number 18.

554
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,640
We can say buck naked.

555
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,340
You've been chosen from the Christmas tree of callers, and you now can address the show

556
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:28,820
doctors.

557
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,440
Please ask your question.

558
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,900
848-442-3.

559
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,340
848-442-3.

560
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,060
What's that?

561
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,620
A dude.

562
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
Is there other...

563
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,980
What's one of those Zen questions, apparently?

564
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,840
Five hours of...

565
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,100
If you consider yourself a musician...

566
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,620
No, no, no.

567
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,060
I didn't say do your show on our show.

568
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,920
He does that on our show, too.

569
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,240
Oh.

570
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Oh, he does.

571
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,180
He does that on all the shows.

572
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,020
Oh, I have a question.

573
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,900
I got an answer.

574
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,760
Yes, I was wondering, is it all right if I knock my friend out with a shovel and bury

575
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,840
him in the backyard like they did in that one Beavis and Butt-Hitch?

576
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,320
You said one Beavis and Butt-Hitch?

577
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Good.

578
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:04,700
Hello.

579
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,640
If you mark the grave clearly.

580
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,620
Okay.

581
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,540
Only if you videotape it and send it to America's Funniest Home Videos.

582
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,660
Because if you don't tape it, it didn't happen.

583
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,580
Right, exactly.

584
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,600
And if it...

585
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,300
Not only that, nowadays, why everybody tapes everything, if it doesn't appear somehow on

586
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,560
TV, it didn't happen.

587
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,600
Well, I can always play it on the underground TV.

588
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:23,940
So they're...

589
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,080
Well, that's sort of how it is.

590
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,240
Our funniest home internment.

591
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,120
But really, you should be asking the question of the doctor.

592
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,540
You have an amazing opportunity here to go back to the beginning.

593
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,000
I would like to know what's going to happen in the next hundred years.

594
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,240
If there's still going to be LSD available.

595
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
Well, there hasn't been any available.

596
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,200
Of course.

597
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,700
So if it's ever going to be available again in the next hundred years, I'd like to know

598
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,120
what's going to happen in the Middle East.

599
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,560
I'd like to know if religion...

600
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,100
Two months.

601
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,120
I'd like to wait two months.

602
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,920
And then the new little...

603
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,380
Well, why don't you just take that acid trip there and just relax there, buddy.

604
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,920
And then a hundred years from now, there'll be this...

605
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,440
A skull with just these two metal teeth.

606
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:53,900
...tucking around.

607
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,340
Talking about the Middle East.

608
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,720
You talk about Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois.

609
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,900
You know, there's nothing to trip about, man.

610
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,280
You know, the world ends.

611
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,880
The world ends.

612
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,340
You know?

613
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,680
What about that LSD I sold you last night on Telegraph Avenue?

614
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,640
What about all that LSD we sent to the Middle East last year?

615
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:06,880
Ah, okay.

616
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
What about all the LSD we just took just an hour ago?

617
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,180
Oh, that LSD!

618
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,520
That LSD!

619
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,620
I was wondering.

620
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,560
That explains a lot.

621
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,040
That explains a hell of a lot.

622
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,100
It does, though, huh?

623
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,720
What?

624
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,660
Hello?

625
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,660
I should have given up that acid again.

626
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,060
Are we going to get hit by a meteor?

627
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,220
We'll talk to my friend LSD, Tripp.

628
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,500
Then he'll hook you up for good.

629
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,880
You should know the one in half-acid shows.

630
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,100
You're just going to drown in your own natural stupidity.

631
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,740
Don't worry about it.

632
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,680
I don't know.

633
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,880
Good God.

634
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,280
Okay.

635
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,860
You're rocking out already.

636
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,840
We'd like a little play for you out there in Radioland.

637
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,040
Is there something that kind of goes in something like this?

638
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,480
That's a little something, all right.

639
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,860
Yeah, it's a nice song, though.

640
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,700
You know, really, the past, the present, and the future is just one big cycle.

641
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,320
I believe.

642
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,560
I know what you mean.

643
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,040
All right.

644
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Like, I'll give you something you did.

645
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,080
Go to the end, but you're doing it again.

646
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,180
Are you guys really entertaining, or is that just the drugs talking?

647
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,840
Does anybody have any idea how loud my new guitar is?

648
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,240
Yeah, you want to show us?

649
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,720
You won't even believe how loud it is.

650
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,580
I thought this was the business meeting, and you guys are still tuning up your so-called band.

651
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,440
Well, this is actually the next so-called band.

652
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,520
It is.

653
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
Business meeting?

654
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,020
It is.

655
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,180
It is.

656
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,620
It is.

657
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:21,760
It is.

658
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,500
Rules of order, man.

659
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,860
Well, he's doing his business meeting with the description of how far down the church

660
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,560
has gone and how far up it's going to go.

661
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,340
I am not the fan of religion, but I'm sure that the religious people would like to hear

662
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:34,920
on the air.

663
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,180
Uh-oh.

664
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,000
Uh-oh.

665
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,300
True church.

666
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,880
Was that Jilo himself that just called in?

667
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,600
Yeah.

668
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,060
Church blue church.

669
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Because you notice he didn't use a phone.

670
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,620
I find it to be dangerous, prejudicial, childish.

671
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,600
And now I think we need to realize that it's uncomfortable that it could get you killed.

672
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,140
But really, buddy, in 2008, the Jilo thing was over.

673
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,240
That's what I'm talking about.

674
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:05,100
And facing 2009, the Church of the Subgenus was again left with the burning question,

675
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,280
where does the church go for the next 91 years?

676
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Well, according to the science of psyche history, the Stang Plan calls for Jilo to be retired

677
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,740
fairly soon, within the next five or ten minutes.

678
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:33,060
And then we have to move on to the next deity, the merchant prince, who is apparently some

679
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,060
kind of pop star.

680
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,960
Let's trade the church for a winning lottery ticket.

681
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,160
You said Jilo.

682
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,900
No, Jilo.

683
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,380
That's the new Bob, or the anti-Bob, or something like that.

684
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:44,940
Okay.

685
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,580
It was according to the...

686
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,320
It's based on Michael Pepe.

687
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,160
Have you ever noticed how Sulphur Lake sounds just like a...

688
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,380
Oh, Jilo.

689
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,380


690
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,300
It's like a mist game.

691
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,980
Yeah, only it really stinks.

692
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,540
Yeah.

693
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,080
And when are they going to change the lid?

694
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,800
And they built a little town.

695
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,020
Oh, it's a stinky mist.

696
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,040
RJ came from there.

697
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,060
Well, then why did we decide to hold this business conference here?

698
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,780
I thought we were supposed to.

699
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,500
It smells horrible.

700
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,420
It smells really okay.

701
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,300
Let's everybody get some hot butter rum martinis and just relax.

702
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,580
Let's doctor sit in there.

703
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,120
Just concentrate on the matter at hand.

704
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,460
Throw them into the shark pond.

705
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,480
Right over there.

706
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
This is great.

707
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,120
Look what I got.

708
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,160
Oh, the sea bugs.

709
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,660
Oh, the sea bugs.

710
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, the sea bugs.

711
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,880
Got five cereals to eat.

712
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,620
Yeah, they'll eject any of them at any time.

713
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,280
What?

714
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,900
What am I...

715
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,240
What were you saying, Dr. Evidence?

716
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,020
I said I got some fried dinosaur legs over here.

717
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,700
Hard as rock.

718
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,340
Five?

719
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,260
Sure.

720
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,080
For a dollar.

721
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,980
Five kinds of dinosaurs, you say?

722
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,140
You buy the year 2003, you'll all be eating frozen dinosaur legs.

723
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,820
What is the...

724
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,140
It looks like the climate's staying speaking in the main hall.

725
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,640
It looks like something's happening in here.

726
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,720
It's like explosions are...

727
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,020
You'll all be eating frozen mammoth burgers by the year...

728
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,820
What was that here?

729
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,940
We need to get the plumber up here.

730
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,880
Get the building guy back here.

731
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,240
This thing isn't working right.

732
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,660
It's making all kinds of noise.

733
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,900
Hey, so Philo, are we going to get to any business, you know?

734
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,180
I mean, are you going to give us a business?

735
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,720
Well, yeah, but we're waiting for everybody to get here.

736
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,620
No, you're waiting for the script to get here.

737
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,540
Oh, for God's sake.

738
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,500
Everybody's here.

739
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:19,620
Everybody's here.

740
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


741
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


742
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


743
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


744
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


745
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


746
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,620


747
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,000
We've been waiting forever for that.

748
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,360
I've been waiting for over 20 years for that.

749
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,320
Yeah, the script didn't hear you.

750
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,640
At least I don't have my part yet.

751
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,780
Everybody's here.

752
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,600
They're all seated.

753
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,220
Everybody all got their parts yet?

754
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,380
That's what my script says.

755
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,520
Okay, do we have an invocation here on the show?

756
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,380
Yes.

757
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,500
Could we open with a prayer?

758
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,260
What is that noise?

759
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,340
That's some...

760
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,980
That's some...

761
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,360
That's some...

762
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,100
Wambling.

763
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
...sacred noise of some kind.

764
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,240
All right.

765
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,040
The panel is about to begin.

766
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,980
Let's have genius...

767
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,680
Look, the place is filled.

768
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,040
...the next 100 years.

769
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,620
I can't believe all these people are here.

770
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:49,620


771
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:49,620


772
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,700
All these people are here to hear us.

773
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,660
And now the prayer.

774
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,680
Now I lay me down to sleep.

775
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,260
Amen.

776
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,900
Good frop, good meat, good God, let's eat.

777
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,060
Have at it, boys.

778
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,180
Okay.

779
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,580
All right.

780
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:04,580


781
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,600
Go ahead and cut open the sacrificial whatever that thing is.

782
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,080
The sacrificial...

783
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,380
The sacrificial...

784
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,320
The sacrificial sucker.

785
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,220
Let's move on into the dining room.

786
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,860
The...

787
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,100
Hey, what do you think of this thing so far?

788
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,940
It's really kind of...

789
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,300
I can't believe all those guys are here.

790
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,180
It's really, you know...

791
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:23,840
It is pretty amazing.

792
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,480
That's what I'm saying.

793
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:24,820
It's great.

794
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
4-8-4-4-2-5-2.

795
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,440
See all of these amazing doctors in their amazing normal state here naked on the air.

796
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,180
Well, I thought that was the press.

797
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,800
All those guys with the cameras, those are the other doctors?

798
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,140
Yeah.

799
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,160
They just...

800
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,340
They press hard.

801
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,900
The new doctors?

802
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,500
I don't know who any of these guys are.

803
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,520
I guess I've been holed up in that...

804
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,340
If you don't, we're in trouble.

805
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,840
I've been holed up in that ivory tower in Dobstown for seven years.

806
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,360
It's been so long.

807
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,580
I don't know who any of these people...

808
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:49,580


809
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:49,920
Yeah.

810
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,500
All living beings...

811
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,060
Test, test, test.

812
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,440
Is it butter?

813
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,300
Can I have a collar?

814
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,000
Can you pass the gravy?

815
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,200
Thanks.

816
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,720
All living beings...

817
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,440
Hey, does Acid Burnout Man ever call this show?

818
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,420
No.

819
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,440
He calls the Cleveland show a lot.

820
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,920
I can hear the doctors are...

821
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,320
Some of the doctors are in there skinning their cats.

822
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,660
May the fruit of our labor repay the...

823
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:13,700
You know what they call it?

824
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,020
Oh, that's what you kids call it now.

825
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,000
They're skinning the cats.

826
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,620
They're, you know, they're taking...

827
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:17,820
They're taking the...

828
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:17,820


829
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:17,820


830
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:17,820


831
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:17,820


832
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,740
They're taking the bones out of them now and it's a really horrible, horrible thing,

833
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,620
but that's the only way they can get their instruments tuned.

834
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,540
All living beings must eat.

835
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,860
Well, it's not for food.

836
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,280
It's not...

837
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,120
They don't even eat them.

838
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,440
They just...

839
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,220
According to Big Rig...

840
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,160
They just use the cat gut to tune their instruments with.

841
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,180
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.

842
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,500
Oh, look.

843
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,480
Philo's giving a speech.

844
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,140
Cats use birds to tune their instruments with.

845
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,800
Oh, look.

846
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:03,460
They're trying to go record their Numbers too.

847
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,420
Justcles and Ar sortie says how fruit-loving animals are to watch.

848
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:04,520
That's a pleasure.

849
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


850
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


851
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


852
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


853
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


854
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


855
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


856
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,520


857
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:04,840


858
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,160
He Hunger Games is in the K에서 ahara16.

859
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,160


860
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,200
Ok.

861
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,320
Well, it's about time we Aunt Rachel and Chief Dana William on the doen.

862
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,140
Wow.

863
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,140


864
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,140


865
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:10,880
Oh, there they are.

866
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:11,420
Oh, well, they're hungry concentrating.

867
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,420


868
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:11,420


869
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,140
So, they're like, do you want to connect him with, um...

870
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,780
Or they can connect him with a radio program.

871
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,520
It sure is.

872
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,980
I'm going to take the skull down there with me.

873
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,700
It's David Meyer, actually.

874
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,600
I thought this was the Church of the Subgenius.

875
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,660
No, no, it's not.

876
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,260
That's right.

877
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,560
How did you get in here?

878
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,240
Do you have your pass?

879
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,360
No, no, this is the Church of the Duh Genius.

880
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,400
Do you have a pass?

881
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,520
How did you get in here?

882
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,720
Okay, so please ask your question.

883
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,540
You're not wearing your pass.

884
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,000
You can ask any question about the subgenius and learn amazing things secretly.

885
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,040
Especially about the next hundred years.

886
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,800
Yeah.

887
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,460
What do you want to know about the next hundred years?

888
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,840
I know about slugs.

889
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,760
Slugs?

890
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,420
Yeah.

891
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,820
Okay, what will slugs be like in the next hundred years to the Church of the Subgenius members?

892
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,740
Well, just the same as they are today.

893
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,420
Oh, that's, okay.

894
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,700
That's the good thing about slugs.

895
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,260
They just basically never change.

896
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,620
But what of progress?

897
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,540
What of evolution?

898
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,560
Something you can count on.

899
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,180
What of forward striving?

900
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,600
What of slack?

901
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,720
Slugs thumb their noses.

902
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
Can we not learn of slack from the slugs?

903
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:12,940
And a thumb.

904
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,300
They would thumb their noses at the very thought of evolutionary progress.

905
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,760
I'll bet none of you have ever seen slugs screwing.

906
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,580
Yeah, but you know what?

907
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,420
Don't bet.

908
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,460
It's bad for you.

909
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,040
You've been using drugs.

910
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,280
It can lead to addiction.

911
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,360
Well, a long time ago.

912
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,520
No, and the effects are still with you now.

913
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,300
You must have used that rock stuff that never wears off.

914
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,760
I'm sorry, you're having a flashback right now.

915
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,160
Would you please get off the ceiling?

916
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,120
Slugs are moving all in a circle.

917
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,040
Just take a deep breath.

918
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,820
You'll be okay.

919
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,420
You know what?

920
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,740
The other thing is you could be spinning out of...

921
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,700
That's what slugs do.

922
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,640
Yeah, when the slugs are having...

923
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:46,780
Slugs are spinning out of the circle.

924
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:46,780


925
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,640
...having intercourse with each other, it's really something that is very amazing.

926
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,200
They have lug...

927
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,100
Just watch that one part in Microcosmos, you know?

928
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,700
Just watch that one over and over and over again.

929
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,620
Slugs are hermaphroditic, isn't that correct?

930
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,580
I mean, some of them.

931
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,680
At least the last one that I was with was.

932
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,260
...a little...

933
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,760
Did you chew its penis off, Dr. Drummond, in order to change its sex before you used it?

934
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Well, I didn't actually have to chew it.

935
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,780
I used a surgical instrument that I keep in my back pocket just for that purpose.

936
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,780
Along the side of the ketchup bottle I keep back there as well.

937
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,180
The ketchup bottle and the slug castrator.

938
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,860
The ketchup bottle's for special effects, right?

939
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,680
The ketchup bottle, the slug castrator, and my pocket knife.

940
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,400
What is the antenna go out and becomes male and then goes back to traction and becomes female?

941
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,520
Because they do it with their antennas and...

942
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,920
They do it with their antennas.

943
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,820
They pull their antenna in and they're a female.

944
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,260
They push it out and they're a male.

945
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,760
I wish I could do that.

946
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,840
And when they're done, they stab each other with their lug, and they both get pregnant.

947
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,160
Man, now that's advanced.

948
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,740
That's the way it should be.

949
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,700
You know, they've been doing it right for thousands and thousands of years.

950
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,000
How about you read my research paper in slug nanotechnology?

951
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,940
This chicken tastes like rubber.

952
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,520
Who's catering?

953
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,060
Did you say slug nanotechnology?

954
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
I thought the quote was, this rubber tastes like chicken.

955
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,280
I'll admit.

956
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,280
Now that's what I'm talking about.

957
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:05,620
Yeah.

958
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,340
Well, bubbles.

959
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,900
Is that like the same as the bubble tech?

960
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,420
That's how I can have some cereal at 3 a.m. like I'm home.

961
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,940
Or is it, yeah, is it...

962
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,960
Is this mind programming?

963
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,460
Is this cereal technology?

964
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,460
No, it's analog.

965
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,880
Analog, okay.

966
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,460
It's analog.

967
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,900
Okay, you put it in the lug and then you squeeze the lug real hard and it comes out

968
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,340
in the back.

969
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,540
Millions of slugs emerge.

970
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah.

971
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,380
So slugs do merge slowly into the highway lanes and cause wrecks.

972
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,120
Aren't we getting ready for some kind of dinner or something we're supposed to go to

973
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,440
there?

974
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,180
I'm getting hungry.

975
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
What about you, Philo?

976
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,000
It's happening.

977
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,540
Oh, it's happening right now.

978
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:42,900
Yeah.

979
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,460
Everybody's eating and talking right now.

980
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,440
Okay, where's my chicken?

981
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


982
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


983
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


984
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


985
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


986
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


987
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,440


988
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,560
Where's my, where's my food?

989
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,660
Where's my dinner?

990
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,420
I want my dinner.

991
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:49,640
It's coming.

992
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,000
We're a little short on help tonight.

993
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,540
I'm waiting for my sandwich.

994
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,600
Your free sandwich for being on the show?

995
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,100
I'm waiting for my hooker.

996
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,240
What about the business report?

997
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,540
Everything just comes served on a silver platter by a low-trumpet.

998
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,440
Oh, the business report.

999
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,940
Investments, you know.

1000
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,660
Oh, yeah, investments.

1001
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,060
Yeah, we made some investments.

1002
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,360
We made some good ones.

1003
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
We made some bad ones.

1004
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,600
We made some ones that were good in the long haul but short in the short haul.

1005
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,160
My new slug hooker technology.

1006
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,420
The good thing about our business investments is that we're not going to have to go through

1007
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,420


1008
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,420


1009
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,600
all the processes that they continue on and we use a special secret technique that we've

1010
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,760
derived from a little atom that we got out of Bob's brain years and years ago.

1011
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,560
We put it inside of a triangle along with these crystal pyramids.

1012
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,800
This crystal pyramid.

1013
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,000
Wow, that's cool.

1014
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,620
And that does two things for us.

1015
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:43,600
It predicts the future infallibly and it helps us determine what our next week's menu will

1016
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:43,840
be.

1017
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,400
Well, it makes a banana peel straight.

1018
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,460
It makes the banana come off of the banana peel faster.

1019
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,940
And it makes the riser blade sharper.

1020
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,220
Sharper but only while you're cutting.

1021
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,540
And yet smoother and softer.

1022
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:10,220
For the softest, smoothest shave you could expect from anyone crawling along a straight

1023
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,200
riser.

1024
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,000
Leaving the trailing.

1025
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,400
Leaving the little droppings behind.

1026
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,840
The next time you hear this.

1027
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,660
The sludge trail.

1028
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,380
Oh, it sounds like we're in a storm.

1029
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,100
You kidding me?

1030
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,880
Is the prayer over?

1031
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,500
I sure hope we, uh, did we put a roof on this thing?

1032
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,680
I think the fair...

1033
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,900
Is the prayer over?

1034
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,740
I predict that the entertainment personality...

1035
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,020
The prayer is over.

1036
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,380
Okay, amen.

1037
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,860
... will be entertainment personalities and nothing else.

1038
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,600
Now, let's see.

1039
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,500
Sergeant Vredes, what were you just saying about the, uh...

1040
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,380
He's a friend of mine.

1041
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1042
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1043
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1044
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1045
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1046
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1047
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1048
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,380


1049
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,480
... the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh...

1050
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,320
I guess I should say some prediction here.

1051
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,260
The future, if you want a picture of the next...

1052
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,640
... the next hundred years.

1053
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,300
When someone pays admission to hear a singer or a comedian, they...

1054
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,720
But really...

1055
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,760
What about the...

1056
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,320
Radio isn't about pictures.

1057
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,580
It's about images.

1058
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,100
Wow, where'd you learn that?

1059
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,600
New York?

1060
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,580
Yeah, I, uh, I went to school for a lot of, you know, borrowed money, uh, all that, and

1061
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,840
that's all I came out with.

1062
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,360
So when pictures are long, they become a thing.

1063
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,360


1064
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,360


1065
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,360


1066
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,080
It was images.

1067
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:16,800
Yeah.

1068
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,120
That explains everything.

1069
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,860
That's where we went wrong.

1070
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,820
You mean JPEG?

1071
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,620
I always thought it was...

1072
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,220
You mean JPEG?

1073
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:27,940
... graphic, graphic, uh, portrayals of, of auditory devices.

1074
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,400
I promise to do better.

1075
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,100
Let's get back to the past hundred years.

1076
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,080
... graven images.

1077
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,580
Graven images.

1078
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,160
That's all it is.

1079
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,360
Makes...

1080
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,280
Let's get this next hundred years out on the table right now.

1081
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,900
Let's, let's kind of roll it around and look at it and let's see if it's what we really

1082
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,100
want to do.

1083
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,460
It will not tolerate protest messages.

1084
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,340
Let's get this next hundred years out on the table right now.

1085
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:45,340


1086
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:45,340


1087
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:51,620
Let's autopsy this hundred year plan and see what gas rises out of it.

1088
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,540
Oh man, that stinks.

1089
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:00,240
I've had some bad luck with gas recently and, uh, so I won't go there right now, but...

1090
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,300
If you, yeah, something, if you, if you have a bad smell later then...

1091
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,000
The next hundred years is...

1092
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,560
Don't look at me.

1093
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,960
... a prairie squid crawling along a straight razor forever.

1094
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,020
No, a straight edge.

1095
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,320
Just the straight edge.

1096
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,980
Yeah.

1097
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,740
Okay, cue music.

1098
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,500
No, we don't care razor, blade, anything sharp.

1099
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,400
It's gotta be sharp.

1100
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,400
It's gotta be sharp.

1101
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,340
It's gotta have a slug on it and it's gotta be in the future.

1102
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,820
And, you know, with the snorting and the pig technology in the future.

1103
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,480
There's no figure what we make for ourselves.

1104
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,780
Uh, right.

1105
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,520
So where's that one guy who's got that, that one, the one thing that's supposed to make

1106
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,140
this show the best show?

1107
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,040
Outside.

1108
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

1109
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1110
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1111
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1112
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1113
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1114
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1115
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1116
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1117
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1118
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1119
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1120
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1121
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,320


1122
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,200
Outside.

1123
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,700
He has the, oh, he has the slack and that is what we needed.

1124
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,060
We haven't let him in the back.

1125
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,420
He didn't show up again.

1126
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,660
I figured something was missing.

1127
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,620
Where is he?

1128
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,980
Where is that guy?

1129
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,340
I don't know how to unbox.

1130
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,740
Where is that pipe guy?

1131
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,420
I am, uh, uh...

1132
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,040
Where's that what?

1133
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,820
Where is that Bob Dobbs?

1134
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,280
I think, uh...

1135
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Where is that pipe guy?

1136
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,780
... I disagree with Chairman Bob.

1137
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,980
Where are those X-Men?

1138
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,480
Uh, uh...

1139
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,020
Once again, we are X-ist-less.

1140
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,380
There you'll be with the Chairman Bob.

1141
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,320
This X-ist-less-ness mess, we once again get to stay apart.

1142
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,320


1143
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,320


1144
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,320


1145
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,320


1146
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,540
It's chaotic.

1147
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,520
It's chaotic.

1148
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,620
Thanks to the non-rival of Bob's business partners, the men from Puddle Deck.

1149
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,380
I'm missing you.

1150
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,140
Oh, no.

1151
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,700
It's followed me here.

1152
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,800
I was trying to escape this horrible show.

1153
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,180
I've come all the way here to the left coast and the horrible, horrible other show has

1154
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,280
pursued me.

1155
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,640
Oh.

1156
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,420
I was trying to escape this horrible show.

1157
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,420


1158
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,420


1159
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,420


1160
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,420


1161
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:43,740
I'm sorry.

1162
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,960
I'm sorry.

1163
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,300
I'm sorry.

1164
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,740
Why, boss, why?

1165
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,000
How many more times?

1166
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,220
How many more times?

1167
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,920
How many more times?

1168
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah, we're going to start again.

1169
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,960
We're going to start the show again.

1170
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,660
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

1171
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,720
That's right, the show.

1172
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,360
Oh, man.

1173
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,940
Where are we?

1174
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,380
What town is this?

1175
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,160
Is this Los Angeles?

1176
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,140
No, we're in the Bay Area.

1177
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,320
Oh, okay.

1178
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,920
When does the show start?

1179
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,900
Right, right.

1180
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,780
Oh, should I start the tape?

1181
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,340
I don't really need him, but you never know when you can use him.

1182
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,180
Okay, now the tense, scary part of the show starts.

1183
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,820
Is this where the scary part starts?

1184
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,220
Yep.

1185
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,520
For a hundred years.

1186
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm going to get ready.

1187
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,060
For the next hundred years.

1188
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,080
To not be scared.

1189
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,140
I hear that spooky.

1190
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,620
Now, what is this, the business report?

1191
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,040
This is the business report.

1192
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,540
Or is it the end of the prayer?

1193
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,020
We finished the prayer.

1194
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:53,740
We did, okay.

1195
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,580
The prayer is over now.

1196
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,300
I did not hear an amen, but I will take your word for that.

1197
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,760
Okay, well, we don't say amen in this church.

1198
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,640
Oh, I get you.

1199
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,620
So it's sort of like you were waiting for your cue and it never came.

1200
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,000
And you didn't know that, heck, we've already been, we've been into the second part for like 10 minutes now.

1201
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,300
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1202
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,520
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

1203
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:12,980
I knew that.

1204
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,560
I knew that.

1205
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,340
Well, I knew you knew that.

1206
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,580
Intuitively, you knew it, but you didn't really have it connected in the same sequence yet.

1207
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,140
Amen.

1208
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,120
Well, we usually say, huh?

1209
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:22,980
Huh?

1210
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,500
At the end?

1211
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,140
Yeah, that's it.

1212
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,000
I didn't hear that either.

1213
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,740
We usually say, what's the amen?

1214
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:27,240
Uh-huh.

1215
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,940
We say, huh.

1216
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,500
Okay.

1217
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,540
Now, you said that, right?

1218
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,220
Uh-huh.

1219
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,640
Uh-huh.

1220
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,740
Uh-huh.

1221
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:31,860
Amen.

1222
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,400
All right.

1223
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,200
Let's get right, let's move right on into the business report.

1224
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay, well, we're going to give.

1225
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,780
Or did you give that?

1226
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,360
Yeah.

1227
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,700
Well, I'm going to, I'm going to give the business report now.

1228
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,800
Well, what was next?

1229
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,180
Okay.

1230
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,320
Well, I'm glad all of you folks could come to the church.

1231
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,400
We're going to be together tonight to hear this great business report that we have that's

1232
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,600
going to talk about the next 100 years and what's in it in the church.

1233
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:58,940
And I hope that you don't hold any of those, those allegations of abuse and corporate fraud

1234
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,740
that we have, that have been leveled.

1235
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I know, I know, I know, but really it's, it's all false.

1236
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,720
When the truth comes out, it's just, there's nothing there.

1237
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,900
I mean, it's just the emperor has no clothes.

1238
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,160
Our enemies will stop at nothing.

1239
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,260
Yeah.

1240
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,140
Our enemies do that.

1241
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,300
They've done that for years.

1242
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,620
They've gotten into our books.

1243
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,920
They've changed our ledgers.

1244
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,760
They've actually recorded things that didn't exist.

1245
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,600
And, and when the IRS came in, we didn't have any choice, but just to deny it.

1246
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,780
We weren't there and we did not do that.

1247
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,400
We didn't.

1248
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:30,960
We didn't.

1249
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,680
We really didn't.

1250
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,300
I didn't have sex with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky.

1251
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,860
Erasability, I swear.

1252
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,780
Or any other woman.

1253
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:36,860
I mean, I don't know.

1254
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,760
But, in particular, the, the allegations of abuse of the state and the...

1255
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,220
I mean, it's just not true.

1256
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:47,960
It's just not true.

1257
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,620
You don't need to go into that much detail, Dr. Drummond.

1258
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,960
So, but anyway, stocks are up, expenses are down.

1259
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,640
What about the contracts for Homeland Security?

1260
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,460
Are the, the, we've funded our, we've given our share to the funding of the Homeland Security

1261
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,760
for the, we want one of those, those Star Wars...

1262
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,180
... satellites to hover over our headquarters building.

1263
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,000
We think it's important that it be close to us.

1264
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,860
So that when the bombs, the, the, the missiles start coming, we'll, we will have our own

1265
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,740
private Star Wars defense shield.

1266
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,820
I, I spent...

1267
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,080
I know I took...

1268
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,840
I've heard those are very dependable defense shields.

1269
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,040
We had to sacrifice, well, you know, it's...

1270
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,480
We figured three out of, three out of ten is better than none out of ten.

1271
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,740
Yeah, I hear they, they work as...

1272
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:36,740


1273
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,440
... as well as computers.

1274
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:37,880
No.

1275
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,960
And besides, it's the government that's paying for it.

1276
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,480
We don't have to pay for it.

1277
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,420
It's the government that's paying for it.

1278
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,180
We don't have to pay for it.

1279
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,660
I thought that invisible hand guy was going to do it anyway.

1280
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,700
We're going to tax the land this time.

1281
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,440
We're not going to tax people anymore.

1282
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,600
We're going to tax the land.

1283
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,760
And, and once the land pays up their taxes, the people will be really happy, you know?

1284
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,280
Oh, he tried this a hundred years ago and it only got us this far.

1285
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,840
Well, we have to go...

1286
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,860
We can only go a hundred years at a time.

1287
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,920
That, that was the last hundred years.

1288
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,620
It's the smallest...

1289
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:10,900
Please.

1290
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,240
... increment we could afford...

1291
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,980
Stay focused.

1292
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,340
... at the time.

1293
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,380
And now, maybe for the next hundred years, we might break it up into like 50-year units.

1294
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,380
You know, like two big, two and a quarter...

1295
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,740
What?

1296
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,100
... 50-year units.

1297
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,080
A 50-year plan instead of a hundred-year plan?

1298
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,920
That's radical.

1299
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,300
Well, you know, the change...

1300
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,200
You're moving too fast.

1301
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,540
The pace of change has gotten to be such that we can't, we can no longer rely on the, the,

1302
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,900
the far, the, the, the outer reaches of our hundred-year plan.

1303
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,060
We've gotta, we've gotta have a more tactical approach to things.

1304
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,540
We have to know what's gonna happen, like, say, 20 minutes from now.

1305
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,640
It doesn't help us to know what's gonna happen 20 years from now, right now.

1306
00:38:50,920 --> 00:39:01,840
I mean, we gotta know, like, should I, should I put my hand in my pocket and, or should I, you know, resist the urge to, to urinate on the...

1307
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,160
Dr. Drummond, Dr. Drummond, Dobbs gave us a rule book of life.

1308
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,940
But it's not a hard and fast thing that dictates every, whether you should put your hand in your pocket every five minutes.

1309
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,760
What?

1310
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:14,900


1311
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:22,240
Somebody, somebody, there's some, another, another feed that's feeding in here.

1312
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,440
Selling incense outside the gates.

1313
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,480
Some guy is playing cymbals.

1314
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,940
It's a Hare Krishna guy over there, and I think that...

1315
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,700
What, are we selling product placement to other cults?

1316
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,160
Well, actually, we weren't allowing any other cults in here.

1317
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,620
This is an exclusive cult.

1318
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,360
We, we are, we're completely, we only want member, our members in here, the people that paid to be here.

1319
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,780
We can't have these freeloaders, you know, freeloading off our cult.

1320
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,860
You know, this is a cult of the people, a cult for the people and by the people.

1321
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,660
Well, the rich people.

1322
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,300
We've got a, well, the richest of the poor people and the poorest of the rich people are all together here in one cult, one...

1323
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,980
I'm beginning to understand why we let Dr. Drummond control the business.

1324
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,400
Yeah, it's an amalgam, amalgam of, of deposit.

1325
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,040
It's a complete deposit.

1326
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,720
Yeah, look at this.

1327
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,700
He learned that at Bob.

1328
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,940
Bob taught Dr. Drummond everything he knows.

1329
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:22,240
Piled up in big piles and, you know, the graphics, the graphics behind that will go into the, the median expenditures.

1330
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:33,240
And on, on the side there, we can see how, if we track this particular, extrapolate that out to its ultimate nth degree.

1331
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:33,960
You know, there's a...

1332
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:41,240
Then you can see that we're going to make about 15 cents off of every third unit on the 12th of each month.

1333
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,700
And the deposits will be coming in, they're going to be rolling in.

1334
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,120
We have the bolt cutters!

1335
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,400
The bolt cutters are here!

1336
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,520
Cut, cut, cut!

1337
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,720
Hey, put those bolt cutters down.

1338
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,620
No, I need the bolt cutters!

1339
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,940
Put those bolt cutters down!

1340
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,460
I need the bolt cutters!

1341
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,800
No, you can't have the, those are my bolt cutters.

1342
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,100
Just give me the bolt cutters now!

1343
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,600
Hey, guard, would you take this gentleman out of here, please?

1344
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,800
And take his harmonica with him, please?

1345
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,760
Yeah, that's horrible.

1346
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,500
Don't, don't let the guard play the harmonica now.

1347
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,380
What about all these allegations about corruption?

1348
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,380
Corruption?

1349
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,660
Well, you know, people have talked about how bad we are for years.

1350
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,660
But few people talk about how good we are.

1351
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,720
I mean, that's the one thing that, we take a lot of heat for being, like, the world's worst cult.

1352
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,380
The world's most hated cult.

1353
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,560
Stingiest cult.

1354
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,060
Corruption was built.

1355
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,680
The world's most corrupt and built.

1356
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,720
But people don't talk about how really good we are.

1357
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,740
You know, how great we are, and the greatness of the world.

1358
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,560
Well, and the purity of the corruption.

1359
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:49,260
You see, if you start out from a base of absolute and total corruption, you can't be bought out.

1360
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,880
Well, that's true.

1361
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,540
I mean, we're starting with the lowest common denominator.

1362
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,380
And we can only go up from here, folks.

1363
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,180
So, I mean, it's gonna, it's like smooth sailing for the next six or eight years.

1364
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,920
Then, at the eight-year point, we're gonna meet a slight blip in this, as this chart will illustrate.

1365
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,280
A jobs crisis.

1366
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,400
That will be our first jobs crisis.

1367
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,060
See that blip there?

1368
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,000
But it goes, we're gonna hammer it down with this big hammer here.

1369
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:13,800
Right.

1370
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,080
And then smooth things out.

1371
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,600
We're gonna extrapolate the linear regression over this way.

1372
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,020
See over there?

1373
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,560
Oh, it's smoothing!

1374
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,480
Yeah, it's smoothing.

1375
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
That's a great, uh...

1376
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,960
We're using a smoothing formula there.

1377
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,020
To smooth out the edges.

1378
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,640
That computer simulation is gorgeous.

1379
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,160
Yeah.

1380
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,800
You can see all the sharp edges are now dull.

1381
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,840
See, you can't cut yourself or anything.

1382
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,200
How much of the church's budget did we spend on that pie, that computerized pie graph,

1383
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,440
that animated pie graph, Dr. Drummond?

1384
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,900
Well, I'm sure it'll all come out in the bill, in the billing, uh, at the end when we get

1385
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,740
the bill from the, this wonderful resort here that we're staying at.

1386
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,360
Yeah, well, I was a little concerned.

1387
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,880
What is this?

1388
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:58,500
Maybe the, the, the business meeting is costing more than the company's profits this particular

1389
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,200
year.

1390
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,560
We'll just gonna, we'll, you know...

1391
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:00,680
Century.

1392
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,220
Century.

1393
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,760
We're gonna take it out of the, uh, we'll take it out, well, Bob will, will provide.

1394
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,800
That's the thing we have to remember here.

1395
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,220
You know?

1396
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,040
And that we will survive, and we don't have to worry about costs overrunning our wonderful,

1397
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,520
wonderful revenue streams because, you know, we've got the flow now, we've got the, the,

1398
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,820
the actual, um, the momentum.

1399
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,060
Dr. Drummond, those are pretty fuzzy figures that you're projecting up on the screen.

1400
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,660
I mean, those aren't even numbers.

1401
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,340
Those are some kind of alien alphabet.

1402
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,740
What are we supposed to...

1403
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,900
Well, you can read it, though.

1404
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,620
If you can't read it, then you didn't study your materials before the, the, the, uh, the

1405
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,020
meeting here.

1406
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,240
I can read that.

1407
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,740
I mean, we had those materials that you were supposed to read and memorize, those tapes

1408
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,140
you were supposed to listen to and be able to regurgitate.

1409
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,700
Dr. Drummond's taken all the money and he squandered it.

1410
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,360
All right, well, we bought tapes.

1411
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,420
We had to buy tapes.

1412
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,680
We needed new tape decks.

1413
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,100
We needed, our 8-track machine had broken down.

1414
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,040
We had our beta, our beta, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our,

1415
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,500
our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our,

1416
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,400
our beta machine is broken down.

1417
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,820
Dr. Drummond, we're talking about three or four billion dollars here.

1418
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,580
Yeah, what are, what are these, these vaults full of receipts from this...

1419
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,480
Billion here, a billion there.

1420
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,880
I mean, to us, it's all just money.

1421
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,160
To the Korean massage parlor.

1422
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,220
And that's the important thing to remember that it's money.

1423
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,840
That, that money, that money, that money...

1424
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,320
And when we keep the money flowing, we keep it going...

1425
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:17,500
The Pink Pussycat Club.

1426
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,660
What are these, what are these vaults full of receipts?

1427
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,200
Well, these are, these are investments we had to make.

1428
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,500
We go in to test the, test the culture, test the air, test the...

1429
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,300
We're doing personality bypass transplant treatments in those places.

1430
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:37,340
And we, even in Enron, we had to go to Enron and do some investigatory work long before

1431
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:41,180
the, the, the, the government auditors got in there.

1432
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
Can you take that out?

1433
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,200
I don't know, he's, he's trying to, to...

1434
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,740
I'm not doing, don't look over here.

1435
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:51,700
There's no, don't pay no attention to the, to the hand behind the, the cloak there.

1436
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,180
Okay.

1437
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,180
It's like a giant invisible hand has been...

1438
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,180


1439
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,400
Some people might call it a cloth.

1440
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,860
Other people call it a cloth.

1441
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,820
But to us, it's just a shroud.

1442
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,240
Cheating the company.

1443
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,660
And we put the shroud on and wear it when we need to.

1444
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,400
Invisible hand that he's got.

1445
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:02,780
Yeah.

1446
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,440
So, I take it that there is no embarrassment among the subgenius that they, that they

1447
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,080
all arrived in limousines here at Sulphur Palms tonight.

1448
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:18,040
Well, you don't want a stupid preacher, as the great brother Gene Scott said.

1449
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:18,760
Uh-huh.

1450
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:18,880
Amen.

1451
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,180
You know, when, when a person turns on their television and sees a picture of

1452
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,080
these, their preacher, he wants to see them in a limousine with these lovely...

1453
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,120
He wants to see them...

1454
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,980
...choir girls on either arm and...

1455
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,560
This beautiful Armani, a $600 Armani suit.

1456
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,220
Right.

1457
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,920
He don't want a stupid preacher.

1458
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:35,500
All the other preachers do this.

1459
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,820
Uh-huh.

1460
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,160
Amen.

1461
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,340
And, and we're...

1462
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:37,740
Uh-huh.

1463
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,500
Uh-huh.

1464
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,760
Uh-huh.

1465
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,720
We're not doing anything different from, from what any other religious leaders do.

1466
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,240
Uh-huh.

1467
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,620
Uh-huh.

1468
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,380
And, in fact, when, when, when we had, we suffered those arrests for methamphetamine

1469
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:51,780
manufacturing.

1470
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,760
That's a, that's a, that's, that's the kind of thing that we get a special award for.

1471
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,040
In fact, we have a, a several boxes of awards for...

1472
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,280
Uh-huh.

1473
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,120
...the various doctors here tonight.

1474
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,280
And don't forget, uh, without those Hummer limos, you couldn't have got here, because

1475
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,960
there's no roads to Sulphur Pond.

1476
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,560
There's no roads...

1477
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,060
Okay, I've just, uh, got an important message I have to take, uh...

1478
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:13,780
...to Sulphur Pond.

1479
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,300
Uh, Reverend Stang, would you like to finish, uh, take over this business meeting at this

1480
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:18,640
point?

1481
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:18,820
No.

1482
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,820
I have to go now.

1483
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,620
Yeah, yeah, take up where he left off.

1484
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,600
There's a special tool I have to get.

1485
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry for this interruption, but I'll be back shortly.

1486
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:34,320
Yeah, he was dealing with the corruption and the embezzlement at the top in the church.

1487
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:44,920
Well, you'll notice under hassles and hang-ups, problems relating to drugs, sexual identity, authority, and relationships, we're up 370%.

1488
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,820
And that's mostly within the 18 to 25 group.

1489
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,540
Wow, that's good.

1490
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,060
Gonorrhea, syphilis, venereal herpes are up.

1491
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,620
The venerous venereal herpes.

1492
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,220
Again, that's almost 400% just in the last year.

1493
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,900
That means the workshops were a success.

1494
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,140
That part of the outreach has been a tremendous success.

1495
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:13,980
The computer viruses and the organic viruses both, in every case, the sexually and DSL transmitted diseases.

1496
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:22,500
The fast food outreach has apparently completely bottomed out.

1497
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,500
The burger god concept.

1498
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,420
I predict entertainment will be entertainment.

1499
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,540
Entertainment, boy.

1500
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,620
That was an understatement.

1501
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,580
That has got to be the understatement of the year, what Dr. Criswell just said.

1502
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,280
That entertainment would be entertainment.

1503
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,700
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

1504
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,520
And you haven't.

1505
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,860
Um, depression or blue moods are up.

1506
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,040
And the manic phases are down.

1507
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,260
I've got a question.

1508
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,340
Oddly enough.

1509
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,060
I've got a question.

1510
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,820
Pardon me?

1511
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,120
Dr. Stang?

1512
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,900
Yes, Senator.

1513
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,420
Yes.

1514
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,280
The little girl in the front row.

1515
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,460
Uh, yeah.

1516
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,220
When your local...

1517
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,880
Church leaders are subject to accusations.

1518
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:25,460
What is your stance on how to handle that within your organization?

1519
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,420
When the collection plate comes around, double what you were going to put in otherwise, my friend.

1520
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:33,560
Good idea.

1521
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,840
There you go.

1522
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,200
The collection plate is the bottom line.

1523
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,720
That is what this business...

1524
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,800
You know, when it comes down to it...

1525
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,420
That'll fix it.

1526
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,960
We can talk about all this.

1527
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:52,920
Our product placement and producing these movies that battle torn earth and so forth.

1528
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,660
But when it comes down to it, it's the collection plate passed from hand to hand.

1529
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,860
Or from paw to paw, as it may.

1530
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,720
From hoof to hoof among the believers.

1531
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,460
And that will fix up those problems that you have?

1532
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,240
Belief is the coin of the realm.

1533
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,540
In this realm.

1534
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,960
What about the emotions of...

1535
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,180
Get along, little bobbies.

1536
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:25,520
What about the personalities and the emotions affected and involved in such incidences?

1537
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:33,640
Well, those are being stored in the finest blue canisters in the Dobstown basement, as always.

1538
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,860
So you would disagree with the Catholic stance that people are expendable?

1539
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:41,400
Yes.

1540
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,580
People, yeah, people, sure.

1541
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,780
But this...

1542
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,480
People, yeah, sure, people, sure.

1543
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,880
Expendable?

1544
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,160
Yeah.

1545
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,840
People, yeah, people, sure, yeah.

1546
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,640
Expendable people?

1547
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,840
People, yeah.

1548
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,800
Expendable emotions?

1549
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,720
Well, like we say, the coin of the realm is belief.

1550
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:09,160
Spend your belief all over the floor, all over the office trash can.

1551
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,660
Just spend it, baby.

1552
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,140
Just let loose.

1553
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,860
Let her rip.

1554
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,720
Bob don't care.

1555
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,140
Bob loves you anyway.

1556
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,080
Bob loves you!

1557
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:20,980
Yes.

1558
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,300
You are on the right track.

1559
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,140
Getting warmer.

1560
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,020
Hello?

1561
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,300
Pastor Dick?

1562
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,860
Is he there today?

1563
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:29,400
Tonight?

1564
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,140
No, Pastor Dick is not here tonight.

1565
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,360
This is the subgenius executive retreat.

1566
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,400
I thought he was part of the subgenius.

1567
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,340
Oh, no, heavens no.

1568
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,840
That's a completely different denomination.

1569
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,340
Oh, okay.

1570
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,400
My mind's all mixed up.

1571
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,080
Uh-huh, amen.

1572
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,620
All right, have a good show.

1573
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,920
I'm so messed up.

1574
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,220
Well, there's another dissatisfied listener.

1575
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,720
Oh, praise Bob.

1576
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,840
We're mowing him down, but crop circles.

1577
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,400
This is the subgenius executive retreat direct from Sulphur Palms, California.

1578
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,820
Ah, yes, yes, yes, and a historic, uh, historic, uh, historic, uh, historic, uh, historic, uh,

1579
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:21,500
weekend it was at Silver Pond there, thanks to Don Joyce, uh, Bud Good, Puzzling Evidence,

1580
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:33,000
uh, uh, Du Gwellman, Dr. Philo Drummond and KPFA in Berkeley, California, whose studios

1581
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,800
allowed that.

1582
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,820
And there are four more hours of that.

1583
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:40,800
Okay.

1584
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,500
the over the edge show merged with the show.

1585
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,960
That's more than an hour,

1586
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,920
less than a show.

1587
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,720
And in fact,

1588
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,000
altogether,

1589
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,120
it was five hours of show and now being strewn about the hour of slack.

1590
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,560
Uh,

1591
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,060
and friends,

1592
00:51:59,080 --> 00:51:59,320
you know,

1593
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:04,360
the San Francisco subgenius show or puzzling evidence show,

1594
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:04,840
uh,

1595
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,420
has been on every week on KPFA since June,

1596
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,220
1983.

1597
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,240
Uh,

1598
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,540
when I went out there to work on the book of the subgenius with Palmer

1599
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,900
Vredes and puzzling evidence,

1600
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,600
and we were guests on Bob Nelson show,

1601
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,800
but the subgenius is never went away.

1602
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,640
Um,

1603
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,340
and this subgenius executive retreat at silver palms was,

1604
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:34,760
you know,

1605
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:39,000
we might say the 20 year reunion of the old timey doctors,

1606
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,320
uh,

1607
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,620
Dr.

1608
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,580
Philo Drummond,

1609
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,260
uh,

1610
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,200
who's banned a swing and left corpses is heard in the background here.

1611
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,500
Uh,

1612
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,220
lies,

1613
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:45,680
uh,

1614
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,280
Gary,

1615
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,180
the broke friend,

1616
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,260
puzzling evidence,

1617
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:48,720
uh,

1618
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,340
and,

1619
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,200
and also Michael Pepe and Ed Holmes all there.

1620
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:53,680
Sorry.

1621
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,180
The Dr.

1622
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,780
Howling glass madness couldn't be there.

1623
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,020
And Jay Kenny.

1624
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,580
But anyway,

1625
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,820
here's a tape of that very gang of wacky Zenos down at the Gazette.

1626
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,060
Zeebo from before the show in 1983,

1627
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,800
when it was just a band that dare not speak its name,

1628
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,320
working on the book of the sub genius.

1629
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,400
Fuck.

1630
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,400
You want to know about the book?

1631
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The book was a flop.

1632
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,060
The book.

1633
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,000
Nobody bought that book.

1634
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,820
Did you?

1635
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:35,260
The book was a disaster.

1636
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,460
And when they did buy it,

1637
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,220
they tried to get their money back.

1638
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,280
A terminal disaster.

1639
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,780
Nobody made a single penny.

1640
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,480
What did he say?

1641
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:58,500
What?

1642
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,440
Ah!

1643
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,120
Ah!

1644
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:02,540
Ah!

1645
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,720
Man, what a, what a flop!

1646
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,460
What's he talking about?

1647
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:10,640


1648
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,600
The book!

1649
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,700
What about the song?

1650
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,640
The book was a flop!

1651
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,620
The book was a flop!

1652
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,720
It made the church stop.

1653
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,480
The book.

1654
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,460
Oh, the loud song.

1655
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:29,880
Yeah.

1656
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,500
Ah!

1657
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,080
Ah!

1658
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:32,920
Ah!

1659
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:32,920


1660
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,560
Ah!

1661
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,660
A thousand copies and most of them trash

1662
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,960
Thirty thousand copies and no one got cash

1663
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:51,140
Warehouse

1664
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,140
A warehouse full of books

1665
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,840
A warehouse full of books

1666
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,480
A warehouse full of unwanted books

1667
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,460
The book stands out

1668
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,640
The book

1669
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,540
The book was a flop

1670
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:14,440
It made the sun stop

1671
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,480
It made the sun stop

1672
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,580
Well, maybe not

1673
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,460
Yes, even the book couldn't make the song stop

1674
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,380
Yeah, well

1675
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,660
It sure made the church stop

1676
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,920
It made the distributor stop

1677
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,540
It made the church stop

1678
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,740
It made the post office and the secret service stop, but

1679
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,460
It couldn't make the song stop

1680
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:26,880
The band that dare not speak its name from the old ancient 1983 subgenius tape.

1681
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,780
Bad Doctors.

1682
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,600
Oh, bad, bad, bad.

1683
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,540
And there's so much more bad in the name of the band that's a pain to the heart.

1684
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:33,540


1685
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:33,540


1686
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:39,220
to be had at www.subgenius.com.

1687
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:44,880
That website will tell you about the Living Church.

1688
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,560
If it's money you want, we'll send that to Post Office Box 2.

1689
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,200
Well, this is where you can write to the business office.

1690
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:03,260
Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118, subgenius.com.

1691
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,820
But, you know, he can work his way up at the 7-Eleven.

1692
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:15,300
I just got back from a trip to visit the beautiful new Austin facilities,

1693
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:22,020
which are run by Jesus and his wife, his beautiful wife, Mary Magdalene.

1694
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,840
It was so great.

1695
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,760
It was great to see that busy operation down there.

1696
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:32,760
And, friends, if you have tapes you want us to hear in Subgenius Land,

1697
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,560
or CDs, or whatever, send them to me,

1698
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:42,380
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, at Box 181417.

1699
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:54,540
That's Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1700
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,760
And I do have a cold, if you were wondering.

1701
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,640
It's a subgenius virus.

1702
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,260
I got it from my computer.

1703
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,320
Hey, friends, happy new last year.

1704
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,600
That's when I'm doing this show.

1705
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,580
And praise Bob.

1706
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,440
Oh, and now more of this.

1707
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:23,900
This broadcast is silly tape-delayed stuff.

1708
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,540
I've been in the women's shoe business since 1875.

1709
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,180
In all those years of servicing customers, I found your feet.

1710
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,580
Unfortunately, we want to service you.

1711
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,180
That's very good.

1712
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,780
It's now out of control.

1713
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:38,860
We have a school bus.

1714
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,120
The trap is completely out of control.

1715
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,680
Out of control.

1716
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,620
And we have nothing.

1717
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,760
They're beginning to run into one another and over one another.

1718
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,540
How much Librax are you taking?

1719
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:52,900
67.

1720
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,040
67.

1721
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,260
I was wondering.

1722
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,460
Well, it seems to me like some animals are after me.

1723
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,260
Do you look at that?

1724
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,360
Oh.

1725
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,580
I think you have to tell your doctors I'm a psychiatrist.

1726
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:06,380
It's likely that's why you're having the nightmares.

1727
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,400
And that's when the gem shepherds tripped over the curb.

1728
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,160
Every year, thousands of letter carriers are attacked by dogs.

1729
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:12,800
It's like that.

1730
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:14,060
Public service dogs.

1731
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,840
I want a mechanical man.

1732
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,400
No, the interesting thing.

1733
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,540
Oh, mechanical man.

1734
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:19,800
That's it.

1735
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,540
The interesting thing is, I'm sorry, but you can't hear any more.

1736
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,100
I must see what this is.

1737
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:24,860
What's that?

1738
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,560
That doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.
