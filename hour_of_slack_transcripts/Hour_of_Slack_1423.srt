1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
On the floor.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,800
The self-genius.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,600
Power of swatching.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,920
Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,960
Lying down on the floor.

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:59,960
Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
I think it's, uh, what is it, Friday?

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,140
Friday next week is the 5th?

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,300
Friday is July 5th.

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,940
It's 7 a.m. That's when the sauces are going to show up.

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,420
Yes.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,320
It's a day that will only last seven hours.

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,100
It will be the last day.

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,140
The last day. The day to end all days.

15
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,500
The last day will be a morning, but not a noon, afternoon, or evening.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,980
Not as we have always understood it here on this...

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,260
This planet.

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:40,940
But that's okay, because we are going to be introduced into whole new ways of measuring space and time that, uh, you know, were never relevant to us, uh, in the lives that we know now.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,820
It's okay. Confusion is normal, but you'll get over it.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,520
Yes.

21
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,220
Eventually you will adapt, and you will realize that this was the time stream in which you were always meant to live.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,140
It's happening right now as we speak.

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,440
And if you're a subgenius, you will never lose that...

24
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,800
Feeling of faintly supercilious superiority of having been right all along.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,500
You'll never lose that supercilious superior feeling.

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,340
That swaggering, simpering, uh, smirking certainty.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,120
It'll never be gone. It will be with you forever.

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,360
Because the best part about religion is not knowing that you go to heaven.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,380
It's knowing that everyone else goes to hell.

30
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,060
Praise Bob.

31
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,780
Praise Bob.

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,160
Praise Bob.

33
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,460
And kill Bob, too, by the way.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Can we get a kill Bob?

35
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,560
Bob sucks.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Kill Bob!

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:29,960
Kill Bob!

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,020
Bob sucks.

39
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,760
Hey, if you've got something to say...

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,040
We're allowed to do that, you see.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,460
Chopper sucks.

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,420
You've got something to say, give us a call here.

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,220
This is a very special edition of Synesthesia here.

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:46,580
Joining me in the studio are Princess We Are Doe, Dr. Howland Owl, all the way from San Francisco.

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,560
As heard in, uh, as heard in, uh, the video game Half-Life.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,180
Salve discipule antiquorum.

47
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,440
Don't know why they insist on these ridiculous, uh, ties.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,820
I'm right.

49
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm right here.

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,640
And, uh, is that, uh, my coffee cup?

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
What other, uh, have you done other voice work that anybody here might have heard of?

52
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,700
Well, I don't know.

53
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:15,580
They, I'm, of course, uh, through these shows, like, uh, infectious, uh, hornworms, uh,

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,760
through vegetable matter.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:24,520
But, um, I'm in the, uh, Half-Life series, which also means the PlayStation version,

56
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,120
Half-Life Opposing Force, and so forth.

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,140
But Half-Life is pretty much...

58
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,180
it.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,120
Ah.

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,080
Well, you know what?

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,940
It's something that I'd heard of before I ever heard of you, so...

62
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Then there was a movie that, uh, two guys made, uh, called The Attack on City 17, or

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:41,980
was it?

64
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,440
Anyway, City 17 figures prominently in their plot.

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,880
And in the background, you can hear my characters addressed to the inhabitants of City 17.

66
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,120
Now, I had heard at the time that these two youngsters, these, uh, eager, uh, creatures,

67
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,640
computer fabricators, had made a motion picture quality movie in their spare time with this

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,720
City 17 project.

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,200
And further, I had heard that some of the powers that be had then given them millions

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,420
of dollars to make a full-length live-action version.

71
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:24,520
But since that, and this was some years ago, I have heard nothing of this strange story.

72
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,260
Hmm.

73
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,300
Oh, like the 3D subgenius documentary.

74
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,440
Yeah, what about that one?

75
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,980
Those guys were there and they were disrupting us, making us be in 3D all the time, and then,

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,020
uh, we heard, uh, nor a hair nor a hide of them.

77
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,360
Well, you know what happened?

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,920
Uh, he had intended to have celebrities talking about how, uh, wonderful the Church of the

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,860
Subgenius was.

80
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,740
Don Rickles, Jerry Lewis.

81
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,440
Well, the problem was, Don and Jerry both said, who?

82
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah, well...

83
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,280
I mean, then, so he went, okay, well, I'll call you back.

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,280


85
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,020
I'll call Pee-wee.

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,700
I'll call Mark Mothersbaugh.

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,480
And they went, who?

88
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,860
Or they went, uh, I don't have time.

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Banned everything you...

90
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,160
I've got to finish this, uh, TV commercial for Hawaiian Punch.

91
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,440
Ran it into the ditch.

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,780
So, uh, and Last X Day, in fact, just before we left...

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,300
God, I hate that phrase, Last X Day.

94
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Yes.

95
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,900
Last X Day Drill.

96
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,260
The Last X Day Drill before the actual...

97
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,280
I tried to get hold of, uh, X Day Drill.

98
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,280


99
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,280


100
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,280


101
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,280


102
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,160
I got Edmund, the producer of that thing, and, uh...

103
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,220
With the scientific company.

104
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,980
I emailed him, and he, and he, I got an auto-reply saying, no, this was a different Edmund.

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,220
Out of office?

106
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:47,660
He, yeah, he, no, it, it actually said, I'll be out of the office from July 5th on.

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Yes.

108
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,840
And I thought, oh, well, maybe he's coming to, to Wisteria, and he didn't tell us.

109
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,660
But he did.

110
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,460
Well, if so, he never arrived.

111
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,640
Maybe he was the only true subgenius.

112
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,260
The only one who could tell us.

113
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,920
I mean, we all got ruptured.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,620
You know, we can't know all of these things.

115
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,020
X Day's come and gone, and that one little filmmaker guy's the, up there lounging with

116
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,000
the sex goddesses, laughing at us.

117
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,660
We have to observe it from our future perspective, after X Day has already transpired.

118
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Then we can, uh, do the post-game analysis of all the X Day drills, and see what was

119
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,480
out of whack in many of them, when we were sure we were all set to go.

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,040
Uh...

121
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,580
I haven't broached this subject on the radio before.

122
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,620
Awful.

123
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,040
I don't think.

124
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,960
Awful.

125
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,300
But we had a pretty sobering discovery.

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,160
Uh, a few months ago, I got results back from a lab test.

127
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:49,860
We had sent the original memo that Bob wrote about the world ends July, uh, 7 a.m., July

128
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,600
5th, 1998.

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,640
Now, of course, there was a problem with the 1998 being turned upside down, and we knew

130
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,080
about that.

131
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,420
Yes.

132
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:04,420
I had the thing carbon dated, and it turned out that in the word June, the L, or July,

133
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,860
in the word July, the L-Y had been added years later.

134
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:16,960
The original note was penned in 1953, and sometime in the 70s, somebody added an L-Y

135
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,260
to what it originally just said, J-U.

136
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,440
So it actually occurs in the month of June?

137
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,360
Well, it could.

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,100
Well, that's another thing.

139
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,320
Is there's the, you know, what?

140
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
Is there some Zionism?

141
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,400


142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,160
Zionist connection here?

143
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,020
But I think rather it's possible that, yeah, it could have been something like that.

144
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,120
Or jujy fruits.

145
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,520
Uh, possibly that Bob meant to say June 5th.

146
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,480
Juvenile court.

147
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,880
Uh, but-

148
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,060
It would certainly be cooler in southern Ohio in June than it is in June.

149
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,080
Some of us might not be able to be there.

150
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,020
That's the problem.

151
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,020
There's, uh, school is still going on, and I, you know, as scholars, we'll debate until

152
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,080
the end of time.

153
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,900
Yes.

154
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,780
That's the meaning of the date, time, and place of the end of the word.

155
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,020
The eschatology will be debated well past the end of time.

156
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,720
Every dusty Mesopotamian chunk of pottery.

157
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,760
It all has to be hashed over to the nth degree.

158
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,420
And then when we can finally correlate these factors, we will know with precision at exactly

159
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,380
what hour the landing pods of the great saucers will make contact with our solar system.

160
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,540
But until then, uh-

161
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,140
I'm gonna do something really crazy here.

162
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,400
Partay!

163
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,680
Until then, let's partay!

164
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,780
It's the end of the world!

165
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,440
216-mouth-no-mouth-view-in-the-vice-of-the-iscus.

166
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,700
There's a number to call if you'd like to talk about anything here.

167
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Eschatology.

168
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,720
Or just eschatology.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Eschatology talk.

170
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,480
You're on the air.

171
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not an autocrat, and my brain is still functioning.

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,700
Well, we'll fix you up in no time.

173
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,720
And we're programmed to say that.

174
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
The autocrats!

175
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,360
Come in.

176
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,100
It's the Robert-

177
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,140
Ah!

178
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,900
Robert- Robert Lunsum.

179
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,540
You know what I wanna do?

180
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,680
I wanna turn that fan off.

181
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm not liking the background noise.

182
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,140
Oh, you're not one of your best fans, are you?

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,520
I'm not.

184
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,220
Well, alright, I have other people to do this.

185
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:03,740
Well, come in.

186
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,700
Have a whiff of anesthetic and-

187
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,240
This is the most wonderful time of the year.

188
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,400
Sit down on the table, and we'll have those wings off in no time.

189
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
We'll take all those other things, too.

190
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,020
The gills, the reappurtenances, the strange growths out of the side of the head.

191
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,440
That's right.

192
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,820
We will carve these irrelevancies away, and what is left will be the pure spirit.

193
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,620
Yes.

194
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:23,740
Yes.

195
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,140
We'll have to turn the fan in order to hear the background noise on the phone lines here.

196
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,700
Yes.

197
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,900
Yes.

198
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,240
Fans are obstreperous and impetuous.

199
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,120
Could you pod the pans and pan the pod and bring up the, um, and fade the, um, there,

200
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,300
Well, I haven't got any pods on me.

202
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,920
Oh, wait a minute.

203
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,800
I do actually have a couple of pods.

204
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,240
I have a couple of pseudo-pods.

205
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,780
Oh, you're from San Francisco.

206
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,460
You know your Perian pods are round.

207
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,100
Oh, well, mine are really real, but, um, yeah.

208
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:47,980
Bean pod?

209
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,220
No, those are has-beens.

210
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,540
I've got something more contemporary and current.

211
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,880
Like, uh, cherries or currants.

212
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,900
Hmm.

213
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,460
So you're carrying a fruit cage full of packing sandwiches?

214
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,780
There's no way we can ingest this packing popcorn because of the closed circulatory

215
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,160
system of the, uh, surrounding structures.

216
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,600
So, too bad about that.

217
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,460
Just a...

218
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,260
And the average one?

219
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,220
Are you saying we can't eat those, those packing peanuts if we're in a space suit?

220
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,520
It could cause a, a giant, uh, beanstalk to erupt in the air.

221
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,520


222
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Oh, man.

223
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,840
And out of the center body core, uh, could be a disaster.

224
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh, that would feel great for a second.

225
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,700
For just a second.

226
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:29,860
Yeah.

227
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Just don't munch the...

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,060
It makes your eyeball pop out of the fly.

229
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,360
Plastic.

230
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,640
Ladies and gentlemen, we, uh...

231
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,360
I was about to say, howdy.

232
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,640
Don't irritate the giant.

233
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,680
Ladies and gentlemen, we have another caller here.

234
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,460
Hello, you're on the air.

235
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Yeah, um, hello, Dr. Spencer.

236
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,700
I'd like to talk to the sub-G.I.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Welcome to the program, No Money Mark.

238
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,200
You are...

239
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,060
It takes a giant to hold down.

240
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,740
You are a sub-genius icon, whether you know it or not.

241
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,500
Thank you.

242
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,500


243
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,500


244
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,780
But I have to be a little rebellious tonight.

245
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,920
I have to ask, uh, the sub-G.I., um, promises, promises.

246
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,680
You've been saying that the world is gonna end for years now.

247
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,180
Why would...

248
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,500
We've been right every time.

249
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,200
Right.

250
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,940
It has happened every time.

251
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,000
It is going to end on July 5th, 1998.

252
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,740
That's plain and simple.

253
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,360
Yes.

254
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,620
It's just that the rest of it is, uh, somewhat murky because of, uh, the primitive conditions

255
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,700
that prevail in the pre-X-Day world.

256
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,240
I messed up.

257
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,480
I hit the wrong buttons here.

258
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,360
We got a problem with our phone lines here.

259
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,220
Phony, bony phone lines.

260
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,740
Now, one of the lights is, uh, one of the lights is lit up here.

261
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,860
And besides, that question...

262
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,840
Indicating that someone is...

263
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,220
...is making me nervous.

264
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,320
...is on the line, even though they're not.

265
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,860
Yes, we should ask Dr. Frank Baxter at Bell Labs...

266
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,560
I was not trying to hang up on No Money Mark.

267
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,280
I was not.

268
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,420
...to see if the sun's photosphere over time...

269
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:37,820
He knew that.

270
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,360
...gave us any indication of when X-Day might actually occur.

271
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,980
We talked to Dr. Arnold Fenster of Columbia University.

272
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,240
Welcome back.

273
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,580
You won't be rid of me that easily.

274
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,140
Oh, good.

275
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,000
And here he is now.

276
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,300
Oh, good.

277
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,440
Uh, now, let's not have any more of those.

278
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,620
Those pesky questions.

279
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,640
Those are embarrassing.

280
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,820
Uh, you know...

281
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,280
Well, they can ask questions.

282
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,680
Why not?

283
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,220
We can stand the push of their feeble questions.

284
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,180
Surely we're not afraid of some, uh, questioning, uh, Pobucker out there.

285
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,960
After all, our mission is education.

286
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,320
We can withstand it.

287
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,320
Not only that, we can enrich their lives with our words and questions.

288
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,660
Is there someone here on the air?

289
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,940
We will answer.

290
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,560
These people need help out there.

291
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:15,860
We can...

292
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,420
We're going to give it to them, Dave.

293
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,880
We're not abnegating our responsibility.

294
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,580
Isn't that part of growth?

295
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,500
We're not abnegating our responsibility.

296
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,500


297
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,500


298
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,500


299
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,500


300
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,500


301
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,340
We're not going to let our friends be thrown into the fiery furnace, uh...

302
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,080
Until you become one of the giants like in the beanstalk tale.

303
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm just saying...

304
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,200
What?

305
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,140
I'm just saying...

306
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,380
You've been proud of the end of the world for so long.

307
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,780
Why should we believe you this time?

308
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,720
...beamstalk tale, tall drink of water?

309
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,320
Uh...

310
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,440
The reason you should believe this time is because we're not saying that the world will

311
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,440
end at a specific date and time that anybody can mark on their calendar as they know it

312
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,620
now.

313
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,040
Mark.

314
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,400
Mark.

315
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,300
Mark on their calendar.

316
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,840
Mark.

317
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:53,520


318
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:53,520


319
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:53,520


320
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,580
And what evidence do you have that this is not going to happen?

321
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,220
You know that you can't prove a negative.

322
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,540
Well...

323
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,640
A subgenius can't prove a negative.

324
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,020
A double negative.

325
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,280
That's not...

326
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,920
We can't prove a negative...

327
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,300
You can't prove a negative.

328
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,760
But...

329
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,580
And yet science revels in taxonomy by saying things are not something else.

330
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:17,700
These days, in post-computer taxonomy, we talk about things that aren't other things

331
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,140
as a defining plenum.

332
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
How about this?

333
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,500
Why can't we do it with this?

334
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,420
Yes, you've got a problem against that.

335
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,060
It's not like what people say.

336
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,800
It's a series of paroxysms, of spasms, so to speak.

337
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,880
And things didn't hit off perfectly the first time.

338
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,060
I've known people who actually drink paroxysm because they think it's healthy.

339
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,140
They sell food-grade paroxysms in health food stores.

340
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,660
It just bleaches your navel from the inside out.

341
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,200
I've actually done an advertising slogan for those guys.

342
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,660
Paroxysm, Caesar the day.

343
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,260
Hail Caesar.

344
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,660
Caesar the day.

345
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,800
Well, you know, you've got to Caesar the day because perhaps only through a sort of pathology

346
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,480
can the true enormity of the problem be discerned.

347
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,220
It takes abnormality to understand and be in sync with abnormal conditions.

348
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,500
It's better than scissoring the day.

349
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,820
Caesar the day, my friend.

350
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
With the scissors of sight.

351
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,680
Well, it depends on what kind of scissoring you mean.

352
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,260
We're talking about removing.

353
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,300
It's about scissor sisters.

354
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,720
Little things that are growing on you.

355
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,320
See, that's what I'm talking about.

356
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:36,580
Well, it's a question of whether we are offering something which is pleasant and ameliorates a problem

357
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,940
or instead are just getting snippy with our blades.

358
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,960
Now, don't forget, I'm collecting all the stuff you guys snip off.

359
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,440
Yes, the snipper-gurie.

360
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,180
Yes, just like in the children's story.

361
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,560
It's lurking in the woods, kids.

362
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,940
It makes you find the sticker.

363
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,320
It makes you find puree.

364
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,800
Uh-huh, that's right.

365
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,800
Fine, fine puree.

366
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,900
It's a starter sauce, so to speak, for those of you who are a little bit younger,

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,480
perhaps a little bit older somewhere.

368
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,380
It is one of the mother sauces, actually.

369
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,860
But mind now, comrade, what I say.

370
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,360
Don't suck your thumb when I'm away.

371
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,180
The great tall tailor always comes to little boys who suck their thumbs.

372
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,160
Before they know what he's about,

373
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,560
he takes his great sharp scissors out

374
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,700
and snip.

375
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,580
Oops, there, thumbs clean off.

376
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,880
And then, you know, they never grow again.

377
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,120
Well, some have.

378
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,900
And that's another thing.

379
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,800
If you're a lizard.

380
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,440
You're going to have nightmares for weeks.

381
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,380
Mama had scarcely turned her back.

382
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,020
The thumb was sucked.

383
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,500
Alas, alack.

384
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,100
See, I didn't have a problem sucking my thumb as a kid

385
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,460
because it's kind of hard to suck your thumb when it's between down your...

386
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,080
Never mind.

387
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,740
The door burst open.

388
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
In he ran.

389
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,660
The great...

390
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,820
Tall, long-legged scissorman.

391
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,860
Oh, children, see the tailors come

392
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,620
and caught our little suck-a-thumb.

393
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,100
Snip, snap, snip, the big shears go

394
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,240
while Conrad cries out,

395
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,780
Oh, oh, oh.

396
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,080
Snip, snap, snip, they go so fast

397
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,840
that both his thumbs are off at last.

398
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,840
Mama comes home.

399
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,900
There Conrad stands and looks quite sad

400
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,760
and shows his hands.

401
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,160
Ah, said Mama.

402
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,820
I knew he'd come to naughty little suck-a-thumb.

403
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,440
We've got to get undercover.

404
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,240
The bombardment is already started.

405
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,280
You know, if this guy...

406
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,460
We have taken over your radio control.

407
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,900
Do we have another caller?

408
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,780
Control the elevator.

409
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,780
Well, when I heard him say neatly snip from his hands,

410
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,880
I thought he was going to say neatly snip from all of his hands,

411
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,800
which caused me some trepanation and some fear at the time.

412
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,980
You have to prepare for...

413
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,920
Of course, it's much trepanation.

414
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,980
A thumbless existence.

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,080
You've got to watch out for that.

416
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,080
Yep.

417
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,880
Our prehensile thumb is what aparts us

418
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,160
from the different monkey species.

419
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,120
No more.

420
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,020
Back to your tree, Jocko.

421
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,740
What?

422
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,120
You've rescinded that privilege

423
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,720
with your thumb sucking.

424
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,260
If you suck your thumb for too long,

425
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,220
you become a monkey.

426
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,200
You suck it completely off.

427
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,160
There's nothing left there but a stump.

428
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,360
Oh, Jocko, that reminds me.

429
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,120
Has anyone talked about the death of Alan Myers?

430
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,420
Ah.

431
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,580
The guy with the lemons, yeah.

432
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,240
The guy with the prehensile snippers?

433
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,200
Well, no, no.

434
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,700
That was the great, tall, red-legged tailor.

435
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,500
No money mark is referring to the recently deceased

436
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,200
original Devo drummer.

437
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,220
Alan won, or I guess he was just Alan.

438
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,760
They didn't have to number him.

439
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,560
As Alan was wrenched from this world.

440
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,280
Yeah, the slaughters picked him up early.

441
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,160
Well, there was actually a Devo drummer before him

442
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,900
who sued Devo for lots of money.

443
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:52,900


444
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:52,900


445
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,440
And they were still friends and said,

446
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,380
all right, all right.

447
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,180
Is it any wonder they switched to drum machines

448
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,960
with all the drummer troubles they had?

449
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,100
Back when Mark Mothersbaugh was a concerned subgenius,

450
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,480
he said, Stan, do you have a partner?

451
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,080
I said, yeah.

452
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,240
He goes, does he have a wife?

453
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,320
I said, yeah.

454
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,920
He goes, that's where the trouble's gonna come from.

455
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,680
It's a cryptic thing.

456
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,180
And I often wondered why he said that.

457
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,560
Because he was secretly the fifth Beatle?

458
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,540
The Thane of Fife had a wife.

459
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,280
That's how he learned? I don't know.

460
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,960
Well, a lot of water under the bridge.

461
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,320
Somehow we are the fifth Beatle

462
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,700
and we'll be discovered someday.

463
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,260
It's been like 70 years now and I'm still waiting.

464
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,520
I was the original fifth Beatle.

465
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,360
And now look where it got you.

466
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,580
Nowadays they're made in Mexico.

467
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,880
Mexico.

468
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:51,900
The history.

469
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,700
Endless police walks.

470
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,580
The so-called perp walk.

471
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,680
Well, at least Ringo made Caveman.

472
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,560
At least he made an animated dinosaur movie.

473
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,460
You know, what other rock star did that?

474
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
And he married his co-star.

475
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,400
And he was funny in 200 motels, too.

476
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,020
Kind of.

477
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,700
Yes, yes.

478
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,140
He was also not bad in The Magic Christian, too.

479
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,700
So, you've got to hand it to him.

480
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,780
And not to mention candy.

481
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,260
Special X-Day award.

482
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,860
Yeah.

483
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,840
Oh, don't forget.

484
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,260
Ringo is actually...

485
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,220
He did quite a lineup of interesting full-data movies.

486
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,820
He has.

487
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,040
Yeah, he played the hunchback Mexican gardener in Candy,

488
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,840
who I think takes the title characters Virginia.

489
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,340
You're talking about Gringo Star?

490
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,240
But no, he was not a Gringo.

491
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,020
No, he wasn't.

492
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,740
He was the hunchback Mexican gardener.

493
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,180
What do they call those guys?

494
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,480
I knew the name, but I forgot.

495
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,040
I'd forgotten it.

496
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,400
Knuckles, I think.

497
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,520
He is a knuckle.

498
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,020
No, that was Charles Lawton, who played the hunchback of Knuckle.

499
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,940
He heard the hunchback.

500
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,740
The full name was Hunchback of Nacho Cheese.

501
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,920
But those terrible scenes where the molten cheese was spilled down on the people.

502
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Was Potter Nostril involved with that?

503
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,420
I can smell the cheese.

504
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,220
Yes, we all remember the Armenian movie classics version.

505
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,500
Recently restored.

506
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:30,580
They're remaking all of our favorite bloody nursery rhymes and Mother Goose stories.

507
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:36,700
Yes, they've already put Snow White out there with werewolves and vampires.

508
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,240
Now they've got Jack the Giant Slayer.

509
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,980
There were three Hansel and Gretel movies.

510
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,520
Thumbelina gets a sex change.

511
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,060
The other day, I...

512
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,420
I...

513
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:51,640
I...

514
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


515
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


516
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


517
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


518
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


519
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


520
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


521
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


522
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


523
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


524
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


525
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:51,640


526
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,220
I declined to download a movie called Hansel and Gretel Get Baked.

527
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh, no.

528
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,500
That means the witch wins.

529
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,660
I guess it's just not PC to push an old bag into a nothing these days.

530
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,420
No, actually, in the main big Hollywood Hansel and Gretel,

531
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,460
they do, in fact, push a pretty scary-looking witch into a mighty oven.

532
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,300
How about the Ray Harryhausen version?

533
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,740
Now, is that the one that went unfinished?

534
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,440
No, he finished.

535
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,100
The one that was unfinished was finished.

536
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,880
You know, I've never met a scary-looking witch in my entire life.

537
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,160
Well, they pushed her into the oven.

538
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,720
I can introduce you to quite a few scary-looking witches.

539
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,240
I don't know.

540
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,700
Are they really scary-looking, or are they just, like, are they just obese?

541
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,460
They use back projection of flames in miniature sets.

542
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,560
That just kind of makes them cuddly.

543
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,240
No, no.

544
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,660
They are scary-looking.

545
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
They're not cuddly.

546
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,320
They're bony.

547
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,160
They're all elbows and knees, and they've got a severe grandma hair problem on the chin, too.

548
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,480
Dowager's hump.

549
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,860
Some people might find this appealing.

550
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,540
And then, of course, kind of a rolling gate.

551
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,480
Now, I'm going to be remembering that phrase for the rest of my days.

552
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,400
It's a feature of advanced old age.

553
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:16,060
Some parts of you grow abnormally, including those vertebral prominences,

554
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,020
which do produce the notorious dowager's hump.

555
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,580
So, in other words,

556
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,240
standing up straight won't help me.

557
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,960
It could help you, but you'll have that hump sticking out rather than sticking up.

558
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,540
Coming next from Unferry Tonic, Little Dead Riding Hood.

559
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,180
Besides, who knows what fantastic medical advances will come in even the new future.

560
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,000
They can whittle that hump into an artistic statement, too.

561
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,120
Sneer at government policies with which you disagree.

562
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,400
My kingdom for a hump.

563
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,060
When I get on my escape vessel,

564
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,940
them X-Men make me a special baby head,

565
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,680
a scary, mean baby head on the back of my hump.

566
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,900
Believe me, the body modification you see today is in its absolute infancy.

567
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,500
In the future, we will be rearranging the human body at our convenience

568
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,960
to take long space voyages and do other things.

569
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,980
It will be possible to move all that stuff around and put it back.

570
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,920
It just isn't quite yet.

571
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,660
Of course, you'll have to be able to afford it.

572
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,900
And affording a quality hump nowadays is very, very difficult,

573
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,560
especially in the market we're in, whatever the hell that means.

574
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,220
I guess it means a lot of people don't have any employment.

575
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,360
But in this market we're in, having a gleaming white hump of your own...

576
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,940
It can be seen on the horizon.

577
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,520
Lighting up the sky.

578
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,180
I had my left rear hump replaced by the surgeon just earlier this week.

579
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:46,880
Wow.

580
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,820
You can probably hear it running.

581
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,500
That's that cracking sound?

582
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,780
Like ice breaking in winter's thaw?

583
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,340
Yeah.

584
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,440
That's right.

585
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,360
That's coming out now.

586
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,460
I have a philosophical question for all of you.

587
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,900
Do animals have near-death experiences?

588
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,360
Yes.

589
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,540
I saw a couple weeks ago a chipmunk that had had a near-death experience,

590
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,520
as far as I could tell.

591
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,040
I see it lying in the grass.

592
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,200
No recording.

593
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,080
Underneath some trees.

594
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,080
I can only assume that it fell from a tree.

595
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,920
And it did not appear to be in the best of health.

596
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,080
In fact, it appeared to...

597
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,880
It could have suffered some kind of injury.

598
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,980
It could have had the air in it.

599
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,980
It was just forced to lie there on its side.

600
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,860
But here's the thing.

601
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,700
It couldn't walk.

602
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,280
It couldn't get up and walk on all fours.

603
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,560
But what it could do is jump up and flop over.

604
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,700
It was a jumping, flopping chipmunk.

605
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,280
And not only that, but it would jump and flop forward and spinning in a spiral.

606
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,760
New jumping flop.

607
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,400
It was the craziest thing I'd ever seen a chipmunk do.

608
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,720
I think some chipmunks are on drugs nowadays.

609
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,440
And they might have been doing the...

610
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,400
It was on PCP?

611
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Does that explain those movies?

612
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,860
Or maybe it was a rescue ranger.

613
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:56,960
Could be.

614
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,860
Oh, cool.

615
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:01,500
Now, moles are known to have near-death experiences.

616
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,200
Because they'll be killed in a trap.

617
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:11,100
And report that they then felt that they were moving through a dark tunnel towards a bright light.

618
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,760
And they might have been.

619
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,640
Moles report that all the time.

620
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,760
Yeah, exactly.

621
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,720
Yeah, I get a lot of email from different barnyards.

622
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,700
Barnyards.

623
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,420
You know, actual large cows and things like that telling me of their near-death experiences.

624
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,260
Then voles.

625
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:34,040
I had a 43-year-old chicken just the other day email me and talk about the tunnel of light and the shinetoad.

626
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,340
I presume, well, Dr. Howell for sure understands the shinetoad or the glimmering, as they call it in German.

627
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
Yes, the shinetoad.

628
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
I did mention it in my book.

629
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,020
Buzzards have near-death experiences.

630
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,600
They seek...

631
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,460
They seek out near-death experiences.

632
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,340
The shinetoad, however, is more or less a state of what we would call suspended animation.

633
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,900
Life functions are suspended but may return while the body exists in a state of preservation, ideally.

634
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,180
That's where Ray Harryhausen is now.

635
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,700
And mild aggravation is.

636
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,620
That's where he is.

637
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,800
Suspended animation.

638
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,900
Right.

639
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,680
We'll dig him up as soon as X-Day happens and put him back to work.

640
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,440
Making monsters.

641
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,700
In a dark little studio.

642
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,340
In a dark little studio, yeah.

643
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,900
He has to watch people do computer graphics in hell.

644
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,840
Twisting the little figures.

645
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,240
I have it on good authority that does have near-death experiences.

646
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,380
And who says...

647
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,160
What about bucks?

648
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,320
...being a deer, a female deer?

649
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,640
Well, the buck and the doe dwell in the same forest.

650
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,280
Not as often as does.

651
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,100
Does have somewhat of a psychic...

652
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I've had experiences where I was dozing and...

653
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,000
A deer.

654
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,800
A female deer.

655
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,660
...and thought I was dying.

656
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,620
And then I woke up.

657
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,160
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

658
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,360
Is there a deer?

659
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-to-e.

660
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,500
You can't say that on the radio, man.

661
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,980
Yes, you can.

662
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,740
You can't say...

663
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,860
On the radio.

664
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,180
You can't say...

665
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,260
On the radio.

666
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
But you can live it like a man.

667
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,000
That's a different station's disclaimer.

668
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,240
Live it and live with it.

669
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,200
Glondy, you son of a...

670
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
Hold it like a pencil.

671
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:16,920
Okay.

672
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,700
Okay.

673
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


674
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


675
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


676
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


677
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


678
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


679
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


680
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,700


681
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,960
I don't know why nobody's calling.

682
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,000
Of course, I normally don't start the talk show until 11, but...

683
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,020
Yes, I'm sure the board will light up like a Christmas tree.

684
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,680
Then we'll have eggnog and open the presents.

685
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,780
Hey, wait.

686
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,140
Something's happening with line two.

687
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,360
We've got something on line two.

688
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,120
Faldiral and Fiddledeedee.

689
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,620
Line two is acting weird, too.

690
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,800
You can't catch me.

691
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,940
I'm the gingerbread man.

692
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,940
Let's see who it is.

693
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,100
I can't either.

694
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,500
It doesn't appear to be anybody.

695
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,080
Let's see.

696
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,600
There's nobody there.

697
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,520
Hello, is anybody there?

698
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,420
Is there anybody there?

699
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,280
Says the listener.

700
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,460
Okay, so it sounds like there was somebody there on line two for a second, and...

701
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,780
They were destroyed in a freakish blast.

702
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,560
Yeah, a tornado just hit their house when you picked up the line.

703
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:11,680
So, just a few days out of the news cycle, and I'm missing the fact about how the West is getting fried in the overheat of global atrocity.

704
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:12,940
Yes, indeed.

705
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,380
119 degrees in downtown Las Vegas, and that's where we're holding 16.

706
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,180
Next day.

707
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,580
Poor Tucson, Arizona.

708
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,020
Because the weather's supposed to be kind of nice in Wisteria this week.

709
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,300
Mm-hmm.

710
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,940
A little bit of rain.

711
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,420
No, we've been getting it easy.

712
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,300
This has been...

713
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,520
Lower 80s.

714
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,040
If you remember...

715
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,760
We had the first real winter in years this past year.

716
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:41,000
Last year, this entire area was declared a disaster area by President Obama, and there was no power.

717
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,900
Because of the derecho.

718
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,420
But, at Wisteria, the subgeniuses were well taken care of with all their power...

719
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,080
Hello, you're on the air.

720
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,500
...booked up.

721
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,420
...pocket of...

722
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,720
Oh, well, that was a little too much for some of our listeners.

723
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,840
Let's go over that again with instant rebate.

724
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,760
You can't.

725
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,300
Do you see what I have to deal with every week?

726
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,200
See, Dave, this is why you should call me more often.

727
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,300
Intermittent signal.

728
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,240
Because I have to deal with these morons week in and week out.

729
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,060
And, Dave, you're the kind of moron I can...

730
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,120
You're the kind of moron I can work with, Dave.

731
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,020
An oxymoron?

732
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:19,680


733
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:19,860
An oxymoron.

734
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,680
Oh, God.

735
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,500
Sorry.

736
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,460
Hello, you're on the air.

737
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,220
Hello.

738
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,200
Hello.

739
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,260
We have a new caller on the air.

740
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,660
I don't smell anything.

741
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,180
This is Dr. Zeronius.

742
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,960
Dr. Zeronius.

743
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,640
Dr. Zeronius.

744
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,140
Dr. Zeronius.

745
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,800
All the way from...

746
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,320
All the way from the Western lands.

747
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,480
Hail, Zeronius.

748
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,560
Princess Weege is reading Tawdry's novel for the second time.

749
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,500
Your third?

750
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,660
For the second time?

751
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,280
No kidding.

752
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

753
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
Is it dirty?

754
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,100
Well, it doesn't have any pictures, Dave, so I don't know if you'd be interested.

755
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,860
Oh, but the pictures it makes you have in your brain.

756
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,820
It's pretty funny.

757
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,500
And you don't even have to color them.

758
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,500
So, Dr. Zeronius, how are you planning to celebrate the end of the world there in Portland?

759
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:17,000
We're going to do the, you know, we're getting off the planet from the backyard of Johnny Brainwash.

760
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,120
There.

761
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,560
That's a good plan.

762
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,580
Because, you know, the saucers won't get you.

763
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:22,920
You should...

764
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,300
You should...

765
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:31,880
Although the X's didn't arrive to pull us away from this idiotic douchebaggery, we still got off.

766
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,560
This idiotic douchebaggery...

767
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,900
And we hope it doesn't really happen to the year this time.

768
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:38,800
I never...

769
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm hearing all kinds of weird things.

770
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,940
And have there been signs and wonders, portents, strange things cited

771
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,680
indicating the end of the world?

772
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,040
Eclipses?

773
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,780
In Portland, there always are.

774
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,840
You have to look for the things that seem a bit more close to the center.

775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,840
When the shooter dead, squeaking gibbering in the streets.

776
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,800
Oh, that's like a banana.

777
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,940
You always hear that crap going off about the end is nigh and whatnot.

778
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,740
The longstanding tradition in our town.

779
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,680
Uh, yeah, I...

780
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,960
I don't know.

781
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,400
I don't know.

782
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:18,860
I don't know.

783
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:19,240
I don't know.

784
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,300
I don't know.

785
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,640
I don't know.

786
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


787
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


788
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


789
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


790
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


791
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


792
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


793
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,640


794
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,720
I don't know.

795
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,120
I don't know.

796
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,460


797
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,460


798
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,460


799
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:21,460


800
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,900
You know, lately I've been hearing that Pittsburgh is going to be the new Portland.

801
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,320
Pittsburgh?

802
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:26,880
Pittsburgh.

803
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,720
I've heard that said repeatedly that Pittsburgh will be the new Portland.

804
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,400
Yes.

805
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Get ready now.

806
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,040
It starts with P, so there's that going.

807
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,640
It's very close to Cleveland.

808
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,420
I didn't have that going for it.

809
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,620
Yes, there is that.

810
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,280
I'm mistaken.

811
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,580
That's great.

812
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,620
And then they could do a television show about that place, and then everyone would move there

813
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,300
instead.

814
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:46,920
That'd be great.

815
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,660
I think Pittsburgh became the new Portland exactly two weeks ago.

816
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:49,660


817
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,060
Two weeks ago.

818
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,920
Pittsburghia.

819
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,200
Is it already happening then?

820
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,020
That's great news.

821
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,280
Like Samson of old.

822
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,880
We had a church tent show revival in Pittsburgh two weeks ago.

823
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,260
Was it two weeks ago?

824
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,940
It seems like it.

825
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,740
Uneternity.

826
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,840
It's just a week ago.

827
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,360
Getting out of town just ahead of the sheriff and his men.

828
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,120
We're getting too old for such antics.

829
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,920
Yes, true.

830
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,580
The sheriff has no head.

831
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,380
He never had a head.

832
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,080
Now, Portland has...

833
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,600
Isn't there a...

834
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,460
They're reading your book for the second time.

835
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,340
They said.

836
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,240
Do you want to talk to them?

837
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,260
The radio?

838
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,340
I'm going to put Junior on the line in just a moment.

839
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Todd, hello.

840
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,040
Hello, welcome to the program.

841
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,140
Who goes there?

842
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,640
You are speaking with the...

843
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,680
I think I've handed the phone.

844
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,200
This is Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

845
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,460
It's Ray.

846
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,800
And there's Reverend Stang and Princess Wee and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

847
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,020
It's true.

848
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,820
Howell Robbins.

849
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,040
Yes, I hear.

850
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm before you.

851
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,420
Dr. Howland Owl.

852
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,080
Reverend Tawdry was baptized two years ago in the Wisteria Pond.

853
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,020
And how did that work out for you?

854
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,180
I've never been the same since.

855
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,380
I wouldn't think so.

856
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,640
It is an unforgettable, unforgivable experience.

857
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,920
You mean you're still wet?

858
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,100
Yeah.

859
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,720
Behind the ears.

860
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,580
That Wisteria water has a unique feature.

861
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,320
It does not evaporate.

862
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,920
Eternal wetness.

863
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,620
Of course, it might have just been driving across the country with Doc Z,

864
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,720
as your traveling companion that caused that.

865
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,840
Well, that was part of it.

866
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,660
I do remember quite well swimming in the pond with Dr. Howell.

867
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,820
Oh, I guess I was there.

868
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,680
Because there was a very upset, large, pagan man.

869
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,340
His fez never got a drop of water on it.

870
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,460
That was the most amazing thing.

871
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,020
That was me?

872
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,900
I was an upset, pagan man?

873
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,360
Hmm.

874
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,020
Well, if you say so.

875
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,120
There was much offense taken to the hopping of the fence and the breaking of the rules.

876
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,820
Who hopped the fence and broke the rules that lived in the house that checked the rules?

877
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,240
Well, I don't know.

878
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,140
I never heard of this until now.

879
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,200
You know what?

880
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,420
One can't remember everything.

881
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,380
But I'm sure it was done in the spirit of interfaith cooperation.

882
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,020
And cognac.

883
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,960
And getting wet.

884
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,600
Right.

885
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,000
Exactly.

886
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,820
But it's hot.

887
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,660
Right.

888
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,400
The evaporation, don't you know.

889
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,700
It's probably good to forget.

890
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,200
Yeah.

891
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:28,920
So, let's also talk about the possibility that we will board our relief ships this X-Day

892
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,560
and begin to fulfill our true destiny as members of the Church of the Subgenius.

893
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,960
Should you say something about board?

894
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,400
Yeah.

895
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:38,780
Yeah.

896
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,360
Okay.

897
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,280
I guess so.

898
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,240
But they surely expected palaver about this subject.

899
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,780
I'm not subject to none other this evening on WCSB.

900
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:56,420
I have stood out there waiting for the saucers at 7 o'clock in the morning every July 5th for 17 years.

901
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:56,880
No.

902
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,360
Yes.

903
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,520
This will be my 18th year of faith.

904
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,220
Here, let me get out this Stradivarius.

905
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,920
Pure faith.

906
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,320
He's 18 years young.

907
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,200
And one of the babies, many, some of the babies who were at the very first X-Day are now fully grown mutants.

908
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,020
Bleeding sheep.

909
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,140
Bellwethers to lead the flock.

910
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,580
That's Dr. Dark.

911
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,600
He's one of those babies.

912
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,200
Oh, yes.

913
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:16,720
It's true.

914
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:24,040
Just think any kids conceived at the first X-Day drill then, they're probably going to be legal this year or next year.

915
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,640
And they're going to be mad when they come of age.

916
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:25,660
And it will be on display.

917
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,180
The first X-Day nose drill will be on display as a way of horrifying the other babies.

918
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,860
It's a multi-generational thing now.

919
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,600
Hmm.

920
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,740
I guess so.

921
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,580
Actually, I was just thinking about Reverend Alley Cat's daughter was born on July 5th.

922
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:39,840
Oh, that's right.

923
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,020
Born on an X-Day.

924
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,880
At X-Day?

925
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:42,860
No.

926
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,840
She was in Ireland at the time.

927
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,520
So it wasn't at one of our-

928
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,260
They can't blame it on us.

929
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,500
Yeah.

930
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:48,780
Right.

931
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,240
Yeah.

932
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,740
There have been some X-Day babies.

933
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,480
Mm-hmm.

934
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,940
I wonder what that portends for them.

935
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,280
Poor things.

936
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,320
Over in Ireland, they have a subgenius baby born on the 5th of July.

937
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,900
Just like a proud, proud-

938
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,860
They call them leprechauns.

939
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,000
Born on the 5th of July.

940
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,940
Wasn't that a movie?

941
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,580
They can grant wishes and answer riddles.

942
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,520
An anti-cult movie.

943
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,220
Born on the 5th of July.

944
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,740
I'm a yacky, doozy, dingle.

945
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,280
Born on the 5th of July.

946
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:28,140
I've got three good feet and four good arms and one big, fat eye.

947
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,580
Glowing eye.

948
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,740
Glowing eye.

949
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,260
Glowing eye.

950
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah.

951
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,260
Speaking of big, fat pies, the annual-

952
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:36,500
Hmm.

953
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,880
I hate saying this phrase.

954
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,600
The annual X-Day cherry pie has been made.

955
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,560
Why do you share it with me?

956
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


957
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


958
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


959
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


960
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


961
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


962
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


963
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:42,560


964
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,660
I hate that phrase.

965
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,540
Well, because there's only supposed to be one X-Day and-

966
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:46,940
Oh.

967
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,700
They've always had that being drills.

968
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,500
The traditional X-Day-

969
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,440
After all the drills.

970
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,000
I was just-

971
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,920
That's like the phrase, next X-Day.

972
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,380
Well, here's the thing, though.

973
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,820
The world ends tomorrow.

974
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,080
That is the next X-Day.

975
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,920
And you may die.

976
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,560
Right.

977
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,200
Yes, that's true.

978
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,660
You may die.

979
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,580
The world ends tomorrow.

980
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,520
That's the caveat.

981
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,120
Is it ever tomorrow?

982
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,640
You may die, but not necessarily.

983
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,780
Notice that word, may.

984
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,160
It's not you will die.

985
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,040
You may die.

986
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,540
May die.

987
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,540


988
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,540


989
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,540


990
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,540


991
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,540


992
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,980
You may instead become a subgenius minister and live forever or as long as you want.

993
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,220
Like Achilles' tortoise in Zeno's Paradox, eternally plodding toward X-Day, it never

994
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,540
actually gets there because-

995
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,740
I love Zeno's Paradox.

996
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,280
In order to get there, it has to go half the distance before it can go the entire distance,

997
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,360
and it'll always be going half of the remaining distance-

998
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,740
I feel a-

999
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,360
Before it can go the entire distance, so it will never arrive, according to this incredible

1000
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,900
logic.

1001
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,060
You're a fan.

1002
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,580
Now, I'm saying question.

1003
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,500
Okay, so you can decide to die if you're a subgenius.

1004
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,900
If you don't like it, can you come back?

1005
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,120
Well that's not knowable, because it's something from the world to come, not this world.

1006
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,700
If you must die, here's what to do.

1007
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,440
Jump in Bob's pipe.

1008
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,840
Let him smoke you.

1009
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,960
And the smoke of that burning going, goeth up forever.

1010
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,340
Or, well, alternatively, you can let him chop you.

1011
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,300
And he can hook you up and huff you up into his third nostril.

1012
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,620
And chew in tobacco.

1013
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,340
Yes sir.

1014
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,080
Or like he could let you become a waveform.

1015
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,760
He'll snort you into-

1016
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,900
Like a waveform that would just go on through, you know, and just keep going.

1017
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,520
It was so embarrassing when I came back from my lunch break at work and somebody noticed

1018
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,040
a little white smudge underneath my third nostril.

1019
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,420
That was the dottle.

1020
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,620
Glad it wasn't my boss that noticed.

1021
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,780
The dottle of Bob's pipe.

1022
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,660
Bob's dottle.

1023
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,420
It was a toot.

1024
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,560
And-

1025
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,580
That telltale white drift.

1026
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,320
You don't know what that is.

1027
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:42,320


1028
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,320
Well guys, time flies, but it is now after 11 o'clock.

1029
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,080
We want to continue plotting on or maybe change discs.

1030
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,180
A good plan.

1031
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,340
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.

1032
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,060
Yes, synesthesia will be right back.

1033
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,920
Special edition, X-Day preview.

1034
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,600
Special Olympic edition.

1035
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,960
And now, we have returned.

1036
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,900
Here we are once again.

1037
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,920
I filed some paperwork about our phone lines.

1038
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,240
That's what was taking us so long.

1039
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,620
Man is born under trouble as the sparks fly upward.

1040
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,880
Sometimes they flow sideways too.

1041
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
I want to hear more about little Suckathumb.

1042
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,140
I like that name.

1043
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,160
Well, he wouldn't obey his parent, his mama.

1044
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,460
And so she showed only cold approval.

1045
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,500
When he showed his mutilated hands to her silently after she returned from her trip.

1046
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,040
I'm going to start calling everybody that.

1047
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Okay, whatever you say, little Suckathumb.

1048
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,620
Hmm, little Namby-Hamby.

1049
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,520
That sounds like an old joke I once heard.

1050
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,300
Fancy pants, little Lord Fauntleroy.

1051
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,300
The old joke I'm thinking of is, I don't know, there's some Native American tribe or whatever.

1052
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,220
A kid was asking his father, father, where do the names come from in our community?

1053
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:20,720
And the father said that, you know, well, the tradition is that when a baby is born, the father steps outside the tent and the first thing he sees is the child's name.

1054
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,840
You know, like your cousin Half Moon.

1055
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,380
That was the first thing your uncle saw when your cousin was first born.

1056
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,820
And, you know, your sister Running Water, you know, after she was born, first thing I saw when I stepped outside the tent was the river.

1057
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,240
So why do you ask this question, little two dogs fucking?

1058
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,680
Beep, beep.

1059
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,240
So it's after 11.30?

1060
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,360
Yes.

1061
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,500
We have already aired the disclaimer.

1062
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,540
Oh, great.

1063
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,340
Now we can relax, scratch, put up our feet, smoke cigars.

1064
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,380
Oh, what was it, Stan?

1065
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,220
Well, the word wasn't said in anger or obscenity.

1066
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,140
It wasn't used in an obscene manner.

1067
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,440
It was used in the scientific sense.

1068
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,020
It might be objectionable, but we warned them.

1069
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,640
Well, you get one even in a PG-13 movie.

1070
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,220
It's just a word.

1071
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,500
It's a word.

1072
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:08,840
I can't believe you say that.

1073
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,740
Well, I don't know that.

1074
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,040
You told me that the other day.

1075
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,420
We were watching Jack the Giant Slayer, which is a kid's movie.

1076
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,520
The MPAA took my baby away.

1077
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,280
And there was one use of the F word in it.

1078
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:28,500
But I have heard that, you know, if you use it more than once, then your rating has to go up to an R.

1079
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:35,460
And I even chose, I had a chance recently to choose a rental movie.

1080
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,220
And so I chose the one that was awesome.

1081
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,440
And I chose the one that was R, thinking it would be better than the one that was PG.

1082
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,860
But the moment the movie started, the protagonist said, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1083
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,880
So that was why it was R. The whole movie was as PG-13 as possible.

1084
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,840
But because of that, they had upped the rating.

1085
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,920
And that's what the MPAA does.

1086
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,660
We've got another caller here.

1087
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,280
I don't make calls.

1088
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,940
Hello, you're on the air.

1089
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,240
Call up Jack Valenti.

1090
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,240
101 damnations.

1091
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,900
We'll have a damnation.

1092
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,200
I don't make calls.

1093
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,200


1094
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,180
We're a plantation where each generation can roam.

1095
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,400
One of our favorite hit and run callers.

1096
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,840
Vivisection station in our damnation plantation home.

1097
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,060
Actually, it's funny that he would say, nobody knows what happened to racist caller.

1098
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:34,460
It's funny that he mentioned 101 damnations because one of the goofiest examples of the use of the F word in cinema that I can recall is the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1099
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,180
Which came out sometime in the 90s.

1100
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:43,080
And I think it had Andy McDowell and Hugh Grant in the opening of the movie.

1101
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,640
They're late for something.

1102
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,860
They're waking up and they're late.

1103
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,280
And he just starts saying, oh, fuckity whatever.

1104
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,320
And like all these different creative spins off the F word.

1105
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,560
But I saw this in Mexico with Spanish subtitles.

1106
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,760
And they just like the subtitles for that whole sequence was just the word maldicion.

1107
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,720
Maldicion.

1108
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,180
Bad talking.

1109
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,660
Damnation, literally.

1110
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,160
I saw a Chuck Norris movie in a movie.

1111
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,740
In a tiny little theater in Bolivia.

1112
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,080
No, no.

1113
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,780
It was in Brazil.

1114
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,600
And it was Spanish subtitles.

1115
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,780
And when Chuck Norris said, oh, shit.

1116
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,460
The subtitle said, ay carumba.

1117
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,840
They even spelled it wrong, huh?

1118
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,400
They even spelled it wrong.

1119
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,120
Ay carumba.

1120
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,440
Hello, you're on the air.

1121
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,500
Did you know Opie was a homo?

1122
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,020
Hey Andy, can I borrow Opie for a minute?

1123
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,520
This is why we don't take calls on our Slack.

1124
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,160
Yeah, we have delay on our station which takes care of things like that.

1125
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,920
It's always helpful.

1126
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,860
Hello, you're on the air.

1127
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,340
Hello, I am too.

1128
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,520
And this is why we do take calls on our Slack.

1129
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,000
Now everything is better.

1130
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,420
What did you think?

1131
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,300
I followed instructions to the last letter of the law.

1132
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,700
I purposely, I filled out my dossier.

1133
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,420
I did all of the prerequisite arguments in the first and the frontal part.

1134
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,940
And then after I was retrieved, I came back and I did it again.

1135
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,900
I did everything as per plan.

1136
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,180
Everyone's got a plan until they get hit.

1137
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,140
You want to make the exes laugh.

1138
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,300
Tell them your plans.

1139
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,660
I'd like somebody to make somebody laugh.

1140
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,440
I would like the exes to make us laugh.

1141
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,600
Oh, they'll make us laugh uncontrollably.

1142
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,340
And will it be a bad thing, Dr. Howell?

1143
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,680
Well, that's...

1144
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,540
It depends in indulging in the luxury of hindsight.

1145
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,100
Because we will not be our present selves.

1146
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,880
What we become may find what the exes do to us the subject of great amusement.

1147
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,940
And even a kind of joy.

1148
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,480
A kind of an inverse, um, inverse pain.

1149
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,900
Inverse suffering.

1150
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,300
Yes, exactly.

1151
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,380
Kind of the negative of suffering.

1152
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,820
The, uh, solarized portrait of suffering.

1153
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,660
But it's still on the same axis, isn't it, unfortunately?

1154
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:15,800
Well, uh, it's still somewhat shaped like the, uh, vanished human nervous system.

1155
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,980
Gone like the great temples of yesteryear.

1156
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,160
Vanished indeed, too, as well.

1157
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,980
Done away with for good, not just vanished.

1158
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,560
Lovely, uh, active living liquid.

1159
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,040
Which we've always called slack.

1160
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,840
The core.

1161
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,440
The essence of all.

1162
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,240
Yep.

1163
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:34,360
Well.

1164
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,340
Ah, no point in these clumsy alchemical methods to revive it down now.

1165
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,620
These ships are like the whaling, uh, ships of old.

1166
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,840
Which, uh, trim your blubber down in the tri-works into liquid slack.

1167
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:57,500
You know, slack was actually discovered by, uh, Sir Isaac Newton as one of the, uh, side effects, or one of the, uh, unintended consequences of his, uh, work in alchemy.

1168
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,080
Along with Sir Alfred E. Newman, who knew that enough blubber would keep you crying for a long time.

1169
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,460
Yeah.

1170
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,800
Sir Isaac Newton bored a hole to let the kittens through the door.

1171
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,140
And when he'd counted twenty-one, he smashed them with a Remington gun.

1172
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,760
You didn't know that, Stan?

1173
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,260
No.

1174
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:16,240
I didn't know that either.

1175
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,700
Professor Ryan.

1176
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,360
Yes, he did.

1177
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,940
He did.

1178
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,940
He bored the hole.

1179
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,380
I'm just saying, to let the kittens through the door.

1180
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,120
Well, you know, you should read Newton's, uh, biography.

1181
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,000
He did many interesting things.

1182
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:33,060
Uh, did he, uh, insert needles next to his eye and move his eyes?

1183
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:33,060


1184
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,460
Did he, uh, tie around using the needle in order to...

1185
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,380
Now that I haven't heard.

1186
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,100
He invented the transorbital lobotomy.

1187
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,440
Put needles in my belly, take samples of my skin.

1188
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,400
I don't care as long as I can be with saucermen.

1189
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,680
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly fiend without a face.

1190
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,360
So come on down, you saucermen, and take me off to space.

1191
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,420
Take me off to space.

1192
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,220
Take me off to space.

1193
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,200
Hey, I've got a new one.

1194
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:07,980
I have a new song I just wrote.

1195
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:08,620
Oh yeah?

1196
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,940
There's no message in the bottle.

1197
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,280
Bob's dottles on his wattle.

1198
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,880
If I only had no brains.

1199
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,920
It's cute.

1200
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:28,180
I just had to, I had to, I had to rhyme dottle and wattle as Hal has done before in Subgenius

1201
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,500
Hands.

1202
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,380
And wattle and dob rhymes with Bob.

1203
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,840
That's the wattle and dobbed thatch huts that some, uh, who believe in the mortification

1204
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,580
of the flesh.

1205
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:44,860
You see these penitents outside Ex Day lashing themselves with the old broken pieces of Coke

1206
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,500
bottles on wire and so on.

1207
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,760
I can look down on the tossers from my safe seat on the saucers when I finally get some

1208
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,180
slack.

1209
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,640
There you go.

1210
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,020
Geez.

1211
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,360
I feel like I'm in the, in Leonard Bernstein and Oliver Cukram or Hans Dixon.

1212
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,220
I'll be flopping and a-twitching, a-scratching and all-eaching.

1213
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,220
Hello, you're on the air.

1214
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,640
No, they're not.

1215
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,580
They decided not to.

1216
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,480
Line two is working now.

1217
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,820
Hello, you're on the air.

1218
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,160
You know, I am an argumentative child.

1219
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,240
I have smacked my mommy ten times.

1220
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:22,980
Hello.

1221
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,900
You like to argify, do you?

1222
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,740
We got a new caller.

1223
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,020
This is Radio Synesthesia.

1224
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,400
You just stepped in it.

1225
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,760
Oh, hey, Dr. Sinister.

1226
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,140
It's Janice.

1227
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,560
Hey, Janice.

1228
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,180
Oh, that's Janice.

1229
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,540
Janice.

1230
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,540
I told you Janice Blackseed was going to call.

1231
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,300
Good to hear from you, sir.

1232
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,060
Are you calling from a Colorado number?

1233
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,420
Yeah.

1234
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:42,760
No.

1235
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,920
This is my number.

1236
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,820
I'm living in Denver now.

1237
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,480
Oh, wow.

1238
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:45,960
How about that?

1239
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,340
Wow.

1240
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:46,720
Oh, yeah.

1241
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,080
Denver's a good call.

1242
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,300
I know why you moved there.

1243
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,800
It's a mile high city in so many more ways now.

1244
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,260
Oh, now you broached the unbroachable.

1245
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:55,880
Yep.

1246
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,600
The storm's getting worse out there.

1247
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,380
Yep.

1248
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,160
It's the phone lines here on WCS.

1249
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,340
Back down hatches, boys.

1250
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:00,340


1251
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,600
SB, we got a state of the art everything here, but our phone lines sound like garbage,

1252
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:04,920
so.

1253
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,300
Did Dr. Janice Helley get reduced from the airwage?

1254
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:14,560
I think that Janice stepped in it, and then he slipped and fell back in it.

1255
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,540
Something about airwake, you say?

1256
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:17,620
Yes.

1257
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,220
Man, the wind is picking up out there.

1258
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,040
It really is.

1259
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:21,680
I know.

1260
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,180
We might all get blown away.

1261
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,480
Yeah, well, I have the snake on fire, so, you know, it's hard to get a signal out of

1262
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,060
here, so.

1263
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,260
Freeze flying by.

1264
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:27,260


1265
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,160
No, it's not you.

1266
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,180
It's not you.

1267
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:29,540
It's me.

1268
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,320
I'm sorry.

1269
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,320


1270
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:30,320


1271
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,580
That's, is that the forest fire in the background?

1272
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,180
We're hearing it?

1273
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,440
It could be the ten mile wide tornado.

1274
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,620
It's encroaching in on us, and, you know, we'll soon be surrounded by flames.

1275
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,300
We got another caller.

1276
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,800
I only started a couple of them, I swear.

1277
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,900
Okay, we have another caller now, so let's go to that caller.

1278
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,860
But what if it's Janice?

1279
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,500
We could hear him through this firestorm.

1280
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,180
No, no, there's room for many.

1281
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,740
We're Sinister.

1282
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,440
Why, hello, Big Johnson.

1283
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,120
Hey, how's it going there, Sinister?

1284
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,560
I wanted to hear your voice tonight.

1285
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,580
Well, I was hoping to hear yours, too.

1286
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,800
Yeah, hey, um, I was gonna say something.

1287
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,320
We were talking about this, and I was like, well, I don't really like your voice.

1288
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,220
Dave, you still with me?

1289
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,200
Janice's gone, too.

1290
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,120
These phone lines are intolerable.

1291
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,320
I actually called off my talk show about two weeks ago.

1292
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,820
It was two or three weeks ago.

1293
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,800
I just said I can't do it.

1294
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,380
This is impossible.

1295
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,180
Ironically, Dave has no buzz and brings clarity.

1296
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,300
Yes.

1297
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:21,660
Yeah.

1298
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,580
The Dave line is the only one without the extra sound effects.

1299
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,760
Whatever you say.

1300
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:35,680
And I think how we get scolded for playing MP3 or for playing God.

1301
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,500
Or for playing God.

1302
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,680
Yes, I'll say it.

1303
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:39,700
Yes.

1304
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,020
Playing God.

1305
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,240
Playing with God.

1306
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,920
My favorite pastimes is playing at God.

1307
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:51,000
I wear a silver crown and sit on a throne and give orders to the universe.

1308
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,820
Not order, but order.

1309
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,700
So is Janice still on?

1310
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,840
No, Janice was gone.

1311
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,000
And hello, you're on the air now.

1312
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,120
Hello.

1313
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,680
Hello.

1314
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,060
Oh, Lord.

1315
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,520
It's not a Google phone.

1316
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,440
It's a real phone.

1317
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,240
It's still...

1318
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,120
There's Google all over that phone.

1319
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,860
I'm hearing strange things.

1320
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,520
I went away for a minute.

1321
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,180
I came back.

1322
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,300
You know what I saw on my computer the other day?

1323
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,520
A thing came up.

1324
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,060
A little icon came up that said user contrast.

1325
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,380
And then below it had some number of kilohertz.

1326
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,900
What sound?

1327
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,880
What's my sound card?

1328
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,480
What's going on?

1329
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,380
It hates you, Dave.

1330
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,400
It hates me.

1331
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,320
It's just that simple.

1332
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,940
That's what I was afraid of.

1333
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,700
It's a conspiracy of one computer against you, Dave.

1334
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,560
Time has run out.

1335
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,940
There's going to be some kind of conspiratorial, you know,

1336
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:46,120
interference with trying to just call up my buddies and hang out for a minute.

1337
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,180
But gee whiz, this is something fierce, isn't it?

1338
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,860
I do expect the conspiracy to interfere with our attempts at communication every step of the way.

1339
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,680
I've just kind of gotten used to it over the years.

1340
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,540
If you study propaganda, if you study social...

1341
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,420
If you study social control, this is what they've done for a very, very long time.

1342
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,580
And they make it seem like it's so simple.

1343
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:04,740
Yeah.

1344
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,540
Oh, Lord.

1345
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,380
Nobody knows when the phones are going to work or not.

1346
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,560
Like you handle that pretty comfortably there, and I sure admire that.

1347
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,980
Now, which color is this?

1348
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,460
Do we know?

1349
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,900
I'm just totally confused.

1350
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:18,860
It's Dr. Ronius again.

1351
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,560
I finally...

1352
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,740
I'm a little bit less confused now.

1353
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,260
You sound a lot better.

1354
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,340
Hold your finger right next to your place in the script like this.

1355
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,760
A big difference is I can hear you now.

1356
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,440
I had to...

1357
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,760
I had to put my funny device in my ear, brain thing, and now...

1358
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,440
He's so funny, I could hear myself.

1359
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,020
Certainly a lot less confused than I was before, too.

1360
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,980
Dare I take another caller here?

1361
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:43,840
Yes, you should.

1362
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,500
Oh, nope.

1363
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,380
Nope, they're gone.

1364
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,360
Well, there went that opportunity.

1365
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,140
Well, let's imagine what it might have asked.

1366
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,040
We'll say, ask Dr. Howell sometimes.

1367
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,480
Why don't we ask Dr. Howell if he can psychoparametrically...

1368
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,120
...conceive of what that caller might have in whatever dimension that exists...

1369
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,840
...that he might have, you know, said or asked?

1370
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:13,180
That caller wished to complain about some minor variation in an abstruse point of subgenius doctrine.

1371
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,040
And I don't know that we have the time to get into such hardcore theology.

1372
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,540
There's that fart sound effect.

1373
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,040
Yep, that's another caller coming in.

1374
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,060
Yes, that's...

1375
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:22,980
Hello, you're on the air.

1376
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,800
Whoa!

1377
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,360
Whoa!

1378
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:26,800


1379
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,460
Whoa!

1380
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:27,820


1381
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:28,120


1382
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1383
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1384
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1385
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1386
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1387
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1388
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1389
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1390
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1391
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1392
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1393
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1394
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,420


1395
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,040
It's shouting.

1396
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,660
A plaintiff.

1397
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,900
They're crying out.

1398
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,440
Bob?

1399
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,260
They're later.

1400
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:33,760
Bob?

1401
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,640
They're crying out in the storm.

1402
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,480
Bob?

1403
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,280
Bob?

1404
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,820
Oh, my.

1405
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,280
Oh, my God.

1406
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,080
This is amazing.

1407
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,140
Bob?

1408
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,640
Gosh, this advances in communication.

1409
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,000
It really is something.

1410
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,000
Yes, this has to be the most entertaining show ever.

1411
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,840
Welcome to my world.

1412
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,200
After all the callers...

1413
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,440
Participants and...

1414
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,380
You see these tools I have to work with, Mr. Napier.

1415
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,100
Also, a lot of audience participation there.

1416
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,320
It's nothing to be worried about.

1417
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:07,620
Exactly.

1418
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,220
If you're going to have your thumb cut off, it might be.

1419
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,860
Bear in mind that there are all kinds of little, little, little, little teeny sardine-sized caveats

1420
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,160
floating around in this here subgenius church.

1421
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,560
And a lot of them have to do with getting off.

1422
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,200
You know, I love sardines.

1423
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,340
Getting off this planet, you know.

1424
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,420
Unacquired taste.

1425
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:26,680
Yes.

1426
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,220
Fell off the vegan wagon.

1427
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,680
Sardines was one of the first things I went for, actually.

1428
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,520
So salty.

1429
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,500
No, man, I got them without any salt added.

1430
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,240
Oh, really?

1431
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,740
I was just craving cholesterol.

1432
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,600
Pure little fishlets.

1433
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:41,560
Yep.

1434
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,040
Skeleton, brain, eyeballs, everything.

1435
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:44,940
It's all edible.

1436
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,980
Have you ever had the halibut steak in a can?

1437
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,260
No, but I smelt them.

1438
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,960
Hell, I bit several of them.

1439
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,340
How about Amsterdam, where they have those cod stands?

1440
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,160
Where everybody's...

1441
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,260
The best fast food is cod.

1442
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,940
Lovely cod.

1443
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,760
It's a good thing, especially with the chips have the mayonnaise on them.

1444
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,960
Or Croatia, with those rat stands, where everybody's got the rat on the stick.

1445
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,060
And they listen to great music, too.

1446
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,920
That's not Croatia, that's Pomerania.

1447
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,640
Well, anyway...

1448
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,000
No, it's Pomeroy.

1449
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,640
It's not Pomerania, it's Pomeroy, Ohio.

1450
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,120
The Pomeranian...

1451
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,540
But there are a lot of...

1452
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,180
Sight of X-Day.

1453
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,640
Pomeranians there.

1454
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,200
There are a lot of Pomeranians in Pomeroy, but...

1455
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,620
Pomeranians.

1456
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:27,920
Pomeranians.

1457
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:27,920


1458
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,640
There's a poma, poma, poma, poma, pomeleon.

1459
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,020
Parma, police, arrest this man.

1460
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:38,780
Boy.

1461
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,680
You see, my friends, it's time for the world to end.

1462
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,400
Can we rewind this show?

1463
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,360
Once you were a man, once you were human...

1464
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,460
Let's play it back in reverse.

1465
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,760
It sounds a lot better.

1466
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,600
More straight to the point there.

1467
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,060
Oh, yeah.

1468
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,720
Didn't we do this last year?

1469
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,840
Weren't we in the same room?

1470
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,760
And I was making the same dumb jokes a year ago, too.

1471
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,900
We're doomed to repeat this loop until they actually occur.

1472
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:10,120
Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

1473
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,960
And it sucks more every time.

1474
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,140
Oh, imagine that.

1475
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,840
You're on the air.

1476
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,440
It's Janice again.

1477
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,740
Hello.

1478
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,640
Hello, Janice.

1479
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,160
Welcome back.

1480
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,520
So you're in the Windy City.

1481
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,860
You're in Chicago.

1482
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,140
What's happening on the Janice side?

1483
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,980
Well, we are thinking about who to rub out next.

1484
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:34,740
I like Denver because the area code is 303, and that's one of my favorite drum machines.

1485
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,080
And then there's Bob Denver.

1486
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,340
There are other things that have to be paid for.

1487
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,420
It goes well with the 808, which spells, um...

1488
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,320
That's the Hawaiian area code, and I don't like Hawaii.

1489
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,980
I don't like Hawaii.

1490
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,120
Boy, that wind is picking up again.

1491
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,380
You can hear the wind.

1492
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,480
Hello, you're on the air.

1493
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,760
We'll return to Subgenius Goes Hawaiian in a moment.

1494
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,020
Yep.

1495
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,560
I can't hear a blame thing.

1496
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,660
Speak up.

1497
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,660
I hate this.

1498
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,880
It's only getting worse.

1499
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,460
I hear the forest fire.

1500
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,480
It's getting worse and worse and worse.

1501
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,720
The conspiracy.

1502
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,160
The conspiracy.

1503
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,020
The conspiracy is trying to censor the X-Day Broadway.

1504
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,420
Okay.

1505
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,280
You guys always think.

1506
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,240
But that's another thing.

1507
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,600
The Brunhilde look.

1508
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,400
You can't hear your own head.

1509
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,720
If your blood pressure is high enough, you can.

1510
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:45,040
If you have any blood on the other hand, I'd be very, very worried about talking to these people.

1511
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,320
You can't lick your own back.

1512
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,220
Well, you know, let's not be too certain.

1513
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,020
Actually, I had a special surgery that removed a couple.

1514
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,380
Ribs and a couple of vertebrae.

1515
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,420
And now I am capable of licking my own back.

1516
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,420
Thank you very much.

1517
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,380
Where did you get that done?

1518
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:00,940
That's exciting.

1519
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,860
Same place Marilyn Manson had his work done.

1520
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,160
What do you?

1521
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,500
I managed to get like one vertebrae in the very first part of my lips.

1522
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,000
And then once I had it there, I held it there.

1523
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,860
And actually, I had a lip transplant.

1524
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,860
I had the lips transplanted into my vertebrae.

1525
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,760
And you have to swim with the rest of them.

1526
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,420
But the lower part, the coccyx.

1527
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,400
The part where the...

1528
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,120
Coccyx.

1529
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,320
He said coccyx.

1530
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,740
I think they teach that in downtown, but I...

1531
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,740
Important nerves.

1532
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,860
Hello, you're on the air.

1533
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,100
As with all that work done, you're the hunchback of sinister dame.

1534
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,360
I'm going to try cutting out one of the lines here and see if that helps.

1535
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
So, nothing personal.

1536
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,140
And now it still sucks because we got someone on line two.

1537
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,380
Hey, Janice, I got to hang up on you too.

1538
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:54,320
What's going on?

1539
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,460
Nothing personal.

1540
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,280
Well, there he went.

1541
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,180
Sounds good suddenly.

1542
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,560
Janice Blackseed.

1543
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,780
But we are glad he called.

1544
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,480
Maybe we can only take one at a time.

1545
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,360
Maybe we should just try...

1546
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,540
As long as they're not on line two.

1547
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,500
Juggling one caller at a time.

1548
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,040
I don't know.

1549
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,060
I'm getting kind of tired of this, but this is a good time to pause for station identification.

1550
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,020
Station identification.

1551
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,780
Station identification.

1552
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,460
Station identification.

1553
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,140
Station identification.

1554
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:16,780
Station identification.

1555
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,380
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry.

1556
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,000
Hour of...

1557
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,520
Slack.

1558
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:47,220
For free information, write to P.O. Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 or see www.subgenius.com.

1559
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,440
Praise Bob!

1560
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,420
Praise Bob!
