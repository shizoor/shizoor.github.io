1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,820
For I'm often drunk, and I'm seldom sober, a constant roving from town to town.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:25,720
But I'm older now, and my sporting's over, so won't you come to lay me down?

3
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:35,520
Just lay my head on a keg of brandy.

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,520
It is my fancy, I do declare.

5
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:55,700
For while I'm drinking, I'm often thinking of lovely moments.

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,120
I'll leave from the county clear.

7
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,100
This is why I told y'all you gotta come up with something better.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm gonna sit there and do this.

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,260
Keep going, that's beautiful.

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,260
This is beautiful.

11
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,940
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the subgenius of Slug.

12
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,700
Funny?

13
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,380
Well, I don't mean funny exactly.

14
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,780
It's kinda hard to explain.

15
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,060
I see.

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,780
Sometimes I feel real good, and then other times, I feel like I was gonna get sick right in my stomach.

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,700
Well, it doesn't take much doing.

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,040
You alright, man?

19
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,620
Yeah.

20
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,420
Yeah, what's up?

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,540
Okay, we're down here at Cafe Sub-D.

22
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,680
We're down on the floor of Cafe Sub-Genie Rave, because that's what happened next, man.

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,500
It was the Sub-Genius Rave, and everybody had the glow sticks, and you would've seen

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,200
him going out there in the field, doing the twist.

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620
It was really cool.

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,940
Yeah, it was good what happened.

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,120
And Rocknar had a special power outlet next to his tent, which he used to fill his junk.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,580
Rocknar sounds like he was the...

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,380
Giant air mattress.

30
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,020
Mel of the ball.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
Nonetheless, was...

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,340
So, like, it was running the whole time, trying to keep air in it.

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,460
Well, it leaked faster than the thing could pump air into it.

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,260
So, Rocknar just ended up putting the spigot in this...

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,240
Some orifice in his body.

36
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,480
We're not gonna name names.

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,840
He got what?

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm just saying, it wasn't on the planet.

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,520
Did he get T-back this year?

40
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,380
No, he did not.

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
Speaking of objectionable...

42
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,240
Objectionable.

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,540
We had the best Bob...

44
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,460
Baptism ever.

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,020
I missed it.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,740
It was...

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,760
We had no cameras allowed, and that's why it worked.

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,460
We've insisted on no cameras the last couple of years, because it drove the girls away, right?

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,100
Yeah.

50
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,300
They know what guys are gonna do to those pictures.

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,980
What was also driving the girls away was Dr. Legume, who always ran the baptisms.

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,520
And so this time...

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,860
And he wasn't really up for that this time.

54
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,440
And I...

55
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,480
Jesus wasn't there.

56
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,680
So Dr. Howell and I did the baptizing.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,440
You need a...

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,700
The fact that Dr....

59
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,540
The sex god, Dr. Howell, and myself were...

60
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,100
And we had our clothes on, too.

61
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,880
We had our holy robes and stuff.

62
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,060
Everybody else was naked.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:49,900
Women jumped into that pool who have never been baptized before, including Princess Wee and the beautiful Barbara Alien.

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,160
It was worth it to me.

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,900
The whole X-Day was worth it just to see those sights.

66
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,660
Yeah.

67
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:56,940
Yeah, you know who...

68
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, I've been waiting years...

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,900
You know, I...

70
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,440
Maybe...

71
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,660
In some cases, to see those two ladies naked.

72
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,300
Maybe we need a John the Bobtist.

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,040
You know, an official guy responsible for those duties.

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
No, I think I'm gonna do it from now on.

75
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,840
It's fun.

76
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,600
Yeah.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Better than Viagra.

78
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,360
You push the people's...

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,600
And plus, I personalized each one.

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,920
I didn't say the same thing.

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,740
I said special things.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,940
I was able to remember everybody's name.

83
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,900
And Dr. Howell would catch them and...

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,480
Keep them from drowning after I pushed them underwater.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,080
It was just a spectacular, spirit-filled thing.

86
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,120
I kept my glasses on this time so I could appreciate what I was doing.

87
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
There were a couple of subgeniuses.

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,460
When we baptized them, they stayed down.

89
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,720
And we know that they are the ones who are most beloved by Bob.

90
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
They're with Bob now.

91
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,360
You know what I was wondering?

92
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,440
I was wondering...

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,060
What were you wondering?

94
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,880
I was wondering about...

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,140
About Reverend Ivan's name.

96
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,040
If his wife was left behind.

97
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,460
I was wondering if I could have his wife.

98
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,300
In your dreams.

99
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,280
Pardon me if I sound a little distracted.

100
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm trying to finish operating on this old man's heart.

101
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,140
This morning was the high-stack flapjack pancake breakfast

102
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,240
attended by a ravenous mob of slavering subs

103
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,060
who reduced the stacks of dough to a memory.

104
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,660
No longer even the...

105
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,060
To the

106
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:49,660
That meal had stick-to-itiveness.

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,540
Stick to your ribs.

108
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,560
Stick to your teeth.

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,120
A stick to your ribs subgenius.

110
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,560
repass. Now, the

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,720
Subgenius

112
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,500
International Chili Cook-Off

113
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,740
is coming up at 4 o'clock

114
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,480
today. That's right.

115
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,760
The cooks are the Iron Chefs

116
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,500
and Velvet Chefs and so forth.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,500
They're all hard at work.

118
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,740
They're opening cans, no doubt.

119
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,500
How long has it been since you

120
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,260
wrapped your lips around a warm

121
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,460
steaming bowl of Wolf Brand

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,160
Chili? Or, in this case,

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Subgenius Brand Chili.

124
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,400
Dr. Howell, how can you, a non-Texan,

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,920
quote the Wolf Brand Chili ad?

126
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,880
Well, that's too long.

127
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,060
Because in Arizona,

128
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,400
we also were bombarded with the same

129
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,700
show for Wolf Brand Chili.

130
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,500
...

131
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,280
...

132
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,420
...

133
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,920
...

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,380
...

135
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,380


136
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,380


137
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,380


138
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,580
...

139
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:16,600
...

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:16,820
...

141
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,400
It was 1779

142
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,200
when Thomas

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,820
Hereford Webber Bufferson

144
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,260
said, give me guns or sandwiches,

145
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,740
a true patriot,

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,140
he never once stopped...

147
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,260
Uh, I'm sorry,

148
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,100
what did he stop?

149
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,100
He never once stopped.

150
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
He never once stopped.

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,340
Until his unfortunate death in 1804,

152
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,260
struck by lightning at the door

153
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,440
of his Williamsburg farmhouse,

154
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,140
after one more occasion

155
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,240
than was necessary of exposing

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,640
himself to the neighbors.

157
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,700
After his radical experiments

158
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,820
with the hemp flowers,

159
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,260
as he used to call them,

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,500
the

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,520
his cholesterol levels were so high he could...

162
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,800
Oh, it's fallen now.

163
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,120
He's fallen.

164
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,320
Look, Jefferson is on his knees now.

165
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:04,920
He's...

166
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,840
But at least Hamilton

167
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,520
still lives.

168
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,860
Plop.

169
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,880
Now, as I recall,

170
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,220
I think it was 1828

171
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,480
when we first established

172
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,380
a precedent of how to deal

173
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,640
with these so-called

174
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,540
sub-administrators.

175
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,360
Sub-administrators.

176
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,360


177
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,360


178
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,380
Sub-administrators.

179
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:24,380


180
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,160
You're saying this right, Senator?

181
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,780
What's that?

182
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,640
Well, that was, uh,

183
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,640
Buford Alcibiades Dobbs,

184
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,900
uh, down at, uh,

185
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,880
the plantation,

186
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,000
which was, uh,

187
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
known as the Grange

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,140
in those days.

189
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,540
He started the mess.

190
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Then he was some sort of

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,260
masonic now.

192
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,160
Oh, they said he had, uh,

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,240
magical powers.

194
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
Yeah, I was gonna say,

195
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,720
he had the magic, uh,

196
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
powers in his...

197
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,200
The magical falderol,

198
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,940
that's what it was.

199
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,280
In his gree-gree bag.

200
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,240
Now, I notice, uh,

201
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,740
you're wearing one of those

202
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,380
unattractive clothes.

203
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,120
You have gree-gree bags

204
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,860
on sale for $19.95

205
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,440
in the Congressional Commissary,

206
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,140
but, uh, why?

207
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,980
That's, uh, all I can ask.

208
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,180
One of the sevens of...

209
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,520
Well, sir,

210
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,400
after an intestinal operation,

211
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,720
one has to wear a gree-gree bag,

212
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,880
if that is, uh,

213
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,940
what one is calling them

214
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,500
these days.

215
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,360
I see.

216
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,300
They will never make

217
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,380
the heights of fashion,

218
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,600
but they are essential

219
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
for a gentleman

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,420
in certain difficulties.

221
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,640
You mind if I empty mine here?

222
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,400
Uh, yes.

223
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,900
The sandwich boy

224
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,600
will take care

225
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760
of your vessel there.

226
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,700
Um, this Bob,

227
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
J.R. Bob,

228
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,840
I forgot the name right now.

229
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,120
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

230
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,640
has he ever

231
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,420
entreated you

232
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,740
into any sort of

233
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,900
slap-happy games

234
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,800
with this, uh,

235
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,140
vesicle you're wearing now?

236
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, they're always

237
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,780
up to their

238
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,800
hijinks and shenanigans.

239
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,300
They can't keep it down

240
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,380
to a dull roar

241
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,260
or confine it

242
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,320
to the rumpus room.

243
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,060
But before I go

244
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,700
any further,

245
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,240
Senator,

246
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,960
I want to read

247
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,540
a certain statement

248
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,340
into the record.

249
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
To a certain...

250
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,500
Go, go, Roddy.

251
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,000
That I...

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,560
Uh...

253
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,160
Go for it.

254
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,040
...am not now,

255
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,480
nor have I

256
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,780
ever been

257
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,680
a member

258
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
of the human race.

259
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,520
Well, um,

260
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,700
it seems...

261
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,800
Now, I'm looking

262
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,680
at something here

263
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,240
that says something

264
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,460
quite different, sir.

265
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,480
It seems you have been

266
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,840
a member of the human race

267
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,100
and disavowed

268
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,080
your genetic, uh,

269
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,340
herology...

270
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,460
What's the damn word

271
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,060
I'm looking for?

272
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,080
Your inheritance...

273
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,660
Right.

274
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes.

275
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,040
And I'm wondering

276
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,240
why this whole

277
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,420
congressional committee

278
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,520
is wondering

279
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,820
why.

280
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
Because, sir,

281
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,620
as it says, uh,

282
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,360
in the old book,

283
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,780
as I will remind

284
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,080
the honorable member,

285
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,960
I know...

286
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,580
When, uh,

287
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,840
one is in the court

288
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,960
of the king,

289
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,880
one is a king's man,

290
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,800
as it were.

291
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,960
Well, uh,

292
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,040
this has not been

293
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,620
a monarchy

294
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,400
since, uh,

295
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,040
Tuesday,

296
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,680
uh,

297
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,520
Sennenhofer.

298
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,040
Uh, I mean, sir,

299
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm sorry,

300
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
I was talking to myself.

301
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,740
Let the king

302
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,780
do the will

303
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,500
of the king.

304
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,820
The law

305
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,460
and not his own will.

306
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
For when the will

307
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,820
rules and not the law,

308
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,020
then there is no law

309
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,340
and no king.

310
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,060
Only the subgenius

311
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,180
can perform

312
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,300
under his own genius

313
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,160
and enact his own will.

314
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
Let what need

315
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,940
be rendered

316
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,760
unto Caesar

317
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,560
be rendered

318
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,380
unto Caesar

319
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,100
with a thick,

320
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
unintelligible

321
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,280
magic marker.

322
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,760
Well, silence, silence.

323
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,640
We get your drift,

324
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,560
Mr. Monogram.

325
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,340
And ladies and gentlemen,

326
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
you know him,

327
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,700
you love him,

328
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,900
you can't live without him,

329
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,860
the reverend

330
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,160
Alex M. Thompson.

331
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:31,900
Yeah!

332
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,980
I never knew

333
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,920
the M before.

334
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,080
The reverend Alex.

335
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,340
Friends,

336
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,980
dear, dear, dear, dear friends,

337
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,300
I have what may well be

338
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,160
one of the shortest rants

339
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,080
after long, long periods

340
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,000
of conflict,

341
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,100
conflicted mindsets

342
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,200
and what should I,

343
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
what could I,

344
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:53,980
what should I rant about?

345
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,300
So many things,

346
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,540
so many choices,

347
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,480
so many decisions.

348
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
What to be angry about this week?

349
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,860
Oh, God,

350
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,500
what's the latest catastrophe

351
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,900
to bitch about?

352
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,960
You know, friends,

353
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I have something very simple,

354
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,040
very true to say

355
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,360
to all of you.

356
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,940
And that is

357
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,280
that this church,

358
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,720
the church of the subgenius,

359
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,480
ladies and gentlemen,

360
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,480


361
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,340
is now and ever shall be

362
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,320
the greatest cult

363
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,940
that has ever,

364
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,060
or will ever

365
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,320
darken the face of this earth.

366
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,340
Yeah!

367
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,640
Yeah!

368
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,880
Yeah!

369
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,260
Yeah!

370
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,800
Yeah!

371
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,540
Are you through

372
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,520
with your questions now?

373
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,320
Yes, sir.

374
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,480
Now let me tell you the story

375
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,040
of one of England's

376
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,780
greatest crickets.

377
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,620
Deceit, hate, and each other all,

378
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,900
Deceit, hate, and each other all,

379
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,740
he presents

380
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,800
eeeeeeeeee!

381
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
Every man a sacred horse,

382
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,740
MacPherson,

383
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,340
on the air.

384
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
His cricket kidney was smashed.

385
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,860
Man was craped, sacred,

386
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,900
called MacPherson,

387
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,920
is a big fake rare.

388
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,060
His cricket children

389
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,200
suddenly blew up.

390
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,980
Or is Thor

391
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,100
right the state of share?

392
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,060
His cricket car was so bad.

393
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,400
You seem a mutant,

394
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,940
for me,

395
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,640
a new treatment.

396
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,440
And this cricket

397
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,100
was offered

398
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,760
a Hollywood movie contract.

399
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,240
Frush it, Moose Man!

400
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,700
Our special guest tonight

401
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:14,760
is a man

402
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:14,860
who is

403
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:14,860


404
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:14,860


405
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:14,860


406
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:14,860


407
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:14,900
my guest for tonight

408
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,980
is Fantastic Paul.

409
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,180
But before we introduce

410
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,000
Fantastic Paul

411
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,620
in person,

412
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,220
let's begin

413
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,420
with real one.

414
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,620
This hot man

415
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,400
is shaving

416
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,000
one of the best

417
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,560
third basemen

418
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,300
in the National League.

419
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
He is in Wonderland.

420
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,300
Dear Bill,

421
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,600
I've got a skin

422
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,200
on my face

423
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
but not anymore though.

424
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,740
I find skin

425
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,440
like mine.

426
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:33,740
Signed,

427
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,060
me.

428
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,980
And that cricket

429
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,260
was a girl!

430
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,720
Hey!

431
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,120
Strange isn't it?

432
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:52,280
No, these are the real thing. These are examples of Reverend Enni and Reverend V's wonderful pancake artistry.

433
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,540
Well, they are beautiful specimens of their kind.

434
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,680
They look completely realistic.

435
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:09,120
They do. The top one looks something like the moon of Saturn, Iapetus, the surface with its many craters and fumaroles and the scorched upper sands of the tormented moon.

436
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,960
Is that the one that the robot landed on and they got nice footage of the landing on the distant moon?

437
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,860
Yeah, that robot's up there now.

438
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:26,180
And you know, the robots on Mars, the tiny human infants inside the two...

439
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,340
They've been doing real well.

440
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Yeah, they're about ready to shift them into open air experiments.

441
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,660
Their lungs have developed enough that they seem to be able to survive.

442
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,920
Now, if those two infants can crawl from the respect...

443
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,300
If those two active Mars explorer robots cross Mars and meet each other and reproduce, it'll be like Blue Lagoon.

444
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,700
Well, Red Lagoon.

445
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,580
Yes, well, it would be a little bit harsher.

446
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,440
And a new race of Martian humans can begin.

447
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,160
It's so romantic.

448
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,740
Of course, they'll probably just die.

449
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,920
Of course, government programs are strange.

450
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,140
And the fact that sometimes they don't seem to be created by people who take the long view.

451
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,080
And another...

452
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
Sometimes they do.

453
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,400
And one cannot ever be sure which of the two alternatives is the more terrifying.

454
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:24,340
Well, we know from Dobbs' prophecy that there are two futures for the human race, if it survives at all.

455
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:36,340
In the far distant future, if the conspiracy wins, humans will be heads, floating heads, with very well-developed hands and fingers.

456
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,360
But that's about it.

457
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,220
Heads with hands.

458
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,500
If Bob wins...

459
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,060
That was what H.G. Wells predicted.

460
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:51,560
If Bob wins, however, the human race will finally end in not quite as large heads and great big hands and great big genitalia.

461
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,020
It's a big difference between the conspiracy future and Bob's future.

462
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,720
Nothing we need to worry about immediately.

463
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,780
This is millions and millions of years in the distant future.

464
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,900
It's strange why they should choose to externalize the sex organ.

465
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,660
But perhaps giving it more surface area was in itself an aesthetic statement of the race in those advanced times.

466
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:27,220
Because the business all takes place in the brain, the largest and most concupiscent sex organ in the body.

467
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,120
As Zappa called it, your dirtiest organ.

468
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:30,940
Yes.

469
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,600
Let me tell you one thing.

470
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,200
If you have a plan on going out, you've got to first go out.

471
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,980
And that young people are turning to drugs.

472
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:52,080
It's because of the Federal Rehabilitation Center, a better welfare psychologist, a psychiatrist, where you've got so many troubled young people.

473
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,540
And man's nature delays.

474
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,480
He'd run around, run around, run around, run around, run around.

475
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,640
With his fist stuck up, a knife in his hand, a gun in his belt, and a punch bird in his mouth.

476
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,020
Because he doesn't have guts enough to ask Bob to forgive him.

477
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,460
Because he doesn't want to bow down.

478
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,620
You know, you quit drinking, you quit smoking, you quit running around, you go to hell.

479
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,920
That last cut was a reverend brainer.

480
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,980
And now...

481
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:32,160
This pleasing sylvan scene, this light on the grass, the song of birds, the swallow twittering from the straw-billed shed.

482
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,600
The puking of Banjo-Bob.

483
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
Only the seeming of things.

484
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes, because Banjo-Bob is one of those phantoms.

485
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,300
Not actually physically present.

486
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,000
But one can intuit his presence.

487
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,620
And then soon the ghostly imago of Banjo-Bob begins to reform out of the black ether.

488
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,340
And pretty soon he stands before you, trombone in hand.

489
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,820
An alien parasitical twin hanging out of his zipper.

490
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,540
Yes, it's called heteropagy.

491
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,760
And as it happens in this instance, it can happen in many others.

492
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,860
As the fabric and foundation.

493
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,300
The foundation garment of reality itself rips and gives way.

494
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,800
Revealing the naked but unwholesome truth which lay beneath.

495
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,760
I love it when you talk about that foundation garment underlying reality.

496
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,640
It seems so intimate.

497
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,520
Language is metaphorical.

498
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,920
And if only we could unzip the zipper and snap the snaps.

499
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:37,540
Which draw the veil of incomprehension over the true sights of the glories of the universe and the beauties of nature.

500
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:47,740
We could progress, ideally, to those sunlit uplands where the sacred subgenius amusement arcade stands at the top of a green hill.

501
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,440
There's where the punchline is found.

502
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,360
I don't fly anymore because of that.

503
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,720
This is Hal getting to, actually, three and a half weeks later.

504
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,400
I'm singled out for special treatment by the airport gestinkener gestapo.

505
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,440
That's because you are...

506
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,680
Because you're a subgenius.

507
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:07,700
A subgenius.

508
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,380
Down with George Bush. Allah is great.

509
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,020
Oh, did I say that? I mean...

510
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,080
I mean...

511
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,860
No, no, no. It had everything to do with the fact that you show up on the screen as a kooky cult minister.

512
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:21,600
Woohoo!

513
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,640
I'm ready to convert the world.

514
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,880
So there's just this joke...

515
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,260
This is J.R. Bob Dobbs, everybody.

516
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,440
In the joke column one it says, check this guy out.

517
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
So they just have fun with you as you go through security.

518
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,660
Now we always pull the subgenius.

519
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,620
We pull the subgenius out of the line.

520
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,200
Unless we're in those strange circumstances where we can't tell who the subgenius is.

521
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,980
In that case we simply detain the whole line.

522
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,400
It's part of the Transportation Safety Administration.

523
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
All right.

524
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,900
Well, um...

525
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,400
I completely quit traveling by air because of that.

526
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,400
Well, you... But the funny thing is, even though they made me flip down my...

527
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,320
Well, uh... You know... Your mind.

528
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,500
I couldn't find the, uh... You know...

529
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Which was right there, where they...

530
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,260
Oh, really?

531
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,600
Yeah.

532
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,400
Did they stick their hands in your pants this time?

533
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,640
Woohoo!

534
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,320
Oh, uh... Well, um...

535
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,360
No, they didn't.

536
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,300
But you never know whether they will or not.

537
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,340
I started to unsit my pants when they did it to me and they said,

538
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,520
No, sir, that's enough.

539
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,600
Stop! Sir, please, that's enough.

540
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,860
And I said, no, you got me started.

541
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,320
Now I'm gonna show you the whole thing.

542
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,720
So, if you want to get on the helicopter, you're going to have to line up over there and...

543
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,840
Sir, please, put that back in your pants!

544
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,840
All right, now it's your turn, madam. Step forward, please.

545
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,100
I'll just touch you with the special wand.

546
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,080
Here...

547
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,240
Bend over...

548
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,720
And here...

549
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,840
A little bit farther...

550
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,960
And here...

551
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh, sir, that's not my bag!

552
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,680
And it looks like you're carrying some contraband.

553
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,060
I'm gonna have to search your inner cavity with my special flesh wand.

554
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,840
This man is deemed an accredited transportation safety engineer.

555
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,620
He's a slumming slumber.

556
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,220
He's a lecherous old man...

557
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,960
Meanwhile...

558
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,100
...filled with sin and perversion.

559
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,200
...left hours ago and we're standing by the sideways of the highways.

560
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,620
Yes, it's terrible.

561
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,380
At the byways.

562
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,780
The byways of the sides of the highways are lonely places...

563
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,120
So, did you take that ride that you go inside Ivan Stang's mind?

564
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:34,960
Yes, I did, because I managed to fly from Boston to Cleveland in the nick of time

565
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,700
to be picked up by Princess Elizabeth.

566
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,640
And taken back to the Stang Mansion.

567
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,680
Quaint, curious, grumbling remnant of an earlier time period.

568
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,940
Yes, when we're doing the house and we're coming over the radio, we do fill your...

569
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,780
I mean, we fill your entire house.

570
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,400
And as we traveled down the street, as she turned the corner, right in front of the car,

571
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,560
there was a strutting wild turkey.

572
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,620
I thought we just caused her pain by the sheer magnitude of the show.

573
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,800
This turkey was running into traffic and causing cars to slam on their brakes.

574
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,700
And she said that it was often seen wandering around the neighborhood, perhaps thought to be a slum.

575
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,500
Perhaps thought to be somebody's pet.

576
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:16,060
Or maybe even a remnant of the original wild turkeys that inhabited those woods as recently as a hundred years ago.

577
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,560
That turkey was over a hundred years old?

578
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,960
Well, no one knows where that turkey came from, but it's constantly running out into traffic and causing cars to slam on their brakes.

579
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,840
Well, I'd die with that behavior and live another hundred years.

580
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,080
I know, I know.

581
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,460
It's not a waddling fat farm turkey, it's a wild turkey.

582
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,220
This is a wild turkey who's lost its ability to survive in the wild.

583
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,120
Just like the one on the liquor bottle.

584
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,300
It can't look out for the train, turkey!

585
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:51,100
Then when I got to stately Stang Manor, I galloped down the back stairs so I could start doing my laundry in their washing machine.

586
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,480
Please, please, turkey, get off the tracks now.

587
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:01,860
And their spider-haunted basement with the low ceilings scuttling with spiders, I quickly chucked my laundry into the washing machine.

588
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,660
Alright, our next question here.

589
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,140
And if the questioner wants to be identified, you can raise your hand and say, hey, that's me.

590
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:11,940
Absolutely.

591
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,880
You know, there's something else, Reverend Stang.

592
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:23,180
The Ask Dr. Hal show back home, where I come from, in San Francisco, has all sorts of peaks and valleys, nodules and lumps.

593
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,580
And this is sort of bland, moving along in a linear fashion.

594
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,600
One thing we do is we reward people who ask exceptionally good questions.

595
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,360
I don't suppose we have any rewards we could give away.

596
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,200
At home, we pour them a shot of Fernet.

597
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,560
About here.

598
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,140
Oh, yeah, sure.

599
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,340
Actually, I have a big box of Hour of Slut duplicate CDs.

600
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,900
Well, there you go.

601
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,940
These are your downloaded MP3s.

602
00:23:49,940 --> 00:24:01,020
These are the original CDs with a separate track for each brilliant cut of the Dr. Hal show or whatever show we've vampirized and parasitized.

603
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,360
The active result of this is that you actually...

604
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,340
Yeah. So...

605
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,980
...walk away with something in your hand more than just having Valderal in your head.

606
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:17,000
So having a little bit of an offer of value that adds a little bit of roughage.

607
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,580
Well, how about that next question?

608
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:25,160
Okay. This next question would be, is it true, Dr. Hal, that evil clowns live in the woods?

609
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,360
Well, it would be presumptuous.

610
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,460
It would be presumptuous of me to deny that there have never been evil clowns in these particular woods.

611
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,460
You see...

612
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,600
Well, let me just be a little bit more explicit here.

613
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,640
We are surrounded by the Hutterite and Amish people.

614
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,560
And they have a strong tradition of solemnity about their religious observances, seriousness.

615
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,520
And so...

616
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,000
...it does become necessary...

617
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,320
...from time to time...

618
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:10,720
...for certain of those who wish to operate in a clandestine fashion, somewhat in the manner of werewolves,

619
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:19,100
to sneak out from their communities and commit the solecism in the privacy of the rural bushes,

620
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,260
which can never be committed in society.

621
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,660
And so we may indeed, from time to time, have a number of grimacing clowns,

622
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,300
but the only evil they do is the evil to the restrictive community from which they live.

623
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,680
And so, if they did, I would be very happy if they did,

624
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,900
and provide relaxation and slack for all.

625
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,660
Friends, if you happen to hear the call of the evil clown in the woods, which is...

626
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,600
Well, that sounds like Philo.

627
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,060
Well, draw your own conclusions.

628
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,980
I've actually been holding back a lot of hate.

629
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,200
I'm trying very hard.

630
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,940
Don't hold back your hate.

631
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,280
You know, there's this little, you know, you can't hold back the hate.

632
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


633
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


634
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


635
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


636
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


637
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


638
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,280


639
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,900
line you have between holding back hate, you know, you start brewing it and brewing it

640
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,140
and brewing it. Because, you know, of all the stuff that Bob has taught me, he taught

641
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:16,360
me hate first. It was this whole thing. I used to be one of these little...

642
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:24,600
Hate to admit it. I was a hippie. I was a dirty, patchouli-wearing, grateful, dead-following,

643
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:38,380
fish-listening hippie. I was all about peace and love and, like, friendly, warm, fuzzy

644
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,920
feelings. You know, what Bob showed me is that you have warm fuzzies, but the cold pricklies

645
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:54,380
are a lot more fun. Bob showed me that sometimes when you're driving by somebody, it's really

646
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,580
nice.

647
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:03,420
It's nice to just go, you fucking cunt! Bob showed me that hate is okay. And Bob has

648
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,720
showed everybody that hate is okay, because after you come to an ex-day and Bob fucks

649
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,020
you over, the hate starts to build, and it builds and builds and builds, and then you

650
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,260
come next year. Bob fucks you over again, and the hate starts to build and build and

651
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,400
build and build and build. It's all about the hate.

652
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,340
You've got to embrace the hate. If you don't embrace the hate, then you

653
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:24,580
are a cunt.

654
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,420
If you are one of these smart monkeys, dumb monkeys, monkeys, monkeys, monkeys, you end

655
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:41,680
up becoming a robot of yourself. That hate is a freedom. That hate is love. How can you

656
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:47,560
have one without the other? You have to, you know, you have to have something on both ends.

657
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,580
For every Bob, there's an anti-Bob. For every Connie, there's an anti-Bob. For every Connie,

658
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:54,580


659
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,380
there's an anti-Connie. And you know what? Connie is the anti-Bob. I've got to share

660
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:10,920
with you this. Connie is a gold digger, and she made the biggest score ever. If you're

661
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:18,680
a gold digger, who else do you want than the luckiest man alive? You can just run up the

662
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,560
credit card bill. He's going to find the money. He doesn't care. He's going to find the money.

663
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:34,380
No, no, she's not a prude, baby. Just because she hadn't come to your house yet. You must

664
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:43,360
be doing something wrong. We've all met her. Her and her Liz Claiborne khaki pants, Mary

665
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,640
Kay selling blonde bleached hair, Gucci purse having Prada shoe wearing gold digging ass.

666
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,540
We've all met her.

667
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,560
You know what?

668
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,960
You know why? Because that's the dark side of Connie, that side of Connie that tells

669
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:06,700
you boys, well, you've got to give me something first. That side of Connie that comes up to

670
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:14,700
you and says, well, yeah, sure, baby, I love you to death, but, you know, I need $50 to

671
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:22,540
make you holler. See, Bob is about the money, too. We know this. The difference is that

672
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,060
Bob never lied to us.

673
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,780
About the money.

674
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,060
There was never a lie. It was give me your money and I'll give you slack. If you don't

675
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:38,800
give me your money, you're not getting anything. Connie lied to us about the money. She really

676
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:47,240
did. She lied. You know, and I've gone for many years trying to kill Bob and saying fuck

677
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,720
Bob, and then I realized, you know what? Fuck Connie, too. Fuck Connie. Kill Connie.

678
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,100
Kill Connie.

679
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,680
And then fuck her.

680
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,640
Kill Connie. Why? What makes Connie so much better that we can kill Bob but not Connie?

681
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:16,060
Think of all the fun you can have killing Connie. Really. Exactly. I don't I'm not

682
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:23,820
prejudiced. I'm not racist. I'm not bigoted. I hate all you fucks equally. I don't like

683
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,760
I don't like this dirt hole.

684
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,180
I don't like the crap I have to deal with every day.

685
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,100
I don't like arrogant assholes.

686
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,940
I don't like drama.

687
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,040
I don't like bullshit.

688
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,740
And you know what?

689
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,920
Sometimes it's not a fucking joke.

690
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
It's not.

691
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,100
And fuck Connie and fuck Bob.

692
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,140
Keep going with it.

693
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,940
Keep going with it.

694
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,520
Because you know what?

695
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,560
Just separate sides of a coin.

696
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,020
Separate sides of a coin.

697
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,140
It's all the same energy, man.

698
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,660
It's just whether or not it has a dick or a cunt.

699
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,860
And that was Priestess Bices with noise by two beans.

700
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
And incidentally, there is a lottery.

701
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,480
You can be a lucky wiener here at SubgeniusCon9.

702
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,800
That's right.

703
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,000
We're going to be giving...

704
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,700
We're giving away the Rancid Triceratops Medallion and many other things.

705
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:33,800
In fact, we've got a swag auction coming up which will cause you to salivate with excitement when you see it.

706
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,580
The treasures of time are nothing to this horde.

707
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:47,260
Croesus' millions and Scrooge McDuck's money bin cannot begin to encompass some of the riches in this pile of wealth.

708
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,780
And that's after certain other so-called...

709
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,020
...high-level subgeniuses have already illegally been through it, scrounging through it and pulling out the best of it.

710
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,600
Even what remains is intensely desirable as a personal possession.

711
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:11,800
But you know, folks, the Church of the Subgenius is just like the cruel outside world in offering you these tempting tchotchkes.

712
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,700
Remember, they are only the symbols of slack and not the actuality.

713
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,440
They will not provide the spiritual relief.

714
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,440
That subgenius doctrine will.

715
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,380
But only its pale shadow, its insubstantial simulacrum.

716
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,940
It is a little cheaper, though.

717
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,460
Oh, well, and it does provide immediate satisfaction.

718
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,240
You know, let's not knock it.

719
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:45,700
We're just doctrinally bound to say that there are far greater, more toothsome delights and within reach, you know,

720
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,000
even than what we hand out in our philanthropic generosity and over all benevolence.

721
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,400
What happened to this microphone?

722
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,560
That's fine.

723
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,000
Okay.

724
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,220
This microphone is a buttless microphone, you see.

725
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,580
Yes, I see. Well, that shows that...

726
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,640
Because of that, it doesn't work.

727
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,380
Right. Well, were I buttless, I wouldn't work either.

728
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,200
I'd want someone to take care of me all through my wasted and worthless life.

729
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,180
Pity the buttless. For one day, you too might be among their number.

730
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,780
Or even the hemai.

731
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, yes.

732
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,400
But the buttless.

733
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,720
You know, the half-cheeked, they still have a hard row to hoe.

734
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:31,120
With only one ischial tuberosity, sitting is always a problem.

735
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:38,440
If you remember your Voltaire, this was the fate of the old lady who had one of her butt cheeks cut off in Candide.

736
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,240
Do you remember that novel?

737
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,360
The old lady with half an ass?

738
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,920
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

739
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,200
She had seen her share of tribulations and troubles.

740
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,440
There really...

741
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,000
There's a half-butted lady in Candide?

742
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,220
Yeah.

743
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,960
In Candide?

744
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I knew about Candida, but...

745
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,580
No, this was...

746
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,620
This character is referred to in the book, I believe, as the old lady with one buttock.

747
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,680
I don't think she has a name beyond that.

748
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,020
I admit, it's been some years since I read the book.

749
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,280
Who knows? Maybe I'm making it all up.

750
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
It's something I remember.

751
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,940
I don't have a copy here, but the point is...

752
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,580
You probably did make it up yourself.

753
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,020
Wishful thinking.

754
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,920
Oh, if only I could have a half-butted woman.

755
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:25,060
I don't think that that is very much on the front burner where I am, confidentially.

756
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,760
I was just guessing.

757
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,160
We're talking about our private suppositions, thoughts, and aspirations.

758
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:38,020
Why wish for the half package when one can so easily conjure up the whole on the screen of the mind?

759
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Yeah, the whole. Let's hear more about the whole.

760
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,420
Let us view the bright buttocks of joy and delight.

761
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,380
And I suppose you know the story of the Athena of the full buttocks.

762
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,460
Which was related somewhere by some Greek.

763
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,520
And the two sons of somebody or other.

764
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,320
Now this one I really have difficulty remembering.

765
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:07,980
But it seems that a certain beauty in Arcadia compared her buttocks to those of the goddess Aphrodite.

766
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,260
Who was incensed by this.

767
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,560
Oh yes, and so she, I still forget her name, but was known as the fair buttocks.

768
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,360
Was turned into...

769
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,240
A stone on Mount Sipylus.

770
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,960
Which weeps tears still to this day.

771
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,000
But, no wait a minute, I think I take that back. That one's not right.

772
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,500
Oh well, at any rate.

773
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,040
The Venus Calipygios was revered as the example of the most beautiful ass in the ancient world.

774
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:45,500
Thus the complimentary term Calipygian for a well assed person.

775
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,700
Yes, the Calipygian beauty.

776
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,880
My father likes to use that word.

777
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,740
A young, like a friend of my niece would come into the house and say,

778
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,380
My, you're quite Calipygianus, aren't you?

779
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,480
And they'll giggle.

780
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,520
And then he gets to explain what Calipygianus means.

781
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,040
And then do they still giggle?

782
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,820
You know how those smart ass know-it-alls are, don't you, Dr. Howell?

783
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,960
Yes, how annoying.

784
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,580
Those obfuscating mendacious peedants.

785
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,700
If I wanted to hear about it, I'd look it up in the dictionary.

786
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,960
Uh, yes, yes, yes.

787
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,860
But every subgenius has a little companion.

788
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,280
The book of subgenius wisdom, which travels in a cloud about him.

789
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,940
The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that deliver him, and they do their job.

790
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,240
You sure talk pretty, Dr. Howell.

791
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,560
By all means, provide some tranquilizers to the people.

792
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,640
To ease the strain and monotony of...

793
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,160
The subgenius power of...

794
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,880
...sweat.

795
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,920
A bottle of 100 should be adequate for a family of four.

796
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,320
Tranquilizers are not a narcotic and are not habit-forming.

797
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,120
Ask your doctor for his recommendation.

798
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,020
Bob.

799
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,180
Now, what time is the American astronaut screening tonight?

800
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,320
That's not going to be at the drive-in.

801
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,300
That will be shown probably on Monday.

802
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,920
We're gonna...

803
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,540
We'll...

804
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:23,720
It's slack-off day for me, which means I'll probably set up screens or something in the studio up at the top of the hill.

805
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,460
But no studio screening will take place tonight?

806
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
Not of American astronaut.

807
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,000
I believe tonight is Vincent Price night at the Bad Film drive-in.

808
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,180
What have they got?

809
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,140
I don't know, but there's signs here and there.

810
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,380
The team there.

811
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,640
Or something like that.

812
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,280
The abominable Dr. Fibes may have, so I don't know.

813
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,480
Actually, I don't know.

814
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,940
I don't know what they're... what he has.

815
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,780
But I'll show the American astronaut.

816
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,900
Friends, it's great.

817
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,820
If you haven't seen it, I don't know exactly how to describe it.

818
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,240
It's bull-dada.

819
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,140
Advertent bull-dada, not inadvertent bull-dada, which is what Dr. Dark specializes in.

820
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,940
He specializes in surrealism that was meant to be suspense.

821
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,680
Comedy that was meant to be horror.

822
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
And so forth.

823
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,780
And the American astronaut is funny when it's supposed to be.

824
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,640
A lot of the time, you're just going,

825
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,100
God, this is like fucked up.

826
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,320
This is one of the most fucked up things I ever saw.

827
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,880
It's great.

828
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,860
This is so fucked up.

829
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,520
So there you have it.

830
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,760
The American astronaut.

831
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,100
It's got some great special effects.

832
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,800
It's got music, actually.

833
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,660
It's a musical.

834
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,700
It's the first cowboy western musical set in outer space.

835
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,720
And it was directed by the guy who was singing on the stage last night.

836
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,300
Corey McAbby.

837
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,320
Oh, God.

838
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,500
The girls were throwing their panties up there at that guy,

839
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,600
shrieking like 12-year-olds at a David Cassidy concert.

840
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,820
These are married women with children.

841
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,800
It's just, oh, God, like Monkees fans.

842
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,880
I was like that.

843
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,500
Uh-oh.

844
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,900
Uh-oh.

845
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,680
Uh-oh.

846
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,800
Uh-oh.

847
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
Uh-oh.

848
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,520
Uh-oh.

849
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,140
Uh-oh.

850
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,760
Uh-oh.

851
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,080
Uh-oh.

852
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,520
Uh-oh.

853
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,320
Uh-oh.

854
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,940
Uh-oh.

855
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,540
Uh-oh.

856
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,620
Uh-oh.

857
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,780
Uh-oh.

858
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,420
Uh-oh.

859
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,000
Uh-oh.

860
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,580
Uh-oh.

861
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,100
Uh-oh.

862
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,720
Uh-oh.

863
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:17,920
Uh-oh.

864
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,360
Uh-oh.

865
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:18,900
Uh-oh.

866
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,040
Ah, ah.

867
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,640
Ah, ah.

868
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,140
Ah, ah.

869
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,660
Ah, ah.

870
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,840
dir was a gard'-n and there was a tree.

871
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,640
And there were three of me.

872
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,820
I was a snake and a crow and a cat, and in the tree, all three of me sat,

873
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,280
for eternity.

874
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:49,020
And that was that. One night an apple grew. And the apple knew everything that I knew.

875
00:39:49,540 --> 00:40:00,180
It was part of me and it was part of the tree. The tree that I climbed into and flew into and slithered to and now I grew.

876
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,460
And there I sat. As an apple and a snake and a crow and a cat.

877
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:14,760
And that was pretty much that until one day a girl who was not me came out to play.

878
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:23,140
And I could see what she wanted from me. She wanted to know what the apple knew.

879
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,580
And I said, you already do my dear.

880
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,420
Otherwise,

881
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,060
you wouldn't be here.

882
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,040
And she said, please.

883
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,260
I've come to eat the apples from the trees.

884
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,940
And I said, no.

885
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,300
I am an apple and a snake and a cat and a crow.

886
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,600
And she said, please.

887
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,780
I need to have that apple inside of me.

888
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,580
She wanted to know everything I knew.

889
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,440
And I said, but my dear, you already do.

890
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,560
Then she stamped her foot and said, for heaven's sake.

891
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,840
Why can't you be a cat and a crow and a snake?

892
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
And I said, no.

893
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,160
Let the apple go.

894
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,240
Then she took a bite.

895
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,860
And I could tell that she knew I was right.

896
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:24,700
She walked away weeping with the apple in her hand and fed my secrets to another man.

897
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,220
So I slid away and flew away.

898
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,860
And out of the tree I ran.

899
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,240
I who was once one, now forever three.

900
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,920
A cat and a crow and a snake without a tree.

901
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,920
Just a snake and a crow and a cat and that was that.

902
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,620
The Billy Nayer Show, dear friends.

903
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,100
Thank you, the Billy Nayer Show.

904
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,700
And thank Reverend Magdalene and Reverend Nikki Death Chick.

905
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,380
And also, Mein Cock.

906
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,680
Not the one on stage, but the one who's been at previous X Days with Bachelors for Bob.

907
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,720
For turning us on to this amazing cultural phenomenon.

908
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,900
Yeah.

909
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,040
Yeah.

910
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,860
Yeah.

911
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,320
We say yeah.

912
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,240
Yeah.

913
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,200
Yeah.

914
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,460
Are you a bunch of Nayersayers?

915
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,580
Oh…

916
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:49,200
竹 Coach, your Marsha Wood РEW

917
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:07,960
Thank you.

918
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,480
Take your slack and I'll tell you where to stick it.

919
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,920
Take your slack and I'll tell you where to stick it.

920
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,320
Take your slack and I'll tell you where to stick it.

921
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,660
take your slack and I'll probably want to lick it.

922
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,420
I got a dirty mind

923
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,580
and a deep, deep need.

924
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,260
Something's got to be filled in.

925
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,440
Take your slack, I'll tell you where to stick it.

926
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,040
Take your slack, I'll tell you where to stick it.

927
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,320
Take your slack, I'll tell you where to stick it.

928
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,740
Bring me slack and I'll probably want to lick it.

929
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,020
I got a burning need.

930
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,100
I got an itch to scratch.

931
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,300
I got a burning need.

932
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,060
I got an itch to scratch.

933
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,460
Something I've got to feed.

934
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,280
Bring me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

935
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,000
Bring me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

936
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,160
Bring me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

937
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:44,000
But if you really want me to, I think I'll just lick it first.

938
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,240
Bring me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

939
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,600
A lick me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

940
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:05,540
Bring me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

941
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,140
Bring me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

942
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,780
A lick me slack, I'll show you where to stick it.

943
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,620
And then, it's done.

944
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:23,020
like the uh he looks like the fate the hideous not the perfect but it's rocknard so we're playing

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,540

951
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,340

952
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,260
speed to clinton

953
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,420

We'll keep in touch with you, Bob, because you're going to join our organization.

966
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,460
Do you, Bob, as a member of the International Secret Police, promise to obey and protect law and order?

967
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,820
We've gotten you into trouble already, Bob.

968
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,520
You'll have to be extra careful, Bob.

969
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,760
Don't worry about me. This is the sort of thing I like.

970
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,580
Oh, say, Bob.

971
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:29,840
Yes?

972
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,460
Oh, say, Bob.

973
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:30,780
Yes?

974
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,240
We'll have plenty to do, Bob.

975
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:32,720
Hey!

976
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,180
Oh, say, Bob.

977
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:34,420
Yes?

978
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,660
Hey!

979
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,680
Bob's information must contain some clue.

980
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,300
Oh!

981
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,600
The house of Bob?

982
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,280
Bob? Say, Bob.

983
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,300
The house of Bob?

984
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,860
Say, Bob.

985
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,000
The house of Bob?

986
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,200
Bob, you're a magician.

987
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,440
Speed to Clint and Barney. Go to the house of Bob.

988
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,020
Bob!

989
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,620
Bob!

990
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,820
The house of Bob.

991
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,280
Bob.

992
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,320
Incidentally, the Brushwood staff, we've learned, calls us,

993
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,200
the Bobs.

994
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,560
The Bobs.

995
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:14,200
Just as a sort of shorthand.

996
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,400
It's a subgenius.

997
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,280
It's kind of, that's a lot of syllables.

998
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,080
They'll say, oh, yeah, the Bobs are coming next weekend.

999
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,240
There go the Bobs.

1000
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,720
We'll have to make them their big icon.

1001
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,600
The fire crew of Brushwood has been a big part of X-Day every year

1002
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,220
because they really know their stuff.

1003
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,700
They keep us from hurting ourselves.

1004
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,060
The pagans, you see, know a great secret that many subgeniuses have not learned.

1005
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:39,480
The secret of fire.

1006
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,240
They know how to make them.

1007
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,120
But tonight we will see the leaping and dancing flames.

1008
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,060
At the sound of the bell, place your hands as follows.

1009
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,580
Right thumb, left thumb.

1010
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,500
Right thumb, four fingers thumb.

1011
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,760
Strike the right thumb.

1012
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,680
You never use your right thumb of each hand to strike the bell.

1013
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,380
Now your hand has ended.

1014
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:02,900
Return.

1015
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,880
You will hear instructions to strike your left thumb.

1016
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,300
The fire crew will now begin.

1017
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,300


1018
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,300


1019
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,300


1020
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:10,300


1021
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,180
That last cut was a refrainer.

1022
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,300
All right, here's another question.

1023
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:26,120
I've heard that hippopotamuses kill more humans than any other African animals.

1024
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,240
Are there other lesser known animals that kill more humans than hippos?

1025
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,220
I think the word do has been left out a couple of times.

1026
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,540
The word do?

1027
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,400
Well, I've heard that hippopotamuses kill more humans.

1028
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,360
More human than any other African animals.

1029
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,880
Are there other lesser known animals that kill more humans than hippos?

1030
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,160
Well, of course, they tell you all sorts of stories in the African bush.

1031
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:00,760
I don't know how much credence you want to give to tales of Bunyips and Michaila Mbembes and so on.

1032
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,920
But hippos are dangerous because they are territorial.

1033
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,380
And they are likely to slash you with their tusks if you come up.

1034
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,160
If you come too close while you're paddling in the pool.

1035
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:21,460
Also, large crocodiles are often far too aggressive and desire to make too intimate an acquaintance.

1036
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:28,260
After you get out of the water, the most dangerous animal is potentially, I'm told, the Cape buffalo.

1037
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:33,860
You wouldn't think something that looked so much like a cow would be with all those lions and things around.

1038
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:38,220
But according to every account I've read, of course, I've never been there.

1039
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,380
This is just stuff I've read.

1040
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:48,380
The Cape buffalo will wheel and gore you and trample you and trample the remains and then gore the remains and then trample the remains.

1041
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,400
I'm getting turned on now.

1042
00:50:51,400 --> 00:51:00,960
That's why it was such a big trophy in the old days of the stuffed heads in the Trunk and Tusk Club downtown.

1043
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,340
They'd always have a wildebeest right in the middle.

1044
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,380
Also, the hairstyle of the wildebeest was worn by people of the past.

1045
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,620
In the early period, like Andrew Carnegie and John L. Lewis and so forth.

1046
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,600
What of the lowly mosquitoes?

1047
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,240
Well, what of the lowly mosquito?

1048
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,760
It makes you wonder why Noah put them on the ark.

1049
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,060
But the lowly mosquito, of course, has laid us low at various times.

1050
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:36,540
And it's always possible that one can suddenly encounter a mutagen in the mosquito's saliva.

1051
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,360
Responsible for a disease as deadly as the one that we're all suffering from.

1052
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,060
And it's only possible that one can suddenly encounter a mutagen in the mosquito's saliva.

1053
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,680
And remember, folks, they can stymie malaria, but they can't really stop it.

1054
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:51,120
Once you get it, you may be in for shivery episodes for the rest of your life.

1055
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,880
I said over and over and over again.

1056
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,180
I said over and over and over again.

1057
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,080
I said over and over and over again.

1058
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,320
I said over and over and over again.

1059
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:14,320


1060
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,180
Funny you should ask that.

1061
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,100
I've become a real expert on that.

1062
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,080
You know, same motion over and over again.

1063
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:29,200
Rock, you know, humankind has been chopping rocks for a million years.

1064
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,840
That's what they used to call it.

1065
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,180
Guys have been chopping rocks to get laid and paid.

1066
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,360
The ones who couldn't shoot very well could...

1067
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,720
could maybe chop rocks better than someone else.

1068
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,160
We used to nap flints.

1069
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,460
The ones who couldn't even chop rocks, those were the ones who invented religions.

1070
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,840
You nap flints.

1071
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,260
You have to be a good flint napper.

1072
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:58,000
My theory is that flint napping went on for so long it became a kind of an instinct.

1073
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,360
And that explains obsessive compulsive disorder.

1074
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,060
That's what the conspiracy calls neatness nowadays.

1075
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,100
Hmm.

1076
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,860
Mental illness they label wanting to have your stuff in order.

1077
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,640
Getting your ducks in a row.

1078
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,300
Being an emergentile like I am, that's a disease.

1079
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,040
A propensity for order.

1080
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:16,680
Yeah.

1081
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:33,040
But personally I think that art, music certainly, especially drumming, and jobs are all results of the obsessive compulsive disorder of flint napping and stone hand axe making.

1082
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,560
So they didn't have stone hand axe stores.

1083
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,600
They didn't even have stone hand axe bags.

1084
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,200
When one wore out they just made another one.

1085
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:49,760
And that's hundreds of thousands of years of that same thing going on.

1086
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,640
We can't stop.

1087
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,200
That's the human part of course.

1088
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,660
The Yetis didn't need tools.

1089
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,340
They did not need clothing or...

1090
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,400
and could practically materialize what they needed out of the air.

1091
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,000
Which they didn't need much luckily.

1092
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,700
Well the sharper image I believe has one.

1093
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,220
That's right.

1094
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,400
It's a very primitive looking with a branch for a handle.

1095
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:25,820
But of course that doesn't come anywhere near the satisfaction of going out and napping your own flint.

1096
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,640
And hardening a fire hardened axe handle.

1097
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,980
Bind it with the tendons of some ruminant that you can.

1098
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,920
And you'll be killed after protracted and bloody struggle.

1099
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,320
And you'll feel that you're a king in your own kingdom.

1100
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,460
Particularly when they come to get you.

1101
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:51,880
And I would like to add that this is not a perpetual motion machine that violates the laws of thermodynamics.

1102
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,160
Energy is coming into it from outside.

1103
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,340
The magnetic energy which permeates the cosmos.

1104
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,140
He who controls magnetism.

1105
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:02,740
Gravity.

1106
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,580
Controls the universe.

1107
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:05,580
Unwinding.

1108
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:06,540
Object.

1109
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,840
Not just magnetism but gravity.

1110
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,380
Distance beacons.

1111
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,260
Forward.

1112
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:11,880
Forward.

1113
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,060
And not only that.

1114
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,800
Let the great world spin.

1115
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,960
The unified fields.

1116
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,820
Now the breaking roots of change.

1117
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:31,980
We've taken all the previously unknown theories and managed to put them all together in one massive ancient Frankenstein theory of unifying.

1118
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,080
Frankenstein culture.

1119
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,480
The old, the new.

1120
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:37,760
The old, the new.

1121
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:37,760


1122
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:37,760


1123
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:37,760


1124
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:37,760


1125
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:37,760


1126
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,880
And the energy specter.

1127
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,680
Where strange surgeons cut out your spine and send it to 67 giant.

1128
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,540
And weave it together in a way to produce the beautiful fabric that we know as.

1129
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:47,540


1130
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,560
You know this comes back to the doctors, folks.

1131
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,380
The face.

1132
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,160
And the old, your doctor.

1133
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:51,740
Of Dobbs.

1134
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,500
In the smiling face of Dobbs.

1135
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:53,740
Of the original.

1136
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,800
You'll find the face of a small child.

1137
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,180
The hideous grin of an ancient crone.

1138
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,060
And yet there is that magnanimous smile.

1139
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,060
And you may see it.

1140
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,060


1141
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:04,060


1142
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,360
might hear the stipulation of an enormous cricket.

1143
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,180
Is the pipe that never leaves.

1144
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,160
Have you ever seen Bob not smoking his pipe?

1145
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,960
No, because you can't.

1146
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,720
It would be the end of the universe if you did.

1147
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,980
I thought that happened already last Wednesday or Tuesday or Monday.

1148
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,540
You know the pipe is smoking right now.

1149
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:23,120
It's proof of the existence of us and Bob.

1150
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,200
Because we're still here.

1151
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,080
We're still here.

1152
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,160
We wouldn't be here if we hadn't already been clenching the pipe

1153
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,240
and that mighty smoke.

1154
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,660
Pleasing the nostrils of Joe.

1155
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,260
I also didn't ask Dr. Howell.

1156
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:35,780
As it is.

1157
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:43,160
Pleasing the gods as they breathe deep the smoke from Bob's pipe.

1158
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,040
Before we wrap up, you know,

1159
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,500
Angry Larry had a pretty good marriage ceremony, didn't he?

1160
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,900
It was very romantic.

1161
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,040
There looked like, I think there were like ten couples getting married.

1162
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,640
Yeah, and then he had a private ceremony with me and Christy,

1163
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,840
so that was kind of cool too.

1164
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,340
I noticed that young Popess Pantiera

1165
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,640
married her little girl.

1166
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,520
Little vibrator.

1167
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,660
And she gave it a gentle kiss at the end of the ceremony.

1168
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,560
It was really sweet.

1169
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,100
It's enough to make the heart warm.

1170
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,000
She doesn't need a boyfriend anymore.

1171
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,100
Right.

1172
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:14,780
Smart girl.

1173
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:15,860
She's got her Bob.

1174
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,620
Oh, you really liked my wife, didn't you, Stang?

1175
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,300
She was pretty, wasn't she?

1176
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,780
Yeah, your temporary wife there, your ex.

1177
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,440
Yeah.

1178
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,340
Christine, yeah, she was gorgeous.

1179
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,260
Excellent hula hooper too.

1180
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,040
Oh, yeah.

1181
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,440
Those hula hoops look great.

1182
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,640
Looks aren't everything, though.

1183
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,780
Money is everything.

1184
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,680
And in that respect,

1185
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:44,480
Ragnar is a god among subgeniuses.

1186
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,200
Oh, yeah.

1187
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,240
If looks were everything,

1188
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,620
Ragnar would be a pretty low-level god.

1189
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,380
All right, guys.

1190
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,840
Well, it's time to wrap this up,

1191
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,020
so thank you very much.

1192
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:54,400
Thank you.

1193
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,320
All righty.

1194
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,400
Yay, yay, yay, yay.

1195
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,700
This has been Synesthesia, of course,

1196
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,960
and, you know, what the heck.

1197
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,480
Belly, belly, belly, belly, belly, belly,

1198
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,620
ho, yeah.

1199
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,600
Test, test, test, test, test.

1200
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,180
Okay.

1201
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,540
What's this all about?

1202
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,620
What's all this about?

1203
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,300
Shallabalala, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1204
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,400
Boy, I have a howl.

1205
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,600
Man, I have a howl.

1206
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:32,680
I have a howl.

1207
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,440
I have a howl.

1208
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,720
Oh, yeah.

1209
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,720
You want the key?

1210
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,660
Come on, y'all.

1212
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,180
Selfish fox.
