1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
You know, outside organizations are wonderful,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,000
but they can only supplement the example and inspiration children should first receive from their...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,440
Some genius, powerful, smart.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,620
Within a year, most of the juveniles that exist today would disappear

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,160
because the family that prays together stays together.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
I sure hope it's Dave.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,840
Schweinholder.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Dave.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,200
It must be Dave.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,400
Dave.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,860
Yes.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,360
It is Dave.

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm the devil hiding in your swimming pool.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,080
God, I don't have a swimming pool.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,360
Me too, because that's an actual real thing that happened up around here or down there.

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,320
What?

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,560
A devil in a swimming pool?

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,440
No, the devil went for a swim in a human body,

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,700
and it wasn't a real...

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,020
He made a mistake, because even the devil can make a few mistakes,

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,800
because he's not perfect.

22
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,040
Only,

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,680
Bob is an imperfect sailor.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,400
And so, he said, I'm going to take maybe 50 laps.

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,340
He started drinking his swimming pool of water.

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,780
He couldn't get out of his body, back to being a devil.

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,360
So, they put him, I guess, somewhere down the hall in room 329 or something.

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,560
Oh, he's in the country club nursing home with you?

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,140
Yeah.

30
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,060
Well, we call it a nursing home.

31
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,680
We know what kind of a home it is.

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,260
Yeah, it's a real homey home.

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,980
Yeah, right.

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,760
Yeah.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,880
Home for homies.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
Friends, Dave's been sick for a month or two.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,620
And he's always been sick, and he always will be sick,

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,580
because it's a sick, sick, sick, sick world that we live in,

39
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,240
that Dave grew up in, and us too.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,940
Yes.

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,040
And it's getting sicker by the minute.

42
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,560
It certainly is.

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,420
I mean, just think of all these many viruses,

44
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,980
and now we're like, he used to be like,

45
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,420
oh, well, Korova's going to be over, or Kofet.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
What's the other one called?

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,260
Kofef.

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,380
Kofef 19.

49
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,760
Kofet.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,240
Yeah.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Kofet's going to be over.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,780
And there'll be another one starting with a K and a vowel sound.

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,660
Yeah.

54
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,780
Kaka.

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,600
Caused by hamburgers?

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,840
Hamburgers.

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Hamburgers.

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,320
No, hamburgers.

59
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,920
Hamburgers.

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,480
Hamburgers.

61
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,960
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:25,960
Anyway.

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,400
Okay.

64
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:26,880
Okay.

65
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,840
So, Dave, that's good.

66
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,340
It's good to hear you on the show again.

67
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,760
It sure is.

68
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,460
Well.

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,580
It's good to hear you on the show again.

70
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,400
The lads and laddies and lattices and lad things out there

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,680
had all been kind of going, where's Dave?

72
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:43,940
Yeah.

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Where's Lone Cow Dave?

74
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,100
Yeah.

75
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,080
Yeah, there's like a Lone Cow Dave-shaped hole in the show.

76
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,040
Buddy agrees.

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,880
Yeah, Buddy really agrees.

78
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
And it sounds like a dog.

79
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,780
Partially agrees.

80
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,960
He can't hear you.

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,080
He can't hear you.

82
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,220
Well, it's very, very moist and humid down, or very hot down in Tejas.

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,140
And I was just wondering if Buddy was a hot dog.

84
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,000
He's a hot dog and a cool cat.

85
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,020
Yes, we decided that just today.

86
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,520
That's his favorite thing is to go out in the yard and get baked and then come in the

87
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,020
house and put his belly on the ice cold floor and then go back out and get baked.

88
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,180
Back in and get cold.

89
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,060
He really likes getting baked.

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,640
He likes to go back and forth.

91
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,500
I used to like getting baked.

92
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,980
I haven't gotten baked in quite a few years now.

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,440
It was some of the best days of my life.

94
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Well, I didn't mean being baked on marijuana or anything.

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,640
Last time Buddy did that, he had to go to the hospital.

96
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,800
Oh, yeah.

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,220
He decided to eat the whole snack.

98
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,380
The entire bag that had just been mailed to me.

99
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,540
Not that I would have anything like that around here normally.

100
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,700
But Buddy knew it was there.

101
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,720
He had butter in it.

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
He staggered around for quite a bit.

103
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,280
And then he ate it all.

104
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,580
And then I noticed he was sick.

105
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,980
Then he threw up.

106
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,400
And when I went to get a mop, the other dog ate the puke.

107
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,780
And then she staggered around and then threw up.

108
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,800
And, of course, I swept up the puke then and froze it.

109
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,120
And swallowed and then ate it.

110
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,180
We've still got it for later if we get desperate.

111
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,660
No, no.

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,480
Yeah, the next day, they slept it off.

113
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,920
And the next day, they were okay.

114
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,280
Although, at first, they got a fight.

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,040
They had painful vagina itch, right?

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,940
And then Buddy burned his draft card and Claudia burned her bra.

117
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,260
And they started a garage band.

118
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,040
Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Wow.

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,820
It did affect him.

121
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,640
It did.

122
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,860
Sounds like punk rock days.

123
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,500
Yeah.

124
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,160
I thought dogs were more like into Mendelssohn and Tchaikovsky.

125
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,120
Tchaikovsky.

126
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,460
Tchaikovsky.

127
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:58,840
Tchaikovsky.

128
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:58,960
Tchaikovsky.

129
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


132
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


133
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


134
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:58,960


135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,740
But they are until they get into your medical cookies.

136
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,340
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

137
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,980
Mm-hmm.

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,040
All right.

139
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,520
Mm-hmm.

140
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,560
Yeah, so kids, you know, make sure those things are...

141
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,340
Actually, I was going to say, up high on a shelf locked in a box, a wooden box with a

142
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,180
latch and inside a freezer bag inside the wooden box, way up high where they can't get

143
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,380
it.

144
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,700
Yeah.

145
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,660
But that's where they...

146
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:28,960
Right.

147
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:28,960


148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:28,960


149
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:28,960


150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:28,960


151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:28,960


152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:28,960


153
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,940
They were when Buddy got them.

154
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,420
And little Buddy's industrial self.

155
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,820
The monster.

156
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,040
The monster is coming.

157
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:46,280
Well, what will prevent the monstrosity of the Carbidolus virus from achieving any, you know, can it slow down somehow?

158
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,620
Or do we all have to watch our dogs go nuts?

159
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,600
We have to all wear diving suits and the dogs have to wear scuba gear.

160
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
If we go out of our room.

161
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,380
Can't just carry like a linkage bag of eggs?

162
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,260
Well, you can.

163
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,740
But they won't reach out of your room.

164
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,640
That's a special thing.

165
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,700
Yeah, I know how people feel when they feel incarcerated.

166
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,980
Because I've been incarcerated.

167
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,940
They wouldn't let you leave, right?

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,880
But it wasn't because you had the Covfef-19.

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,020
It was because you...

170
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,480
I think they were afraid that you'd fall down.

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,680
I tested negatory on Cora.

172
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,140
Cora alone.

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,940
One of our friends, the only other for real subgenius in Glen Rose, Texas.

174
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,220
There's more than one?

175
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,860
I'm trying to think which of her names I should use, if any.

176
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,460
I'll just skip it.

177
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,760
But she had to be quarantined for nine days just for flu.

178
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,360
Regular, ordinary flu.

179
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,680
They wouldn't...

180
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,560
Her job made her stay home.

181
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,180
Yep.

182
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,420
They won't let her go to school either.

183
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,440
She had to be clear of a fever for, I think, 14 days before they let her come back.

184
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,800
Princess, will you show us a little closer to the mic?

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Okay.

186
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,520
Remember, this is a radio show, not...

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Okay.

188
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,360
Did she have painful vaginal itch?

189
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,120
Like some of the rest of us?

190
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,540
Dave!

191
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,380
TAVE!

192
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,000
That's not flu or cough feff.

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,860
That's Spanish fly flu.

194
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:35,840
Spanish fly flu.

195
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Yeah, mix and pudding with tripe.

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,680
Spinach flu.

197
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,760
Yeah.

198
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:42,620
Uh...

199
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,880
Spinach flu.

200
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,260
We locked the kitty cats up.

201
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,240
So they wouldn't climb around on Tarzan's radio station.

202
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,740
while we're doing the show because they do climb around on it.

203
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,200
Oh, they love to rollick around in these fancy pieces of equipment.

204
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,400
Well, there's big plastic dinosaurs to knock over

205
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
and all kinds of things to knock over.

206
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:06,860
A moon.

207
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,460
Well, I wish I could visit it just to get the hell out of here.

208
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,740
I bet you, I bet you.

209
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,440
But, you know, Dave, even if you did get out of there,

210
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,760
if Nurse Ratched would let you out and you were back at home,

211
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,240
you'd just be, it'd be the same.

212
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,600
You're still not supposed to leave or go anywhere.

213
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,140
No, he wants to come down here and visit us.

214
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,460
You have to, is it true that you are kind of implemented

215
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,980
to not buy groceries, to only buy certain bags of friendship

216
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,180
and other toiletries?

217
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,420
I mean, don't they not want you to go outside too much?

218
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,840
Right.

219
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,660
No one.

220
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,300
No one's supposed to go outside and they don't.

221
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,960
They stay home.

222
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,180
It's just like your novel, Dave, Neighbor World now.

223
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,380
Everything is a whole lot like Neighbor World.

224
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,620
See, listen to Buddy.

225
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,180
Buddy knows.

226
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Yeah, everybody's looming, you know,

227
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,300
getting real high off the light waves from their screen,

228
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,700
only they don't call it looming, they call it zooming.

229
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,600
Mm-hmm.

230
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,460
Well, there's zoom to loom.

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,460
The whole world is zooming now.

232
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah.

233
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,520
That's the phrase used.

234
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,740
We went to a zoo.

235
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,260
We had a zoom hangout of subgeniuses every Saturday at 3.20 Central Time.

236
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,280
There's a zoom chat.

237
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,760
It's funny because it's a whole separate group of people

238
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,180
that did the zoom chat that are different from the hour of slack listeners,

239
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,920
different from the forum readers, different from the Facebook people.

240
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,840
The zoomers are a whole different looming crew.

241
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,540
A whole different group of looners and zoomers.

242
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,860
I'd just as soon zoom the looms and the loons into the moon.

243
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,780
Yeah.

244
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,360
After a while.

245
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
After a while, I get tired of it.

246
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,280
In fact, tonight, get this, Dave,

247
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,980
tonight is the first Ask Dr. Hal virtual Zoom teleconference show

248
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,960
where Dr. Hal will do his nightclub show from his room,

249
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,200
his quarantine cell.

250
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,000
He's going to be in the station.

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,240
And there'll be musicians that are in other states

252
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,100
and can't really be in sync with each other,

253
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
so I'm not sure how that works.

254
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,940
Although they said that the other day they sang Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

255
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,720
And of course, nobody was quite in sync, right?

256
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,340
Because it's not instantaneous.

257
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,660
There's a certain amount of delay for each person

258
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,460
depending on their internet setup and so forth.

259
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,640
And apparently, Row, Row, Row Your Boat,

260
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,840
a cappella was a great success of Weirdness.

261
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,200
Yes.

262
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,620
Whereas if you tried to like play the blues

263
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,540
and be in time with each other,

264
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,100
it would just sound like a subgenius band.

265
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,200
So, you know.

266
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,840
Yeah, I know what that quote sounds like, unquote.

267
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,360
Yeah.

268
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,700
Yeah.

269
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,260
And so, but yeah, Dr. Hal's going to be on and he'll,

270
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,860
I guess people can text their question to Ask Dr. Hal.

271
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,620
Well, that would be lovely.

272
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,660
It would be like right now, wouldn't it?

273
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,320
No, no, no, no.

274
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,280
That doesn't happen at all.

275
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,620
10 p.m. Eastern time, 7 p.m. Pacific time,

276
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,080
and blah, blah, blah in between.

277
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,480
We have to check it out at 9.

278
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,740
But that'll happen every second Sunday of every month.

279
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,680
Wow. Cool.

280
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,300
Yeah, every second Sunday of every month.

281
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,020
And maybe every other second Sunday,

282
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,100
or second and fourth Sunday, something like that.

283
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,240
Every two weeks, they'll be Ask Dr. Hal.

284
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,980
Cool.

285
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,500
Online.

286
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,700
That's great.

287
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,800
And he'll have to dress up like Charlie Chaplin

288
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
when he's a communist.

289
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,500
There was an old movie.

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,500
Charlie Chaplin got run down the street,

291
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,700
and he grabbed a danger flag, which was red,

292
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,100
and the police thought he was a communist,

293
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,060
and they put him in jail.

294
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,260
But he got out because of the minister's wife,

295
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,520
liked eating cheese and carried a dog around with her.

296
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,080
Excellent.

297
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,420
So I thought that worked out pretty well for everyone.

298
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,460
Well, except for the fact that Charlie Chaplin movies

299
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,060
were all in black and white,

300
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,740
so how do you get the red flag?

301
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,280
Well, yeah.

302
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,380
Somebody has to say,

303
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,380
hey, look at that red flag, not gray,

304
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,040
but red that he's carrying.

305
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,160
I think it was contextual of the days

306
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,580
that a certain type of construction flag was red

307
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,760
because that's what he grabbed.

308
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,280
He wasn't a communist.

309
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
He was a neo-communist.

310
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,300
He was a neo-lighter, something like that,

311
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,900
a historian or a pastoral.

312
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,440
I don't know.

313
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,280
The subgenius historian, Reverend Susie the Flusie,

314
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,220
recently pointed out that she always thought

315
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,840
that the commie red scare was a 50s thing,

316
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,540
but actually it started in the 20s.

317
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,780
Yes, yeah.

318
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,820
Both in the United States and England.

319
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,240
In fact, in Peaky Blinders,

320
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,760
they're chasing after commies all the time

321
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,300
or bedding down with commies

322
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,560
or buying dope from commies

323
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,680
or selling guns to commies.

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,680
And nothing's changed.

325
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,600
That was 100 years ago on television, anyway,

326
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,680
and nothing's changed.

327
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,340
You're absolutely right.

328
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,140
If you listen to Mr. Dr. Presidential E.X. Trump,

329
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,620
you would know for certainly that it's,

330
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,000
you can use, you're a communist as a word of derision.

331
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,060
Well, unless you're one of his Russian masters,

332
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,580
then, you know, you're a communist as a compliment.

333
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,300
So he could be like a double agent of some kind.

334
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,260
Well, when he's pretending to be hard on the Chinese,

335
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,340
then commie is a bad word.

336
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,900
But when he's licking the boots of the Russians,

337
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,300
then commie is, you know, commie is,

338
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,200
that's what liberals are, not Russians.

339
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,700
Russians are cool. They're all white people.

340
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,040
Give me a break.

341
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,420
And they're run by an authoritarian bunch of oligarchs.

342
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,980
So they've got to be perfect.

343
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,060
Right. Especially the oligarch part.

344
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,540
Sure. Yeah.

345
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,080
If only we could make America just like Russia.

346
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,820
That is, in fact, what I think a lot of people

347
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,500
in the backs of their minds are thinking,

348
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,640
only they're confusing Russia

349
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,860
with the fictitious good old days of America

350
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,180
and the fictitious non-Russian.

351
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I mean, you know, the 1950s.

352
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,880
Yeah.

353
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,420
When everybody was, quote, happy, unquote,

354
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,340
which is also a complete lie.

355
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,540
Yeah.

356
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,580
So I know that because I was there.

357
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,980
And I didn't get the plastic battleship that I wanted.

358
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,160
So I tell you, the 50s were not that great.

359
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,160
Even for a little white boy.

360
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,180
There are also little scuba divers

361
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,600
you could put up your nose if you wanted to try.

362
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,880
Oh, you have those too?

363
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,780
Yeah.

364
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,620
Well, there were some little plastic scuba divers

365
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,460
if you put baking soda in their back.

366
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,260
Yeah.

367
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,780
And then stuck them in your nose,

368
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,340
they'd actually swim up to your brain and start eating.

369
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,080
Yeah. Somebody might know what we're talking about.

370
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,900
Perhaps, maybe.

371
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,320
I sure don't.

372
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,600
You guys have me lost as heck and beach.

373
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
Your brother would know.

374
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,100
Your brother had the little scuba diver that you could...

375
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,280
I forget if it was...

376
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,620
It must have been baking soda.

377
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,840
Yeah, it was baking soda.

378
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,700
And then you drop it in a glass of vinegar?

379
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,260
No, in the bathtub.

380
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,660
And he'd kind of poot his way around in random circles.

381
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,700
But at least he moved, you know.

382
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,960
He didn't just float there.

383
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,400
He moved.

384
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,080
Because he had this, you know, air coming out of his...

385
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,960
Whatever.

386
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,860
His back.

387
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,340
His back.

388
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,100
His groin.

389
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,420
Yeah, it's coming out of his back, actually.

390
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,720
It's coming out of his back.

391
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,380
That was the orifice.

392
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,060
Well, things certainly not only have changed,

393
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,900
they've gotten worse.

394
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,540
Most things, anyway.

395
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,460
Oh, yeah.

396
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,980
Now the kids' scuba divers are all run by remote control

397
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,340
and have, you know, legs and arms that move.

398
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,020
And they actually swim through the water.

399
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,180
And, in fact, they have AI free will.

400
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,560
If you turn that part on, they'll swim wherever they want to

401
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,720
and maybe even attack you.

402
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,700
Yeah, those were dangerous.

403
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,940
But here's the thing.

404
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,460
They cost about 750 bucks apiece.

405
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,240
So, you know, whereas I think in our day,

406
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,200
the little baking soda scuba divers were what?

407
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,160
Three cents or something.

408
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,320
Maybe a dollar for the whole kit.

409
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
A dime per soldier.

410
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,260
Per Eastern Bloc soldier.

411
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,740
Well, you could, for a dollar,

412
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,440
you could get a hundred green plastic army men.

413
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,200
And then melt them.

414
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,580
You could melt them all if you had a sun-gun movie lamp.

415
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,960
Yep.

416
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,180
You could do anti-war artworks using potions.

417
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,180


418
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,100
You could make piles of army men and melt them,

419
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,420
melt them into a partial slag

420
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,740
so it looked like a tortured hill of fighting, struggling men.

421
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:26,960
Yep.

422
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,820
All green.

423
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,260
You could also get a chemistry kit

424
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,960
that you're routine not to blow up.

425
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,720
And mix all the chemicals in in vain effort to blow them up.

426
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,220
Speak up, Dave. Speak up.

427
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,760
Speak up, Dave.

428
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,280
What about the chemistry set?

429
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,060
The Gilbert's Chemistry Set lab?

430
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,600
The Gilbert's Chemistry Set that he used to buy.

431
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,160
Yeah.

432
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,400
Thinking, it said, don't worry,

433
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,320
this chemistry set will never blow up, so you're good, safe.

434
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,480
And you would try any way possible,

435
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,480
anything you could think of to make the chemistry set

436
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,420
blow up in someone's face.

437
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
Right. We all tried to.

438
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,980
And all it would do is make a smoky, smelly thing come out.

439
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,860
Yeah.

440
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,840
Oh, I invented an invisibility potion

441
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,180
just by randomly mixing chemicals

442
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,560
and painting them onto grasshoppers.

443
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,580
And one of the grasshoppers literally vanished.

444
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,520
And I realized I had invented an invisibility potion,

445
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,160
but I couldn't remember which chemicals.

446
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,340
I wasn't using the scientific method.

447
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,540
I wasn't being disciplined.

448
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,300
I wasn't keeping a list of each, you know, potion that I made.

449
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,300
And you were wearing ladies underwear, too.

450
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,640
I believe you anyway.

451
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,880
No, no. I didn't even know what ladies underwear were.

452
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,620
I didn't even know what ladies were then.

453
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,560
I was only like 10 years old.

454
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,380
And remember, this was the 50s.

455
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,640
Right. You were raised by wild wolves.

456
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,560
Well, I was raised by 1950s Americans.

457
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,320
And they didn't like to explain embarrassing details

458
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,780
like how ladies were different from men.

459
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,880
Dad always wore a hat and a suit and a tie.

460
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,420
And Mom always wore those Betty Furness underpants

461
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,840
and globe things, you know.

462
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,680
I have no idea what my mother wore under her dress.

463
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,300
No idea.

464
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,580
Well, why not?

465
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
I never...

466
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,240
Is that such an uncommon desire or want?

467
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,540
I wanted to see what my mother wore.

468
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,960
My mom was wearing her underwear.

469
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,100
All right, I shouldn't have said that.

470
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,240
I didn't mean that, Dad.

471
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,460
Well, you were braver than me then, man.

472
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,260
Well, I've always been braver than you.

473
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,880
I got to admit, there were times when we would sneak into our parents' bathroom

474
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,100
and open the drawers and marvel at these odd things in there.

475
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,440
Rubber tubes and long, narrow things and short, thick things.

476
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,780
It had no real use that we could discern.

477
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,620
They had a machine that would...

478
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,860
If you plugged it in and turned it on, it shook.

479
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,360
It just shook violently.

480
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,140
And we would, like...

481
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,040
It had straps.

482
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,280
You could put it on your hand.

483
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,800
And we would rub each other's heads with it.

484
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,220
My brother would rub each other's heads with it.

485
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
And it would kind of hurt and feel kind of weird and give us visions.

486
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,760
We never did figure out what my parents wore.

487
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,720
I don't think my parents used that stuff for any of us.

488
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Well, at least they weren't celibate.

489
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,800
There were a lot of people in their 50s who were celibate.

490
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,880
Oh, my parents absolutely were completely celibate the whole time.

491
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,560
I'm certain of it.

492
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,280
Oh, they were?

493
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,680
Yeah.

494
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,060
What about the time that you walked in and found the squirrel on your dad's belly?

495
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,420
Well, they were both asleep, so it didn't, you know...

496
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:31,640
Oh.

497
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,600
Okay.

498
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,240
No, they told us about the birds and the bees, but they weren't birds or bees.

499
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,280
They were Mammy and Pappy.

500
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,940
Squirrels and yogurt jacks.

501
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,460
Mammy and Pappy.

502
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:44,860
Yeah.

503
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,020
The stork brought my brother and me.

504
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:54,940
I think my sister happened after some disease made my mom's belly real huge.

505
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,120
And then my sister appeared.

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,640
Oh, jeez.

507
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
But that was a long, long time ago.

508
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,020
By the way, Dave, I told you my sister had the COVID and survived it.

509
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,100
Yeah, I heard it.

510
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,580
In a Texas prison where she's serving...

511
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:11,760
Ew.

512
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,060
Two and a half to five years for a good deed.

513
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,660
In Texas, no good deed goes unpunished.

514
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,020
No.

515
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,540
Yep.

516
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,720
But it could be worse.

517
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,480
It could be Louisiana.

518
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,160
What do they do in Louisiana?

519
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,160
Do they take you out in the swamp somewhere or something?

520
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,860
They give you life for stealing a blender.

521
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,120
Did somebody get life recently for stealing a blender?

522
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,800
No, somebody got life about a lifetime ago for that.

523
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,600
I think...

524
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,540
I read that they just freed a guy after 40 years from prison.

525
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
He'd been in prison because he sold $30 worth of pot.

526
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:52,860
Yeah.

527
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,160
And he probably committed another crime that involved pigmentation.

528
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,880
Yeah.

529
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,900
And...

530
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,740
Crimes of pigmentation are big nowadays.

531
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
Well, they always have been.

532
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,600
They've been that way for a long time.

533
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,380
400 and some years.

534
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,580
Everybody's kind of...

535
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm going to go back to the news again for a while.

536
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,220
Wow.

537
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:15,940
Oh.

538
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,840
Yeah.

539
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,800
It's awful.

540
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,700
I have friends in Portland where if you were watching the news, you'd think, oh my God,

541
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
there's every street.

542
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,820
Portland is exploded.

543
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,580
Yeah.

544
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,180
Oh, every single street is just full of screaming, yelling, black clad monsters throwing bombs

545
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,960
and setting everything on fire.

546
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,300
And cops.

547
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Noble, noble, unmarked federal police.

548
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,220
Unmarked federal policemen nobly spraying gas into the faces of those moms and dads.

549
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,960
The wall of parents.

550
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,060
Yes.

551
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,360
The wall of children.

552
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,120
Wait until they have their kids come out in front and go, please don't spray us.

553
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,520
We just want to say that black lives matter or else no lives matter.

554
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,180
So our lives should matter, but also black lives.

555
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,140
Kill the kid.

556
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,260
Remember Kent State.

557
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,520
Yeah.

558
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:08,740
Yeah.

559
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,540
They like to kill kids too.

560
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,120
Yeah.

561
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,660
And I just recently saw or heard one of the-

562
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,140
Don't make those libtards cry.

563
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,480
Oh, I wasn't going to use that word anymore.

564
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,480


565
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,480
Giuliani.

566
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,620
Called the people in black lives matter and Antifa called them killers.

567
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,200
That sounds like a lawsuit to me.

568
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,460
You can't just accuse somebody on the air of being a killer if they're not.

569
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,080
Well, the problem with Antifa is that-

570
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,340
Well, how could they sue them?

571
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,600
There's nobody to sue him because there's not actually an Antifa PO box.

572
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:38,720
Well, I don't know.

573
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,120
I was saying, what's the next step here?

574
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, I saw an ad today on Facebook.

575
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,060
Join Antifa.

576
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,720
I actually gave them a big Facebook ad going around, Join Antifa, 200 bucks a day to invade

577
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,600
the suburbs and throw bricks through windows.

578
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,640
Of course it was totally fake, but every Republican in the United States has read it this morning

579
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:08,420
and only about 10 of them instantly recognized it as an obvious damn satire or deliberate.

580
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,700
The only doubt.

581
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,740
fake made by Russians or Chinese or rednecks.

582
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,980
Or Iranians, too.

583
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,960
I shouldn't say rednecks either because there's liberal and progressive.

584
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,340
There's even smart rednecks that aren't liberal or conservative.

585
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,180
They're smart.

586
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,440
Rednecks with necks that are red because they work outdoors a lot their whole lives.

587
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,300
It does make your neck red unless you're kind of red already.

588
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,480
Yes, where the dog collar shines through.

589
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,420
Right, and the dog whistles.

590
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Oh, my.

591
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,600
I was trained like a dog growing up in the 50s, so I hear the dog whistles.

592
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,540
I know what the dog whistles mean when they use those polite ways of saying,

593
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,560
all them people is subhuman.

594
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
The South.

595
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,300
Shall rise again.

596
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,540
I know what all.

597
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,760
I can translate the whistles into those sentences.

598
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,260
It's a good thing you can because those are standard earmuffs nowadays.

599
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,100
It takes a lot of peloponnesian pleasure to make them work right.

600
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,720
Well, everybody's got some kind of earmuff on to not hear what they don't want to hear.

601
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,900
What kind of pleasure? Peloponnesian?

602
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,140
What kind of pleasure?

603
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,820
Peloponnesian.

604
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,420
Well, you know Peloponnesian.

605
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,520
Peloponnesian?

606
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,320
Peloponnesian?

607
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,080
In ancient Greece, mixed with Polynesian.

608
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,640
Oh, okay.

609
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,840
Equals Peloponnesian, meaning mini Peloponnesian.

610
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,580
You know what I mean.

611
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,360
Got it, yeah.

612
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,540
Yeah, Polyphemus.

613
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,160
Yeah, one-eyed ninny.

614
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,140
Yeah, one-eyed ninny.

615
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,260
I just heard a burping sound in the background.

616
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,440
Could that be the industrial police force?

617
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,320
I felt it.

618
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,100
I didn't hear it.

619
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,420
I felt a kind of a buzz run through my face.

620
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,720
I felt a buzz run through my fingers.

621
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,980
Well, mine was fell all the way down to the bottom of my scrotum.

622
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,560
So there, Mr. Stang.

623
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,120
That's a big burp.

624
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,900
Dave, black helicopters are probably listening to this broadcast even though it's not being broadcast.

625
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,260
No, seriously.

626
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,200
It's just being recorded on this little Olympus recorder here.

627
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,060
Well, they can hear you.

628
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,580
But it's going through the phone.

629
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,480
You know, they can hear it through the phone.

630
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,140
Right, right.

631
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,380
They don't know you can hear them listening.

632
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,760
The black helicopters will come for you first, Dave, because you're easier to find.

633
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,340
Yeah.

634
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,420
Yeah.

635
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,460
I guess that's right.

636
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,720
Actually, I'd be just—

637
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,660
I don't know how so—

638
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,060
I'd be easier to find, I guess, but I have more escape routes.

639
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,800
It would take them at least five minutes to catch up with me.

640
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,340
And more escape boats, too.

641
00:26:48,340 --> 00:27:00,980
You know, if the black helicopters showed up and there were guys kind of, you know, rappelling down into our yard, we would shoot out that door—I'm not going to say which door—and out that gate—I'm not going to say which gate—on the air.

642
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:10,700
And down that trail—I think you know which trail it is—and we'd be down on the ranch road in about ten seconds.

643
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:18,420
And they wouldn't know where we went except for their heat vision goggles and their hound dogs.

644
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,140
So it would take them at least five minutes to actually catch us and shoot us.

645
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,020
Yeah.

646
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,320
But we'd give them a little bit of a run for their money.

647
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,900
I hear voices.

648
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,160
There are voices in my head.

649
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,420
Yeah, that's what I was talking about.

650
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,160
There's escaped goats and hostage chickens.

651
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,900
The escaped goats?

652
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
Or the scapegoats?

653
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,200
The escaped goats and the hostage chickens.

654
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,120
And they've all got Stockholm Syndrome supplies.

655
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,480
Yep.

656
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,480
All work at the maritime freelance organizations for some reason.

657
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,780
That's right. I love my captors.

658
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,960
And they let me build my own cage—or, well, kind of decorate it anyway.

659
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,500
Yeah, they let you decorate it.

660
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,140
Sometimes they let you do it.

661
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,760
Sometimes they charge you.

662
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,700
Yeah, but you get to pick which of the three throw pillows you can have in your cage.

663
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,280
So, you know, and they give you snacks.

664
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,080
We have snacks here at Trump Stop.

665
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,520
And we're off work for like eight hours a day.

666
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,500
Sometimes you can sleep.

667
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,240
Sometimes if you try all day, eight hours of trying to sleep.

668
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,620
Yeah.

669
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,260
And then you put a cigar in your nose and everybody expects it to go away.

670
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,220
Like, that's what they did to me, too.

671
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,620
They stuck a cigar up my nose.

672
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,460
It still pinched a little bit.

673
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,400
They're pinchy people.

674
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,840
Frog fighters, you know.

675
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,260
Deluxo grabs.

676
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,960
Yeah, yeah.

677
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,580
Yeah.

678
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,040
That's just what I was thinking, too.

679
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,600
Yeah.

680
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:53,920
Yeah.

681
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,000
Deluxo grabs.

682
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,280
Well, you and your blasted Hanami Gritch.

683
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,140
Yeah.

684
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,920
You pull the cripes.

685
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,220
Our Harmony Grits are pretty good.

686
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:05,940
Yeah.

687
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,300
I like Harmony Grits.

688
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:08,760
They're in tune.

689
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,160
They're gritty, but they're in tune, you know.

690
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,680
Yeah, they have to be.

691
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,400
If you want to make them creamy, you have to add too much cheese and cream.

692
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,120
Dave, my Victory Garden is going great.

693
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,740
You know, I started a garden this year because we were going to be in prison in the same place all year.

694
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,580
This is the first time.

695
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,660
I'm in years that we've been in prison in the same place.

696
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,520
I thought, well, I'll start a little Victory Garden to celebrate.

697
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,220
And I got carried away.

698
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:47,120
And now we have one okra and 100 million hot peppers.

699
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,080
And 200 million cucumbers.

700
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,060
Well, yeah, the cucumbers are good.

701
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,860
But I said that I'd never.

702
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,460
I'd never really monkeyed with tobacco.

703
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,500
I'd never really thought about tobacco peppers per se.

704
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,580
I ended up growing some.

705
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,360
They grew well.

706
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,780
Big old bush of them in 100 degree weather.

707
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,080
They're good for making sauce out of, too.

708
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,080
Well, but I have several mystery peppers.

709
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,580
And I cut one of each.

710
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,760
And I was going to go through and try them.

711
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,840
And I started with the smallest one, which was the Tabasco.

712
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,560
And I was really pretty shocked.

713
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,920
I couldn't do much of anything for about an hour after that.

714
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:45,040
I guess when they make Tabasco sauce, it's 99% vinegar and 1% actual molecule from the Tabasco pepper.

715
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:56,120
I had like literally a nibble the size of an 8 millimeter film sprocket hole.

716
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,260
Okay.

717
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,820
The piece that's punched out of the film to make the sprocket hole.

718
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,660
That's how big of a piece I had.

719
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,060
And I had to scrape my mouth with oyster shells for an hour after that.

720
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,240
Get rid of the oil.

721
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,480
That just was intolerable.

722
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,960
Well, at least you didn't have to dress in bear skins and dance around the fire, you know?

723
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,360
Have to?

724
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,200
That was what I was trying to.

725
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,780
That's what I wanted to do.

726
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,660
But you can't.

727
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,360
Fires are illegal now.

728
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:26,840
Here.

729
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,340
Unless they're wearing masks.

730
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,880
No, no, no.

731
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,140
I mean, you can't.

732
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,040
It's 100 degrees and it hasn't.

733
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,420
By the way, I'm not exaggerating.

734
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,000
It's 100 degrees.

735
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,040
It has been for a couple of weeks now.

736
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,780
And it hasn't rained for six weeks at least.

737
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,700
So the grass is glass.

738
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,860
It just it's brittle.

739
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,640
It shatters.

740
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,160
I don't have to mow.

741
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
All I have to do is walk on it.

742
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,180
And it's flat.

743
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,740
It's flat.

744
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,600
It's been rather droughty up here, too.

745
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,760
Well, you guys still get moisture out of the sky sometimes.

746
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,440
We haven't had that in a long, long time.

747
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,160
Long, long, long, long time.

748
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,800
I was reading a post from a Norwegian friend of ours.

749
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,420
And he was real sad because the blue muscles.

750
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,460
Of Norway.

751
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,080
Might as well be extinct.

752
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,940
What a great band that was.

753
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,300
And they couldn't catch even cod.

754
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:38,740
He said it used to be when you didn't have anything for dinner, you just walked down to the harbor and throw in a hook and catch some cod.

755
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,620
Well, now you couldn't even catch cod.

756
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,660
And I was going, oh, boo hoo hoo.

757
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,920
They're so sad because they can't eat their favorite seafood.

758
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,280
We don't even have water.

759
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,960
Much less a harbor.

760
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,300
Good God.

761
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,940
So there's a drought in Norway, too?

762
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,480
Yeah.

763
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,200
Norway is droughted, too?

764
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,560
No, it's not that.

765
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,220
It's that the.

766
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,900
It's hot.

767
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:17,760
The global coronavirus, you know, the cool warming thing that they love so much has extinctified the fish or drove them north where they can barely cling to life.

768
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,460
Of course, pretty soon the polar bears are going to be coming south and eat all the fish.

769
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:22,460


770
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:22,460


771
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,140
And then the polar bears will starve to death if they have to go further south.

772
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,600
Or start their own extinct function, yeah.

773
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,560
Everything's pretty.

774
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,680
Eventually everything will eat everything else up out of desperation.

775
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,220
And there won't be anybody left except for you, me and Bob Dobbs and we.

776
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,100
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

777
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,440
Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?

778
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,640
That's what it is to be a slave.

779
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,100
In fear.

780
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,020
Sounds like Peter Siller's in it.

781
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,060
Yeah.

782
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,480
Discarnate voices.

783
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,240
Colombian discarnate voices.

784
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,100
Dave shouldn't be able to hear that.

785
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,800
That's the Danish National Orchestra doing the soundtrack of Blade Runner and they threw in some soundtrack clips.

786
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,860
I play at the beginning of the show, I think.

787
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,880
What we had on was a band called Thrust playing.

788
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,940
Playing saucers, I think.

789
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,940
I'm not, I'm confused.

790
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,640
Maybe it was, uh...

791
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,480
I just don't know.

792
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,760
I don't know if I'm real or a skin job or...

793
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,200
I mean, skin jobs are people too.

794
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,800
I mean, you can't say a skin job isn't real.

795
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,820
They're real as hell.

796
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,460
Yeah, foreskins can be very painful and luxurious too.

797
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,940
In some mountain places.

798
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,380
Well, you could say they're not human, although they look human.

799
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,320
You could say they're not human, but you people wouldn't believe...

800
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,380
You could say they're as human as a human door.

801
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,500
Quiet.

802
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,620
Whoa.

803
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,740
Attacked ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.

804
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,440
Oh, wow.

805
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,380
Is that the new Hungarian orchestra?

806
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,920
I watched sea beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.

807
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,440
Did you guys say that?

808
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:19,780
Yeah.

809
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,320
Old people talk this way, old people.

810
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,180
I know J.R. Bob Dock for who he was.

811
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,860
I know the subgeniuses for what they were.

812
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,800
Well, they didn't know what he was, and he didn't know what he was either.

813
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,620
So it makes all the difference the same.

814
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,740
Hey, speaking of quotes from Little Big Man,

815
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,880
Onan pointed out that Dustin Hoffman turned 83 this week.

816
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,180
They could re-film Little Big Man and he wouldn't need makeup.

817
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,760
They could do the old man scenes and he wouldn't need the makeup.

818
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:56,740
Yeah.

819
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
My name is Jack Crabb.

820
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:07,100
I'm the sole living survivor of the Battle of Little Big Horn, commonly known as Custer's Last Stained.

821
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,260
Last Stained.

822
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,500
Wonderful that he lived so long that he could actually do that.

823
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,200
It's wonderful that I can do that.

824
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,080
It was wonderful that he could do that when he was only 30 or so.

825
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,540
Yeah.

826
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,620
Thanks to the great makeup artist Dick Smith.

827
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,820
Ah ha, a Smith.

828
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,540
Dick Smith before he dicks you.

829
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,540
Right, Dick Sniffer they call him sometimes.

830
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,880
Sorry.

831
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,440
That's not...

832
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,280
I thought that was funny.

833
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,400
There really was a great makeup artist named Dick Smith.

834
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:48,920
And the reason I know about him is because he wrote this wonderful publication called The Monster Makeup Handbook.

835
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,960
And it was for kids.

836
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,640
And I got it when I was 12 years old.

837
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,100
I remember that.

838
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:02,440
And Dick Smith used his son as a model for a lot of the makeups because it was makeup for kids.

839
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,740
And his son was named Douglas Smith, age 12.

840
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:08,720
Wow.

841
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,680
Well I was Douglas Smith age 12 then but that was long before I was Ivan Stang age 7,100.

842
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,840
And so that made me pretty...

843
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,220
Pretty excited.

844
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,280
But don't you think Dick Sniffer is a funny name?

845
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,720
I mean...

846
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,600
Well, yeah.

847
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,560
There are funnier names but...

848
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,440
There are funnier names.

849
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,020
I had a buddy in high school named Richard Titley.

850
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,600
Oh no, it was Robert Titley.

851
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,000
Bob Titley was his name.

852
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,340
But his dad's name was Dick Titley.

853
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,940
Goodness.

854
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,060
Poor guy.

855
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,380
Bob Titley is a well respected figure in country western music management now.

856
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,900
I knew girls...

857
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,300
I knew a girl whose name was Fonda Dix.

858
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,820
Like a lot of my old high school buddies who made it good, they are not my Facebook friends.

859
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,320
And I've heard third hand that when somebody mentioned, didn't you know Doug...

860
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,920
Ivan Stang back when he was Doug Smith?

861
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,520
The less said about that the better.

862
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,260
Oh.

863
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,540
Sad, isn't it?

864
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,180
It is.

865
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,700
What do you think about the...

866
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,960
I knew a girl whose name was Fonda Dix.

867
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,320
No way.

868
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,700
Oh yeah.

869
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,840
D-I-X, right?

870
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,960
Yeah.

871
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,600
Yeah, that's a common last name.

872
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,800
And Fonda, like Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Fonda Peter.

873
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,300
But that's a last name.

874
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,760
But like Peter Fonda probably had to say the same thing in reverse.

875
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,800
Fonda Peter.

876
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,520
Say your last name first, then your name.

877
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,700
Fonda Peter.

878
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,180
We asked your name, not your proclivities.

879
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,380
Yes.

880
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,040
No.

881
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,120
We don't all have...

882
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,980
For the faint tops, we don't all have the same proclivities.

883
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,180
It would be a hell of a rush to the steam wagon.

884
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,820
You know what I mean?

885
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,980
We'd all be hand over hand trying to get in those old festival gates.

886
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,920
That'd probably be really fun.

887
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,300
No festival gates this year except for Sturgis.

888
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:00,800
Right.

889
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,060
Which is also a dirty name to many people.

890
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,220
Oh, you know what else is also open for festivals?

891
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,480
It's Renaissance Fair.

892
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,880
The Renaissance Fair in Texas cared more about money than the safety, than having another

893
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,560
Renaissance Fair with quite as many people next time.

894
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,800
I'll have to check that out.

895
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,620
They have Renaissance Fairs around here in August too.

896
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,780
So I'll have to check that out.

897
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,720
But I think it's very, very selfish of them because somebody might get converse.

898
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,100
Can't they do it on Zoom?

899
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,580
I understand.

900
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,640
It's not the same.

901
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,620
It's not the same at all.

902
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,780
And it is mostly outdoors, which is fine.

903
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,940
But then the shops, you know, when you go into the shops are these tiny little tents.

904
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,220
Yeah.

905
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,420
Like Starwood.

906
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,980
You know, you walk into a little tent and everybody's hacking and coughing.

907
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,220
They're so glad to get their mask off for a minute.

908
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,140
And they're hacking and coughing in each other's eyes.

909
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:02,820
And then they go home and give grandma a big kiss on her head.

910
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,480
Wait a minute.

911
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,600
I do that every day.

912
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,140
Yeah, but you're not in little tents with people hacking and coughing, dear.

913
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,420
No.

914
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,720
The worst I've been in is the supermarket in the tiny little town.

915
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,600
And there's no...

916
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,940
And you keep your distance from people in the grocery store.

917
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,540
I've been keeping my distance from people my whole life.

918
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,460
See, none of this is good for me.

919
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,620
You've got to be careful.

920
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,080
I've been wearing a mask my whole life.

921
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,420
The mask of normality.

922
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,540
The mask of Norway and the codfish.

923
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,460
The deadly hot codfish.

924
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,300
I forgot to tell you about the nice little old lady the other day when I was walking into the grocery store.

925
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,560
She smiled and kind of laughed.

926
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,820
And looked at me and said,

927
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,020
It's just like Halloween, isn't it?

928
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,100
Oh, because everybody had masks on.

929
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,200


930
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,700
Yeah.

931
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,860
I'm going to try a big smile on.

932
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,660
She just got done trick-or-treating and robbing a bank.

933
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,840
Were you wearing one of your Dobbs head bandanas where the lower half of your face was Bob's lower half?

934
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,200
Yes.

935
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,820
Yes, I was.

936
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,580
Yeah, those are...

937
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,040
Then it is like Halloween.

938
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,900
You could rob banks with those Dobb masks.

939
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,800
And you should, too, probably.

940
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,540
Well, that's true.

941
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:22,120
It would confuse the video replay and facial recognition thing.

942
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,420
And Bob would get it.

943
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,280
They'd go after Bob.

944
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,580
In many lights, people with masks on look like cartoon faces.

945
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:35,160
And you look at them and like a beautiful woman's face suddenly becomes an ogre face.

946
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,840
And you want to laugh out loud, but you can't because you want to be quiet.

947
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,080
It works the opposite way for some people, Dave.

948
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,520
Some of us have a big face.

949
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:53,720
We've observed that now that the ladies are wearing masks, maybe they put more work into their eye makeup or something.

950
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,520
I don't know what it is, but for some reason...

951
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,340
Oh, eyebrows, for sure.

952
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,140
They all look beautiful.

953
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,660
All the women's magazines are telling women to do that.

954
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,580
They're all saying...

955
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,060
We use more makeup on your eyes.

956
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:06,360
Yes.

957
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,620
They're all saying, look, you've got to cover half your face, so work that stuff.

958
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,240
Right.

959
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,540
And remember, ladies, boys can't tell that you don't have your teeth anymore.

960
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:17,760
Right.

961
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,580
So work the eyes.

962
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,400
Yes.

963
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,140
They can't tell that you lost most of your nose to cocaine use.

964
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:32,280
They don't know that you really look like the Phantom of the Opera from the bridge of the nose down.

965
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,240
So work it.

966
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,160
Do your hair.

967
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,100
Do their eyes.

968
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,280
I've noticed that every gentleman's quarterly man...

969
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,540
Has a three-day...

970
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,840
Four-day stubble.

971
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,220
It's like a half beard.

972
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,400
What's up with that?

973
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,000
You're a little light ass, that.

974
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,920
I seem to remember that being a big fad in the 80s.

975
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,660
Well, yes.

976
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:02,840
The first, there was the Miami device that they made because Miami Vice guys had the half-grown beards, and that's where it got popular.

977
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:03,640
That's what started it.

978
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:10,400
But then it fell out of favor, and then recently, again, it has fallen back into favor.

979
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,700
Over the last year.

980
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,320
I would say.

981
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,680
You mean like right now I'm accidentally fashionable?

982
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,260
No.

983
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,100
No.

984
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,360
That's only if it's evenly all over your face and it's black.

985
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,460
And there has to be a big chunk of it on your throat, too, on your neck.

986
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,340
I don't know that the wide stubble really does anything for anyone.

987
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:29,960
It's softer.

988
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,740
It smells so white.

989
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,040
Your beard is so soft.

990
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:35,420
I love it.

991
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,820
Makes you look like Kill Bill.

992
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,840
Or some other...

993
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,520
Redneck.

994
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:44,740
I'm sorry.

995
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,440
I didn't mean to take my shoes off.

996
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,540
I'm literally just stretching.

997
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,280
Yeah, put your shoes back on.

998
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,640
Boy, oh boy, are my feet smelly right now.

999
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,860
Boy, you'd never be able to tell that Dave was in an iron lung right now, would you?

1000
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,140
No.

1001
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,040
No, you can never tell.

1002
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,540
He sounds like the same old Dave.

1003
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,760
In fact, he sounds better than he did the last time we did a show.

1004
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,060
This is a great connection we've got right now.

1005
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:04,420
Yeah.

1006
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,420
This phone is great.

1007
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,820
Especially the gurgling sound and the mad professor in the background screaming, this is my phone.

1008
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:10,820


1009
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,260
This is mine.

1010
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,000
This is mine.

1011
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,840
It's alive.

1012
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,440
There's no buzz.

1013
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,860
That's right.

1014
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,400
There's no buzz.

1015
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:18,680
There's no buzz.

1016
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:26,340
Well, Dave's buzz phone was his home line, that ancient hard-lined phone.

1017
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,740
Ah.

1018
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,580
It's gone now.

1019
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,400
Oh.

1020
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:35,840
He only has the magic little pay-as-you-go phone.

1021
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,720
The cello phone, as Bill Cates calls it.

1022
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,740
The cello phone.

1023
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,180
The cello phone.

1024
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,980
The guy who goes, hup, hup, hup, is sounding off now.

1025
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,220
Bleepo, I mean.

1026
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,440
You can hear him down the hall.

1027
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:47,760
The tracker phone.

1028
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:48,840
Tracker phone.

1029
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,160
Yeah, that's the way the conspiracy can track Dave.

1030
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,100
He has a track phone.

1031
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,340
Oh, I see.

1032
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,600
You know, I have to recharge the dog's trackers every day.

1033
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,260
I know.

1034
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:58,960
Do you really?

1035
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,420
Which is Monday, see?

1036
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,500
We can't take him today, because this is the Lord's Day.

1037
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,480
There's nothing open except beer.

1038
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,080
The Lord's Day.

1039
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,880
Places where you can buy beer.

1040
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,420
Honestly, you think about it.

1041
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,960
In this town, on Sunday, only places where you can get beer are open.

1042
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,860
What else is open?

1043
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,200
The dollar store.

1044
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,580
Dollar store, you can get beer.

1045
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,640
Tractor supply, you can't get beer there.

1046
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,660
So that's the only store that's open on Sundays.

1047
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,420
I don't think you can get beer at the dollar store.

1048
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,040
Hell yeah, you can.

1049
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,200
Dollar General?

1050
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,720
Hell yeah.

1051
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:30,980
Oh, yeah.

1052
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:31,700
Not good beer.

1053
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,480
It's all American, you know.

1054
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,680
I didn't know you can get beer there.

1055
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,360
Of course.

1056
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,160
Yes, you can.

1057
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,340
Conspiracy beer.

1058
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,200
Yeah, dollar store.

1059
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,500
I had no idea.

1060
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:39,500
I thought you were going to say,

1061
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,300
Oh, because you're not an alcoholic, dear.

1062
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:41,680
Oh, okay.

1063
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,260
Or not a very good alcoholic, I should say.

1064
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,380
Okay, gotcha.

1065
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,000
All right.

1066
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,760
But no, you go in there, they've got all that Coors and Miller crap.

1067
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,040
I didn't know.

1068
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,100
They don't have anything I would drink.

1069
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,000
I didn't know.

1070
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm a snob.

1071
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm a hipster snob, man.

1072
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,240
Spell backwards, that's Bonds.

1073
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,360
Yeah, Rignotskisnaka.

1074
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,520
Bonds.

1075
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,720
My dad had to say everything backwards.

1076
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,580
Hey, Dave.

1077
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,040
You remember the Fireside Theater?

1078
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,400
They inspired us to become a fan.

1079
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,700
We've become what we are today, right?

1080
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,580
Yeah.

1081
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:19,200
David Osman of the Fireside Theater is still alive and kicking, and he's on Facebook, and

1082
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:27,440
he's cooped up in the woods, sort of like I am, and he's been posting memorabilia like

1083
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:34,680
crazy, all kinds of old photos and old jobs, radio jobs he did, and times when he met his

1084
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,020
heroes, who were people I'd never even heard of, mostly.

1085
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:39,380
Yeah.

1086
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:48,520
And I'd say it's kind of fun to watch a guy 20 years ahead of you that you copied and

1087
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,720
imitated and was your hero, and now he's just your Facebook buddy going, hey, look

1088
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,120
at this old picture I found.

1089
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,280
Well, that kind of makes sense.

1090
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,000
I met him once, and he seemed to be that kind of guy that would do that.

1091
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,140
He'd live a reclusive life and sell things on I-Bean.

1092
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,480
David Osman was actually the first celebrity.

1093
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,920
To me, he was a celebrity.

1094
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:18,480
First celebrity I ever met, and he was so nice that I vowed that if I ever became a

1095
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:28,040
slight bit of a celebrity, like he is, that I would try to be nice to fans and not be

1096
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,200
haughty or any of that kind.

1097
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,580
I'd be encouraging.

1098
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,120
And I've really tried hard.

1099
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,460
And about a week ago, I wrote him a book.

1100
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,820
I wrote him a fan letter saying, thank you for being so nice to me 40 years ago, because

1101
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,160
I've been nice to my fans ever since then, as much as I could.

1102
00:47:48,840 --> 00:48:00,360
If they weren't insane, obnoxious, crazy, boring, talk-too-much ninnies on speed without

1103
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
offering me any.

1104
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,260
Al Pacino walked up the steps of the Guggenheim, and he kept on pointing at me going, you!

1105
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:07,340
You!

1106
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,160
Every step he took, you!

1107
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,340
And it was like he knew me, and he was waiting to come and embrace me or something.

1108
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,180
He got right in my face and he went, nah.

1109
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,020
He thought you were another Italian that he recognized.

1110
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,440
I suppose that was it.

1111
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,920
But I was like, why is he doing that?

1112
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:31,340
By the time he got right up to me, I was kind of chuckling, but a little nervous about meeting

1113
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,640
Al Pacino, and I didn't.

1114
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,580
He's, nah.

1115
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,600
He said David Carradine.

1116
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,240
Yeah.

1117
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,940
No, he said Al Pacino.

1118
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,280
No, he's another Italian-y kind of guy.

1119
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,320
My brain is glitching.

1120
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:43,900
My brain is glitching.

1121
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,960
David, I had a weird surprise.

1122
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:54,980
Princess, we and I did one of those DNA tests, finally, and we got the results back, and

1123
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,680
there was a bit of a shock in there.

1124
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,080
It turns out I have like 13% Italian in me.

1125
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:03,840
Everything else is British.

1126
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,640
Ah, if he was tangy.

1127
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,420
If he was tangy.

1128
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,760
Yeah, yeah.

1129
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,680
And I went, I'm not sure where, how, what.

1130
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:20,320
I talked to my cousin who does genealogy and has really been following the staying side

1131
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,460
of the family, and she said that would come from the Swiss.

1132
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:29,880
We had some Swiss, a major Swiss ancestor.

1133
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,340
Switzerland is right north of Italy.

1134
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:34,860
Mm-hmm.

1135
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,800
So that's where there's a little bit of the old pizza brush.

1136
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,840
It's divided up into a French sector, an Italian sector, and a German sector.

1137
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,140
They have Oing and Romance.

1138
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,180
So there's four distinct languages, and one is like an Italian dialect, and the other

1139
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,260
one is actually Italian.

1140
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:01,360
Well, one of them Italians sneaked in and nailed one of those English or British or

1141
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,860
Irish or Scot gals.

1142
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,180
Or something happened there.

1143
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,260
The old Italian double cross.

1144
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:14,420
Of course, if you're ... Everybody from the British Isles is basically part Scandinavian

1145
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:25,460
and part German and part French and part Roman because they were invaded by all of those.

1146
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,220
Just because.

1147
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:32,940
And there was a certain amount of rapey, rapey stuff going on, and probably some, oh, hence

1148
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,880
some centurion.

1149
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,340
Well, well.

1150
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:42,100
I bet the old witch woman won't mind if I impregnate myself with something new here.

1151
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,280
Impregnate yourself?

1152
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,880
A man can't impregnate.

1153
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,840
I like to think that it was somewhere in my British Isles background, one of my Yeti woman

1154
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,660
ancestresses, that Roman guy had been away from Rome for a long time.

1155
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,880
My sister did the ancestors.

1156
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,080
Oh, yeah.

1157
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:12,680
The English part of ours also had Roman in it, or what would be considered nowadays Italian.

1158
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,420
Well, there's a difference.

1159
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,940
Roman is not the same as every other kind of Italian.

1160
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:22,760
Well, they survived the Saxon plunder.

1161
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,700
The Saxons actually tried to wipe them out, but they couldn't.

1162
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,320
They just ...

1163
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,820
Damn.

1164
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,680
Do asconced.

1165
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,400
Remember, St. Patrick was ... Huh?

1166
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:42,400
When I was in Rome when I was very young, like 19, and on a bus, and this priest sat

1167
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,640
down next to me and softly put his hand on my leg, and he said, you know, young man,

1168
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,020
you look Roman.

1169
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,000
I went, what?

1170
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,100
I don't think so.

1171
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:56,540
As far as I know, I'm mostly just, I don't know.

1172
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,980
I don't know if ... I don't think I've got any Italian.

1173
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,400
He goes, no, not Italian, Roman.

1174
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,380
He goes, you've got a Roman.

1175
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,380


1176
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,040
Roman knows.

1177
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,720
Classic Roman knows.

1178
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,500
You look at our coins and stuff, you'll see what I mean.

1179
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,360
He's like, what?

1180
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,360
And then he moved his hand a little further up me, and I went, that's a very interesting

1181
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:13,760
photo.

1182
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,020
Oh, this is where we get off.

1183
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,400
You guys went and had dinner then.

1184
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,380
Could hardly wait to get back to the hotel room.

1185
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,220
I know.

1186
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,900
That happened to me too, twice.

1187
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,360
No, all I ever learned was that I had a Roman nose, which I don't really know.

1188
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1189
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1190
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1191
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1192
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1193
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1194
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1195
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1196
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1197
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1198
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1199
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,360


1200
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,300
I don't really get or see.

1201
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:38,560
I've had people tell me they thought I must be part Chinese too, including Chinese have

1202
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,180
said that.

1203
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,520
But maybe it's just that wherever you go, they want to make you feel good.

1204
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,940
So they go, you know, you look like you're part human like us.

1205
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,940
You don't look as ugly as regular Americans because your nose isn't quite as huge and

1206
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,700
your eyes aren't as retarded looking or stupid looking or something looking.

1207
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,420
I've been hip to that.

1208
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,840
You must be part Chinese.

1209
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,340
You must be part Chinese.

1210
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,140
You must be part African.

1211
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,800
You must be wherever you are, you know.

1212
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,220
Yep.

1213
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,700
That happened to me also.

1214
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,560
And my grandfather was actually from Rome.

1215
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:13,500
So his claim to fame as being Roman was kind of true.

1216
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,040
From Roma Saini.

1217
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,420
But my grandmother was from the south.

1218
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,980
Way down yonder.

1219
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah, the hairy ones.

1220
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:23,660
Napoli.

1221
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,380
The ones with big naples.

1222
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,320
Yes, big, big Napolis.

1223
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,060
Yeah.

1224
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,820
Which I always thought was part of France or Indian subcontinent, Napolis.

1225
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,420
But I guess it's more a fruit flavor you can get once in a while.

1226
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,280
Well, you'll have that.

1227
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,380
Well, heck.

1228
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,360
I wonder how much Neanderthal you have, Dave.

1229
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,780
Oh, many, many, many tons of it.

1230
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,960
My brother got a fancier DNA test than me.

1231
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:07,680
And it said that he had more Neanderthal than 70% of the people who'd taken that test.

1232
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,800
I don't know if that's really saying that much.

1233
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,420
But in theory, my brother and me would be almost identical.

1234
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,900
They can actually check for Neanderthal bees?

1235
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,660
Oh, heck yeah.

1236
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,740
The one that we and I took was the cheap one.

1237
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,320
And they don't tell you much about it.

1238
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,940
Ancestry.com, that one?

1239
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,020
Which one did we use?

1240
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,860
Ours is 23andMe.

1241
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:34,400
But the one we got for our mom was more expensive.

1242
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,300
Yeah.

1243
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:44,840
And she turned out to be mostly pure.

1244
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,440
Trapezoid.

1245
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,120
Pure inbred British type, British Isles.

1246
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:58,780
Which means, you know, part everything.

1247
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,160
Everything else.

1248
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,860
Because everybody invaded England.

1249
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,040
It's just like my grandfather used to say.

1250
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,160
He'd say, I'm a Duke's mixture.

1251
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,380
A Duke's mixture.

1252
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:08,720
Dookie.

1253
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,000
Welsh, Irish, English.

1254
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,660
Scott.

1255
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,240
Scott, all those.

1256
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,200
Cornwalls.

1257
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:18,680
Cornholish.

1258
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,140
And you turned out to be one half inbred British Isles.

1259
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,140
And one half, what is it?

1260
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:28,680
Oss?

1261
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,460
Ashkenazi.

1262
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,560
Ashkenazi Jew.

1263
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,460
Yeah.

1264
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,300
That's like being from outer space.

1265
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,700
No, it's like being from Russia.

1266
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:41,940
Well, my father was 100% Austria-Hungarian.

1267
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,480
Right.

1268
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,960
But not originally.

1269
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,520
It was from somewhere near Russia.

1270
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:53,620
Because that's near the Ashkenazic Republic, which they named for it because they wanted

1271
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,200
to have their own Israel place.

1272
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:56,680
Oh.

1273
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,240
The Russians did anyway.

1274
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:58,660
Yeah.

1275
00:55:59,300 --> 00:55:59,920
They did.

1276
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,560
They did.

1277
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,020
They did.

1278
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,620
Well, I guess we have to read up on that and figure out which planet you're from, Princess

1279
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,020
Wade.

1280
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:06,640
I guess so.

1281
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,680
If at all.

1282
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,280
If you are-

1283
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,020
If you're from any planet.

1284
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,640
Any planet.

1285
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,540
And not some gas giant in deep outer space.

1286
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,440
A gas cloud.

1287
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,540
Larger than 20 solar systems.

1288
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:26,420
Well, that's about it.

1289
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,580
The cranes are made of gas.

1290
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,660
Yeah, that is about it.

1291
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1292
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1293
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1294
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1295
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1296
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1297
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1298
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1299
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1300
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:28,660


1301
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,540
Actually, Dave, we've been talking almost a full hour.

1302
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,540
Okay, well, I'm going to go lay down now.

1303
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,020
I thought you were laying down the whole time.

1304
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,320
I thought you were laying down this whole time, Dave.

1305
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,720
I was laying down for much of it, but then that got too uncomfortable.

1306
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,020
I have to stand on my feet for a while.

1307
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,300
Well, I'm glad you can still stand on your feet for a while.

1308
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:50,740
Me too.

1309
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,240
You're going to have to walk with a walker, so.

1310
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,840
Well, we have walkers around here.

1311
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,180
You have to shoot them in the head.

1312
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,640
Yeah.

1313
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,580
Or bust their brains in.

1314
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,320
That's about the only way to deal with walkers.

1315
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,540
Yeah, redeem them.

1316
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, Wee Ma Ma has a walker.

1317
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,060
She calls him Fred.

1318
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,080
We don't know what his name is.

1319
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,900
She rides around on him.

1320
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,260
He doesn't have any arms, and his lower jaw is being removed, you know.

1321
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,560
So he's a useful ride for the old gal.

1322
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,020
She needs help.

1323
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:25,660
Yeah.

1324
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,480
Princess, we, nor you, were ever big fans of that Walking Dead show.

1325
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,460
I refused to watch it for a long time.

1326
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,060
I don't know, zombie, that stuff's, that's actually a beautifully written show.

1327
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:40,840
Really, really good.

1328
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,860
I quit watching it only because I couldn't handle it anymore.

1329
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,040
It got too intense for me around season seven when they introduced the evil human,

1330
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,560
who was a thousand times worse than all the living dead put together.

1331
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,020
And I just couldn't handle it.

1332
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,300
Tugging at your compassion strings too hard?

1333
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,900
Oh, no, it just grossed me out.

1334
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,640
It was too horrible.

1335
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:03,820
Gross.

1336
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,180
All my friends that had survived so long were having, were being tortured.

1337
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,260
It was so vivid.

1338
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,340
It was just, ugh.

1339
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:15,280
I had to switch to something light, like Game of Thrones.

1340
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:21,420
It was so much less violent and had more Naipolis in it.

1341
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,540
It still had walkers.

1342
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:25,540


1343
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,700
White walkers.

1344
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,540
It was kind of a Nazi Walking Dead thing.

1345
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,160
Night stalkers, night walkers, huh?

1346
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:34,560
White walkers.

1347
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,720
Because they came from the far, far north and they were kind of frozen looking.

1348
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:43,040
And they controlled an army of the dead.

1349
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,840
It was a show, you know.

1350
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:49,860
Okay, well Dave, our necks hurt so we have to go now.

1351
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,980
Okay.

1352
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,600
But at least your fans got to hear a good show for a change.

1353
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,040
Yeah.

1354
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:03,260
Because your fans have had to listen to Zoom recordings and reruns and me reading and all

1355
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,460
kinds of stupid crap.

1356
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,780
Horrid Dave-less shows.

1357
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:06,880
Yeah, Dave-less shows.

1358
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,620
Anyway, we're going to go now.

1359
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,400
Okay.

1360
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,380
Going to the show.

1361
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,420
Okay, well enjoy your laying down, Dave.

1362
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,820
He always hangs up real fast.

1363
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,180
Yeah, he, he, he, you know.

1364
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,040
It's like he wants to get out of here, man.

1365
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,400
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

1366
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,400
Number one.

1367
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,660
Okay.

1368
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:25,660


1369
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:25,660


1370
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:32,960
$1,792, maybe 91 or both.

1371
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:37,720
And everything's okay at subgenius.com.

1372
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,960
You can learn everything at subgenius.com, including stuff about Dave's book, Neighborworld,

1373
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,840
and other Dave-related things.

1374
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,580
The end.

1375
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,800
Okay, now we have the internet part.

1376
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,180
$35 for your Subgenius membership, folks.

1377
00:59:53,180 --> 01:00:00,200
and when you get that membership it's not just a bunch of flyers it's not a just a bunch of

1378
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,300
stickers that's not it's actually a pretty sizable package that appears in the mail

1379
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:12,860
and it has metal objects decoder pins and rings and well not rings exactly but

1380
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:21,160
it does have stickers and it has diplomas but they're not like what you're thinking of it's not

1381
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:29,820
what you're thinking the reason is because most of you listening to me can't imagine it and are

1382
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:35,540
never going to send that 35 bucks because you think you can imagine it and you think you know

1383
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:44,840
how it is you can't and you don't and you won't but the that smaller percentage that goes 35 bucks

1384
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:50,340
that's nothing they're bound to raise it to 50 any minute now i'm gonna go for it what the hell

1385
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,140
you

1386
01:00:51,160 --> 01:01:00,400
maybe i'll meet you know something of the opposite or otherwise desired sex or sexes

1387
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:08,180
so who knows you know stick your neck out stick other things out it's nice out why don't you

1388
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:15,880
leave it out praise bob praise subgenius.com and there is a go fund me for dave uh dave's going to

1389
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,580
be uh well the hospital's going to be taking dave's money for the rest of his life

1390
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,820
i think he's allowed to have two thousand dollars in his account but anything above that they're going

1391
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:36,080
to take forever um because he's he's been in therapy now for weeks and he's got weeks more to go

1392
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:43,480
um he sounds good doesn't he does he sounds great but he sounds so much better when that red light's

1393
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,780
on because we've been talking to him every few days and oh he doesn't sound that good when he's

1394
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,860
not on the air no but he's speaking great

1395
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,140
you're welcome to be on the air but he's not on the air he's not on the air but he's not on the air

1396
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:51,960
On the radio.

1397
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:52,740
Don't be fooled.

1398
01:01:53,020 --> 01:02:00,360
He woke up and snapped out of it and fought off his pains and paranoia.

1399
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,520
For you, the listener.

1400
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,380
He really did.

1401
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:03,800
He did.

1402
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:04,860
He really did.

1403
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,920
I'm real glad we did that.

1404
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:07,380
Me too.

1405
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,020
It's reassuring to know that he can still enunciate and speak.

1406
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,280
If he tries.

1407
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,360
Yeah.

1408
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,720
Okay, praise Bob.

1409
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,480
Hey, praise Bob.

01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:41,220
Dobbs.Town is the non-Facebook, non-Google groups, cool subgenius hangout.

1415
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,760
And I'm going to try to use that more.

1416
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:49,380
And then there's yet another new one called Dobbs.

1417
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:49,560
Discord.

1418
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:57,060
Reverend Fox has started a new thing, Dobbs.Cord, which is on Discord, which is another non-Facebook,

1419
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:05,520
non-Google, so that you don't, your privacy is not as much infringed.

1420
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,520
There's not as many jerks.

1421
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
There's no ads.

1422
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,540
You know, it's just, for now, it's better.

1423
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:11,980
Uh-huh.

1424
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:15,460
Dobbs.Town is on the Mastodon platform.

1425
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:17,020
This.

1426
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,460
Dobbs.Cord is on the Discord platform.

1427
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:31,580
And now we're going to zoom off and see the Ask Dr. Howell show in a couple hours.

1428
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,680
In a couple hours, yeah.

1429
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:33,360
After we walk the dogs.

1430
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:33,880
Praise Bob.

1431
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:34,540
Praise Bob.

1432
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,700
Ah-oo-ga.

1433
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,780
Ah-oo-ga-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

1434
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:38,620
Ah-oo-ga.

1435
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1436
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1437
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1438
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1439
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1440
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1441
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1442
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1443
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1444
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1445
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1446
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1447
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1448
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:38,620


1449
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:38,600
