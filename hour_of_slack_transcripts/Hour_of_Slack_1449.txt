From PR News in Washington, I'm tackled by two people and shot in the leg with a .44 Magnum.
The United States is closed this week.
PR's report reports the U.S. is on the alert for a psychiatrist attack.
The U.S. complained about PR News here in Washington.
The U.S. is also urging Americans to leave.
The Dow Jones 9358.
The man who shot and killed three people yesterday says you're listening to PR.
State Police in Ross Township broke out during today's PR News in Washington.
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.
They've got a subgenius powerhouse.
I say this calls for action and now nip it in the bud.
Ah, shut up.
Come closer.
Take this to your people.
And tell the people the day of their deliverance is at hand.
Modesty, but no humility.
My father imprisoned a friend of his in this room for three years.
When he was released, he could never again bear to look at the sun.
Or even a daffodil.
How cruel.
Cruel?
It was simply a test to prove how easily a man's mind can be controlled and twisted.
My family have always been interested in such things.
Somewhere in the mind is the key to our existence.
My ancestors tried to find it.
To open the door that separates us from our creator.
But you need no doors to find God.
If you believe...
Believe?
If you believe, you are gullible.
Can you look around this world and believe in the goodness of a God who rules it?
Famine, pestilence, war, disease and death.
They rule this world.
There is also love and life and hope.
Very little hope, I assure you.
No.
No hope.

No hope.
If a God of love and life ever did exist, he is long since dead.
Someone...
Something...
Rules in his place.
Let me speak to you about the anatomy of Bob.
What would you know of Bob Ralfredo?
Your senses are much too blunt.
What is Bob-Bob-Bob?
Come.
He's not...
He's not...
Silence.
Listen.
Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy.
Who do you think you are, anyway?
Yes, it came from outer space.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What was it?
There's something behind this.
Something we don't understand.
Where did it come from?
It came from outer space.
What is it?
Something we don't understand.
We don't understand.
We don't understand.
We don't understand.
We don't understand.
We don't understand.
Ah.
I have never seen any
But I've met many a darkness
And there are plenty of signs just scattered around
The biblical stories
The Sumerian society
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?
Oh, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
The Sun in the world of technology
Ancient celestial cartography
Can you explain to me how you can ace the cows?
The Kiru and the Anunnaki
You may say it's all malarkey
But the evidence is sure does us dumb
Oh, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians


Oh, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians
It's aliens, but it's aliens
Velcro
Anal Brunch
Human Minds
Puppet Shards
Internet
Experiments
Radio
Torture
Creationists
Atheists
Aliens
Oh I'm not sure you're
It's aliens, but it's aliens
No, I'm not sure you'll tell me
you're
It's aliens, but it's aliens
No, I'm not sure you'll tell me
I love not sanitarians, but Italians
I love not sanitarians, but Italians
I love not sanitarians, but Italians
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

Orel, come in!
Juh... juh...
Bob?
Yo... Yes!
Not Jesus?
No! Not quite, but between you and me you got the better butt.
Yeah but-
I know, it's a big butt!
I just can't, Mr. Armature!
Orel, he's Bob!
And there's a great song-
G... g-get a load of it!
It's a great song!
Bouncy as the...
I hate you, Jesus, you rotten little thing.
Your sermon never pleases and your parables all stink.
Your eyes are beady noses with a goofy basket case.
I'd like to take your stupid beard and rip it off your face.
Prancing gaily on the water.
What, what, what?
I can't imagine ever singing that in a million years!
You're nuts! It's totally in your range with everything.
I cannot play.
BAM!
Come on, give it a try.
Hit it!
I hate you, Jesus, you rotten little thing.
Your sermon never pleases and your parables all stink.
Cut!
Kid, you're killing me.
I just can't. I guess I'm not a good enough for you to really hate.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think.
I got it, got it!
You can be a good Christian.
I can?
Sure. I mean, if you look at it in the grand scheme of things,
it would never be Christianity if it wasn't for Bob.
Oh.
In fact, you might even call Bob one of the bigger heroes of Christianity.
A hero?
You betcha! He's real important to the religion.
Hmm. Then you know what, Mr. Armature?
What, Oral?
I think I can...
Bob, Bob, Bob.
Well, hello, Fresbo, you silly clown.
Say, why aren't you up on your flying trapeze today?
Well, today is Sunday, and Sunday is...
Ow! Fresbo, you hit me!
Heheheheheheh...
You've got to turn the other cheek.
Ow!
Turn the other cheek.
Ow!
Show the world how strong you are by simply acting weak.
Inherit all the world someday, cause you will be the meek.
I'm a god!
Shoo!
Inherit all the world someday, cause you will be the meek.
Ow!
And just tell me when you turn the other cheek.
I hate you.
Hate away, sister.
Hate away.
Alright.
Oh!
I know I'm drunk now.
Ladies and gentlemen, I forgot my favorite man sitting over there.
His name is...
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr. Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr. Bob Dove Lina-
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.
Mr Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina!
Mess the up.
Mess it up to **** You made me sick with, via, a thousand words,
Why don't you be handy, little rug rat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid
Because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw you trying to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission trying to hawk me
But it isn't happening, you fraudulent foes
You used to front big time, now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of, but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D.E.L. is already hip to your cronies
Me and CM Phoenix thought about this
And never have we seen a brother who would hover like
Mr. Mr. Mr. Davalina
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Bob Davalina
Ooh, ooh, Mr. Davalina
You thought you could manipulate, you thought you could fool me
Ooh, ooh, Mr. Davalina
Cheech Wizard put me on a stumper, then he schooled me
Prince could be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my money grip, then he stole my honey dip
Mr. Davalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-timer resembles Aunt Jemima
Would you marry me?

I'm wearing jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like you wouldn't be a snake, or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D.E.L. could see through the mask
All I had to do is ask the Emperor and Kwame
And my maris thought if they were bombing
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way you're on my dick must really hurt your knees
You need to take heat and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadalupe
I never saw a groupie like you
But when it's time to go, I'ma show you

The fun is you wanted to be down with my crew
But D.E.L. is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress some professor, Davalina
Because you don't impress me, Davalina
The style of dress is not the key, Davalina
It's all in the mind and the heart
So you should start by remembering
You gotta pay a fee, Davalina
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Glory, how stupid
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina
Mr. Bob Davalina
Glory, how stupid
Mr. Bob Davalina
Glory, how stupid

Hi
Aku


D Sturizen
Never?!
uh yes
oh
man whoa that's intense
that was uh not the rudy schwartz project although some long-time listeners would recognize that tune
as the instrumental called moe mars tractor by rudy schwartz project but it wasn't by rudy
schwartz project it's being covered by a band called purple johnson blimp situation
you hadn't heard that before
you hadn't heard that before

no it's our reverend peter because no i had not it was it was just submitted with two other pieces
of music this week by reverend peter because and uh the other piece that we've heard that he did
was uh that opening song for this show about i'm not saying i'm not not saying it's aliens but it's
aliens that was uh purple johnson blimp situation as well
which i thought deserved special attention wow um let's see what else uh after
his song uh i'm not saying it's aliens there and before there were some collages by the great
lee murr and also by reverend exister of ministry of slack who sent us a big mess of stuff last week
including that uh mixed up rant by papa joe mama
the인�werd tour was the pre
their second album had a song called,
that went Bob Dabolina, Mr. Bob Dabolina.
But that's all it did.
It kind of did that in chorus like a loop.
I mean, it was really the monkeys imitating future loops.
The monkeys were ahead of their time in strange ways.
Yes, they were.
We heard some cut-ups by Reverend Exister, yes,
who did Brought to You By and some others.
Oh, and the Rainmakers did the song Wages of Sin.
An old favorite of mine, this was a live version,
a recent live version from a live DVD,
they have out celebrating 25 years of rainmaking
and lonesome cowboy Dave.
All the more so thanks to you.
All the more so for the porso in the torso.
And all under an orange-colored sky.
Is it truly orange-colored where you sit right now?
Yes.
The sky is actually the color of orange sherbet here.
And it reminded me of this song from my parents' era.
I was walking along, minding my business,
when under an orange-colored sky.
Wham, bam, alakazam, wonderful you walk by.
That was the era when all the songs sounded like advertisements.
It is kind of surreal here.
They had a very delicate song.
They had a very strong.
They had delicate song structure.
It's back to the common rock and roll song structure of today.
Sometimes they would start with an interlude
and then revamp again on it later.
They would set up the tune and do a variation on it
and then somebody would start singing something
that didn't seem to make any sense
and they would slap together.
Then suddenly it would be over.
And that's how we do the Hour of Slack.
Thank you for listening, friends.
Wham, bam, alakazam.
Yeah.
But is that...
Is it true that the sky is orange?
It is orange.
The sky is literally orange here.
Well, isn't that a sign of some sort of danger in the atmosphere?
No, it's a sign of low clouds over a big city
with old, aging orange lights.
Cleveland, in other words.
I thought it was a sign of snow.
The glowing rust belt.
Yeah, it glows orange, like the color of rust
and the hearts of its people.
Rust color.
Are you sure you may not want to take...
slower breaths once you leave the building, however?
Slower breaths?
Well, you know, it's funny.
We were just talking on the way down here.
We were passing the ancient ruins
of the universities and museums,
which they fixed up.
You know, they sandblasted.
Those things had turned black.
Those ancient buildings from the 1700s,
Cleveland or whatever,
had turned black.
And from the...
pollution of the steel mill days
when we were prosperous here.
And then they got sandblasted carefully.
And now they're all white,
but they're still ruins
full of students
whose minds are in ruins.
Some of them.
Little enclaves of houses
that had little actual yards in them
in the front and stuff
are now enclosed in weird iron bars
and strange fortifications
so they can keep on having a party
in a place where there are no more...
parties.
Except for the Robitussin party
of the egalitarian empire.
That's an actual trade name,
so it was just a...
Those were some great parties.
I used to get invited to those,
but, you know,
just over the years,
you stop getting invited
to the young people's parties.
Yeah.
Once your cough is incurable...
Oh, Reverend Sam,
you can't make it with your cough?
Oh, we're so sorry.
Sorry, you can't make it,
Reverend Stan.
You weren't invited anyway.
Remember the old days
when the hippies used to smoke,
what is it,
nitrous...
Neutrogena.
Neutrogena.
As a scrub or as a bomb.
Either way, they would drink it.
They'd scrub it and drink it
and bomb it.
With a marijuana.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Marijuana.
Marijuana is the fuse
and Neutrogena is the bomb.
Bum, bum, bum, boom.
Bum, bum, bum.
Oh, our music in the background,
by the way, friends,
is a tune or something
called The Lotus Eaters
by Cult of Zere,
also known as our friend Dr. Zeronius.
Praise Dr. Zeronius.
On one later on, he sings.
Praise the name Lotus Eaters.
But it's got a filter.
We're on.
It's a kid in a car.
It's a...
It's a...
So I hope he doesn't say anything cuss-worthy
because this is a live show
broadcast from the studios
of WCSB Cleveland,
but not necessarily
what you're listening to right now
because we do send the show
to other stations,
worthy stations.
To fruits and animals of all time,
to reptilians and creatures of magma,
and those,
those who live in the atmosphere
as tiny little spherical atmospheric spheres.
And we also have our own fears
for as you look below,
the sky is not only orange,
but the ground and all of the pavement
and all covered with an orange slime.
It's quite tasty, though,
if you don't mind the acerbic reaction
at the beginning.
The tang.
You show it while you feel your tongue dissipate,
and you're not even in the air.
The cloydus,
your bambus,
like your interruptus,
will also fade into the...
What's that smell in here?
It's been nice knowing you, Dave,
now that we all turn orange,
slowly but surely.
Our clothes,
our skin,
our eyes.
Caution.
Caution.
Eardrums.
Caution.
Caution.
We're becoming fully orange now.
Or orange, you glad I didn't say orange.
Aren't you happy?
We can live among the citrus fruit
and still survive.
Others have passed this way
and have not crossed the river.
But we shall.
We shall.
We shall.
We shall.
We shall.
Shall.
Shall.
Yes.
Yes.
Screw you, pumpkin.
It's all a bunch of lies.
Can't you tell?
Look at his eyelids.
Look at his eyelids.
Can't you see that thing hanging down there?
Ew.
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's...
You ain't gonna cross no rivers dressed like that, boy.
Now, hit your pants up
and get your boots on
and cross the dang river.
I see the other side, my friends.
I can smell the other side.
I can smell the other side of that river.
Bob's on the other side of that river.
And he's toking up on his Borkham Riff
or whatever he smokes.
It's not marijuana.
Everybody thinks that.
It's some kind of cheap, horrible-smelling pipe tobacco.
He gets it at Walgreens.
Very, very smelly.
Yeah, awful.
You can, but you know it's Bob.
That's the way you know.
You can smell him coming.
He's not coming.
I don't smell him.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Will thou come unto us
and deliver us sucor and slack
as promised on page four, paragraph 19,
indentation number three, B.
The subgenius must have slack.
After all, that's what this is all about, isn't it?
Bob!
Oh, Bob's not listening.
Who cares?
Why am I sitting here muttering to myself?
Hmm.
Good.
Bad, bad.
Now, little fella, you're not muttering to yourself.
You're muttering to the world at random.
Yes, to a listenership of at least 15 people.
What does it say on the, uh...
Oh, actually, we have a high number.
We have a record high number of internet listeners.
That's odd.
Princess Wee, it's your fault, isn't it?
It is.
Princess Wee said on Facebook.
See, she's on Facebook.
I'm not.
But she is.
And she's very much on Facebook.








And popular.
And I have no brain waves currently.
No, no ones that I have to declare.
So there.
I am powerless in the face of Facebook.
I'm smooth as a baby's arm.
How are the words forming?
Well, someone else is maybe doing it.
No, that's not really such a bad idea.
No.
It's a happy, happy, happy way to go.
Let's examine those undershores one more time.
Trooping, siding, windows.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.

I'm not ready.


I'm not ready.
Roofing, siding, windows.
Roofing, siding, windows.
And that's what we're all about here at the Hour of Slack, friends.
Roofing, siding, windows and lonesome cowboy Dave.
This is the psycho skeletons heard in the background with the song, Roofing, Siding, Windows.
And it had enveloped our Dave.
You have to do something.
You have to think of Bob Dobbs.
And when you were speaking out so clearly about your desire for succor and volum.
Yeah, succor.
I'm a sucker for succor.
Succor and lollipops.
We have to furthermore think of Bob as a form of structural canopy under which we can hide
our vices and virtues and live in virtual mental squalor.
We have to remember that all around there's closets full of suitcases that don't belong
to us.
And if we poke around in the wrong one.
Who knows?
A dog sniffing drug could explode in our underpants.
Once again reducing us to the same level of...
Of zombie-ism.
Because that's what happens when you go sneaking around looking at other people's luggage.
You turn into a zombie.
And that's what all the freemason camps are all about.
At least as I've heard.
They are building thousands of freemason camps around the city.


center of the universe so as to sexploit, or in other words, disengorge the human race
of its most valuable and least valuable vacuum.
Wow.
But that's okay, because Gregory, the cockroach will come and save us.
Well, I'm going to try and be one of the cockroaches.
Somehow.
I've got to fix it in.
I've got a scrawny, weird little face with big, huge buggy eyes.
You can see both directions at the same time, different angles.
Yeah.
La cucaracha.
No, no.
No, no, no, senor.
El cucaracho.
Con nariz rojo.
Equipo de partita.
The loudness of this music is a puzzling evidence to me.
The music.
The music is, likewise, by Purple Johnson Blimp Situation.
It is a piece called Gregory the Cockroach.
Well, why did he have to have such a funny name?
What was the name of this band again?
Gregory the Cockroach.
No, it's the Purple Something Experiment.
Oh, the name of the band is Purple Johnson Blimp Situation.
Duh, everybody, where have you been, Dave?
I didn't know you were talking about Gregor Samsa, who awoke one morning to find himself
transformed into some sort of monstrous German.
No wonder it's Gregory the Cockroach.
Yeah.
Yeah, see, that's a literary.
That's one of your literary references.
Like when that Rainmaker's Guide where it says me and J.D. Salinger were sitting on the porch or whatever.
You know, it's like a show that you're smart enough to read a fancy book.
Like Molotov-Kovka or one of them other famous writers.
Remember Molotov-Kovka?
The famous Japanese-American angstist wrote angst novels about people that turned into little Pokemons and stuff.
It's horrible. It's scary.
I thought you were talking about Professor Mitch Kaku, who claims that if you look at yourself,
whether disguised as Gregor Samsa were, the cockroach...
eyeball person, himself, or another individual, doesn't matter.
When you look in the mirror, you're seeing yourself one billionth of a second later than when you actually are seeing yourself because of the speed of light.
Go figure it out, man. I dare you.
See, you think you're bobbing on me.
That sounds like...
Because you're described that you don't know all the science and stuff about paleolithic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's talking all that time control stuff.
This is Dr. Zier in the background. Dr. Zieronius.
Wow.
Singing.
Listen.
Beautiful voice.
It didn't sound...
Back to guitar keyboard with a fuzz drill and an apocalyptic ending.
Yeah, I don't know how they do that stuff.
Actually, his sound machine is homemade, self-constructed, and has all manner of little toys inside that work,
along with the electronics that make the bent, twisted music of cult of Zier.
I know this because I've seen he actually performed at X-Day at least once,
and also at the Portland Devival.
We first saw his box of weird tricks.
Then there's Gadgetto, the band in Portland.
It's a one-man band.
He's got a wooden box with four or five tape recorders,
gold cassette decks in it, bolted inside the box, and they only run loops,
maybe 10-second long loops.
And he just drops one little cassette of loops after another into each of the five cassette boxes
and runs them in different...
...sets.
...somewhat planned ways.
That is the music of Gadgetto, as not heard here.
Although they're both in Portland.
Dr. Zeronius and Gadgetto both live in the benighted city of Portland,
which, by the way, has the highest rate of methamphetamine-related burglaries and theft.
I just wanted to let people know that because those Portland snark people like to brag about,
they're just as good as the people who have the most money.

So, I'm from Portland.
We're so painfully hip here.
So utterly painfully Starbuckianly hip.
Then I'd like to point out they actually have a higher rate, much, much higher crime rate
than, say, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
Not to be confused with East Cleveland or Downtown Cleveland.
Or Cleveland Loads.
Loads?
Is that what they call the lowlands around there?
There's Cleveland Heights.
And Cleveland Loads.
It's mostly Loads.
Yes.
Yes.
It's mostly Cleveland Loads.
Especially with the Sheep Lady and the mass spanking, I would be willing to measure,
at least in a fathom or two, that most of the listless listeners around there,
throughout the land, have never heard of the Sheep Lady, which lived on Euclid Avenue,
on your way to, no, the one adjacent, the one right next over, not Lake Sheep.
I had a friend that lived right next to the Sheep Lady.
You know of the Sheep Lady?
Yes, I do know of the Sheep Lady.
There was a lady that was raising sheeps.
The talk-on girl.
That ain't like Pig Man, is it?
No.
Not like Pig Man?
These were actual, very dirty sheep.
And there were things like Arby's and McDonald's right next door to where her sheep farm was.
That's terrible.
There was some little glitch in the law going back to the days of the 1790s and
now it's a little bit different.









And Moses Cleveland, what a wonderful man he was as far as the Native Americans are concerned.
But anyway, I can't get away from that.
And there was some sort of clause that a woman could, not a woman, but that anyone could
have a sheep pasture.
You couldn't have cows anymore.
We're a city now.
We can't.
But there she was right in the city limits with a sheep pasture.
And she had the Bo Peep weird stick thing with the, you know, with the, you know.
Yeah.
It was wild.
Yeah.
She had the full-
She was more like a babushka looking lady.
Yes.
But she was still 107.
Yes.
She looked like a yogurt commercial.
Mm-hmm.
And she fought the law and the law won.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
The law won and she got to keep her sheep farm right up there next to the McDonald's
and the Arby's.
And then finally the law of nature won and the sheep farm got moved to another
dimension.
Yeah.
That's some funny stuff, right guys?
And now that sheep farm lives in the twilight zone, are you saying?
No, I haven't seen her.
I thought she disappeared.
Poof.
Just like that.
Like a magic spell, a puff of smoke.
But the sheep are still there.
And they're voting.
And they're what?
They call each other sheeple all day long.
You're all a bunch of sheeple.
Meh.
I don't know.













I don't care about you.
You're just a bunch of sheeple.
They're all saying that.
I know.
Thousands and thousands of them, especially on talk radio and internet forums.
All the sheeple are so blind.
They haven't pulled the wool off of their own eyes.
I'm blind too, but at least it's my wool.
That's what the subgenius kook says actually.
It is.



















It's nice and warm and very pleasant.
Well, I could certainly not test that because that's what I hear seeing coming and going,
man.
And I wish that that had never been, because like 20 years ago when you said you're all
sheeple, that was kind of semi-funny back then.
First time I ever heard it was Chaz said it.
Yeah.
In this chair right here.
Yeah, I told her.
It was some shortwave radio program that was out there warning the people of the government
takeover of their guns.
And I told him and we listened to it one night and he called everyone sheeple.
And then he caught on.
He was some sort of a megalomaniac from Texas.
Who are you talking about?
Alex Jones or Ivan Stang?
One of those crazy- Early day Alex Jones.
Perhaps one of Alex Jones' heroes.
Uh-huh.
Right.
An early sheeple accuser.
Yeah.
When people would listen to shortwave radio.
I was listening to it on the radio because not everything was available on the internet.
Well, you know how it really started, how that whole thing started out, that sheeple
thing?
It was a bad rip off of Princess Wee's rant routine where she would go, wake up, sleeple.
She called him sleeple.
That was her word.
And Alex Jones and his people heard that.
They went, oh, wake up, sheeple.
That's real clever.
No, it was the original was wake up, sleeple.
So they stole from women.


Wee.
Quickly tide down
Very good.
Re- lean properly, and did you see what she did to that sheep?
She didn't.


Things that don't think are real-
A thing thatallah does.

전 acute weak pulled out that's wrong.


so that we could say that we and I, we, we, we?
We, we.
We, we.
So, yeah, I thought that it was all.
And then there's the people who call her Princess Wei.
That's how you know they never heard the hour of slack, not even once.
They're way off.
Yeah, they're way off.
Because we say, we!
And also what they're doing is they're pronouncing it like Feng Shui or something,
or Shu-i or, here's your, uh.
I like to, yeah, Sheng-Fui is what I say.
I'd like to, I'll lay some Sheng-Fui on this room here.
I'll lay your guts and black soil and your red, blue, snitching, scabby eye oil.
You know I'm going to do it right now.
Sorry.
It's good that we're all weighing in on this.
No, I have to we in pretty soon.
You have to we in?
I have to we on in a minute.
If we, if this showed an end.
In pretty soon.
Actually, I'm okay.
I took care of that.
That's why I had the half hour of recorded stuff on first.
So I knew I was going to have to.
Keep running back and forth.
Keep running, yes.
Keep the water running.
It's just, I'm happy.
As long as it's running, I'm not going to complain.
It's when it backs up, that's when you've got to worry.
Rush to the hospital and form a new relationship with the nurse.
As my dad put it.
To my head.
To my head.
Under duress.
Did we give all the credits?
This music in the background just now has been Einstein's secret orchestra.
And that was Dave himself you heard playing the guitar.
And Chaz Smith's organly music.
And Michelle George on violins.
Back in the days when everything was.
Robert Mosick on percussion.
Right, Bob, the real Bob on percussion.
The real Bob.
Yep.
Then were the days when everybody was happy and healthy.
And nobody was dead.
And we all had.
We didn't have any more money than we do now.
But it sure went a lot further.
Yep.
You could get five cups of coffee for $500 then.
That's not the only thing that's inflated nowadays.
You should see my feet from walking around in the snow.
They're as big as balloons.
Dave, if you've been walking around in the snow barefoot again to be cool.
It's not really.
Just because everybody's doing it doesn't mean it's that.
Cool, man.
Wake up, sleeper.
I've just seen so many people, as if zombies, as if actual sleeper, walking around in the snow.
And I know some of them don't have houses.
And I don't.
Warm up, Friesel.
Because it makes me sad.
And that's for real.
So I better go back to the character.
It is sad because none of us know how long we'll be under roofs with a heater.
It's really.
It's really sad.
It's scary.
Yeah.
Think of people that don't have a cover.
Things sure have changed since them days of witch disco.
We'd get a pizza and there'd be little golden rings that were hidden by the pizza.
No, I'm sorry.
Golden rings hidden in pizza.
We're out now.
Things have changed, yes.
Well, we knew that was going to happen.
It all came true just according to what we were predicting.
We said it was going to be.
Bob said it was going to be a bummer.
He said that.
And people did.
Some people didn't pick up on it.
But was Bob right or what?
Yeah, Bob was right.
It was going to be a bummer.
It did turn into a bummer.
Yeah, Bob and the Buddha.
But I'm not going to let it bum me out.
No, sir.
Because I'm a man of Bob.
I have faith in Bob.
I keep up the FIB.
It's harder to keep the FIB up when you're my age.
But by golly, I try.
With the help of Bob.
Bob.

Bob.
Bob.
Bob.





Bob.


And to keep up the FIB.
I mean the FIB.
The faith in Bob.
Yeah.
No grander scheme could have ever been exposed under plundered eyes.
That's what they used to say back in the cowboy days.
After the conquistadors got there, that's when guys like Bob started popping up all around the place.
Of course, there's only one.
Of course.
One true Bob.
Yeah.
The salesman.
Now, friends, Bob's going to sell you the greatest story ever told.
The greatest joke ever told.
If Earth can make it to the punchline.
And you can help.
But how?
Well, that's up to you.
But you can get some hints if you want to look at subgenius.com.
Which, by the way, if you poke on the radio link, you can download every previous episode of this show going back to number 200 or so.
But you really have to look.
Now, we have to go.
Because I'm going to play a song, a love song, to Bob pretty soon here.
They can often listen to live shows on WCSB 89.3 FM in Cleveland, too.
Just by going to, downloading the show and listening to it and grumbling and throwing crackers at the kitten.
Well, that's WCSB.org.
Archives the shows for like a week.
A week or so.
But subgenius.com archives the subgenius shows forever and ever and ever.
Well, if not subgenius.com, David Bauchner does anyway.
Praise Reverend St. Bauchner.
I have never, ever thrown crackers at a kitten.
No, you ain't lived, honey.
You don't learn nothing.
For all of the people of my village here.
You know, it's the only entranceway.
The icon.
The son of Bob.
Adorned state.
Tampa V.
The distance.
The front.
Front of the queue.
And, uh, what do you think?
Maybe we'll enjoy it.
They call him Bob.
Sick, walking sick and gold watch Bob.
Every other dude looks like a slob.
Compared to Bob.
Bob.
They call me Bob.
Just looking good.
That's my whole job.
When I split down the street, I draw a mob.
They follow Bob.
Bob.
Now, everybody.
Everybody wants to have a job.
With the one and only.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.

They call me Bob.
Ma'am.
Bob.
He makes the lady's hearts all throb.
You could always hear some poor girl's song.
On the radio.
Bob.
On the radio.
Bob.


W-O-W!
Woo!

Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
Woo.
You're welcome.
