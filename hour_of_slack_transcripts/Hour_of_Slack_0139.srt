1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,340
It did not satisfy me because my daughter still has to walk by the same vacant houses with the same drug users in those same houses.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,200
In those same houses with the same drug users.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,380
They can beat you around the bush till you're just dead.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,480
Just dead. Dead.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,020
And as long as we let them keep beating us around this same bush, we will be dead.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,240
We will be dead.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:55,720
We will be dead.

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:07,500
We will be dead.

9
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,320
You're dead as a beaver hat, but you're dead as a beaver hat.

10
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,040
They're gonna think you're insane.

11
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,720
These people want to hypnotize us into cutting their brains out with chainsaws.

12
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:56,680
I mean, if people psychically will us to beat their ass, I don't see how we're responsible.

13
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,980
I mean, if they will just go...

14
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,760
It's a subgenius boot camp.

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,340
Drinking coffee and staying awake?

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,380
Stand up there!

17
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
Here, stand out in the rain.

18
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,640
Here, have some, here, have some old Bob Cologne.

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
Do you call yourself a subgenius coming to drill with a beard?

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,480
That's two demerits.

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,260
Alright, Mr. Hughes.

22
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,440
Three more demerits and I'll get that new baseball glove.

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,500
Look at the knees of your uniform pants.

24
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,640
That's disgusting. I'm docking you five more demerits, Mr. Hester.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,100
Oh gosh, gosh, your new car!

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
What are you smiling about?

27
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,200
I hate Bob.

28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,400
My...

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,140
Bob...

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,780
made my daddy go crazy.

31
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,200
My daddy used to make money, but now he just sits around all day.

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,660
Hmph.

33
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,140
I hate Bob. He's a bad man. I wish he would die.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,020
Who's part of the conspiracy?

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,400
I shouldn't have been busy. You've just been bad.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:52,820
It would appear that the government at the moment is practicing a lot of this religion in absentia for many folks.

37
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,100
It was a trendy thing.

38
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,840
Well, we're actually the conspiracy...

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,060
You've always heard of the conspiracy, right?

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,460
Yeah.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,400
Well, we're the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,900
We've decided to come out in the open.

43
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,080
You're the unnamed source.

44
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,280
That's us.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,960
One of them. Well, you've certainly heard of the Public Criminization Society.

46
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:25,940
...and now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures and to bring back to normalcy and a state of perfection any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation of matter, any given plane, any given depth.

47
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,500
I can easily do anything that I want to do.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,980
I can.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,720
I can.

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,660
I'm a winner.

51
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:44,040
Pursuant to Section 28A, Article 4B, Paragraph 2 of the Internal Security Regulations, I now hand over to you rejected application number 578293B021.

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,080
And he fell white on his face.

53
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,180
Hey, when am I going to get paid?

54
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:50,880
Shut up.

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,120
I hate myself and I hate everyone else.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,680
I'm not done yet.

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,100
Can you hear me?

58
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,300
What the heck is going on out here anyway?

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,580
I need to talk to Bob.

60
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,140
Bob.

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:00,760
Bob.

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,560
Bob.

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,380
Bob.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,480
Bob.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh, yes.

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:19,200
Dear friends, this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,660
The voice of the church of the subgenius.

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:33,420
Actually, since we're on K and O N 89.3 FM, I should say it's the voice of the people.

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,540
But in the case of the subgeniuses, it just, I'm sorry, it just ain't the people.

70
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,760
I mean, the people would probably burn us at the stake for what we say between the lines.

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,340
And they, well, I love the people, but we ain't kidding ourselves.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,140
It's, it's, uh, of course it doesn't really have anything to do with any, you can't put

73
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,280
your finger on what makes a subgenius.

74
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,220
You really can't.

75
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,680
There is absolutely, you can't tell by looking at them.

76
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,860
Can't tell by talking to them on the phone.

77
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,760
You, it takes, it takes several weeks of working with somebody oftentimes before you know whether

78
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,720
they are or not a subgenius.

79
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,020
Of course, very few people are geniuses.

80
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,140
And technically, I suppose anybody could qualify for the post of subgenius.

81
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,920
But, uh, I don't know.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,280
It just, the way it's worked out, just the way it's worked out, it hadn't been that way.

83
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,040
I mean, they, it's a mystery, dear friends.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
And it can be scary.

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,620
In fact, it's so scary.

86
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,200
We haven't been able to work very hard on this show lately.

87
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,620
There aren't enough subgeniuses in the world, you know.

88
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,300
There's just all these pinks of various, all colors, uh, you know.

89
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,400
But they're pinks, you know.

90
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,920
They're soul.

91
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,740
They're chameleon lizard soul.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,560
Which pink?

93
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,560
It's a pink soul.

94
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,760
And they, they make us work for a living.

95
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,740
I hate that.

96
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,520
Don't you?

97
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,060
Don't you hate that whole working for a living thing?

98
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,440
Isn't that just...

99
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,840
I just hate that.

100
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,020
But, well, I mean, sometimes it's fun.

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,760
It can be great.

102
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,060
I mean, for lucky people.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,660
And I've been lucky, actually.

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Uh, I've been...

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,480
Well, we may get to that later.

106
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,940
I'm just gonna play old reruns.

107
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,700
That's right, friends.

108
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,180
This is another rerun show.

109
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,060
But I don't think any of you have heard any of this material.

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,560
A lot of it, actually, is from the media barrage tape.

111
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,260
Uh, number 10.

112
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,500
Repent, quit your job, and slack off.

113
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,660
But...

114
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,820
Not many of you in Dallas have that.

115
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,360
I know.

116
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,820
I've checked.

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,840
I mean, we have our computers.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,060
And we're hooked in with the police computers.

119
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,260
And we can tell, you know, how many of you have actually pledged money to the show.

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,480
So, uh, with that, I will just leave you.

121
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,540
Huh.

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:19,560


123
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:21,760


124
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:22,880
Bye.

125
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,380
Bye.

126
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,600
Bye.

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:23,880
Bye.

128
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,160
Bye.

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,300
Bye.

130
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,740
Bye.

131
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:24,860
Bye.

132
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,000
Bye.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,320
Bye.

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,380
Bye.

135
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,380


136
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,980
Bye.

137
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,880
There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices, to be found only in

138
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,760
the minds of men.

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,720
There is no typical subgenius.

140
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,600
There's no profile subgenius.

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,320
The subgenius is the person who is an outsider, who has been different somewhere or another

142
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,180
since birth.

143
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,180
A person who was born with slack.

144
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
And we're all born with slack.

145
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Original slack.

146
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,860
Original slack.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,220
But the conspiracy, the conspiracy of normalcy, really, is what it is.

148
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,600
It takes it away from the minute you are born.

149
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,760
They give you that first whack on your behind to make you cry.

150
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,120
From that moment on, they're taking away your slack.

151
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,820
He was alive one minute.

152
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,460
Then he was dead.

153
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,020
Why not?

154
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,100
The mother got a woman.

155
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


156
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


157
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


158
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


159
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


160
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,800
What do they have?

161
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,320
Catch-22.

162
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
That's right.

163
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,100
You're all fired.

164
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,780
You can kill yourself, Hoff, or not.

165
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,340
It don't make no difference.

166
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,040
There's nothing you can do about it.

167
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,580
All right.

168
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:47,640
We're going to win.

169
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,640


170
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,700
It's gonna be a great day, mate.

171
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


172
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


173
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


174
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


175
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


177
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


179
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


180
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


181
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


183
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


184
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


185
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,700


186
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,720
Go, go.

187
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:47,720


188
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:47,720


189
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,460
Faceless surgeons are new razors

190
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,320
Cut out our imagination

191
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,260
Yes, they creep up on you.

192
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,960
Conspiracy bugs.

193
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,540
Conspiracy bugs, they creep up on you, don't they?

194
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,380
They breed fast, don't you see?

195
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,400
And also, they don't need much to live on.

196
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,220
Just a constant supply of mindless entertainment

197
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,020
and food and false slack.

198
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,880
That's all they need.

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,380
And false slack is so much easier to get than real slack, my friend.

200
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,760
So much easier.

201
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
All you have to do is work a 9-to-5 job

202
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,780
or, you know, the equivalent, whatever you do.

203
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,260
It doesn't have to be a 9.

204
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,860
You can be your own boss, entrepreneur, help, whatever.

205
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,700
It doesn't matter how you get the money.

206
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,740
But the money can buy, can...

207
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,240
False slack can only be had for money.

208
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,920
True slack can be had for money.

209
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:14,660
But you've got to have a slack awareness, my friend.

210
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,100
More than you need money.

211
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,380
More than you need money.

212
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,380


213
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,380


214
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
You don't need money.

215
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,500
You don't have to have money to have true slack.

216
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
And that is the God's turn.

217
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,880
Oh, no.

218
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,900
I'm dreaming.

219
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520
None of this is true.

220
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,020
They don't know that this is a conspiracy.

221
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,380
This is for real.

222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,020
They're agnostic.

223
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,640
They don't know.

224
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,100
They have to see it in front of them before they go.

225
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,520
They have to see it.

226
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,380
And even then, they don't know.

227
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,380


228
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,040
They deny it.

229
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,940
The thing is that these people are real.

230
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,740
And the pinks are the ones who actually do not exist.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,020
Because they're not awake enough to actually have consciousness.

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,020
They haven't turned into a dog yet.

233
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,280
They're just things.

234
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,240
They're tubes to be filled with video images.

235
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,060
They're shadows.

236
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,300
They're spirits.

237
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,380
But they're not real.

238
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,000
By recreating body and mind out of remembered fragments,

239
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,380
I was to program...

240
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,940
my own inferno.

241
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,020
Good God.

242
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,820
Well, he certainly lost his mind.

243
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,220
Listen.

244
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,740
In effect,

245
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,980
my soul was a monstrous cancer.

246
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,800
Continually creating within itself the means of my destruction.

247
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,500
A lost soul is one that no longer controls its own circuitry.

248
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,420
The goddess has been taken over by the enemy,

249
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,260
which uses it to destroy me.

250
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,180
To destroy you.

251
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,880
The sensation is like spontaneous combustion.

252
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,840
Ah, I should have taken it off the hook.

253
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,560
Oh, let it ring.

254
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,900
And you'd take a message, would you?

255
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,440
And leave it off the hook?

256
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Yeah, okay, okay. I'll get it.

257
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,900
Go on, Linda.

258
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,660
Go on.

259
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,600
It is this control of the circuitry,

260
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,860
this ability to send phantom signals

261
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,400
to work.

262
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,640
To send real bodies through their remembered images.

263
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,520
Like pins stuck in a doll.

264
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,000
That gives hell its power on earth.

265
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,480
Hell is not a place,

266
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,040
but a system for disrupting the plans of God.

267
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,640
She thinks you can cure the world by kindness and rules.

268
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,600
But it's too small.

269
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,600
The Lord's Prayer on a pinhead.

270
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,960
Some make rules,

271
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,120
some obey.

272
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,800
But the rules are for the fools,

273
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,220
is what I say.

274
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,340
The system makes me sick.

275
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,080
I wear the wrong clothes.

276
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,700
I ask the wrong things.

277
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,540
You know I can't dance,

278
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,700
my feet are much too wide.

279
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,520
You think he sets the trends.

280
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,060
You wear your head this way.

281
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,700
Your clothes are out of sight.

282
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,960
Your house is modern, really kitsch.

283
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,040
You get so macho when you're with your bitch.

284
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,100
I see them go to work.

285
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
I see them go to sleep.

286
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,300
I see them on TV.

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
I see them laughing.

288
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,340
I see them laughing black.

289
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,780
I'm on the outside.

290
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,600
I'm on the outside.

291
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm on the outside.

292
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,220
And if you're on the outside, dear friends,

293
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,540
just look around you and reach for your telephone and call.

294
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,680
You can call the subgenius hour of slack radio ministry,

295
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,480
if you dare,

296
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,820
at 823-7490.

297
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
Our phones are working again.

298
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,100
The will of Dobbs is ready to infect your mind.

299
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
Yes, just wait.

300
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:02,840
Just call 823-7490 and see what happens when the will of Dobbs insinuates itself into your

301
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,180
cerebrum, into the wrinkles on the top of your little mushy brain.

302
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,700
You know, it's nothing but an organ, just a piece of guts.

303
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,780
You've got a bunch of electricity running through it, a bunch of blood.

304
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:14,780


305
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,780
You've got a bunch of chemical reactions going on there.

306
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,660
Big deal.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,900
Big deal.

308
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,700
You can afford to...

309
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,920
You've messed it up before, haven't you?

310
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,660
Most of you.

311
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,560
I bet you have.

312
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
The nice people out there probably bonked their heads a few times.

313
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,820
Well, go ahead and call them.

314
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,700
823-7490.

315
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,900
It's something that hadn't happened before.

316
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,620
It may scramble a few circuitries here and there.

317
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,660
And, of course, you can call to find more information about the Church of the Subgenius.

318
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:44,760
I'm Bob Duff.

319
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:44,760


320
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,060
I'm Bob Duff.

321
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,340
And find out what number to write for free information.

322
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,380
Rude clerks in stores that hate their job and take it out on you.

323
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,740
The thing about the normals is that they're not going to pay you.

324
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:14,740


325
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:23,280
They conceptualize themselves to be hot sinus effluvia on silver platters, but in reality

326
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,780
reveal themselves to be cold mucus encrustation on a paper plate.

327
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,060
But that's the way religion is.

328
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,880
It's been a constant battle since the very beginning.

329
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:40,080
The first man to try to guess why he climbed out of the slime was the first man to pick

330
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,680
up a stick and hit his brother.

331
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,100
We've been programmed.

332
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,720
We've been programmed.

333
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,280
We've been programmed.

334
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,900
We've been programmed.

335
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,180
This is the very beginning.

336
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,100
Our slack was taken away the moment we entered this world-weary treadmill, and we've been

337
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,460
running like little rats through a maze.

338
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,420
And the only way you can get away from that is to deprogram.

339
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,400
Edit your own memory.

340
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,840
Take those bad memories.

341
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,460
Take those horrible training regimens that you were subjected to as a youth.

342
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,300
Flush them down the toilet as you excrementate.

343
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,100
Let me ask you.

344
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,280
Let me ask you.

345
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,820
Yes, Sister?

346
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,720
Yes, Sister?

347
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,440
Did you ever own a guinea pig?

348
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,140
I ate my guinea pigs!

349
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,080
I grew them and I ate them!

350
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,200
That's dick-crazy Bob!

351
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,760
They were food!

352
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm a carnivore!

353
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,620
I can't help myself!

354
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,720
My kids need flat poop.

355
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,960
Doctor, doctor, here.

356
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,880
Take some more of this.

357
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,680
Have some of that.

358
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,980
Maybe the show will finish and we'll get to make another tape.

359
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,700
Oh no, more prescriptions again!

360
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,720
I don't know if I can get through this.

361
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


362
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


363
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


364
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


365
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


366
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


367
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


368
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


369
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


370
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


371
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


372
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:44,720


373
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,400
I can't keep up with all these prescriptions and all these callers and all these fake shows.

374
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,420
Oh my god, this is a genius thing.

375
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,440
It's more than actual.

376
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,100
Just take the pills, Doctor.

377
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,660
I can't.

378
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,200
I mean, man, I don't think I can keep up with it.

379
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,220
I mean, it's like there's too much of it.

380
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,300
There's these letters that come in the mail, these weird magazines, these characters that

381
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,500
show up at the door.

382
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,000
Doctor, take your medication.

383
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,600
They're like bobbies.

384
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,260
Doctor.

385
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,700
They want to know things.

386
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,680
They want to know how to run their lives.

387
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,680
What should I do?

388
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,460
What am I saying about this?

389
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,840
About my girlfriend?

390
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,960
My girlfriend doesn't want me to worship.

391
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,800
What should I do?

392
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,320
What should I do, man?

393
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,460
That's what I want to know.

394
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,200
Relax, Doctor.

395
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,960
I'll tell you what you should do.

396
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,420
It's like, Doctor, you should do this.

397
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,280
No head launching, Doctor.

398
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,980
Oh.

399
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,040
Take the pills.

400
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,820
Oh.

401
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,460
Light the fire.

402
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,540
I'm a carnivore.

403
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:42,980
I can't keep up with this.

404
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:42,980


405
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:42,980


406
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:42,980


407
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:42,980


408
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:42,980


409
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,600
Oh, try some of this false slack.

410
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,640
But we can't talk about that because it would leave this station open to libel and slavery.

411
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,440
That's our lawyer now.

412
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,360
Oh my God, he's here.

413
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,660
Hey, I feel much better now.

414
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,140
Oh, man.

415
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,260
That's because Bob sent this for you.

416
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,940
These normal soles are amazing.

417
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,700
You can drink them.

418
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:12,960
You're welcome.

419
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,660
You can smoke them, you can eat them.

420
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't know, who knows what you can do.

421
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,900
You can even snort them.

422
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,560
I'm rubbing one up under my gums.

423
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,800
I'm gonna try a line of this human soul here if you'll excuse me now.

424
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,480
Now that's what I call soul.

425
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,640
Let me try some of that.

426
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,040
Jesus, that must have been a fairly intelligent normal.

427
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,980
Oh no, that wasn't a normal, that was...

428
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,980
God, I think I got some of his memories off of that.

429
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,660
How?

430
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,940
Yeah, it's like I'm seeing this little woman in the 40s, just for a second.

431
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,620
It's probably the guy's mom.

432
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,700
Yeah?

433
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,600
God, you can snort their souls and these little primal memories come in.

434
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,340
You've just gotta give them final unction and dry them out first.

435
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,840
Okay.

436
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,660
God, how long have you guys known about this?

437
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,280
I mean, was this something the Indians had down there?

438
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,800
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:34,100
It's too rainy to light a fire to smoke a soul a lot of times, so they just, uh, they dry it and keep it with volcanic rock as an absorbent.

440
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,380
And they just grind it up and...

441
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
They just snort it through huge, huge canes.

442
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,900
But they didn't have the technology to extract souls. I mean, how'd they get them under pressure? How'd they get them into the canisters?

443
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:53,380
They don't do it that way. They just feed them the right amount of herbs and plants and the soul just drips out of the nasal and anal and...

444
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:53,580
You're kidding!

445
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,620
No, it just...

446
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Why can't we do that?

447
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,380
We can if we got the right pills.

448
00:19:59,220 --> 00:19:59,620
But...

449
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,080
It's kind of, you know, it's all organic. I mean, you know, there's two ways you can extract. You go high technology...

450
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,660
Or you can go with just kerosene and a couple of guys with bare hands.

451
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,260
Why did Bob set up these extraction machines? I mean, what's with these emaculators?

452
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:22,860
Well, all you gotta do is you dig a little pit. You dig a little pit in the ground, you line it with plastic, peg down with wood, and then you put the body in.

453
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,020
A normal, right?

454
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,360
Yeah.

455
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,500
Any normal?

456
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,100
Any normal.

457
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,240
Any normal that isn't dead yet. The stole is still in him, right?

458
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,580
Uh-huh.

459
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,080
Okay, then you cover him with kerosene and acetone.

460
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,060
And then you just do it.

461
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:45,000
You jump up and down on him until it turns kind of green and thick. Then you remove him, strain the liquid, then you boil it, and you add sulfuric acid.

462
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,220
But then there's some kind of ritualistic... I mean, what actually causes the transmutation?

463
00:20:51,920 --> 00:21:01,840
Well, there's a group of people around the pit adding a psychic element of the alchemy, you see. That's... They concentrate.

464
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,540
Oh, yeah, because they don't have the soul amplifier.

465
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,160
Right. So it's just done with psychic methods.

466
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,560
Oh, man.

467
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
And then, after it's boiled...

468
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,680
God, that's incredible.

469
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,860
After it's boiled, they add...

470
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,880
There's a bunch of Brazilian tribal jungle people...

471
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:23,740
And Bolivians. And Bolivians. Both. They both do it. And the lowlands on both sides there. And then you boil... They boil the soul. They actually boil the soul.

472
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,800
Little combo souls.

473
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:34,200
Yeah. They boil... And little coya souls, too, you know? And they boil them. And then when it starts to thicken, they add another liquid. It's some kind of corrosive, I believe.

474
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,520
And then it turns into a...

475
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:43,480
It turns into a thick white paste, and they just spread the soul out into the sun, and it dries. And then you just have to chop it up.

476
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,800
They'd probably think we were idiots for crystallizing them and compressing them.

477
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,640
Yeah. I mean, it's...

478
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,900
I mean, it probably doesn't cost them... You know, it costs them a couple of necklaces or, you know, a taper.

479
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,020
Well, they don't need electricity to do it.

480
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Their pet taper.

481
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,000
Yeah. Well, it...

482
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,400
The most expense they've got. And it costs us a hundred grand a year to keep these things pumping.

483
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,820
Well, you see, we use a lot of...

484
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,540
And not to mention the bodies and the souls and getting rid of...

485
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,400
Yeah. Well, that's the thing. See, the body dissolves...

486
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,000
...storing them.

487
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,700
The body dissolves in the solution completely.

488
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
Well, do you do up the body, too?

489
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,120
No. They just strain it out with a solid waste.

490
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,980
What do they do with that?

491
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,460
With that?

492
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,420
They put it on the...

493
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:30,280
Do they press it into little cakes and burn it? Like, for fires and stuff like that? They usually give it back to the guy's family.

494
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,240
How come the... How come they... How come that this was...

495
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,920
Like, how come the Western civilization didn't discover that?

496
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
Well, you see, it's because...

497
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,000
How come they haven't been ripped off yet? How come we didn't rip them off?

498
00:22:46,200 --> 00:23:00,720
Well, because we can pay for soul and get it a lot cheaper from them than doing it up here because, you know, like down there, nobody complains if you go through four or five hundred bodies in one night. You know, you can sit around and smoke all the soul you want to.

499
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,680
Yeah, I guess it would be kind of questionable to...

500
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:02,820
That's right.

501
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,220
...questionable to...

502
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,980
They got a lot more soul.

503
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,340
...to be digging pits in your backyard and throwing normal bodies in there.

504
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,640
Well, it's just little pressed cakes.

505
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,280
Trampling them.

506
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,340
Noisy, if nothing else.

507
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,500
It's just little pressed cakes. Most people barbecue on them later, you know.

508
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,460
Well, the senator got indicted. Bob never forgot it.

509
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:19,820
You see?

510
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, and then we've got to give half of them away to the... wherever they're taken on Jupiter.

511
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,640
Well, of course...

512
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,220
Well, Karen, so I have to cut in there on that. I can't play the rest of that because there's...

513
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,220


514
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:40,600
There's no... You really shouldn't know about the... where the canisters go.

515
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:52,460
That was an old... an old show. That was Hour of Slack number four. Or, no, it was number six. Hour of Slack number six.

516
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,980
I doubt if any of our current listeners heard that. It's about two and a half years old. Or two... less... around two years old. Something like that.

517
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,200
And you are listening to The...

518
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,360
The Hour of Slack.

519
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,520
The radio ministry of the Church of the Subgenius.

520
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,680
We've had a couple of people call up and say,

521
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,280
What is... What... What are you?

522
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,460
That's always the question. What are you? They don't say who.

523
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,200
Uh...

524
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,600
And is this on all the time and why?

525
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,820
And yes, we've been at this place on the dial.

526
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Uh... 89.3 FM for about...

527
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,180


528
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,180
two years.

529
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Nine o'clock Sunday night.

530
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:44,560
You tune in and learn the word of Bob, dear friends. The word of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

531
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,820
The... The master of Slack.

532
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:57,520
The salesman of the universe. The one man qualified to sell the universe and to invest your soul wisely.

533
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:04,180
Because we don't smoke or otherwise, uh, consume the souls of true souls.

534
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,060
The subgenius listeners.

535
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,300
Those of you who are true subgeniuses.

536
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,240
Who really comprehend, uh, what...

537
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,480
Slack.

538
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,840
Those of you who truly understand the power of Slack.

539
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,560
And your need for Slack.

540
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,060
Uh...

541
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:28,020
Your souls are... are kept... are saved in canisters.

542
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
But never sold by us.

543
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,280
And never used or in any way abused.

544
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,200
Uh...

545
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,460
Only those of the...

546
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,060
Oh, those pathetic.

547
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,160
Those...

548
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,200
Oh, fashionable.

549
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,440
Those who want to join the church of the subgenius just to be fashionable.

550
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:52,540
Those who run down and buy the book of the subgenius so they can leave it on their shelves so everybody can see it.

551
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,520
But they never read it.

552
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,740
And if they do read it, they don't see nothing between the lines.

553
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,440
Not a thing.

554
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,180
Uh-uh. No.

555
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,200
Or those who buy subgenius tapes or t-shirts or whatever.

556
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,360
Just to...

557
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,200
Just to show off like they were cool.

558
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Like they knew what was happening, baby.

559
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,860
Those are the ones who will fry!

560
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,240
Fry!

561
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,720
Where?

562
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,760
In Bob's pipe, my friends.

563
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,960
In Bob's pipe.

564
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,000
Yay.

565
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,540
And I think this is a good time to read this PSA.

566
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,940
This ought to lend a great deal of credibility to our clients.

567
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,060
Or not clients, really.

568
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,300
Those that K&OM supports.

569
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:36,900
Okay.

570
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:46,600
The Dallas City Council will hold a public hearing July 27th to receive your comments concerning the 1988-89 Community Development Program.

571
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,080
We expect available October 1st.

572
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,800
15 million community develop-

573
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,100
These from HUD.

574
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,000
HUD.

575
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,760
HUD.

576
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,860
Activities be-

577
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,540
Housing, economic, street, and even so, you-

578
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,480
Day project.

579
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,640
Project.

580
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,500
Uh, strict-

581
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:02,900
Yee!

582
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,140
Uh...

583
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,500
In a council chamber.

584
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,480
They-

585
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:07,960
You see.

586
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,480
Ah, yes.

587
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,400
If you're thinking about starting to smoke, chances are there'll come a time when you'll be thinking seriously about quitting.

588
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,980
Why don't you just think about that now?

589
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,800
A question from the Dallas office of the American Heart Association.

590
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,400
Shut up! I'm not done talking to you!

591
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,920
Wait.

592
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,380
I don't believe about that.

593
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,760
I don't believe about that.

594
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,560
The triple keyboard operates an echo chip.

595
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,860
Resonating bars made of foam.

596
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,020
And something that rather resembles an earthly xylophone.

597
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,580
I'm getting tired.

598
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,820
I don't know if I can keep up.

599
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,320
But I believe I actually enjoyed it.

600
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,880
For the last mutant.

601
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,000
Mutant.

602
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,800
Mutant.

603
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,900
That's me!

604
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:14,820


605
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,080
Oh!

606
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,140
Oh!

607
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,260
Ape!

608
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,540
Civilized men were so frightened by talking apes-

609
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,120
Let it get away, doctor.

610
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,420
But how does one control a 400 pound gorilla?

611
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,620
I'm a duck, not an animal trainer.

612
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,840
I'm a duck.

613
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,020
I'm not an animal trainer.

614
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,020
That thing's got the balls as long as my middle finger.

615
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,140
Oh, no!

616
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,100
You think the unthinkable.

617
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,680
This radiation is beautiful.

618
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,780
Yes, that is beautiful.

619
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,320
Please!

620
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,260
Please!

621
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,120
Please!

622
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,880
Cover your faces!

623
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,040
That's the doomsday bomb.

624
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,780
Do you know what that means?

625
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,380
Do you know what that means?

626
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,220
Do you understand?

627
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,040
Do you understand?

628
00:28:59,820 --> 00:28:59,840
Illusions!

629
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,420
Illusions!

630
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,160
Oh!

631
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,820
...who pretend that aboriginally he was a respectable stemming.

632
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,140
Okay.

633
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,160
He was an outlier.

634
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,420
Our Slack radio ministry.

635
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,740
Here are the numbers to call.

636
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,840
The old classic number, 823-7490.

637
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,460
Or you can try 823-8801.

638
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
823-8883.

639
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:26,260
If all numbers are busy, well, heck, we won't give that one out yet.

640
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,220
So, 823-7490.

641
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
Or 823-8801.

642
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,320
Or 823-8883.

643
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
Light up the phone bags for us.

644
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,980
Our Slack radio ministry.

645
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,780
We need gifts for the pledge drive.

646
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,880
And we do have volunteers to take your calls.

647
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,320
That's right.

648
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,600
And not all of this money goes to the Church of the Subgenius.

649
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,320
In fact, none of it does.

650
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,000
This is all strictly to keep this station on the air so that you can hear all those

651
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,120
other shows that I'm sure some people would rather hear.

652
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,080
Because this is a great place to be.

653
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,080


654
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,140
This is a great place to be.

655
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140


656
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140


657
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140


658
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140


659
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140


660
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,140


661
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,040
At times, a dangerous show to listen to if you're trying to understand exactly what's

662
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,340
going on.

663
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,260
You have to listen very closely.

664
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,640
That's the tricky part.

665
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,100
You have to listen very closely.

666
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,840
You have to listen very closely.

667
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,840
So much so that young Master Shemmy on his very first aboutch at the very dawn of proto-history,

668
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,480
seeing himself such and such, when playing with thistle words in a garden nursery, Griefer

669
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,180
Trophio at Fig Street, 111 Shovel in Old Holland.

670
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,120
Would we go back there now for some more?

671
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,120


672
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,160
Pellets, sounds, pillens and scents?

673
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,860
Would we now for annas and annas?

674
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,240
Would we for full score eight and a loretta?

675
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,500
For twelve blocks one bob?

676
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,560
For four testas one gross?

677
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,740
Not for a deaner.

678
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,160
Not for Joe.

679
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,560
Dictated to of all his little brethren and swisterines, the first riddle of the universe.

680
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,240
Asking, when is a man not a man?

681
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,860
Telling them take their time young friars and wait till the tide stops.

682
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,500
For from the first his day was a fortnight.

683
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,900
And offering the prize of a bittersweet crab, a little present from the past, for their

684
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,140
copper age was yet un-minted to the winner.

685
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,220
One said, when the heavens are quakers.

686
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,960
A second said, when Bohemian lips.

687
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:21,180
A third said, when he know, when hold hard a jiffy, when he is agnostic and determined

688
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,540
to.

689
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,600
The next one said, when the angel of death kicks the bucket of life.

690
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,840
Still another said, when the wine is a jiffy.

691
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,900
And still another, when lovely woman stoops to conk him.

692
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,140
One of the littliest said, me me said, when papa papa to harbour.

693
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,960
One of the wittiest said, when he ate ye yablecooken and his meals he self so sooken.

694
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,340
Still one said, when you are old I'm grey, fall full with sleep.

695
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,820
And still another, when we dead a walkner.

696
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,900
And another, when he is just only after having been semi-sized.

697
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,480
Another, when he is just only after having been semi-sized.

698
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:56,820
Another, when he is just only after having been semi-sized.

699
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,960
YAY, he hath no m'namas!

700
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,580
And one, when those pigs they begin now that they will flys up into the luft.

701
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,740
All were wrong.

702
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:13,320
So Shem himself, the doktator, took the cake, the correct solution being, I'll give it up,

703
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,080
when he is a, yours to the rending of the rocks, sham.

704
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,300
Shem was a sham, and a low sham.

705
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,520
And his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs.

706
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:26,800
And his lowness creeped out first via foodstuffs.

707
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:26,800


708
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:26,800


709
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:26,800


710
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:38,600
So low was he that he preferred Gibson's tea-time salmon, tinned as inexpensive as pleasing to the plumpest roe-heavy lax or the friskiest par of smoked trout that ever was gapped between Leeslip and Island Bridge.

711
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:50,260
And many was the time, he repeated in his bottle-ism, that no jungle-grown pineapple ever smacked like the whoppies he shook out of Ananias's cans, Phil Legend, Lansdowne's corner house England.

712
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,140
So many great things, it just goes on and on and on and on and on.

713
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,660
That's from Finnegan's Wake.

714
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,460
Heavy stuff.

715
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,920
It's a big book, a big, big book.

716
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,280
People read it.

717
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,080
They get lost inside of it.

718
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,980
I did.

719
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,840
And we've got special signals attached to the tapes that we play on this show that reach out and lock onto your mind.

720
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,960
It's funny, isn't it?

721
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:30,160
This is Reverend D.K. Jones in New Jersey.

722
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,400
Great subgenius.

723
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,920
A song called Midnight Rambler.

724
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,340
I don't mean just black night.

725
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,860
I mean you black-hearted men and women.

726
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,760
I'm Midnight Rambler.

727
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,100
Yeah.

728
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,580
All Midnight Rambler's faces are not black.

729
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,180
But they're armed.

730
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,320
They're as black as midnight.

731
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,900
I'm talking to you.

732
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,800
Hold up, men.

733
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,540
And women.

734
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,800
You bank robbers.

735
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,340
You say so.

736
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,420
And you bank robbers.

737
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,160
And kidnap.

738
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,500
Hold up, men.

739
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,220
All right.

740
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm talking to you.

741
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,400
And we got some people in the church.

742
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,100
Stay down just a minute.

743
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,020
Come on.

744
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:59,500
Why can't you keep talking?

745
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,220
Da recently they

746
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,760
are.

747
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,540
Well, he said to me.

748
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,940
Saya.

749
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,940
Yeah.

750
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,280
That's the church.

751
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,740
Yeah.

752
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,860
He was in jail.

753
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,600
I've seen him last.

754
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,660
Yeah, in jail.

755
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,240
Yeah.

756
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,820
Now, Mr. Durbin, where was your husband?

757
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,280
Where was your husband?

758
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,180
My husband didn't get home last night.

759
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
He told me not to tell you.

760
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,800
Oh, well, he don't have to tell me.

761
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,260
I'm not holding court.

762
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,640
No.

763
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,860
I'm just talking to you.

764
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,380
He's got to tell the judge.

765
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,140
And you're out to tell him what to do.

766
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,880
Him what to do.

767
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,300
Him what to do.

768
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,280
Him what to do.

769
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,920
Him what to do.

770
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,780
Him what to do.

771
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,440
All right.

772
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,440
And in the court, you know, my name gets fixed on it.

773
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,460
Ah, ah, gee.

774
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,120
Hey.

775
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,460
I'm talking to you.

776
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,860
Midnight Ram.

777
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,240
Yeah.

778
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
You ain't that nice.

779
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,080
Yeah.

780
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,780
Just a robbing Steve.

781
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,500
All right.

782
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,500
From a year's old.

783
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,660
Come on.

784
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,600
I'm telling you this.

785
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
Steve, come yourself.

786
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,160
All right.

787
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,880
Fire, eating fire, eating fire, eating fire, eating fire.

788
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,520
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

789
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:42,880
All right.

790
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,580
All right.

791
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,480
All right.

792
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,780
All right.

793
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,280
All right.

794
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:49,820
All right.

795
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:50,720
All right.

796
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,780
You got with my, you got with my big brother.

797
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,620
Uh-huh.

798
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,620
Oh, yeah.

799
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,420
Out with somebody else.

800
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,000
But he's got the answer for himself.

801
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,960
Yes, sir.

802
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,220
I went out there for him, but he got the stand for himself.

803
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,820
That's right.

804
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,440
Do you need a job or job skills training?

805
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,680
The Opportunities Industrial Center can help you.

806
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,760
OIC offers counseling for your particular situation,

807
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,440
job skills training, and a bulletin board with current job listings.

808
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,740
They're located at the corner of Irvay and Young in Dallas,

809
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:49,880
and their phone number is 7486-0011.

810
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,300
Go by or call.

811
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,320
They want to help you find a good job.

812
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,180
That's 748-6001.

813
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:08,180
And I can appreciate a person who doesn't have a job wanting to get one.

814
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,200
Believe you me, I've been in that situation many a time,

815
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,300
and I wish I could have called 748-6001.

816
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,700
But those of you who have jobs,

817
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,820
my friend,

818
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,780
you know what?

819
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,960
You know what J.R. Bob Dobbs says to you,

820
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,280
the guru of the Church of the Subjeans?

821
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,640
You know what he says to you?

822
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,860
You can't imagine how much he hates you.

823
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,920
But he has something to say to you.

824
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,560
He does.

825
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,100
And what he says,

826
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,140
his friend,

827
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:43,940
repent.

828
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,820
Quit your job.

829
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,940
Quit your job.

830
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,420
And slack off.

831
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,300
If you could but appreciate

832
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,380
what that slack could mean to you all.

833
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,020
So

834
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,320
So

835
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,360
So

836
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,640
The black paper between the mirror breaks my heart

837
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,440
The moon frayed through dark velvet lightly apart

838
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,560
Steals softly to sunshine

839
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,780
Steals softly to snow

840
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,520
This is the children's mission, Doctor.

841
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,300
Yes, this is the children's hour for the Church of the Subgenius.

842
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,300
Kids for Bob.

843
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,300
Say, kids, Tevis, come over here.

844
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,100
Tell us what you think about Bob, Tevis.

845
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,160
Nothing.

846
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,600
A wise answer.

847
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,900
There is wisdom.

848
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,420
Subgenius.

849
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,400
I know about him, about spaceships.

850
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,640
You know about spaceships and Bob?

851
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,320
And that's all you need to know, friends.

852
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,260
Praise Bob and the spaceships.

853
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,720
Thank you.

854
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,860
Bob going away.

855
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,960
Bob with the regulator.

856
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,680
Bob with the robot.

857
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,380
Kid overnight.

858
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,380
Got returned to battle.

859
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,140
I didn't talk to him.

860
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,600
He didn't talk to me.

861
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,340
Bob with the robot.

862
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,420
At first, they didn't take you seriously.

863
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,100
Good.

864
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,800
Then they began to be frightened.

865
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,620
Good.

866
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,380
They kept their opinions to themselves.

867
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:37,820
Good.

868
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,600
They stopped joining clubs.

869
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,200
Good.

870
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,480
They informed on their friends.

871
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,120
Good.

872
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,840
But you went on and on and on.

873
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,580
Now they're beginning to ask themselves, maybe, I'm next.

874
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,280
Where will it lead to?

875
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,200
Nowhere.

876
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,880
I take up a copy of the book of the subgenius.

877
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,840
The book of the subgenius is right here on lovely McGraw Hill.

878
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,080
And I assume that must be Bob right there on the front.

879
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,760
Could very well be Bob.

880
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,280
Could very well be Brian.

881
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,140
With the pipe in his mouth, it's certainly a marvelous and comfortable experience.

882
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,460
Will be.

883
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,220
The publisher did not see that my purpose was to write a moral lesson.

884
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,280
The punishment that befell a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

885
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:26,900
Well, whatever your purpose may have been, my dear, I take great relish in savoring each separate horror.

886
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,560
This book isn't full of subliminal messages.

887
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,340
The messages are right out front as far as I can see.

888
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,080
Both, actually.

889
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,360
Both.

890
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,020
Yes, both.

891
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,900
They work.

892
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,380
They're subpsychic messages, too.

893
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,420
And, in fact, the book actually, now, most of your listeners will not believe this,

894
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:52,020
but the book carries a power shell that actually protects anything that it's being carried in your car,

895
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:57,040
your bathroom, especially your bathroom, and, well, your whole house.

896
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,140
The conspiracy can't touch it because there's power.

897
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,580
Power in that book.

898
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,560
Oh, no.

899
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,820
They're afraid of it.

900
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:17,100
In fact, in one respect, that's tough on sales because the love of Bob that's manifested in this book can injure normals and humans.

901
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,020
Come on.

902
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,300
That's right.

903
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,100
Each one of the Bobs in the book sees.

904
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,800
Did you know that every picture of Bob has the power to view you?

905
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,740
Has the power to look at you and look into your very soul?

906
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,360
I don't know.

907
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,500
Every picture of Bob is not just an image.

908
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,740
Not just a meaningless, mindless graph.

909
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,220
See, those dots are alive.

910
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,200
No, I'm just joking.

911
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:37,280
Look.

912
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,260
Each of those dots pulses with unfathomable radiant energy.

913
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,280
Each of those Bobs next to those toilets all over the U.S.

914
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,400
Don't listen to him.

915
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,060
Don't listen to him.

916
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,580
No.

917
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,200
Yes, you can find help.

918
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,460
You can be deprogrammed.

919
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,820
You can find out the truth.

920
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,760
That beat me up today.

921
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,580
It's a hell of an impetus.

922
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,740
I know you're a dumbass.

923
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,440
They force you to sleep on boards.

924
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,140
You must be fast.

925
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,820
You must be fast.

926
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:03,300
You must be fast.

927
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,820
You be fed with the skeleton of the real world.

928
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,220
It's so bright that I can't stay in my house.

929
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,840
When some genius escaped me and they took all my furniture.

930
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,580
I was told to buy me this neck brace that I keep taking off now.

931
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,620
And they said it was a living being.

932
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,820
What the hell?

933
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:28,220
What the hell?

934
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,260
I'm not a part of anybody else's entire city.

935
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,340
I...

936
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,280
I...

937
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:33,940
I...

938
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,700
I...

939
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,180
I...

940
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:35,660
I...

941
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:35,880
I...

942
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,020
I...

943
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,020


944
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,800
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

945
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,940
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

946
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,860
Just remember to praise Bob, friends, and you'll be okay.

947
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,480
Praise that mighty man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

948
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,480
He's out there slacking off for you.

949
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,340
For your slack.

950
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,800
Because, you know, you can't spread slack unless...

951
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,080
...wise you got some slack yourself.

952
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,320
And that's the truth.

953
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,480
That's the God's truth!

954
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,520
...on your radio show.

955
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,740
Oh, yes, dear friends.

956
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,700
We're back.

957
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,960
And, boy, it's getting tough doing these shows night after night after night.

958
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,000
It's easy for you.

959
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,860
You only have to listen once a week.

960
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,420
But we do ten shows a day.

961
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,900
We have to keep up.

962
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,820
Stay ahead.

963
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,260
What is that noise?

964
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,320
I have no idea.

965
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,780
I think it might be the X's on the X's.

966
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:31,780


967
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:31,780


968
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,560
It's probably outside of the hall.

969
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Yeah, a little bit.

970
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,680
Yeah, I can hear the hiss, the air noise.

971
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,600
We're still on the fringes of the atmosphere, you know.

972
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,640
It's just a few molecules.

973
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,040
What happens if I push this button?

974
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,560
What's your problem?

975
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:44,800
What?

976
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,920
Running up, demagnetized.

977
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,180
Oh, you can hear us.

978
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,020
Oh, man.

979
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,900
Oh, for sure.

980
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,060
What if we flip?

981
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,120
You've got a whole week's show there.

982
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,880
Here we go.

983
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,180
Visit Landon.

984
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,880
They'll get mystery in the magic.

985
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,380
Miss Funger was...

986
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,260
Up there went the mystery in the magic.

987
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:00,880
Right there.

988
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,160
Why did you have to say that?

989
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,620
Here are heroic legends of ages past, timeless myths, haunting ghost stories...

990
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,700
Hey, is this that Time magazine about Vietnam?

991
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,980
Yeah, it certainly is.

992
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,760
It's certainly...

993
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah.

994
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,320
Joke's shit before it's too late.

995
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,140
Okay, thanks.

996
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,360
A feast for the eye-minded...

997
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,380
We don't want to do that.

998
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,500
I think he's right.

999
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,220
He?

1000
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,040
What do you mean, he?

1001
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,600
What, a female colon?

1002
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,300
No, I used the term he to describe all aliens in the colon show.

1003
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,760
I don't think human was ever colon.

1004
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,900
He was as rich and as deep as the ingenious human...

1005
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,380
If that's an it...

1006
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,140
Wow.

1007
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:35,900
What is that?

1008
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,720
I want to get fixed, too.

1009
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,820
...gadget together for the first time by the editors of the Book of the Subgenius.

1010
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,640
Yes, all of the show was getting fixed.

1011
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,140
They were fixing the show.

1012
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,360
And nobody knew exactly where it would lead.

1013
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:53,780
Now, Subgenius Publishing guides you through this intriguing realm and unique and spectacular family library, the Book of the Subgenius.

1014
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,780
Here we go.

1015
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,900
Visit Landon.

1016
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,320
They'll get mystery in the magic.

1017
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,800
Miss Funger was...

1018
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,620
Up there went the mystery in the magic.

1019
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,220
Wait there.

1020
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,480
Why did you have to say that?

1021
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,640
Well, Gary, we just thought we'd say it.

1022
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,980
There went the mystery in the magic.

1023
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,380
Yeah, it's all you.

1024
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1025
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,100
Welcome back to the show.

1026
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,260
The Subgenius Divival, our friends.

1027
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,400
Yes, indeed.

1028
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,600
This is Dr. G. Gordon-Gordon.

1029
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,840
And Reverend Ivan Stagg.

1030
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,420
We're sitting here to bring you the Word of God.

1031
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,300
And don't you feel devived now?

1032
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,120
And don't be afraid.

1033
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,740
It's just a little radio show.

1034
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,500
The Grand Divot is...

1035
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,860
Sometimes it gets scary.

1036
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,940
The Grand Divot is...

1037
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,020
The Grand Divot is...

1038
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:47,020


1039
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,240
It's a scary show.

1040
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:56,000
It could get scarier depending on what, whatever parakeet mixes we drop in.

1041
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,800
That's right.

1042
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,900
But remember one thing.

1043
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,580
It doesn't matter what life cycle you're on.

1044
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:00,600


1045
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,500
over and over again.

1046
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,860
And whether your basic metabolism is carbon, silicon, or plasma,

1047
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,380
we're broadcasting to you because this is the first intergalactic church of dogs.

1048
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:17,360
Yes, friends, this is the church for every form of life that knows how to snicker.

1049
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,380
Yes, indeed.

1050
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:24,700
Every life form that can enjoy and appreciate slack, dear friends.

1051
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,100
Yes, and the mysteries.

1052
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,120
Those who appreciate the mysteries.

1053
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,060
Ah, the mysteries, yes.

1054
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,360
That sweet, sweet burning mystery of slack.

1055
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:43,300
Yes, and when finally they learn the answer to the mystery, why, on that great day?

1056
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:51,500
That one day, the sound of the slack goes rippling.

1057
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,360
This is what it sounds like, friend.

1058
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,440
Yes, listen to that slack rippling along.

1059
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,080
Isn't that a lovely sound?

1060
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,140
Oh, yes.

1061
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,380
Yes, receive the splendor of that slack sound, friends.

1062
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,320
Ah, yes.

1063
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:14,120
Ah, doesn't it drip through your frontal lobes or, depending upon your metabolism, of course, sometimes your back lobes.

1064
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,560
Sometimes it just runs down their spine and dribbles out.

1065
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,300
Sometimes it just dribbles through their cells and oozes through the pores.

1066
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,380
But we know that somewhere out there you're listening to the sound of slack.

1067
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,960
We can't give you too much of this air.

1068
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,040
We can't give you too much of this slack because...

1069
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,460
Nay, nay.

1070
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,380
No, no.

1071
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,580
We can't let you get all hooked.

1072
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,820
You'd just be sitting by your radios from now on.

1073
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,700
You wouldn't be able to do anything.

1074
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:42,780
Wait until next week when the subgenius hour of slack comes back.

1075
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,000
Ah, but...

1076
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,140
So that you can soak up some more of the healing power that can be mysteriously broadcast.

1077
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,240
That's right.

1078
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:58,900
So put your appendage, your pseudopod, your flipper, your hand, your manipulator, your chela, your...

1079
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,120
Yes.

1080
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,160
...endable, whatever you got, friends.

1081
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:10,300
It doesn't matter if it's a scaly, horny carapace or a squamous, drooling mollusk-like mucus-secreting skin.

1082
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:18,040
Just place your little sensory appendage upon your transmitter-receiver unit,

1083
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,920
and you will receive the benefit of this slack, this air slack.

1084
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,120
And when finally you discover the mystery, the answer to the mystery of the slack,

1085
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,620
why, on that day, you will be killed and re-killed and re-killed again

1086
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:42,080
in the scalding and scathing acid love of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1087
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,520
Hallelujah.

1088
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:43,280
Praise Bob.

1089
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:43,860
Hallelujah.

1090
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,640
E-I-E-I-E-I-E.

1091
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,860
Ah, yes, friends.

1092
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,860
Well, well, Dr. Stang, I think perhaps we ought to...

1093
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,380
We ought to...

1094
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,440
...turn the slack generator down a little bit.

1095
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,860
Let these poor...

1096
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,040
Just soothe them out with it.

1097
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,400
Don't drop them off sudden now.

1098
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:58,760
Just...

1099
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,020
There you are.

1100
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,680
Yes, friends.

1101
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,680
Just a rug.

1102
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,040
There.

1103
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,700
A rug of slack underneath.

1104
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,060
That little tiny layer that separates you from the hard, cold floor of reality.

1105
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,160
Well, we'd love to get you hooked, but we wouldn't be able to supply it.

1106
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:13,800
That's right.

1107
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,960
It'd be like Dawn of the Dead all over again.

1108
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,140
In a shambling...

1109
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,200
Shambling...

1110
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,080
...for Bob, trying to get some more of that great stuff that they...

1111
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,820
That beautiful, that beautiful essence, that vital,

1112
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,020
secretion of the heart-soul of Dobbs,

1113
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:37,280
that one thing that he possesses more than any other entity in the universe.

1114
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,640
And, friends, we're talking about slack.

1115
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,980
Don't you wish you had it?

1116
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,640
Don't you wish you had that sound with you all the time?

1117
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,680
Don't you like to wrap yourself up in that slack,

1118
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,540
that big, warm, fuzzy, woolly slack,

1119
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,160
and just snuggle into it and say,

1120
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,900
Ah...

1121
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,800
If you had just one bottle...

1122
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,760
Bob Pills.

1123
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,180
Like this one in this little vial.

1124
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,420
And we have one, listeners.

1125
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,420
We have one.

1126
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,240
And this one pill would be enough to impart into you

1127
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,760
the essence of the Stark Fist of Removal.

1128
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,720
You would become Vishnu, the Destroyer, friends.

1129
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,580
That's right.

1130
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,300
You would dance upon the helix of the ever-changing quantum universe,

1131
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,260
shifting your eigenstata.

1132
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,240
Dogs have always been my friend.

1133
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,960
And, friends, stay tuned, you dogs out there.

1134
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,680
Stay tuned for Robert Wisdom's American Music Party.

1135
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,800
Totally different thing from this show, but slack all the same.

1136
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,080
And if you want to know more about the...

1137
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,360
subgenius style of slack,

1138
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,560
and, believe me, you'd have to know a lot more about it

1139
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,980
before you got stuck to that mighty tar baby of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1140
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,100
and you want to, I know you do,

1141
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,760
just write for free information.

1142
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,960
I'm going to give you that sacred P.O. box number in just a second,

1143
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,080
so get your pencil ready.

1144
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,680
In the meantime, you still have about five minutes left to call

1145
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,220
the Will of Dobbs here at 823-7490.

1146
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,460
Get that pencil ready.

1147
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,860
Write to Bob for free information.

1148
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,160
Box 140306.

1149
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,280
That's box 140306.

1150
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,120
In Dallas, Texas.

1151
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,360
75214.

1152
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,260
75214.

1153
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,460
And, you know, when you do that, dogs will always be your friend.

1154
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,040
They've always been my friend.

1155
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,420
And we've had many dogs during these years.

1156
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,400
And we've had many dogs during these years.

1157
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,420
And now we have you.

1158
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,840
And I think he, I think they saved the best of the last.

1159
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,640
He is the friendliest and the smartest.

1160
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:56,220
He is the most constant in his attention of all the dogs.

1161
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:56,640
He is the best dog maybe

1162
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:04,120
in the country in the world, but I've known him more and more traditional lives than I've known the best in the sequences.

1163
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:22,060
He is the friendliest and the most constant in his attention of all the dogs.

1164
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:26,440
And I think he is the best dog maybe in the conversation with him more and more.

1165
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,620
You're the smartest.

1166
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,220
You're the smartest.

1167
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:38,000
And you're the constant.

1168
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,740
And you're the potential.

1169
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,020
With all your power.

1170
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,860
With all your love and love.

1171
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:08,920
With all your power.

1172
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,060
With all your love and love.

1173
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,280
Ricky's been here ever since.

1174
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:04,420
We love the world, but if the owner ever asked about him, to direct him here.

1175
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:09,340
But I'm glad that the owner never missed him.

1176
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,520
Because I surely would if he left me.

1177
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,420
Me.

1178
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,340
If you don't get him, if you don't get some flea powder,

1179
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:25,800
then...

1180
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,660
If he wants to go in the car.

1181
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,660
You want to go on a ride?

1182
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,920
You want to go to see the cattle?

1183
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,880
You want to go see it?

1184
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,180
You want to go?

1185
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,720
You want to?

1186
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:35,720


1187
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:37,900
Oh!

1188
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:38,900
Oh!

1189
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:41,860
Oh!

1190
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:43,860
Oh!

1191
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,080
Oh!

1192
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:44,700
Oh!

1193
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,060
Oh!

1194
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,600
Oh, friends, that's Hinton Templar.

1195
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,200
Hinton Templar.

1196
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,520
Available only on our Slack, I'm afraid, so far.

1197
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,520
Amazing.

1198
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,480
But I'm going to get out of here.

1199
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,260
So it's Robert's thing.

1200
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,160
Oh, there goes more show in the way.

1201
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

1202
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,380
We can't help.

1203
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,680
End of the line.

1204
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:34,940
That's right, folks.

1205
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,160
Of his lineage.

1206
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,220
The king of rock and roll is not really dead.

1207
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:39,880
He stinks.

1208
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,420
Yes, but dead now.

1209
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,320
Oh, please.

1210
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,600
A brave penguin gang or something like that has been seen.

1211
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:47,440
Oh, please.

1212
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:53,460
He isn't in suspended animation in an amusement park on a small planet near Arcturus.

1213
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,720
And he will not be killed.

1214
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:03,620
He will be killed by rampaging Yakutism in 1991 and end up with his head dangling from the Yakutism equivalent of a rearview mirror in one of their vehicles.

1215
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,340
Nothing this evil.

1216
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:13,220
Nothing that this evil, deceitful group, which, by the way, is actually a KGB front, says about Elvis is true.

1217
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,120
Here's the real truth.

1218
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,480
Elvis never did drugs.

1219
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,360
His fat, junky...

1220
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,520
That's right.

1221
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,240
Don't forget it.

1222
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,560
This is K&O in 89.

1223
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,780
.3 FM, Dallas.

1224
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,700
I'm Robert Wisdom.

1225
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,040
This is the American Music Party.

1226
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,160
Tonight's show is Gospel Connection number four.

1227
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:45,140
I'm going to start off with a song by Black Oak, Arkansas, off their very first album.

1228
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,520
It's called Lord Have Mercy on My Soul.

1229
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,940
Jim Danny must have done something in any way.

1230
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,160
He walked through the house of karma.

1231
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,340
And shook hands with both the devil and God.

1232
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,600
So this is about that.

1233
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:05,980
Y'all turn your radios up real loud and open your windows real wide so you never can listen to.

1234
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,800
. . .

1235
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:12,800


1236
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:12,800


1237
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:12,800


1238
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,100
. . .

1239
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,160
Now there's something I'd like to talk to you about at this particular moment.

1240
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,680
. . .

1241
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:22,680


1242
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:22,740
. . .

1243
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:22,760
. . .

1244
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:22,900
. . .

1245
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,160
. . .

1246
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,340
. . .

1247
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:23,360
. . .

1248
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,140
. . .

1249
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,140


1250
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,140


1251
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,140


1252
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,140


1253

1294
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:02,080
imagination, but I think it was real. See, I felt the presence of the two energies, positive

1295
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:10,000
and the negative, of God and the devil, however you want it. And they was pulling and deciding

1296
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,780
and wondering what to do with my soul. And I couldn't take this at this moment because

1297
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:23,320
I had to come back to be with you people to do a thing. And I proved to them in bargaining

1298
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:29,600
with them that I had a thing to do for the good of all of us. Out of this bargain, the

1299
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:37,840
devil, he got my body for the good and his needs while I'm here on earth. And the Lord,

1300
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:45,540
he's got my mind for the good of the universe and for the good of man. And they both, they

1301
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:52,800
got me in between because they both got my soul. So the next time I come up, I want the

1302
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,120
Lord.

1303
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,200
I want the Lord to please have mercy on my soul.

1304
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:52,240
I want the Lord to please have mercy on my soul. I want the Lord to please have mercy

1305
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,000
on my soul.

1306
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:13,940
The devil said scratch my back and I'll scratch your back for sure. But you have done all

1307
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:23,300
these sins for him. I could not be purer. I found out what means more to me. Can you

1308
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:29,680
Ain't anything on this earth to be ready on my judgment day.

1309
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,400
Ready to face the truth.

1310
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,220
So Lord, have mercy.

1311
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:42,160
Lord, have mercy on my soul.

1312
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,080
And on my soul, on my soul, on my soul so long.

1313
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:16,980
I hope I've done the right things for both your sake and mine.

1314
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,700
I'm reaching for a higher level.

1315
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,280
My only fear is fear.

1316
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,020
Fear of time.
