1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
All right, Doctor, go ahead.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,460
First paranoia.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:04,500
Intense.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,140
Terrible.

5
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,720
Unreasoning terror.

6
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,800
What then?

7
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,660
Then...

8
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,100
I see.

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,900
You know that one man is responsible for it all.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,600
Yes.

11
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,460
The man who lied when the truth would have cleared you.

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:20,320
Phase two.

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
The man who called himself...

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,000
Bob.

15
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,380
He's in an induced psychotic state.

16
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,700
Uncontrollably happy.

17
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,140
He's at large somewhere in the city,

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,580
and is potentially dangerous to others and to himself.

19
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,740
Stand by.

20
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,400
Shut up.

21
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:32,880
Five.

22
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,860
Four.

23
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,040
Three.

24
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,140
Two.

25
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,320
One.

26
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,620
Zero.

27
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
Stand by.

28
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,460
Just shut up.

29
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,400
In any event, I'd better be with you to administer the antidote.

30
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,540
This will cut short the effect and...

31
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,320
Shut up.

32
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,860
...greatly ease any after effects.

33
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,440
Shut up.

34
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,720
Bob?

35
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,660
Bob?

36
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,660
Bob?

37
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,480
Bob?

38
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,420
Bob?

39
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,320
Bob?

40
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,320
Bob?

41
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,340
Bob?

42
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,720
Bob?

43
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,400
Bob?

44
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,080
Bob?

45
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:05,440


46
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:05,820
Bob?

47
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,120
Bob?

48
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,640
Bob?

49
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,860
Bob?

50
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:07,360
Bob?

51
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,480


52
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:07,800


53
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000


54
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,040


55
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,040


56
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,040


57
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,080


58
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,080


59
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,080


60
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,080


61
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,200


62
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,200


63
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,260
Bob?

64
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,260


65
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,260


66
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,260


67
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm an oddball because I'm hacking government computer systems.

68
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,380
President Donald Trump did indeed interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

69
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,100
President Trump is a poot-poot-pootin'.

70
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,800
Trump now says he spoke.

71
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,080
Poot-poot-pootin'.

72
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,340
Trump also says...

73
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,080
Poot-poot-pootin'.

74
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,800
...aggressively.

75
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,900
Last week, the president's intelligence chief warned that, quote,

76
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,820
PR News, Washington, again.

77
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,700
President Trump must have something on President Trump.

78
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,260
In other news, many scientists are alarmed by the Major League Stars for the All-Star Game.

79
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,520
Star Washington, star Texas, star teenager.

80
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,600
So low.

81
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,980
PR News has been declining in popularity, especially among younger fans.

82
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,560
Low.

83
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,660
So low.

84
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,060
So low.

85
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,100


86
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,100


87
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


88
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


89
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


90
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


91
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


92
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


93
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


94
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


95
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


96
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,120


97
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,680
Doctors agree.

98
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,260
Low.

99
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,420
On Capitol Hill, the Republican leadership says...

100
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,080
Trump.

101
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,400
Trump.

102
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,680
Trump.

103
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,040
Trump.

104
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,300
Trump.

105
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,580
Trump.

106
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,060
Trump.

107
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,340
Trump.

108
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:05,580
Trump.

109
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,740
Trump.

110
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,540
The Dow 55-25-19.

111
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,100
Around Jupiter, the team of astronomers say...

112
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,260
This is PR.

113
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,760
Everyone who came into town noticed the stench from the Libyan fart plaza.

114
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,320
It was a

115
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,560
A

116
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,220
FAIL disabled

117
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,420
operation,

118
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:32,420


119
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:32,420


120
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,120
Hold

121
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,300
Call

122
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,980
hope

123
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,700
home out.

124
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,380
delicatessen that would routinely pay off health inspectors rather than address their frequent

125
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,160
problems with vermin infestations. This restaurant chain is known for its legendary endless buffet,

126
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:18,760
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. First found with the food by the buffet, the dinners are down for a minute.

127
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:26,020
The tourists that long ago stopped frequenting the Giant Tiger Thrift Center on East Boleskin Road

128
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,880
mainly because of the rude staff, but also because most items were long past their expiration dates

129
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:41,280
and the cashier smelled like feta cheese. Curiously, the Fart Plaza had been conceived as a way to boost

130
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,260
the local economy, and bonds had been issued to pay for a series of radio ads promoting its ostensible benefits.

131
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,000
Fires were printed and stapled on to utility poles in neighboring communities as far away as

132
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000


133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000


134
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,000
Carson City by a one-legged man who tried too hard not to look like Gary Cooper.

135
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,940
Once the failure of this divulgative gambit became apparent to local taxpayers,

136
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,420
a recall initiative was announced and the subsequent election led to unprecedented

137
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,060
voter turnout and the ascendancy of a swarm of poisonous Asian paper hornets to the city council.

138
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,540
After a brief

139
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,180
The ex-mayor and his business associates were all placed in shackles and frog-marched to

140
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,600
the gravel pits on the edge of town, then forced at knife point into a reservoir filled

141
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,840
with buffalo pits.

142
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,560
The Libyan Fart Plaza was repurposed as a community recreation center, and its neon

143
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,820
sign was sold to an itinerant junk dealer, who eventually resold it on eBay to an unsuccessful

144
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,700
performance artist in Pickle Gap, Arkansas.

145
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,820
Nowadays, the Fart Plaza is a popular tourist attraction in the state of Florida, and is

146
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:08,820


147
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,020
a popular tourist attraction in the state of Florida.

148
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,440
Folks don't talk much about it anymore, and the new mayor is focused on attracting more

149
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,100
big-box retail to the town's perimeter, boosting city revenues, and securing funding for the

150
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,120
proposed Sip Milton Male Lactation Research Facility.

151
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,620
And that was...

152
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,260
Insert band name here.

153
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:51,200
The Rudy Schwartz Project, on the album entitled, Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick

154
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,680
Powell.

155
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,580
It's safe to say, thank you, Lee Murr.

156
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,860
And now, Lee Murr.

157
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,420
What about Bob?

158
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,140
I gave him the torch right in the eye.

159
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,100
The hell?

160
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,900
That's Bob, right?

161
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,780
No!

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Bob!

163
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,400
Bob!

164
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,360
What about Bob?

165
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:17,960
What about Bob?

166
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,420
Don't stop!

167
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,880
What about Bob?

168
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,120
Bob!

169
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,500
Or anybody who watched here.

170
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,040
Whoever Default could come back up if he weren't here.

171
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,820
There's plenty of time.

172
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,920
He's a Default.

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,100
But instead of...

174
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,740
You can Default him.

175
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,080
I'm going to go down for a moment.

176
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Bye.

177
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:38,580
Bye.

178
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:38,720
Bye.

179
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:38,800
Bye.

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:38,800


181
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:38,800


182
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,740
Down, down, down, down, down.

183
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,860
Great, we've even got that.

184
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,240
Yay!

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,520
It goes up here.

186
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,400
As random non-radio events are occurring, I know it's a podcast.

187
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,240
Well, no, this is a radio, this is a broadcast radio show, we're just pre-recording it.

188
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,460
Shows how much I don't know.

189
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,320
It's also a podcast.

190
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,920
Podcasts are, you hear the cuss words on the internet version, you see, but I actually

191
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,700
mail our slot to five stations.

192
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,720
So if you have time, some of this will be edited.

193
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
And they can't have any cussing.

194
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,540
Yeah.

195
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,640
So I have to cut the cussing.

196
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,280
I've had to pronounce your name very carefully because of that.

197
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,960
Well, everybody says the obvious joke, of course.

198
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,320
Right.

199
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,340
It's just an opportunity to make the new shtick, the old shtick about my name.

200
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,900
I know, I know.

201
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,300
It's like having a funny name.

202
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,360
There are other things to talk about than my favorite subject, myself.

203
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,260
I'm going to get the, well, one beautiful dame wants me to help her with something.

204
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,360
But we're going to, we need to get away from the mic for that.

205
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,700
Are you making radio still?

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,240
Yeah.

207
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,600
Well, it's recording.

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,060
I don't know if we're making radio.

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
You can sit down.

210
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,420
We could do Geek Acres.

211
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,940
I'll do Geek Acres with you.

212
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,300
Let me see.

213
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,360
Let me see if I can find both things.

214
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,280
Boy, Susie, it sure would be great if you were sitting here.

215
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:09,780
Yeah.

216
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,880
You'd look so much better than Philo.

217
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,440
Yeah, it would be.

218
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,860
Your beard is so much nicer than Philo's.

219
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,540
I did want to ask one more little question.

220
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,680
About when open mic performances are allowed.

221
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,820
I was told I could probably take the warning sign down there, sarcasm prohibited.

222
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,840
I could take that with a grain of morphine because, I mean, my material runs on high octane

223
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,380
sarcasm from beginning to end.

224
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,820
Well, maybe it's a sarcastic sign.

225
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,800
There is truth in some sarcasm.

226
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,940
I can only hope.

227
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,940
Thank you.

228
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,180
Snarkasm?

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,220
Snarkasm?

230
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,720
Snarkasm, that's a new one.

231
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,480
Snarkasm?

232
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,680
I've never heard that one.

233
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,180
Where's that been all our lives?

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,900
Snarkasm, yeah.

235
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,200
It's yours.

236
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,580
Snarkasm?

237
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:02,740
Snarkasm?

238
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:02,800
Snarkasm?

239
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,180
That's nasty.

240
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,960
That's nasty and irritating.

241
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,940
It's even worse than sarcasm, which we use all the time.

242
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,380
Y'all listeners, this is our slight number 1,700-something.

243
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,320
And Princess, we and I have a song.

244
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,900
Yes, we have a song to present for you.

245
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,000
Just for you.

246
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,520
Let's see.

247
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,000
I think I know how to start.

248
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,640
Let's start.

249
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,300
Head acres is no place.

250
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,840
No, no, no.

251
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,340
No, no.

252
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,720
Oh, sorry.

253
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,440
Mr. Douglas is first.

254
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,980
Okay, sorry, Mr. Douglas.

255
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,660
Go ahead.

256
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,540
Let's start from the beginning.

257
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,620
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

258
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

259
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,540
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

260
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,520
Dun, dun.

261
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,820
Head acres is no place to be.

262
00:09:59,340 --> 00:09:59,820
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

263
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,960
Conjure is not for me.

264
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,060
Bad jobs that like to break my back.

265
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm going to X-Day and letting Bob get me slack.

266
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,820
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,800
Starwood is where I'd rather frop.

268
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,140
All night drumming, let it never stop.

269
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,860
I just adore the pagans best.

270
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,960
Stang, I love you, but X-Day is a sausage fest.

271
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,720
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

272
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,640
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

273
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,420
The slack.

274
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,460
Da-da-da-da-da.

275
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,320
Kick back.

276
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,320
Na-na-na-na.

277
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,240
The weed.

278
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,160
Na-na-na-na-na.

279
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,280
The mead.

280
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,380
Why not do both?

281
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
And take off all our clothes.

282
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,120
Geek Acres, we are there.

283
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
Na-na-na-na.

284
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,600
Woo!

285
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,520
Woo!

286
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,680
Even better than Donald Trump's.

287
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,980
Princess, we tried to do that solo last year.

288
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,720
Yes, I did.

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,620
But without proper preparation.

290
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:00,780
Right.

291
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,020
It was not ready to be launched.

292
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,860
Till now.

293
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,000
I did about three-fourths of Buddy the Dog Opera.

294
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,640
No.

295
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,400
By myself.

296
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:12,800
No.

297
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,440
Out of order.

298
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,480
In little bits and pieces.

299
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,100
But I told Reverend Angry Larry about it.

300
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,940
And he said, you know, if you had given me

301
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,620
an Android.

302
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,500
From the Computer Core on the pre- отwinter pizza divulge nightcee

303
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:44,260
И, I give up my part for the job.

304
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,260


305
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,260


306
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,260


307
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,540
If I don't sit rather see, how could I stand?

308
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,740
I am the…

309
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,760
time that we've tried to do that, everyone's kind of patiently waiting for us to stop.

310
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,900
But Susie has a kindly heart.

311
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,520
Yes.

312
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,400
She's very charitable.

313
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,080
I love it.

314
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,860
Well, it's really, really terrible.

315
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,520
And we worked hard at that.

316
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,460
We're good at that.

317
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,020
It's terrible and wonderful at the same time because it's about our buddy.

318
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,160
And X-Day.

319
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,800
And X-Day.

320
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
And peeing.

321
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,360
And peeing.

322
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,240
Yeah.

323
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,180
And slack.

324
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,200
And slack.

325
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:27,880
Yeah.

326
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,760
Because that's what Buddy gives us.

327
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,660
Slack and lots of it.

328
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,220
I haven't heard from our dog sitter.

329
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,720
But then I haven't had phone service.

330
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,680
We haven't either of us had phone service.

331
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah, so if anybody hears from the dog sitter, we're eager to...

332
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,380
Yes, let us know if Gabriel calls, please.

333
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,080
Yeah.

334
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,040
Or Buddy.

335
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,940
Or Buddy.

336
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,700
Or Claudia.

337
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:49,920
Claudia.

338
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,960
So, I really have to get up and go.

339
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,800
I have to go to the bathroom.

340
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,680
I just realized.

341
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,860
Well, I guess the radio show is drawing to a close then because I can't carry it alone.

342
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,660
And there's no one else up here to do radio show with, so I guess we're drawing to a close.

343
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,820
You want to hold it while I run water through it?

344
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,500
Can I hold it while you run water through it?

345
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,880
Yeah.

346
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,440
Yeah.

347
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:19,700


348
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,460
Uh-oh, Mr. Sister's staggering this way.

349
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,920
Racine, can you help him get that to us?

350
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,740
This is the names from the guest book.

351
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,640
The guest book stories.

352
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,980
Can you read it?

353
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,320
Day three.

354
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,580
It's been a long week of fish tips.

355
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,420
These...

356
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,500
Fighting these things.

357
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,880
It's been a long week of fighting these things.

358
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:07,460
They have taken our neighbors and drugged them through the woods.

359
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:15,720
Dragged them through the woods from behind far into the hills.

360
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,240
We never saw them again.

361
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,240
They came back.

362
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,540
And as they came, we were all in the loft.

363
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:28,940
I look out the window and saw one gnawing on a human arm.

364
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,520
Now, most of the words in this are spelled phonetically.

365
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:44,300
A human eye gasped and we sat in silence as the cabin shook of screams and pounding from the outside.

366
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,800
But then it stoked.

367
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,140
Silence grew.

368
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:48,900
Bang!

369
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,180
This went on for some like minutes.

370
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,000
Then it stoked.

371
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,320
All of us scared.

372
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,000
We looked outside.

373
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,640
The weird creature were...

374
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,920
Creatures.

375
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,760
Apostrophe.

376
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,360
Were what seemed like dead or dead.

377
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,020
We looked from where the shots were fired.

378
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
It came from the...

379
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,100
A rail?

380
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,480
It was the castle people.

381
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,580
We were saved.

382
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,820
This was in the guestbook?

383
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,920
This was in the guestbook where I'm staying at the castle.

384
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,980
Good Lord, man!

385
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:42,140
It's like an illiterate 12 year old is writing a diary of a zombie apocalypse.

386
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,720
Yeah, that's brilliant.

387
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,000
But it's not a zombie apocalypse.

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000


389
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000


390
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:55,080
Well, it's very realistic looking because the spelling and handwriting are just psychotically bad.

391
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,680
And it's pencil, which helps.

392
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,320
In pants-le?

393
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,460
Yeah, in pants.

394
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,760
I couldn't live my life without sharing that with the substitute.

395
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,320
Well, thank you so very much.

396
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,660
We find these.

397
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,000
Mr. Sister, it's just one of those found manuscripts.

398
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,160
Found magazine would like that one.

399
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,540
That's really, really appropriate for them.

400
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,040
Yes.

401
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,820
And then of course I found this, but you can't possibly translate that.

402
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,460
Although that's the way I feel right now.

403
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,700
Okay, the tetheress...

404
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,220
Let me see.

405
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,740
Oh, it's just scribbles.

406
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,020
Just insane scribbling on a page.

407
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,920
That's the way he feels.

408
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
That's how you feel right now?

409
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,560
That's how I feel right now.

410
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:57,440
Oh, he did try one tiny inhalation of that allergy, the allergy stuff that was going around.

411
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,120
So that might explain part of that.

412
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,300
The bad hot wine might be the other part.

413
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,320
The bad allergy stuff?

414
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,780
See, friends, radio listening audience, if you get your stomach operated on to where it's down about the size of your thumb,

415
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,900
you can get drunk really fast.

416
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,480
Fast on very little alcohol.

417
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,560
And then you're straight again in a fairly short time.

418
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,280
So you can do it again.

419
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,900
And I might.

420
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,000
Why not?

421
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,360
It's next day.

422
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,620
The world ends and you may die.

423
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,540
You may die.

424
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,180
You're going to take me back to sit me down.

425
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,200
Just watch your step on the way and yes, use that tripod as a walking stick.

426
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,860
It's lucky that I don't have to pee right now or I would need assistance.

427
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,080
Oh, it's too late.

428
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,060
That is really fortunate.

429
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,820
Look down.

430
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,820
The little puddle is growing for the whole time you stand there talking.

431
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,720
He thinks he doesn't need.

432
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,180
I have about 15 cc's left.

433
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,680
And I'll be able to, you know, sit on the Supreme Court.

434
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,860
Ah.

435
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,700
You could do it now.

436
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,300
They'd never notice.

437
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,160
Mr. Sister could sit on the Supreme Court right now?

438
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,640
Yes.

439
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,700
And he's drunk as a lord.

440
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,560
As they say.

441
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,160
I see.

442
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,100
He would fit right in these days.

443
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,660
That's the biggest bunch of obvious, visually obvious alcoholics I've ever seen.

444
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,480
It takes one to know one.

445
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,360
No, seriously.

446
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,960
I mean, geez, look at Kavanaugh.

447
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,560
That guy is, he's got every earmark.

448
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
Every single earmark.

449
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,020
I'm not, no judge.

450
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,200
I'm not making judgments.

451
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,680
I've known many people who are professional alcoholics and were quite fortunate.

452
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,440
Functional in all their jobs and relationships.

453
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,480
But they usually don't last all that long.

454
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,740
I'll drink to that.

455
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,680
You're talking about alcoholics, but we got these drinks at the same time.

456
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,360
Look at them.

457
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,720
And yours is finished.

458
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,340
And I'm just starting.

459
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,120
And you're cackling.

460
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,740
And I'm jabbering.

461
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,520
So there you go.

462
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,800
Well, the drinking helps with the cackling.

463
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,840
It's a cackle assist.

464
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,860
Cackle fruit.

465
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,760
No, that's eggs.

466
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,500
That's eggs.

467
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,800
Right.

468
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,380
That's cackle fruit is eggs.

469
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:12,680
Right.

470
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,260
Okay.

471
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,720
Well, where's Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

472
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,860
When does he call in?

473
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,060
Who's going to play Dave?

474
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,580
Anyone can sound like Lonesome Cowboy Dave for a little while.

475
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

476
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,900
There you go.

477
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,900
That was my best Lonesome Cowboy Dave imitation.

478
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,900
St. Joyce has just presented me with this.

479
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,780
However, it was explained to me what they are, and I don't recall.

480
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,920
So I'm going to need one of the pressures once they have registered.

481
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,400
Saunter up here and explain what this is.

482
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Princess Wee is holding a cloth rabbit, a stylized bunny rabbit with the big colorful ... The

483
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,620
inside of the ears is colorful.

484
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,200
Psychedelic ears.

485
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,900
The rest of it's black.

486
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,900
The inside of the ears are psychedelic.

487
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,880
And it's a little bit of a ...

488
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,940
But, you're going to give me a little listen to it.

489
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:10,940


490
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:10,940


491
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,160
We're all so used to go on 멋있 EMINEM PO siguables.

492
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


493
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


494
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


495
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


496
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


497
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


498
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


499
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


500
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


501
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


502
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


503
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


504
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


505
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


506
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,160


507
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,820
We can't hear you.

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,740
It's a feel-good rabbit.

509
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,340
Phil-good Rabbit!

510
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,880
You don't have to make me feel demeaned.

511
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,460
A feel-good rabbit, he said.

512
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,200
I feel terrible the way he told me that.

513
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,660
As soon as I got it, I had to put it on my chest and feel it.

514
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,600
And it made me feel good.

515
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,320
So these are well designed.

516
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,340
This is a feel good rabbit.

517
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,380
As opposed to the feel well pills that make you feel pain very well.

518
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Have a feel, Reverend Stang.

519
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,580
See if it doesn't make you feel good.

520
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,480
No.

521
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,740
It doesn't?

522
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,020
No.

523
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,900
No.

524
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,280
No.

525
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,540
No.

526
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,020
It's just an inert object to me.

527
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,280
It doesn't feel...

528
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,080
It's a sweet, warm, feel good rabbit.

529
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,960
These make me feel pain.

530
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,200
Oh.

531
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,060
So they're the complement to the feel good rabbit.

532
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,600
Here's the feel pain shoes and the feel good rabbit.

533
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,180
These are diametric opposites.

534
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,440
Who wants the feel pain?

535
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:22,820
The pain shoes.

536
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, see.

537
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,540
Oh, now they all want that.

538
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,160
Nobody wants the feel good rabbit.

539
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,680
Are these for the auction, sir?

540
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,560
Oh, my.

541
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,120
The pain shoes.

542
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,940
Someone should probably enjoy using these.

543
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,480
Well, it's an acquired taste, they say.

544
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
And now this.

545
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,080
Boy, that got me out of that one quick.

546
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,740
All right.

547
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,420
Bye.

548
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,880
Bye.

549
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Bye.

550
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:02,720
Bye.

551
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,360
Bye.

552
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,360


553
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,440
Ever since I've been about it.

554
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,100
Bye.

555
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,240
From PR News in Washington, I'm accompanied only by Vladimir Putin.

556
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,600
And overall, his responses continue to raise questions about what he said today at the White House,

557
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,160
which is no to answering questions about.

558
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,720
What he said today at the White House, which is no questions about this presidential election in Finland.

559
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,580
Um, uh, uh, but, uh, uh, uh, uh.

560
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,620
The remains of the White House may be returned home in the coming weeks.

561
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,940
Researchers have the degenerative brain disease that can only be diagnosed after listening to PR News in Washington.

562
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,980
It's safe to say, thank you, Lee Murr.

563
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,940
And now this.

564
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,340
Oh, Lee Murr.

565
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,840
I miss him.

566
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,800
Uh, he's still doing stuff and you can hear his new PR news and titles and things on our Slack.

567
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,640
Bless him.

568
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,740
Yeah, yeah, you can find him on archive.com.

569
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,140
He uploads about a hundred new things every three months or so.

570
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,900
He's still in Colorado, uh, living like a hermit with dogs.

571
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,400
Kind of like me.

572
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,860
I went to see him about 12 years ago.

573
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,840
Unbelievable.

574
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:29,540
Mr. Sistar is explaining that he made a pilgrimage to Colorado to meet the elusive Mr. Fernandin Andy Lee Murr.

575
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,400
Just to meet him.

576
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,620
The famous artist and, uh, sound collage.

577
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,520
And, uh, yeah, he's another old weird man like so many of us.

578
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,480
Quite the unique individual as I recall the report from Dr. Mr. Sistar.

579
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,380
Did he have that pencil in his eye like he does in all his pictures?

580
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,240
No.

581
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,580
No?

582
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,720
Apparently not.

583
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,480
He has some medical conditions which might be comparable.

584
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, he has some medical conditions like the pulsating tumor thing with the mouth and little eye on it.

585
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,860
On his cheek.

586
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah.

587
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,720
Yeah, that always.

588
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,360
I never wanted to bring that up with him, you know, because some people are sensitive.

589
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,920
Uh, he might not be able to afford to have it removed and maybe it talks to him, you know.

590
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,720
It does drool.

591
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,120
yeah sum

592
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,160


593
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:39,800
Yeah a PER зр

594
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,640
RR Rr

595
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:45,760
Rr

596
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
Rr

597
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,320
Rr

598
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,320


599
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,240
I'm sorry.

600
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,720
I'm sorry.

601
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,300
Ah, yes, dear friends.

602
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,280
And that was the death of a Muto.

603
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,120
We were listening

604
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,980
to there from the first of the

605
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,620
recent Godzilla movies.

606
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,260
Just great sound effects in that movie.

607
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,740
Like

608
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,980
avant-garde music. And we'll be

609
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,060
hearing some more avant-garde

610
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,120
music. A live recording

611
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,420
from 22X Day Drill

612
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,120
with Reverend Angry Larry

613
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,840
and the strange

614
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,960
Reverend X, or maybe

615
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,940
just X.

616
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,460
The unknown.

617
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,800
New guy. Kind of a winged eel

618
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,360
fingerling. Like

619
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,780
sound.

620
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,160
And the recording is incredibly

621
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
accurate. It's how it really sounded

622
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,580
that night. Complete with live jerks

623
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,080
talking over the music.

624
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,840
Loud live jerks.

625
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,200
But first,

626
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,260
more tedious early

627
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,720
subgenius internet

628
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,460
history.

629
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,580
I can't

630
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,240
hear you. Reverend

631
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,220
Mr. Doctor, I

632
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,160
Doctor Mr. Sister is saying that there is

633
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,840
a road. Say it again.

634
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
And low.

635
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,740
And a group

636
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,780
called Sputum.

637
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,880
Sputum was one of Dr.

638
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,400
Dinosaur's organizations.

639
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,720
It was to fight spam

640
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,480
on the Usenet group,

641
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,520
Alt.Slack.

642
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,840
Okay, now I remember Enloe.

643
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,020
He was a pink boy who thought

644
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,960
we were going to be impressed by pictures of

645
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,420
him and his muscle car

646
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,040
and his muscle shirt.

647
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,920
And he had a, oh, and he was

648
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,120
a detective.

649
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,860
It was one of the

650
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,600
so obviously this whole

651
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,080
built up persona.

652
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,600
And he'd picked the wrong people

653
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,380
to impress with that particular

654
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,000
persona.

655
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,820
It was probably, it was his idea

656
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,320
of impressing girls

657
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,660
but it was not

658
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,520
the kind of thing that would actually

659
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,640
impress much of anybody except

660
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,640
other guys like him

661
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,560
that might fall

662
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,800
for that. Can you show me?

663
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,100
How to get a muscle car

664
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,880
and girls?

665
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,140
And no, he can't.

666
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,280
But Bob can.

667
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,860
Bob teaches you

668
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,700
to give up and

669
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,760
get slack and sex

670
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,260
and whatever else you want.

671
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,700
As soon as you quit trying so hard

672
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,960
what you really need will come to you

673
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,900
and eventually you get what you want.

674
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,580
Or die.

675
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,700
Okay, later.

676
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,240
Oh, thank you.

677
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,180
What's up?

678
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,000
She said it was our lighter.

679
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,240
See ya.

680
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,540
Okay, see ya.

681
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,400
It's really nice to see you guys.

682
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,260
Oh, there you go.

683
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,240
I'll be here.

684
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,740
Alright.

685
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,480
Alright.

686
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,860
10 a.m.

687
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,360
Okay.

688
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,580
Good job.

689
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,560
Oh, it sank.

690
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,680
Google pay me.

691
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,140
Now we've got form skalage.

692
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,060
You know,

693
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,160
But practicing

694
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,840
bloomin' later in the whole place.

695
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,720
It's like a

696
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,180
fucking weird moment.

697
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,900
One moment later .

698
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,620
. profits.

699
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,100
. profits.

700
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,080
guitar solo

701
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,080
Yeah!

702
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,740
There, there, there.

703
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:04,500
Again.

704
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,940
Play it again, yeah, play it again.

705
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,040
Yeah, because I played a wrong note there in the third...

706
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,880
Yeah, that was a bad note.

707
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,300
I hated that note.

708
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,120
That didn't sound like...

709
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,160
He wrecked it, man!

710
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:17,900
That was...

711
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,560
Yeah, it takes all kinds.

712
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,480
That's what people do.

713
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,080
That's what people do.

714
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,760
There's only one what?

715
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,340
He's not seeing double vision, he's seeing single vision from looking at two people.

716
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,020
Thank you for keeping us up on your inebriation level.

717
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,980
Don't give him any LSD, friends.

718
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,060
Or LDS, or any of those things.

719
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,420
I can't get high because I feel that way all the time.

720
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,740
Ah.

721
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,600
Maybe...

722
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,960
He did try a little vape thing.

723
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,720
Did he?

724
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,700
Just one.

725
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,140
Uh-huh.

726
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,700
He didn't even cough.

727
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,760
Didn't do anything, did it?

728
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,260
No.

729
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,920
Didn't do anything.

730
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,860
No, because he is drugs.

731
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,760
He is, he's...

732
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,980
Mr. Sister is drugs.

733
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,440
He is drugs.

734
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,580
He's like Salvador Dali.

735
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:10,860
Right.

736
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,780
I don't need drugs, I am drugs.

737
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,980
Or as Mr. Leahy said, Philo quoted,

738
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,540
I am the liquor.

739
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,240
Randy.

740
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,560
I could probably do Lonesome Cowboy Dave right now.

741
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,400
For a little while.

742
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,500
For a little while.

743
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,760
Yeah, you can do, anybody can do Lonesome Cowboy Dave for a little while.

744
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,280
I bet Lonesome Cowboy Dave wishes somebody would do him.

745
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,460
Yes, I bet he does too.

746
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,500
Yeah, it's been a long time since anybody did Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

747
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,200
But the harder part...

748
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,940
In the good way.

749
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,460
Would be for I, Dr. Mr. Sister just getting from his seat to the stage.

750
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,820
Yeah, we're not going to bring the mic over to you.

751
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
So it's not going to happen.

752
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,140
Look at that.

753
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,240
He said, oh my God, he's going to do it.

754
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,920
Somebody call the ambulance.

755
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,220
Mr. Sister's off the hook.

756
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,560
Call the hospital.

757
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,140
Do you need to go to the hospital?

758
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:01,920
No.

759
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,460
Look, he's carefully using support to get up the steps.

760
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,220
See, he's not as drunk as we thought he was.

761
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,880
He's actually taking the measure of holding on.

762
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,760
Yeah, I knew that was coming.

763
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,180
Yes, I'm so concerned about global warming.

764
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,940
Oh, he made it.

765
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,800
And I think Trump is destroying America.

766
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,080
There's a sign there that says no sarcasm.

767
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,200
He's not being sarcastic.

768
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,140
I mean, that's the thing.

769
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,880
He's being sarcastic.

770
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,840
It's okay, Mr. Sister.

771
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,760
I actually understand why people voted for that.

772
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,580
I wish AOC had a much better whatever she's got than she's got.

773
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,020
AOC?

774
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,560
She's got pretty good tips and ass.

775
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,740
That's what I'll say.

776
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,020
Yeah, that's all I care about in politics.

777
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,160
That's not all you care about.

778
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,640
Yeah, hell yeah.

779
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,400
And if that's all I had to do, I would vote for Sanders every day.

780
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,560
Well, he doesn't have any kind of TNA going on.

781
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,580
That's pathetic.

782
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,400
Maybe when he was younger, he had nice, you know.

783
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,740
Well, what?

784
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,260
We all did.

785
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,560
Oh, my God.

786
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,640
I just realized I had him potted down.

787
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,680
You still couldn't hear him.

788
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,740
Well, I kept on putting the microphone closer and closer to his mouth, but I couldn't hear anything.

789
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,140
Well, at least we know where that feedback was coming from.

790
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:28,800
All right.

791
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,900
That's good to know.

792
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,680
Now it's back.

793
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,100
It's Mike 3.

794
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,680
It's just horrible that we all eat meat.

795
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,340
I mean, Jesus.

796
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,460
Is this what Democrats say?

797
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,280
Are you saying the things that the liberals say?

798
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,780
You know, it's the part of what I hear.

799
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,700
Exactly.

800
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:54,640
What you hear is you hear what liberals say according to the people you're listening to.

801
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:02,280
How many times have you heard me, an actual real-life libtard, say any of that stuff?

802
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:03,780
Never.

803
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,020
No, that's true.

804
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:12,700
I'm a meat-eating, shotgun-toting libtard on a goat farm with a dog.

805
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,720
I've always thought of you as a centipede.

806
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm a centrist.

807
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,480
Actually, I'm a Maoist radical.

808
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,440
How's that?

809
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,220
Power to the people, baby.

810
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,400
I'm a Black Panther.

811
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,240
I only believe about half of what I say.

812
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,100
I only believe about a third of what you say.

813
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,340
So I've got to do one better.

814
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,080
One third?

815
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,340
Well, that's okay.

816
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,380
Some fraction better.

817
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,920
But really, you know, I mean, he had, what, tanks on the Fourth of July?

818
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,600
I mean, it's like, don't we respect the English?

819
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:45,700
I mean, it's like, don't we respect the English?

820
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,180
I mean, they...

821
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,060
Well, it's a great image, tanks going through D.C.

822
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,380
Think of the stock footage that'll make.

823
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,280
And then the conspiracy turned against its own people in this stock footage from the

824
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,040
deadly Fourth of July, the day the plague was released in Washington, D.C.

825
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:10,680
That's where it hadn't made it to the news yet, that somebody released that vial with

826
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,460
that virus.

827
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,260
I was...

828
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,420
Right there, right in front of Trump.

829
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:15,680
I was...

830
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


831
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


832
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


833
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


834
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


835
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


836
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


837
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


838
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


839
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


840
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


841
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


842
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


843
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


844
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


845
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


846
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


847
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


848
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


849
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,680


850
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:15,900
Right there, right in front of Trump.

851
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,100
And of course, he was busy reading his...

852
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,380
Well, no, he didn't really have to read cue cards.

853
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,200
He just spews right on the top of his head.

854
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,660
You could tell his exact level of education from that.

855
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,480
What a spouter.

856
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,340
I...

857
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:37,500
As Paul Mavridis said, oh, he's the most subgenius president, but not in the good way.

858
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,580
I think he's much too old to be president because he must be close to my age.

859
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,440
But you're not old, Mr. Sister

860
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,780
Where are the young people?

861
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,100
What?

862
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,620
The 35-year-old

863
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,380
He's not old

864
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,420
He's older than me

865
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,480
And I'm old as dirt

866
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,140
My mother is old

867
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,220
She's going to be 90 years old next month

868
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,380
And she's old, okay?

869
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,080
That's old

870
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,600
You guys are young

871
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
He's going to be 80

872
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,940
I'm going to be

873
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,980
Who's going to be 80?

874
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,100
If we're lucky

875
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,700
Yeah

876
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,560
If we're lucky

877
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,540
Yeah, if we're lucky

878
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,060
Right

879
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,120
If we're lucky

880
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,860
What did I do?

881
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,720
Just sneak up on stage here

882
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,460
And take over a microphone?

883
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:18,800
Yeah

884
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,700
I believe that is what you did

885
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,980
We invited you up here

886
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,440
Man, well, thank you

887
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,080
I mean, hey

888
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,800
That's what I'm here for, I guess

889
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,560
You know?

890
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,540
Well, we knew you were really, really drunk

891
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,500
And we thought, you know

892
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,620
Who knows what's going to come

893
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,360
This could be good

894
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,200
This could be real good

895
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,520
This could be real good

896
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,340
You never know

897
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,080
Why not?

898
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,260
We're up for any program

899
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,180
Dear Mr. President

900
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,520
I want you to know

901
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,040
I am deeper than you

902
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,560
Listen and learn

903
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,320
My heart is a chapel

904
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,900
My head is a steeple

905
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,260
My arms are the people

906
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,400
And the people now yearn

907
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,080
I stand for the midget

908
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,460
I stand for the negro

909
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,080
I stand for the engine

910
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,160
All the way

911
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,720
All hopped up on booze

912
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,960
I stand for the Jap

913
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,620
And I stand for the beaner

914
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,880
I stand, yes I do

915
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,380
For the Christ-killing Jew

916
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,840
And I stand for the dyke

917
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,360
And I stand for the retard

918
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,140
I stand for the Chinaman

919
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,260
Washing my socks

920
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,620
I stand for the bum

921
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,980
And the pimp

922
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,140
And the bugger

923
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,440
And the cripple that lives

924
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,140
On my street in the box

925
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,340
To conclude, Mr. President

926
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,840
I'm not at all hesitant

927
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,140
To tell you, I think

928
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,660
The first lady's a fox

929
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,560
Her husband, the jerk-off

930
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,820
Has ruined my country

931
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,160
That's all I know

932
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,080
For today

933
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,400
Sincerely, D. Cox

934
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:28,100
Thank you, Dewey Cox

935
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,540
That's from his great biopic

936
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,000
Walk Hard

937
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,940
And now we'll go back

938
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,660
To the Wotan Doctor Band

939
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,840
Of 22X Day

940
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,980
Including Reverend Angry Larry

941
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,120
And X

942
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,860
But I took no photos

943
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,380
That night

944
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,020
So I don't know

945
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,980
Who was on drums

946
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,160
Or who else was there

947
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,100
Really, or

948
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,640
Anyway, but

949
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,900
They're doing

950
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,380
Free Bird

951
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,000
Hey, you just don't know music

952
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,800
I'm sorry, sir

953
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,640
I can't believe it

954
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,340
This is my day

955
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,700
Play it again

956
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,200
But play it right this time

957
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,180
Dr. Drummond

958
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,120
Would you get down

959
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,300
On your hands and knees

960
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,180
And be a mic stand for me?

961
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,700
For the next half hour

962
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,440
On these ugly gravel rocks

963
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,260
Because I need a mic stand

964
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,440
To put this mic on

965
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
If I put it up on stage

966
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,260
It would be all distorted

967
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,720
Here's a mic stand

968
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,760
But it's not big enough

969
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,680
I need a bigger

970
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,560
Usually I use a chair

971
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,180
Look, but it has two glasses in it

972
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,820
That doesn't matter

973
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,040
It needs to be bigger

974
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:39,740
Look

975
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,300
Hold on

976
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:42,820
Look

977
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,520
Here comes the challenge

978
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,400
One two three

979
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,520
Two three

980
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,060


981
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,140
And the music

982
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,460
Will not stop

983
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,940
It's a busy world

984
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:07,940


985
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,000
This might never be

986
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,000


987
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,000


988
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,220
So just

989
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,220


990
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,220


991
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,720
That no one

992
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:10,720


993
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,020
Who is

994
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,620
In need

995
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,060
Of what

996
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,100
You're

997
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,660
97

998
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,340
guitar solo

999
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,160
guitar solo

1000
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,160
guitar solo

1001
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,160
guitar solo

1002
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,620
guitar solo

1003
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,420
I drank all my booze.

1004
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,960
I hate when that happens.

1005
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,080
I got one again.

1006
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,760
Hey, was that Freebird?

1007
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,460
That was Freebird, yes.

1008
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,000
At least that's what the drunk guy who lives downstairs said.

1009
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:34,940
I mean, I've got every show original elements on hard drives and CDs and stuff,

1010
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,900
but finding them is hard.

1011
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,280
That was a lot of hard drives ago.

1012
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,880
I know, that's a lot of work.

1013
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,900
Just think of all the petroleum she dyed.

1014
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,300
I think that's plastic products.

1015
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,900
They're not plastic.

1016
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:56,660
They're mostly metal and rare toxic minerals that come only from China and Africa and other communists.

1017
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,060
CDs?

1018
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:57,760
What?

1019
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:58,920
CDs?

1020
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,280
No, no, no, I'm talking about hard drives.

1021
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

1022
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,640
Oh, God, people laugh at you if you admit that you store things on optical media.

1023
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,000
My son actually said to me,

1024
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,100
Dad, I think you're the last guy I know that still stores things.

1025
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,280
I think you're the last guy I know that still stores things on optical media.

1026
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,420
And I thought to myself,

1027
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:24,560
Yeah, well, when the big thermonuclear pulse wipes out the entire internet,

1028
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,240
I'll still have all my stuff.

1029
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,940
Because it's on optical media.

1030
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,500
Just don't expose it to a hydrogen bomb blast in the open.

1031
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,340
That'll wipe it out.

1032
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,940
But who cares?

1033
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,080
You wouldn't be around to listen to it anyway.

1034
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,540
Yeah.

1035
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:40,780
Yeah.

1036
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:41,620
Yeah.

1037
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,020
Yeah.

1038
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,000
Yeah.

1039
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:43,120


1040
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1041
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1042
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1043
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1044
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1045
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1046
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1047
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1048
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1049
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1050
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1051
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1052
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1053
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1054
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1055
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1056
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1057
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1058
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1059
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1060
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,160


1061
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,720
If they have all of their electronics fried,

1062
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,220
they'd rather be dead after that.

1063
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,880
Well, their whole body is just an exempted gas.

1064
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,540
And they have to be the one to be the fart catcher, so to speak.

1065
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,660
No, that's only if you're on the internet too much.

1066
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,740
That won't happen to me.

1067
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,800
I still walk my dogs.

1068
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,960
Speaking of which, when we end the show, we can walk the dogs again.

1069
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,700
Hint, hint.

1070
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,960
See, I'm just like the dogs now.

1071
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,460
We're going to go out.

1072
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,160
We're going to go out.

1073
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,920
This might be a good juncture.

1074
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,740
I must remove myself, but I shall return.

1075
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,200
Uh-oh.

1076
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,460
I think I know what that means.

1077
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,580
It means she's coming back.

1078
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,580
And that doesn't mean anything.

1079
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:54,600
Silence will heal my wounds.

1080
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:54,600


1081
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,780
That's about time when we prove 67 seconds.

1082
00:44:59,780 --> 00:44:59,780


1083
00:44:59,780 --> 00:44:59,800
That's getting us there in less than a second.

1084
00:44:59,800 --> 00:44:59,800


1085
00:44:59,800 --> 00:44:59,800


1086
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,980
There we go.

1087
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,160
That's getting us there in less than a second.

1088
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,860
Thank you.

1089
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,280
Thank you.

1090
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:48,840
Thank you.

1091
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:23,840
Thank you.

1092
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:49,740
Thank you.

1093
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,260
Thank you.

1094
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,660
Thank you.

1095
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:20,440
Thank you.

1096
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:43,520
Thank you.

1097
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,580
Thank you.

1098
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,720
Thank you.

1099
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,340
Thank you.

1100
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:43,540
Thank you.

1101
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,680
Thank you.

1102
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,160
Thank you.

1103
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,140
Thanks for watching!

1104
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,620
Thanks for watching!

1105
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,660
Thanks for watching!

1106
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,300
Thanks for watching!

1107
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:10,260
Thank you, psycho skeletons, for that song called I'm Immune to Rabies.

1108
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,820
Well, Princess, we've done our duet.

1109
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,200
You know, we should learn let's duet.

1110
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,020
Yes, we should.

1111
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:24,860
From the Walk Harder to Do It cubs story.

1112
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,440
In ways that make us feel good.

1113
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,800
That would get everybody all turned on.

1114
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,220
Yes.

1115
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,580
So I'm tired. Let's go.

1116
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,000
Bye.

1117
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,680
Bye-yi-yi-yi.

1118
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,680
Bye-yi-yi-yi.

1119
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,820
Hello, Darlene

1120
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,300
Hello, Mr. Cox

1121
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,640
You ready to sing one?

1122
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,840
I'm always ready

1123
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,480
All right

1124
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,020
In my dreams you're blowing me

1125
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,460
Some kisses

1126
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,240
That's one of my favorite things to do

1127
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,880
You and I could go down in history

1128
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,540
That's what I'm praying to do with you

1129
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,800
Let's do it

1130
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,860
In ways that make us feel good

1131
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,440
Let's do it

1132
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,040
And make that sacred sound

1133
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,740
Put two and two together

1134
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,140
Perfect harmony we've found

1135
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,200
We know it's only natural

1136
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,480
Let's do it

1137
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,860
I'm gonna beat off all my demons

1138
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:06,220
That's what love and Jesus are about

1139
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,180
Looking in your eyes

1140
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,820
I start believing

1141
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:19,900
Let's bring this whisper to a shout

1142
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,900
Let's do it

1143
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,980
In ways that make us feel good

1144
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,640
Let's do it

1145
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,040
And make that sacred sound

1146
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,440
Put two and two together

1147
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:36,440


1148
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:36,440


1149
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:36,440


1150
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,220
Perfect harmony we've found

1151
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,380
We know it's only natural

1152
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,580
Let's do it

1153
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,540
Did I hear you sighing?

1154
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,040
What are you implying?

1155
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,640
You look a little tired

1156
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,380
The music got me wired

1157
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,020
You're pretty good looking

1158
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,300
Boy, we're really cooking now

1159
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,940
I just wanna make out what you're saying

1160
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,340
Read my lips, it's what you're looking for

1161
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:29,520
Here I am, I'm sneaking up behind you

1162
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,920
You can always come in my back door

1163
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,180
Let's duet in ways that make us feel good

1164
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:49,200
Let's duet and make that sacred sound

1165
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:57,380
Put two and two together, perfect harmony we've found

1166
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,880
We know it's only natural, of course it's only natural

1167
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,900
God knows it's only natural, of course it's only natural

1168
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,180
Let's duet

1169
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:41,640
So maybe I'll see you there

1170
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,340
We can go down, down, down

1171
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,960
Different stations at subgenius.com

1172
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:18,240
Also, books, CDs, t-shirts, and of course, Bob

1173
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,960
And now, in some markets

1174
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,100
Now for the internet only, X-rated bonus feature

1175
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,300
I went shopping at Heinen's the other day

1176
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,620
So did she

1177
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,560
Heinen's is a...

1178
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,880
A Cleveland, very small chain, I guess

1179
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,100
I love to shop at Heinen's

1180
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,640
Yeah, well it's got a funny name, Heinen's

1181
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,780
Sounds like Heine

1182
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,900
Hehehe

1183
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,360
Hehehe

1184
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:46,700
Heine

1185
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,280
I forgot to bring anything to the X-Data

1186
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,280
Yeah, the auction

1187
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,080
I feel kinda bad about that, but

1188
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,220
Yeah, get out of here, you lousy, you two-bit cheapskate

1189
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,880
Hey, I, um

1190
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,880
Previously, I was in a shop

1191
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:08,980
For six years, I brought all my nice DVDs

1192
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:09,560
Yeah

1193
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,140
But, uh, I finally ended up with, uh

1194
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,220
These are the ones I wanna keep

1195
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,500
You know, total crap, but

1196
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,460
Well, I kept my most obscure LPs

1197
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,960
And we donated the rest to, uh

1198
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,280
Weirdsville Records in Detroit

1199
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,060
You can find all my old Hendrix albums there

1200
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,000
They're scratched all to hell, dude

1201
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,280
Dude, but

1202
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,020
You can find all of our old albums there

1203
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,840
We were cleaning, we were moving last year

1204
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,160
And, uh, I know there must have been tons of our stuff

1205
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,920
At the auction, Bulldata auction

1206
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,540
This time, I only brought four or five things

1207
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,040
But they're really big

1208
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,020
And really kind of special

1209
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,800
Believe it or not, in that box over there

1210
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,500
Is a dickhead mask

1211
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,820
That's right, folks

1212
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,000
Uh, yes

1213
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,240
I wouldn't tell you that, but

1214
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,120
I'll say it again

1215
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,200
There's no other polite way to put it

1216
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,740
It's a dickhead mask

1217
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,400
It's pretty old and may smell a bit funky

1218
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,240
But it's only been worn on human heads

1219
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,640
I think

1220
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,400
It's way too big for a human dick

1221
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,340
It will transform you into a huge dick

1222
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,600
If you weren't a huge dick already

1223
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,200
You can be with this mask

1224
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,600
Made by Pudi Flang Damarong about 40 years ago

1225
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,020
It's quite realistic

1226
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,340
It's rubber, it's handmade

1227
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,280
But it's definitely

1228
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,820
Well, I'd just pull it out

1229
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,820
I'll just whip it out

1230
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,300
Just whoop it out, Reverend Stang

1231
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,380
Whoop out your dick, Reverend Stang

1232
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,500
Whoop it out, whoop it out hard

1233
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,440
Whoop out your giant dick

1234
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,240
Is a sentence you could legitimately say this X-Day

1235
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,720
Show us your giant dick, Reverend Stang

1236
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,880
It wouldn't be a metaphor

1237
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,180
Show us your giant dickhead

1238
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,780
If I can

1239
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,440
If you can find it, if you can put your hands on it

1240
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,720
That's how I hurt my shoulder

1241
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,440
Grab it

1242
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,220
Reaching out to you

1243
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:05,940
For your dickhead

1244
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,560
Oh, good lord

1245
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:13,320
He's now picking up a two-ton box

1246
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,160
Oh, it's only about 200 pounds

1247
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,620
Reverend Stang, don't you know

1248
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,020
You're not supposed to be picking up heavy things like that

1249
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,260
Tsk, tsk, tsk

1250
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,760
And here it comes

1251
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,820
Drumroll, please

1252
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,760
Oh, that's beautiful

1253
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,820
It is

1254
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,500
It's a giant

1255
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,080
It's really a giant dickhead

1256
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,820
Yeah, it seems to be a little flat down here

1257
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,860
To go down your t-shirt

1258
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,880
Oh, man, it's really losing its skin

1259
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,880
Yes

1260
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,120
It looks a little too real

1261
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,260
But an artisan could repair it

1262
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,620
And make it into a nice new dickhead mask

1263
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,940
It's rather, rather circumcised

1264
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,460
It is rather uncircumcised

1265
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,020
And then there are the slits on the opposite side

1266
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,160
For you to be able to look out and smell

1267
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,220
The world around you

1268
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,220
As you're being a dickhead

1269
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,400
You could actually

1270
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:09,860
Fuck

1271
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,360
This dick

1272
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,260
Reverend Stang is explaining that this dick can be fucked

1273
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,320
Don't let the clowns get to this thing

1274
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,720
Don't give this to the clowns

1275
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,640
It is a thing of beauty

1276
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,700
I agree

1277
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:33,360
Oh, and friends

1278
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,220
Some of you might want to check out the video

1279
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,140
Check out a website

1280
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,080
Blog type thing

1281
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:43,940
Called stupidamerica.net

1282
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,940
Stupid America

1283
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,420
They have a Stupid America award

1284
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,720
It's about stupid stuff

1285
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,020
So, yeah

1286
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,460
Stupidamerica.net

1287
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,480
Praise God

1288
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:12,390
