Stir it up!
At last I have control of your radio tubes!
And I do too!
Good! This is Ren Huak.
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.
Happy, happy, joy, joy, happy, happy, joy, joy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, joy, joy, joy.
And keep listening, you idiots!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Else I shall kill you!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.
The truth that I'm about to give you has exploded...
Mm-hmm.
...in power!
Woo!
Woo!
Woo!
Thank you, though. I'm enjoying this.
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel lies man's most formidable challenge.
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters long thought extinct.
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet.
To rule the planet as they once had thousands of years back.
...and that ain't all...
...since...
Science was baffled and powerless.
This is confusing!
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.
Ha, ha, ha.
Well, things are looking up.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
A once proud civilization now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful
ally, Bob.
We must end this, Bob.

From 1997, I calculate.
This cassette master here says,
Hour of Slack 356, Joe Riley Barrage and KPFA with Stang,
which means I must have been in California and done a show at KPFA in Berkeley
with Puzzling Evidence and all them.
And I know that Joe Riley did this incredible,
incredible sort of a collage, media barrage tape.
In fact, it says here some sort of note that I believe this is a rerun of a rerun
because it was run as Hour of Slack 681,
now being Hour of Slack number 918.
Only this is really number 1,608 and we're rerunning it yet again
because...
The great St. Joe Riley of Dallas died very unexpectedly of a heart attack back in 2007.
You can Google Joe Riley subgenius and there he'll be on Wikipedia and subgenius.com.
Riley is spelled R-I-L-E-Y, not the usual way.
You can see Joe's amazing video barrage TV show, The Hypnotic Eye,
on...
The subgenius TV channel on Roku.
OSI 74 is the name of that channel.
And on YouTube.
Joe's Hypnotic Eye is also on YouTube.
It's well worth it.
As you can hear by the audio barrage editing he performed way back in the 90s used in this episode.
And the other reason for a rerun right now is that I had an unexpected heart attack this weekend in 2017.
But I was helicoptered to Fort Worth.
Implanted with a stent.
And sent home to face a low-salt, low-fat diet and very, very high medical bills.
So, I'm a little behind, but otherwise I'm fine as you can hear.

Welcome to yet another Bulldada Audio Barrage tape.
Volume 1 couldn't possibly hold all the eclectic.
Eclectic propaganda needed to become a complete raving lunatic for Bob.
On this tape, you'll hear rantings from every two-bit.
The movie.
Actor ever born.
Cold precision auto monster boys.
And from hundreds of dysfunctional infortunates across our globe.
Oh.
Hi there.
How do you do?
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.
Thank you.
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.
Ah!
Come on.
This is a new episode of the Vietnamese radio show.
But I'd like to inform you, audience, or give a few minutes for Bob's radio.
Subgenius's reporter.
What the hell are you doing, Lee?
I'm watching Bob.
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Crusty used to be.
You backstabber.
You traitor.
You...
Snap out of it, Bart.
Um, I lost my job.
I had a job.
Now I don't...
Ah!
I want you to be like me.
I want you to worship me.
I want you to be like who I am.
I want you to be like me.
I want you to be like me.
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have, the courage that I have, the compassion that I have, the love that I have, the all-encompassing mercy that I have.
I want you to be what I am and something greater.
I want you to give you more than I have.
I want you to be greater than I am.
And if you don't want to go this route, then go to hell where you want to.
But don't bother me.
I really didn't broken, you know?
Heal my toe, honey.
Heal my back.
Heal my bottom.
But don't you heal my mind because my mind is too sick.
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.
Jesus said that every human being was a God.
It is written that you are God.
I'm a God and you're a God.
And I'm a God and I'm going to stay a God until you recognize that you're a God.
And when you recognize you're a God, I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.
You are a God.
But until I see all of you know who you are, I'm going to be very much what I am.
God Almighty!
God Almighty!
God Almighty!
Call the next defendant.
Kay Bridges to the bar.
Silence, Kay.
Yes.
Your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.
Murdered?
But I never murdered anyone.
Not with a sword.
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell with your malicious tongue.
It would have been a thousand times better had you murdered them with a sword.
Oh, no.
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.
I only spoke the truth.
No, Kay.
You spoke that which was true.
You said that you wanted to be true.
But granting that you did only speak the truth, who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others?
The serpent with his venom and his ire, with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,
with his deadly call and fatal fang is the only fit emblem of the man or woman who stabs and kills the character of another.
Let your own words condemn you.
May 10th, 1973.
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.
Well, when you've known her as long as I have, you'll really get to know her.
What do you mean?
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think.
But I'm not one to say anything.
You just call me when you need advice.
Well, I've got a lot to do. I have to go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh, no.
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.
I don't believe I want any part of it.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. My God, have mercy on me.
I never realized. Have mercy on me.
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue, have driven the babes away from my church.
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?
There is no mercy for you.
You are sentenced to hell where you will want be haunted forever by the souls you sent there.
Oh, no. I don't want to go to hell.
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.
I didn't know. I only repeated what I heard.
You didn't know that the most frivolous of all crimes is the crime of gossip.
Your record will speak for itself.
Oh, no.
But, yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs, daughter of Connie.
Oh, that felt so good.
I forgot.
Oh, look out!
Cleveland Donut Dunkin'.
Call her!
Call her right outside the building. Come on.
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence you had there.
It was almost a half second.
Oh, my goodness!
Come on!
That'll last forever in my memory. First time ever.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, nice and clear.
Oh, we got some more.
Why do I feel that they're...
Bergman knew how to use silence.
The silence of the soul.
Sure is nice out here. I hope the boat comes, though.
Fellini knew how to use silence.
Gary said he was silent.
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands...
Yeah, I know. Don't touch him.
...a giant flaming orc...
Oh, yes, Mr. Boatman.
Please, Mr. Boatman.
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue and it's all black and icky.
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.
No, no.
And be prepared to go past my dog.
My three-headed dog's cerebrus.
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates, the gateway.
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
What's he reading from?
It's a B-movie script.
I don't know. What's about this three-headed son of a dog?
I don't know. It's some kind of a...
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.
It is getting hot in here.
Yeah, I've seen that movie.
It's gonna be the Virgil movie.
Mmm, yeah.
It sure is nice out here in the ocean.
I think you forget all about the ocean.
Oh, look out.
Oh, look out.

Oh, yeah.

Slack from right next door!
Here you go!

Slack shows, my ladies and gentlemen!
You Slack!

You Slack!
We have you Slack!
Just remember,
the food is in the ghetto.
Nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner

and no one received it.
You get them in a corner, they're extremely dangerous.
I want my Slack!

It's defundable!
This?
You can't prove anything.
Extremely dangerous, aren't they?
I think you can sense the hands of these people
that we are nonviolent people, but we are extremely dangerous.
You know what you are?

If you have the chance, you can have your Slack.
Money is Slack!

Slack is green.

Slack is government control for your protection.
I want more Slack.
Slack is not for everyone.
You cannot take my Slack away.
Slack can be taken by prescription.
I want more Slack!
I want more Slack!
I want more Slack!
I want more Slack!
I want more Slack!
Slack is great.
Slack!


Slack is great.
Slack is free.
Just remember...
You don't have anything on me that I care about,
because everything that you have on me,
I've let it all hang right out for everybody to see.
Now you forget to worry about yourself.
I don't mind losing my life.
What about you?
I don't mind losing my reputation.
What about you? I don't mind being tortured. What about you? I'm just no longer afraid,
and I've lost interest in this old world of capitalist sin. Racism, I've lost interest in it.
So if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with filthy-minded people
that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies,
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst, I would just as soon bring it all to a gallant,
a glorious screaming in.

Your ultimate goal on this adventure through inner space
will be the very hub of this microcosmic solar system, the atomic nucleus.
Its capabilities are almost unimaginable.
It is a million times smaller than the atom, and yet it contains 99% of the atom's weight.
The density of the nucleus is such that if we had one cubic centimeter, half a teaspoon,
it would weigh 100 million tons.

I asked myself this.
Who are you, Luther Higgs, to be the guest speaker at this luncheon?
I thought about my answer about being guest speaker for a long time.
What is a guest speaker?
Let me clarify this.
I have been called brave.
What is brave?
Let me clarify this.
Of course we all know that it is short for bravery.
That goes without even being said.
But it is also a symbol of another thing.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Thank you, sir.






Thank you for having me.

I promise you that.

I just try to help, folks.
That's all I do, is try to come on and help.
Not that the job pays well.
Never has on this planet.
Did you ever notice anybody ever tries to help, we shoot them?
Did you ever notice that?
Ah!

You're welcome.
Tweet.

the tweet.
There ain't no tweet.
Here it comes, here it comes, look out, look out.
Cleve told me
of an incident
that happened to him the other day.
He was standing in a nearly deserted
Boston subway station.
Tell it, brother, tell it.
There was a drunk standing on the other side
across from him.
And he said, what's your name?
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name,
said Bob.
That's right, he said Bob.
And the drunk said, all the best
drunks are named Bob.
In fact, the greatest
drunk on earth is named
Bob.
And then that man got down on his hands
and knees and he licked that third
rail. How many of you
listening by radio can lick that third
rail? How many of you have been
sitting the way Bob wanted you to?
Huh?
You've just been sitting on your little fannies,
your tokuses.
Sitting there
praising Bob,
singing hymns to Bob,
but you're afraid to get out there
and whoop, pee dog for Bob, huh?
Aren't you being a little harsh
with these people?
Oh, you Californians
are so laid back.
We're into violence and hate in Texas.
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice
guru.
We thought he was a good guy.
We thought he was on our side.
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo
just to praise him.
Just to praise his sweet name.
I didn't get any ammo.
I got some PCP.
And he was in recognition for his efforts
in the land of our people.
Well, at least that.
There's little kids in China
who don't even get any PCP.
None of the sacred PCP of the church.
Ah, yes.
Many people meet here on the beach
to call Sternow.
There's the little Sternow at the bottom of the hall.
Oh, look, I see him now.
He's been poked and prodded awake now
by the bad show.
Let's hurt him now.
Oh, no.
Subgenius Corruption.
Uh, Energon crystals.
Our muscles flexing.
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.
Okay, here it comes.
Here it comes.
Look out, look out.
Sternow's love muscle is flexing.
Oh, watch out, man.
Everybody stand back.
I'm listening.
Stand back.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Excuse me.
It bumped into me.
And you thought P-Dawg was ugly.
Yeah.
Don't get any on you.
Don't get any on you.
You hadn't seen nothing until Sternow
whipped out of bed.
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.
That damn thing's got three heads.
I haven't seen anything.
Oh, big day!
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?
Only one foreskin's infected, though.
Something unwholesome about that critter.
Don't look at it too close up, little show.
There's kind of a capacity there for isolation.
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could
and then give you a call so it's the bad show again.
Well, good.
We're gonna take those chromosomes and DNA fragments
from the subgenius Rue and somehow mediate a recombination
between those two types.
That's what we're gonna do.
Just plop them into the protoplasm and let them realign on the wall.
Why not?
Why not?
Well, it's all right.
We're gonna take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head.
That's the way it goes.
No!
No!
Don't inject the head!
You'll bring it back to unholy life!
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course,
leaving a trail of sizzling blood.
It's like a little snail trail.
It's decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.
As the head floated and levitated along, it kept uttering the word,
Why?
And it realized its tragic loss and the tragedy that it had invented for itself
and sunk into a depression.
Mumbling and muttering, mindlessly champing with its jaws in a peephole.
But listen.
Please listen.
Once upon a time, long, long ago, a lovely queen sat by her window sewing.
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.
Is that a boy or a girl?
Is it a faggot?
It's a dyke.
No, it's a hippie.
A communist?
Perhaps it's a drag queen or a woman.


A washrag queen.
Probably a speed freak.
Or a pothead.
Or a muffin queen.
Look at her, it's just a whore.
Or maybe a gold digger.
Or she's a hustler.
Or some sort of intellectual.
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.
It could be a bag tag.
Or maybe it's a bee girl.
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.
Some day she knew he would come home and she would be the queen of the world.












And she would come and carry her off to his castle in the clouds.
And I often imagine that a girl is actually a boy and use her accordingly.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of us all?
She said.
And the mirror replied.
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.
Interesting.
Thanks, Dad.

What do they do in Texas on the weekend?
Oh, drink the bloody blood of Christian babies.

So call now for your free no obligation information.
Oh my God.
Coming up next.

Like a lot of women, I've discovered recently one of my breasts is larger than the other.
And by saying that phrase to you, it will now go out and be stuck in your heads, thousands
of other people's heads, and I'll be free of the curse, I hope.
It, it, it all, it all comes at me, there's too much of it, I can't take it.
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't do one thing at a time.
You just have time to wash.
Mirror, mirror on the wall.
Who is the fairest of us all?
You sure as hell.
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.
A box?
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.
But she was not really alone, she found.
All the little woodland animals were her friends.
You're all right.
And chirping and chattering happily,
they led her to a new home.
Hey, what kind of place is this?
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.
Looks like a rogues gallery.
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.
Shut up, shut up!
You're dopey.
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.
She took one bite and sank lifeless to the floor.
And that ain't all.
Now you drop dead, you nitwit.
God bless you.
It's a beautiful thing.
Praise Bob.
Why not?
The man with the plan.
Focusing up now on the future of America.
The world domination.
The whole superior mutant.
Marching across history or the face of it.
Well, if you go over here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian,
you do find there is a whole section of...
of WADADS, mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.
It's a wonderful theatrical world.
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but now everybody's doing it.
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule ride.
You cross the mutant with the normal and you get some sort of mutation,
but now the mutants are doing it with other mutants.
It's almost become, I don't know, mainstream.
It's...
I know, it's really sad to see the best minds of our generation,
doing all that 50's stuff over again the same way they did it back then.
And now, you know, now it's almost like uncool to be anything but mutant, you know?
I mean, it's sort of like...
It...
Well, you know what I'm saying?
I mean, it's...
Yeah, you're saying it...
Yeah, exactly.
And on top of that, it's a mutant and...
It is.
It's like, be different.
For the sake of being the same.
Yes, that's right.
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.
And I...
That's really no better than the normals.
I mean, when you get right down to it.
Here on show.
Yeah.
Well, that's why the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of our lives.
Then we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutations.
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.
I just wanna be me.
Not the me.
Well, me, for ye, is the.
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.
You gotta be the you me.
I gotta be the I me.
Well, this is no longer the me generation.
That was last generation.
So perhaps it's the...
Yeah, but I'm sterile.
So, you know, I'm kinda stuck with it.
Well, uh...
If I could reproduce, then I might have a ye generation.
I think it's the same thing.


Well, I'm not gonna be the me generation.






I'm gonna be the ye generation.



Ye, that's true.
No, no, ye.
Ye, that's true.
Right.
These get confusing after a while.
Why not?
Reverend Stanley, let me ask you.
If Bob's number is 999, whose number is 911?
So I know who you are.
God bless you.
Hello.
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated, and if you were to die, how would you like




Come on, that's a pretty unprofessional obsession right there.
Well, it's true, but it's all we got.
Well, we'll just have to be cartographers of the head.
And it's our duty to explore the wilderness.
Artillery-like art.
This new gray matter preserve.
Just don't look up its neck stump.
You might see something you wish you'd never seen.
It was an ugly sight.
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.
Yeah, I know what you do with that neck stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.
I know exactly what you've been doing with that neck stump.
I've detected the potential many times in the past
and have been dazzled by the ill-matched, intimidating circumstances
that this relationship has provided for me.
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know,
inhaling deeply of the church air.
Of the air.
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?
What?
We're going to go to the caller.
Hold on.
Okay.
Sir, I know who you are.
God bless you.
Why did that nasty caller divert it before we could even get our hooks into him?
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel
when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head.
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed tonight.
Might have.
Yeah, that's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues,
as I'm often doing in the show.
Yes, all you gas-fans trapped out there.
The grass-fanned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.
The clues are buried in the show.
But that board stood up like a Christmas tree, Commander.
Well, the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions.
A tidal influence, we would say.
Yeah, that's true.
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.
Yeah.

That's right.
They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.
Well, we'll...
The water's best for brewing.
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries,
which yet lay beyond those that we had deduced had to the security of the poop-dog hat.
A monster, eight feet tall, half-man, half-beast.
Perhaps the elusive missing link between humans and apes.
Oh, it's a little bit of a mystery.
In the Himalayas, it's called Yeti.
Yeti.
Yeti.
Yeti.
I was cursed by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?
Why don't we catch them?
You must decide.
For you are the jury.
It's not my...
It's not my...
intention to delay this court. God bless you. Wouldn't that be weird?
There's a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave? I say,
I believe in everything. You don't mean that. Yes. Even that? Yes. Yes, I, yes, yes, I do.
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth. I believe in every philosophy,
every religion, every ideology, everything that exists. And that don't give me no room for no
argument. If the world is wrong, then right your own self. That's something to think about, sure.
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness. And I believe if a man's
down, kick him. That's right. If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above. God bless you.
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street. So we walked on down and stood in
the grassy slope just this side of the triple.
Underpass. The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president. So she said,
look, there's the president's car. Get a picture of him. He turned to us and waved.
He faced forward again.
I lifted my Polaroid. Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.
Ow!
That's a pile of horse manure, son.
God bless you.
I don't know.
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.
Just because you're not the same, it doesn't mean you're weird or strange. You're just different
and being different is being great.
You too. Isn't that a risk?
Just because you're a different one, there's no telling what you might become.
Thinking different.
Being different is being great.
God bless you.
It's not who you aren't. It's who you are. And being yourself is being great.
From the church of the subgenius women.
Ah!
Let's get into trouble, baby.
I'm, uh, I think it's time to play some music because we're shi-
nothing better.

















juggernock that can't be stopped. But Mike, let's be serious. And squabble. Well, all right,
what's a four-letter word for, oh wait, hold on. What's a four-letter word for pronate? Food.
How about prolapse? Just prolapsed on me. Oh, you're terribly sorry. Bear with me a moment.
There's a fond analog that, oh wait, I'm gazing into the mirror now. Okay, I'll eat it. I'll eat it.
Okay, we're going to go with the menu. Let's see, punch up 3D food. Okay, well,
how about the spooky strips of light and the, I'll take the dead moth, the dead moth shining pie.
At dead moth drive-thru plaza, the pie is our profession.
I'll take the dead moth.

The wall, the fluttered wall soup.
Now available at Wall Drugs.
Yeah, and the dipping French woman.
Okay, thanks, here.
From Noble Slaveway.
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.
Wait a minute, Ivan's about to squeeze again.
Oh, man.
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III about a $1 billion Iraqi fight.
Yeah, it makes me think of Meese, too.
I don't know.
Jake mentions a possible payment or a contribution.
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.
You know, basically, ancient sense of smell just kind of makes you think of Meese
when, well, when the whole building squeezes like that together.
And suddenly it dawned on a cooker friend that things had changed a bit.
Rappaport hired a long-time Meese friend E. Robert Wallach to get him a piece of that.
Well, I just went to the bathroom there and almost finished the stark fifth.
But then I forgot.
I turned around.
I flushed it before I even thought about it.
And so more shows are probably going to be backing up the pipes.
Oh, God.
I need a gift.
More shows.
And I really, I just have no idea what to get him.
More you.
I know just what you mean, and I have just the gift you need.
But I can't sell it.
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.
I will not tolerate any outbursts.
Donations.
Any talking among yourselves.
Any laughter.
Nor anything that would interfere with the normal, orderly presentation of testimony.
Ah!
Oh, a radio!
With your mid-afternoon news.
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO in today's sunny, smogless skies.
The official...
...punished every 300 days.
Oh, they put a mic there?
Ah!



That's a good one.
Oh, it's coming alive.
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the toilet.
That's Mobius.
Mobius, hey, hey.
Look out, Mike.
Look out, look out.
Don't pull me in there.
Oh, God.
Ow!
And children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.
Is the new...
...inradiated food...
...is the new Starfish out yet?
Yeah, it's out.
A little listener asking a real question.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
Stop it.
Yeah, it's out.
It's $40.
But let's go over that again.

I don't, I don't, I don't...
You can use all...
...start fist.
...monster?
The long, long, long-awaited start fist of removal is indeed almost finished, just as
we've been saying for the last two years.
And this time, we really do mean it.
And, uh...
Whoop, there went that...
Shoot, we flushed it away again.
Now I've got to start all over again.
Yeah, you see, he back-flushed these things, and there's a little collar.
He's floating up.
He'll be floating face up.
There he is.
It'll be out soon, but we can tell you what the theme of the next issue is.
Get the plunger.
Get the show plunger.
Get that little collar up out of there.
The theme of the, uh, new start fist is not you hearing.
Oh, I'm afraid he's drowned.
Yeah, well...
Put it down as slowly as you can.
Oh, it's only an overshot.
Like Patty said.
On the floor.
Put it on the floor.
Gently.
Now, just what could have happened to get such a piece of tripe?
You have no idea.
What I've gone through in the last three months.
Sometimes I'm perfect and all.
Mentally.
I sit for hours and hours looking in the mirror.
Hoping and praying for the slightest sign of my physical change.
And then it comes.
Then I feel myself going back.
Like, the animal instinct.
I try to fight it.
I try to fight it with all my willpower.
And I fail.
William.
William, what am I going to do?
What am I going to do?
Fight.
That's all you can do.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.


Oh.

















We better get back
because it will be dark soon
and they mostly come at night.
Mostly.
On O.B.O.D.
Translate.
Sure is preferred, it is.
I like that.
What is the truth
about rock music?
I think it's an octopus.
Yes.
Plato said
when the music of a society
changes,
the whole society will change.
Certainly.
I got married so I could retire.
Lennon said
the best and the quickest way
to undermine any society
is through
its music.
Can you think of anything else?
No, you've covered it all.
Satan has taken music
and he has counterfeited it.
See that?
Convoluted.
Convoluted it.
Twisted it.
Exploited it.
And now he's using
the hammer, hammer, hammer,
hammer, hammer.
Hammer, hammer, hammer,
hammer, hammer.
A message into the minds
and the lifestyles
of this generation.
And that ain't all.
All sins.
What kind of ungodly being was that?
Don't you believe in reincarnation?
A wise guy, huh?
Quick, kill him.
Subdenies in space.
They took me up to the top
of that space needle
and they showered me
with beautiful gifts
and beautiful girls.
Moon babes.
Wow, what moon babes?
Yeah, look at those satellites.
Look at them spiked heels.
Oh, that one's looting me now.
I can't tell whether those are convexities
or concavities, but that looting

Are they some kind of moon babes?
I say, do that again.
Boy, can you dig those potatoes
out of the craters.
Hey.
Oh, I love it.
Oh.
Tiny flatulence move through
this microscopic stool
as if they owned the place.
What happened?
What, did something die in here?
Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan raised the pocket.
Just more shit.
It's that dinosaur ink
that Hal's been sitting on
for the last 20 days.
Look, it's cracking.
I hear a scratching, a scratching noise.
He's not even aware
that his own child is being born now.
It's got the head of a boy
and the body of a Tyrannosaurus.
Yes, but it smokes Shermans.
Do you think that it could be?
And it's still talking.
The PLO chief rates full pardon for safe sex.
Oh, I just don't know about this guy.
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev bought
a covert aid for erosion.
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child
on the show and didn't even notice.
And so we're going to cook this little rare creature
up for breakfast.
Yes, this single living example
of a homosaurus sapiens.
It's Jack and Amy.
Just what do you mean?
The show fought its way to the front of the castle.
I'm killing this creature.
Or maybe I am.
You.
You.
The show thought to itself,
should I swim across the moat
or should I crawl through the mud?
Or should you crawl six miles over the broken glass
and radioactive mine tears
just to hear our program?
How many callers?
How many records?
How many eardrums?
We're going to talk about some of the subtle racism
and sexism in the bibles.
The sexism's pretty well accepted,
but we will talk about the racism
because it's so much more hidden
and it's so much more dangerous,
What genocide the wretched can justify with the racism in it?
Through devious ways, Satan has tainted the Bible,
and they justify their racism on the fact that Cain, the son of Adam and Eve, went off to a great city.
How is there a city if Cain was the only first son of man?
Well, this city was not occupied by man, but the beast of the field.
And Mormons and many other religions still teach at Blacks
that the descendants of Cain and the beast of the field.
We single out these tainted Bibles, even St. John and St. Luke versions,
so you will know that ours is the only Bible that should be read.
Versions of the Bible which have racism in them is going to be exposed,
and then we will announce how we will edit the Bible.
Well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to,
the edits of the Bible,
the edits of wonderful little sound bits,
holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,
that was all edited by St. Joe Riley.
Oh, praise St. Joe Riley.
Saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others.
There's a song called Used Slack,
buried in that.
That was by Out of Band Experience, OBE.
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.
On the commercial for our new product,
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy,
was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.
Oh, yes, up there in New York land.
The background music that's on right now,
of course,
Jay Condom from his album,
Zombo Frockland.
And now, this.
Well, no, how about this?
How about the post office box of the Church of the Subgenius?
I know that so many of you have been sitting there
with your pens in your hands,
just aching to write down that address
where you can write for free information
about all the other...
all the other services of our...
our beloved Church.
Ah, yes.
And, uh, that post office box number,
we'll just write to Bob.
That's all you need to do.
Write to Bob at post office box one...
eight one four one seven
in beautiful Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
That zip is four four one one eight.
Once again, that's box...
one eight four one seven.
One eight four one seven.
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
Four four one one eight.
And now this.
The dead hours of the morning
between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.
This is the time when women
who have been many hours in labor finally deliver.
And when the idea of the supernatural
seems the least implausible.
Mobius Rex is clambering around on top of the...
Rectum in propere se se rectus in curiae.
Amazing camera.
For those of you interested,
monitor number four will show Mobius.
At this time,
ancient superstitions and night fears
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.
The time when those who sleep are deep in their pains.
And this is the hour when the callers call.
The Church of the Subgenius radio show.
Hello?
Hello, you're on the air.
Cookie.
This is the show trying to bother Philo.
State short question, please.
What's for breakfast?
Cook fist cookie.
Cookie, this is Ivan.
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwatt.
Hey, hey, hey, I got him.
So we can hurt him.
How many presidents does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No, no, wait, wait.
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.
I get it?
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
Spooky bad show.
Cookie.
Oh, no.
Can we talk to little dude?
Don't listen to these men.
Not unless you have a connection to dog heaven.
Oh, no.
Friends, this is dog heaven.
And this is Philo Drumhead.
Hey, dog heaven.
Philo Drumhead.
He's woken up just to be here entertaining you in all of northern and central California.
No, I'm still asleep.
You are going to save the universe this time.
Yeah, that's right, Philo.
You have a link up to the sleep.
Be of good cheer.
Yeah.
Well, just tell us what you're dreaming about and we'll let you go eventually.
I'm dreaming about little dude.
What?
Your dog?
Your dog that you had five years ago?
Yes.
I've never forgotten the little chap who was so dear to us.
Still running out there in the fields of toxic substance.
That's what it is.
He's prancing and dancing through fields of clover and dioxin.
In that land where no cars are.
And the smell of good clean earth under his nails.
The only cars that are there are those that are run over by dogs.
Oh, those.
Yeah.
Little dogs.
That's Salvation and Infotation at www.subgenius.com.
Oh yes, I almost forgot.
Uh, friends, are you a subgenius minister yet?
Have you joined the Church of the Lord?


Probably my surety.




And I'm your friend and I am a subgenius.
And by that, I mean actually send in your $35 payable by PayPal or credit card on subgenius.com
where it says become an ordained minister or where it says stores.
And even if you have, do you have your well made Bob t-shirt from anticonformity.com?
Do you have your ARISE DVD?
Sure, you could watch it on the internet.
I'll do it.

But it's not the same.
And it isn't the same.
It hasn't been kissed by the lips of Princess Wee,
who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.
How about that?
You can still get those from us.
But yes, the $35 for the Minister's Pack,
you really ought to think about it, folks.
You don't have to meet any subgeniuses ever.
But you will have that option.
You can't come to X Day unless you're a member.
You can't go to the members-only kind of smarty-pants internet forum
called Scrub Genius.
I do a lot more there than on Facebook.
Because Facebook's just a bunch of gimme bobs,
people who can't even spell Bob's name right.
Do you know that, Princess Wee?
They can't even spell Bob's name right, half of them.
They leave off the quotes.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, gimme bobs.
You can tell.
It's so easy to tell.
Anyway, friends, we'll be back next week with more X Day recordings,
and hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.
Rotten house old dammit.
Do it over there, dammit.
The hound dog's doing fine.
Well, thank you.
Good night.
And praise Bob.
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.
