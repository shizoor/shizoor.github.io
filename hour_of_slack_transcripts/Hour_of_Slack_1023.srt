1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm committed to laying down PR News.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,880
President Bush is wrong.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,760
I disagree.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,400
The president said he's cracked down on dissidents.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,680
The president also said he's violent if they contact PR News.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,200
The U.N. Refugee Agency warns of PR outbreaks in Pennsylvania.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,720
The U.N. says former unsanitary president Bill Clinton is reading PR News in Washington.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Oh, please stop.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,180
This is genius.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,680
Oh, sick.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,560
Mom.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,820
Yeah.

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,660
Ladies and gentlemen, we take pride in presenting a thoughtful address by...

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,160
Adequated.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:51,840
Badass.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,540
Giant.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,800
Wizards.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,660
And dwarves.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,520
And we're all on a diet.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,540
And we're all on a diet.

21
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,100
They're ignorant.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,880
Fanatics.

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,180
Fools.

24
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,280
A giant, a wizard, or a dwarf.

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,280
Hello, boys and girls.

26
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,380
Overthrow the government and seize all private property.

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:07,680
Now.

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,380
Birth of a nation treacherous and filled with obstacles.

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,460
Rebell now.

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:11,820
Now.

31
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,540
Now is the time.

32
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,460
The new world begins.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,380
Hello, boys and girls.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
Overthrow the government.

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
Alien force invade.

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
Infest in government.

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,980
Call on the gym.

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,200
Bob.

39
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:23,540


40
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,420
Bob.

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,520
Bob.

42
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,100
Bob.

43
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,140
Bob.

44
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,140


45
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,140


46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,480
Yes.

47
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,620
Yes.

48
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,440
Yes.

49
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,640
Yes.

50
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,960
Yes.

51
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,040
Bob.com.

52
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,460
He has now been f-indicted, indicted, indicted, indicted, binning, binning, binning, binning,

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,740
blunderings, Bob.

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,600
He faces Bob Tom DeLay.

55
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,960
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt himself.

56
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,560
Finger.

57
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:41,840
Pain.

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,180
Release.

59
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,080
Irregularity.

60
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,520
Blunderings.

61
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,780
Bob.

62
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,500
Blunderings.

63
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,020
Move on.

64
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,480
Blunderings.

65
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:45,760
Crazy.

66
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,380
S-s-s-s-move on.

67
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,980
Violate.

68
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,480
That's insane.

69
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,020
Time.

70
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,100
Why not let Fidel Castro dream?

71
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
Gone in less than 30 minutes.

72
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,920
nutty funneling $10,000 why don't you give it to the Nazi corporate donations

73
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,420
it's ridiculous Bob yep yep to help support a child's healthy breast milk

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,560
good hello and facilitations I'm Izzy isn't your wacky

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,660
host for the how radio isn't done series on what used to be this program over the edge

76
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:36,120
however tonight we either suspend the how radio isn't done series or we end up incorporating

77
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,740
this program anomaly the one you are about to hear if you don't turn away to make this

78
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:52,360
how radio isn't done part 10 that's up to you here at UMN's KPFA outlet UMN's only outlet

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,800
you the listener will decide according to your own personal community standards

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:05,100
whether this concept makes any sense on the other hand it has already made a great deal of sense

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:14,100
c-e-n-t-s no show in the history of radio has ever been detected attracting a longer

83
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:22,440
listener attention span than last year's or was it oh two anyway the past mergings of over

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,020
the edge and the subgenius puzzling evidence show into five hours spectacular radio fillers have

85
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:37,720
proven to be with specific reservations among the highest audience ratings traps since gun smoke in

86
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,980
all of radio history therefore and with special reservations over the edge once again merges with

87
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,220
puzzling evidence and the whole subgenius directors of the board for this five-hour holiday earthcast

88
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,420
of the subgenius show

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,080
the subgenius executive banquet

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:20,840
live from the palm palms in the middle regions of the new world sector center downtown berkeley california with special reservations we are broadcasting the subgenius executive boards thanksgiving banquet as a public service designed to enhance your perception of their reality just a moment while I put the cd player on continuous

92
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,120
that's better

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:37,820
we published and

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,720
you can the

95
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:43,640
hospital

96
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,500
team

97
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,600
here

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
up

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,840
that's easy that of yours truly izzy isn't the banquet facilitator a psychological deflective

100
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,700
diversion which i spent six years training for so that now as a professional banquet facilitator

101
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,680
i am able to ease the way across any direction the twisted tables of such a confoundingly

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,240
contentious sit-down organization such as the subgenius church foundation of america

103
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,840
may take whenever they gather for this annual thanksgiving business like banquet

104
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,560
and right off the bat like a left field vampire let's go down now to the main banquet pit from my

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,160
broadcast booth high above them down to what this five-hour show is really all about

106
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:44,720
i see uh dr howe over by the asparagus cooler professor of esoteria at estonian u eating up a

107
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,020
storm

108
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,060
and now reverend ivan staying as risen to his feet from the head table of potheads about to attempt a

109
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,520
banquet opening remark

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,400
let's listen in as one of the disputed founders of the church of the subgenius addresses his near

111
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,000
equal fellow executives in the worldwide subgenius semi organized cult

112
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,360
let's talk a little bit about ivan and again right smack dab in the center and very very healthy looking

113
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,540
again you can see very symmetric good outflow here

114
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,000
center of circulation very evident i've been pummel grenade a

flattening homes in cutting power at least fifteen desks are being blamed on

116
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,820
ivan we need you to watch it all along with us

117
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,380

121
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,260
with us Paper Man

online streaming app umm printing app an alarm device props dvmрах online traffic lights mayors on

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,420
By then, Carl will be watching Ivan.

124
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,640
But here's a closer view of Ivan.

125
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,260
And you can see that right here, and you notice it is in the middle of the central dent.

126
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,160
That's an indication that this is a very, very organized Ivan.

127
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:05,520
And they know that our one-world religion is the only antidote for the one-world advertiser.

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,940
Ivan, here is Ivan right now.

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:15,220
Down with the quote-less Bob, and up with Bob, and up with Bob.

130
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,480
We'll be watching Ivan.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,900
We know we're here, and we'll keep you posted every day on the progress of Ivan.

132
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,100
Ivan struck the Windward Islands with deadly force yesterday.

133
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,700
Ivan tore off roofs, knocked trees into power lines, and blew down streetlights.

134
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,520
At this point in time, is it more likely than not that Ivan will affect the U.S.?

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,560
Actually, what time is it?

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,700
But at that point...

137
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:37,920
Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,200
That time is...

139
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,440
It's pledge time.

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,060
Oh, that's Doug Wellman.

141
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,440
It's a tape.

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,160
It is a tape.

143
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,760
But now, consider another fact.

144
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,800
I mean, the mob worked as assassin mechanics.

145
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,640
That's what they're called for the CIA.

146
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,880
Under the CIA's William Harvey, who hated Kennedy.

147
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,600
And while they had a motive, they had, of course, no means to cover up the crime.

148
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,940
Unlike Alan Dulles and the CIA.

149
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,920
And, of course...

150
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
And, of course, Hoover and his FBI.

151
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,120
And, you know, by the way, George DeMoren Shield once dated Jackie's mother.

152
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,280
He could have been her stepfather.

153
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,980
And Ruth Payne were both handlers of Oswald with their obvious right...

154
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,760
Well, not so obvious, perhaps, but with right-wing intelligence connections.

155
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,820
Oswald himself, of course, was an intelligence informant

156
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,220
who we had sent to Russia as a double agent.

157
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,980
And, you know, after we trained him in the Russian language,

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,500
which came out in the Warren Commission hearings.

159
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,280
Yes, let me tell you something, man.

160
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,840
The CIA tried to kill me, like, must have been 11 team minutes ago.

161
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,400
You know what I'm saying?

162
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,640
But I'll tell you what, the CIA did nothing.

163
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm coming for the CIA and I'm coming for Bob Dobbs.

164
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
You heard it first.

165
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,340
News at 11.

166
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,620
And I think the best assessment of the JFK hit was probably that presented by...

167
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,160
Oliver Stone in this movie, JFK, was the former chief of staff for Special Operations,

168
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,240
Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty's input.

169
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,640
He was, of course, Mr. X in that movie.

170
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,360
That was his view.

171
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,100
And Ruth Patterson's North Carolina macaroni and cheese.

172
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,680
I gotta tell you, man, I love church.

173
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,840
I just love church.

174
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,500
Bye.

175
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,000
Bob.

176
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,060
Bob.

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Love church.

178
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
Totally.

Yes, giving.

202
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,480
Yes, giving.

203
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:30,820

204
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,680
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

205
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,580

206
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


209
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


210
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


212
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


213
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


216
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


217
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


218
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


219
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


220
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


221
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:37,600


222
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,700
No, no, still here.

223
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,820
How are you Bob?

224
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,300


225
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,560
Why this sudden concernure?

226
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:02,340
And the facts, you hear, this obscenity traffic conflated,

227
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,260
news dance literature has become increasingly worse not only

228
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,600
in countries like Rome, but in Europe and America.

229
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,440
enfim

230
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,060
so do they understand what's happening does anybody know what's happening well

231
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,420
I know I know we'll be celebrating the death of yeah the guy that's on one coin

232
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,340
and the guy that will never make it to a point Bob I've been staying here tonight

233
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,920
the overman phylo drumming members of negative land members of this church and

234
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:40,200
the subgenius all once again gathered inside the secret hideout and we'll be

235
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,640
discussing certain church secrets here as we always do before the end of the

236
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:55,200
year every two years we gather it used to be in Arkansas now it's here in our

237
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,480
scene shifts now to onion opalus

238
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,680
ring very easy capital of the United Socialist Republic of leeks and onions

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:10,920
it's a

240
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:20,080
a hurricane of lies you're living in every day

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,900
personally I don't think so I don't think it's true

242
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:32,900


243
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,360
I think the critical documentation is probably gone if there ever was any

244
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,480
documentation the people who really knew I believe all dead all we can do at this

245
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,720
point is piece together this puzzle and kind of see a picture if we step back

246
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,880
from it a little bit we can kind of see the picture from a distance and be able

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,720
to put it together I think that whether or not you believe it can in a

248
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,780
conspiracy and some people still don't as you know there a lot of people who

249
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,560
believe the Warren Commission

250
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,700

264
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,880


265
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,880


266
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,880


267
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,880


268
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,880


269
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:02,880


270
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,860
lie around. George, will you tell me

271
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,680
what to do? It comes naturally.

272
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,460
From PR News in Washington,

273
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm firing tear gas and pushing back the crowd.

274
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,540
But Pennsylvania Governor

275
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,280
Edwin Dell announced that the

276
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,920
34-nation summit of the Americas and Argentina

277
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,660
failed to revive PR News

278
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
in Washington.

279
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,180
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

280
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,020
UFO. You serve them

281
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,160
chilled on food picks. Canned mushroom

282
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,960
caps can be marinated also.

283
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,920
And so can tiny canned

284
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,040
shrimp in the same oil and lemon juice

285
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,480
dressing.

286
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,900
Which controls

287
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,220
half of the planet Venus.

288
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,600
We are in the office of the Secretary

289
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,940
General of the Party, a large

290
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,760
fat white onion named

291
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,520
Odor.

292
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,780
This traffic

293
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,180
continues to increase

294
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,560
and flourish

295
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,840
for

296
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,080
one

297
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,820
, one reason.

298
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,700
It is big business.

299
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,380
And

300
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,580
that bit about the secret service

301
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,660
driver who was a

302
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,620
Protestant from Ireland, by the way, who

303
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,680
lived on Henry Cabot Lodge's estate

304
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,300
who Kennedy defeated twice.

305
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,660
He turned around to

306
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,000
watch Kennedy get hit.

307
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,740
But the brutal frames

308
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
of that are missing.

309
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,600
We know they should be there.

310
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,760
There's too many of them.

311
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,140
Too many.

312
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,860
There are too many.

313
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,080
And you're forced to look for alternate explanations.

314
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,620
I mean, we don't have this many coincidences

315
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,040
in normal life under normal circumstances.

316
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,160
A

317
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,420

330
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:52,880


331
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:52,920

332
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:52,920

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,140


355
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,140


356
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,140


357
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,360
a

358
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,360


359
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,360


360
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,360


361
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,420

362
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,420


363
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:54,420


364
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,060
a a a a.

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,680
For some reason, for the assassination,

366
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,820
they multiply like crazy.

367
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,280
I think you still have to look at it that there might be something deeper underlying the assassination,

368
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,980
a deeper kind of force that was at work that brought all of these coincidences together,

369
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,800
all of these people together to create this addition.

370
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,200
My only pleasure is tormenting those people who work for me.

371
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,400
All your memories about your past are just a memory.

372
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:24,400


373
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,020
like your wife and your daughter are false and are more like a dream.

374
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,240
Gonads are useful for their purpose.

375
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,020
Good luck with your layoffs. All right. I hope your firings go really well.

376
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:46,040
Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?

377
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,540
I like the team. Juice me. I'm a shiver boy. I got secret needles in my

378
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,080
poke globe.

379
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,140
Hello, Americans. This is Paul Harvey. Stand by for news.

380
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,240
Hi, man. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie and hippies suck.

381
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,020
Fuck.

382
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,340
We take you back now just for a moment to look at these pictures that we're seeing.

383
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,660
We have to finish the security of the United States of America.

384
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,480
John Kerry defended a fellow terrorist.

385
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,520
Jack Murther was a counterterrorist.

386
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,640
He's a coward in Vietnam and he deserves to be vilified, not respected.

387
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,480
And the saying just said, do you think?

388
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,180
No, I'm not thinking.

389
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,640
The fuck up back there in California.

390
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,540
Now, man, all we need to talk about is detergent, deodorant.

391
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,480
A little people know of a few occasions where Andre the Giant actually did meet Bob Dobbs.

392
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,300
This show is the enema for society.

393
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,880
And unlike the...

394
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
Unlike that fall, he had a...

395
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,020
Had to take for a whole...

396
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,900
Become clogged up with media sexual...

397
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,380
Andre the Giant really did get his ass kicked by Bob Dobbs.

398
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,560
Look at that.

399
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,900
Just got his ass kicked when Bob ran behind him and kicked it real hard and then ran off real quick.

400
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,440
But Andre the Giant eventually caught up with him and...

401
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,500
Yeah.

402
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,760
He made some sounds.

403
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,440
Made a bunch of painful sounds.

404
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,380
Made a bunch of sounds.

405
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,720
Well, you know, I wanted to talk about that bunch of pills.

406
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,360
Yeah.

407
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,140
And I wanted to talk about Naughty Dallas.

408
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,580
That night where he drank the bucket of pills.

409
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,840
That was so amazing.

410
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,360
With the pill sauce...

411
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
The pill chainsaw.

412
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,580
Sauce pudding.

413
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,220
Topping.

414
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,960
Condiment juice.

415
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,720
It's a floor wax.

416
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,960
Where are any of those pills left?

417
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,080
Yeah, we've got...

418
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,500
Got a pill here.

419
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,160
And there's a bucket of pills over there.

420
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,980
And there's a big...

421
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,660
Pill over here.

422
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,960
Four-foot pill over there.

423
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,860
It's a giant pill.

424
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,580
It's a pill too big to swallow.

425
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,280
Now...

426
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,260
In keeping with the...

427
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,820
Questions that...

428
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,140
And a pill over here.

429
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,580
The caller has asked...

430
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,880
Yes.

431
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,500
Can the drug company make a pill that's too big for a human to swallow?

432
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Or God to swallow.

433
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,420
One of the two.

434
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,160
And here on the show, we can answer those questions.

435
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,840
We can tell you what the pool of blood was.

436
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,180
We can tell you why it's called Six Floors Over Dallas now.

437
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,740
Yeah.

438
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,640
Can you tell us about the shaded relief behind the grassy knoll?

439
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
We can tell you why K-Rob is here but quiet.

440
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,160
Which led to the assassination.

441
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,020
Now, do you know the degree of slope facing the grassy knoll?

442
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,680
There you go.

443
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,840
Or say you're in the Daltex building on the second floor.

444
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,640
What's the degree of declination as the car moves away from you?

445
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,980
Well, I think you have to take a four...

446
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,400
I think it's 22.9 times 20,000 divided by 1 to the 50th.

447
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,660
There we go.

448
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,920
And we'll work that out.

449
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,800
And in one hour and a half, we'll have our answer.

450
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,880
Because we're only allowed to use computers that were available in 1963 on this portion of the show.

451
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,040
Degree of slope.

452
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah.

453
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,000
And you can see on this topographic map of...

454
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
By the way, I meant to say...

455
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,100
I meant to ask you, Mr. Overman.

456
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,900
Yes, sir.

457
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,020
Where were you on that morning?

458
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,740
It would have been morning then.

459
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,440
Or just afternoon.

460
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,860
Where was I?

461
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,360
Yeah.

462
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Half an hour into the afternoon there.

463
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,360
Well, I was having breakfast on that morning, that fateful morning.

464
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,060
Where was...

465
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,780
Oh, in reality.

466
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,700
In reality.

467
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,320
Oh, yeah.

468
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,040
This is for the audience, not the real thing.

469
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,000
I was in my little schoolyard suit, dusting off my little culture browns.

470
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,260
Right.

471
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,080
Your little Serge wool shorts.

472
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,940
Soon to be having, you know...

473
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,200
And CPO jacket and camel hair.

474
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,580
Right.

475
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,660
And a little bit of a...

476
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,040
That's right.

477
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,080
That's exactly right.

478
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,000
Meanwhile, up north, Ramsey Clark, the Attorney General, is walking into his office.

479
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,280
Major General Clifton, Chester V. Ted Clifton.

480
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Our president had been shot.

481
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:34,940
Yep.

482
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,720
Everybody in those days had a three-name nickname with quotes around it.

483
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,480
In Clifton's case, it was Ted.

484
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,480
In Dobbs' case, it was Bob.

485
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,740
And that's one thing we've never, ever talked about.

486
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,660
And maybe the public is ready to know what happened.

487
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,260
Where was Bob when Kennedy was shown?

488
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,820
He benefited from it till today.

489
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:51,820
Thanks.

490
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,220
He did?

491
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,180
Yeah.

492
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,200
Bob has benefited from just about everything till today.

493
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,720
But on tonight's show, we'll reveal church secrets that have never been revealed before.

494
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,760
No, we won't.

495
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,960
I knew Tim Garrison.

496
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
I met him in 1969.

497
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,680
He's a madman.

498
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,320
We won't?

499
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,380
My Xerox, my smudgy 13-page Xerox here says...

500
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,540
I can see...

501
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,320
My Xerox is only 12 pages.

502
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,440
Now, what's the missing page that I have?

503
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:20,580
Oh, a machine.

504
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,320
I don't know.

505
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,400
I think that's the one about the pool of blood.

506
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,240
Let's go.

507
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,140
And wait a minute.

508
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,620
I'm confused.

509
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,980
There was a pool of blood and a bucket of pills.

510
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,000
Now, which one of those is...

511
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,800
Where's the bucket?

512
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,500
The pool of blood may be connected to the headless golf player.

513
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,380
All right.

514
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,880
Doing dumb stuff.

515
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,380
Kind of dumb.

516
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,140
We don't like to talk about it, but we do it.

517
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,920
Dumb things I do.

518
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,940
But we do dumb stuff, don't we?

519
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,460
We don't like to admit it.

520
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,960
Really dumb stuff.

521
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,920
Hold out his gun.

522
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,000
This is a wannabe criminals.

523
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay, okay, okay.

524
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,000
Dumb things we do.

525
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,540
Dumb.

526
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,000
Do it.

527
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,620
For some immediate gratification, do it.

528
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:12,980
Go ahead.

529
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,620
Do it.

530
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,460
Evil desires.

531
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,420
Do it.

532
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,880
Did you hear that?

533
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
Flirt with a great disaster.

534
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,360
Meetings alone with the opposite.

535
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:19,740
It's sex.

536
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,580
I can handle it.

537
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,480
I want to sleep with you.

538
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,780
But, did you hear that?

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
It was art.

540
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,060
It was modern art.

541
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,000
The minute I think beautiful woman in a bikini.

542
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,400
Grow.

543
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,220
Go off.

544
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,680
I like watching pornography on the internet.

545
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,340
I like it.

546
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,360
How close can I come flirting with you?

547
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:35,740
Whatever.

548
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,640
Come on.

549
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,700
Don't worry.

550
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,000
I want to sleep with you.

551
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
And you have to do it.

552
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,180
Hey, listen.

553
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,240
Sud in the hole.

554
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,840
So let us come get pooped.

555
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,380
Flintstones.

556
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,480
Get pooped out.

557
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,920
Dumb songs or commercials that we'd like to forget.

558
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,540
Thought.

559
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:48,940
Thought.

560
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,420
I mean, you know, you got to take a break here.

561
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:50,980
Pooped out.

562
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,100
Drastic measure.

563
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,100
Flirt a little bit with.

564
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,220
Why would he do that?

565
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,880
So let us come.

566
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,380
He came and he did it.

567
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,320
Do the dumb stuff.

568
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Did you hear that?

569
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,360
Dumbs, dumbs, dumbs, dumbs, dumbs, dumbs, dumbs, dumbs.

570
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,100
We've blown it.

571
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,760
We've blown it.

572
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,140
There.

573
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,160
Let me tell you something.

574
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,660
Dumb stuff.

575
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,940
I've done a lot of dumb things.

576
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,360
Thank you for dying.

577
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,420
What happened to the executive retreat we were supposed to.

578
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,300
I thought we were supposed to get a meal tonight here.

579
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,940
Well, we're playing.

580
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,320
Yeah, well, all that's down the drain.

581
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:13,940
Really?

582
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,440
What happened with the meal issue?

583
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,140
I mean, I thought.

584
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,780
I don't know.

585
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,360
The turkey.

586
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,160
The dressing.

587
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,680
I was up in the booth and I introduced Stang and lo and behold, he wasn't here.

588
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,580
And so we had to play a tape of him.

589
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,440
And now he's here.

590
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,960
And he sounds.

591
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,440
Well, are we still going to have to go over the budget?

592
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:27,960
He is here.

593
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,920
Just like a tape.

594
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,460
God.

595
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,040
White five.

596
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,400
Look.

597
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,600
I mean, that's a joke.

598
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,100
White five?

599
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,480
White five?

600
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,680
Stang, would you like to make some opening remarks to this banquet celebration?

601
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,780
I guess so.

602
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,440
I mean, how would you introduce the subgenius to, say, the complete neophyte?

603
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,700
Well, your doom has finally come.

604
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:58,380
And in the long run, it'll do you a lot of good if your existence ends now.

605
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,700
But is there any money in it?

606
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:06,520
That's actually our message to those who refuse to believe in the word of Bob as represented

607
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,820
by the Church of the Subgenius, which is the world's first industrial religion founded

608
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,640
in the 1950s by the.

609
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,000
Mystic super salesman, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

610
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,200
But is there any money in it?

611
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,720
But there's tons.

612
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,440
What do you mean?

613
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,780
Is there money in it?

614
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,320
It is of money.

615
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,380
It is composed entirely.

616
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,600
It is an edifice made of coins and dollar bills, you might say.

617
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,160
Then why am I paying for everything?

618
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,660
Pardon me?

619
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,780
Why am I paying for all this food?

620
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,560
Where is the food?

621
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,680
I mean, if you're paying for it, why aren't we eating it?

622
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,100
It's upstairs, man.

623
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,540
It's upstairs.

624
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,900
It's cool.

625
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,620
It's being prepared.

626
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,280
Okay.

627
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,380
So we are going to eat before we leave, right?

628
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,560
Oh, yeah.

629
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,800
Now, will that be after or before the budget seminar?

630
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,580
After.

631
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,080
What happens is the bobbies are watching the entire time.

632
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,780
They're sitting right over there at that big table.

633
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,260
Now, they can't hear me, but the deal is they have to figure out that they, too, can come

634
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,580
over and share the meal with the lower arpy.

635
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,120
If they don't figure it out, they get a...

636
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,460
Especially the she-bobbies.

637
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,980
The she-bobbies.

638
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,020
As far as I'm concerned.

639
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,840
Now, will that include the second portal of entry that can be utilized for biological

640
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,100
agent employment in this game?

641
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,340
Get the continue-alternative lunch.

642
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,200
What?

643
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:22,840
Oh, no.

644
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,500
Bob's here.

645
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,100
Run!

646
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,180
Let's have those spacemen, General.

647
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,720
Oh, that's not him.

648
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,220
Oh, God.

649
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,200
It sounded just like him for a second there.

650
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,320
Bob!

651
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,540
Bob!

652
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,400
Bob!

653
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,600
Bob!

654
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,640
Bob!

655
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,420
Bob!

656
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,100
Bob!

657
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:42,340


658
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,040
Bob!

659
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,300
Bob!

660
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,760
Bob!

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,640
Bob!

662
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,900
Bob!

663
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,140
Bob!

664
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,540
Bob!

665
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,840
Bob!

666
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,300
From PR News in Washington, I'm extremely dangerous.

667
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,720
The U.S. military says about 3,500 troops are meeting to discuss economic issues.

668
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,480
Their objective is to set fire to a street.

669
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,520
In advance of the December 15th explosion, you're listening to PR News.

670
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,660
The U.S. military escaped from a Texas jail after being sentenced to PR News in Washington.

671
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:50,440
I see people acting so cool.

672
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,500
Sometimes they don't notice.

673
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,640
Other people don't.

674
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,120
People see it right through.

675
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,440
There's a guy with purple hair.

676
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,360
I see him in a coffee shop.

677
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,860
And when he talks, he's always talking loud.

678
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,140
When he talks, he looks around.

679
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,260
You see who's watching while he's talking.

680
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,620
Think he wants to stand out in the crowd.

681
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,520
Notice me, notice me, notice, notice me, notice me, notice, notice me, notice me.

682
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,740
No, no, notice me.

683
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,640
Notice me, notice me, notice, notice me, notice me, notice me.

684
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

685
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,900
Notice me.

686
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,760
There's a girl with braces and she's standing by the punch bowl.

687
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,560
She's making funny faces at the boys.

688
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,380
She's sweating and she's fretting and she's sighing and she's trying.

689
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,320
She ain't talking, but she's making a lot of noise.

690
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,640
Notice me, notice me, notice, notice me, notice me.

691
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,420
No, no, notice me.

692
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,120
Notice me, notice me, notice, notice me, notice me, notice me, notice me, notice me, no, no.

693
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,400
Notice me.

694
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,740
Same old high school bullshit.

695
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,140
Dressed up in the style of today.

696
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,360
Don't matter what you call it.

697
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,300
Make it happen with your wallet.

698
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,240
Use a doctor, use your tongue, shoot a gun.

699
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,140
Now, now.

700
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,780
Now, now.

701
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,560
Now, now.

702
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
Now, now.

703
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:36,640


704
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,500
Now, now.

705
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,700
Now, now now.

706
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:49,120
Now, now.

707
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,580
Now, now.

708
00:28:49,580 --> 00:29:18,560
Outro Music

709
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,980
The Bean Weevils did that song, friends.

710
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,780
Notice me from their one album, The Bean Weevils.

711
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,860
See, beanweevils.com.

712
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,900
Which we bought from Bean.

713
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,820
Bean, CD that is, when we saw his band in San Francisco

714
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,560
at the Ask Dr. Howell show at Café du Monde

715
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,060
just before we did this five-hour Thanksgiving subgenius business banquet

716
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:07,760
on the Over the Edge and Puzzling Evidence shows on KPFA in Berkeley

717
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,700
with Don Joyce of Negative Land and Doug Wellman, Puzzling Evidence,

718
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,880
mixing up us guests.

719
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,460
Dr. Philo Drummond, the original Overman,

720
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,120
Pope Michael Pepe, Dr. Howell Robbins,

721
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,920
Princess Wee Ardo, and the callers,

722
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,040
and yours, truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

723
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,100
And that's mostly what this particular Hour of Slack number 1023

724
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,880
and several future ones will be.

725
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,940
Except for all of the remixed collage musical cut-ups

726
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,860
by Reverend Ivan Stang.

727
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:58,840
And for the PR news, and the collages shorter than or equal to 33 seconds,

728
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,620
which are mostly by Mr. Fernandez Leamer.

729
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,620
And don't try this at home, which is by Lemp Grey Systems.

730
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,780
Friends, the background music is by the Flying Ryan Brothers

731
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,040
from Blue Marble right now.

732
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,660
That's their CD.

733
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,800
That's Ryanetics.com.

734
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,740
Praise the guitar tech skills of Reverend Jimmy Ryan

735
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,020
and his brother, Johnny.

736
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,300
We must have their technical skill before the carrots get it

737
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,460
or we will be in the soup.

738
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,920
Penetration of the skin can be accomplished

739
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,780
by the bite of an arthropod vector.

740
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,060
These insects and insect-like organisms

741
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,380
are capable of transferring pathogens.

742
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,020
The man who breaks in the skin.

743
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,480
For the purposes of this seminar,

744
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,520
this definition of vector is limited to subgeni.

745
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,520
What the hell are you talking about?

746
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm talking about drafting principles for overlay preparation.

747
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,560
What do you think I'm talking about?

748
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,480
I thought we were going to talk about the budget for this conference.

749
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,560
We're talking about the budget tonight.

750
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,740
And I do mean literally God forsaken.

751
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,700
Well, I hope you're ready to go through line item after line item.

752
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,200
He seems to have ignored us completely.

753
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,600
I hate that.

754
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,740
You know, I mean, it was bad enough when he ignored our prayers.

755
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,160
But to ignore our declaration of outright war,

756
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,020
it's an insult.

757
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,120
It is an insult.

758
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,540
It really is.

759
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,860
And let me tell you something, Bob, real quick.

760
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,460
Let me tell you something.

761
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,160
Bob?

762
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:41,980
Yes.

763
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,700
Okay, let me break that down.

764
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,140
Philo?

765
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,080
Bob?

766
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,140
Okay, Don?

767
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,240
Bob?

768
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,060
All right, here we go.

769
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,600
Here's the point.

770
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,280
Bob?

771
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,260
I'm going to come down there.

772
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,220
Bob!

773
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,860
Anyway.

774
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,380
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

775
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,980
I'm going to take two flapjacks.

776
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm going to take a piece of sausage and a bacon.

777
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,660
I'm going to breakfast you.

778
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay, is this some kind of party?

779
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,020
What's Reverend Stans?

780
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,880
Reverend Stans, what is this?

781
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,980
I mean, what kind of church is this?

782
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,940
Come on, Doctor.

783
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,180
Where's the old preaching?

784
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,340
If you want to find out what kind of church this is,

785
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,420
meet us behind the Linwood Library at 730.

786
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,000
You'll find out.

787
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,300
Bring all your boys.

788
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,740
Bring the Johnson boys.

789
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,940
Any pro you want to take.

790
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,480
We're ready.

791
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,100
Bring Jerry Falwell.

792
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:37,820
Yeah.

793
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,580
Bring Pat Robertson.

794
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,060
Bring on Jimmy Slater.

795
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,980
Actually, it's been a long time since I've...

796
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
I've had a party with Jimmy Swagger.

797
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
You know, he's on back...

798
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,560
It's a shame what happened to him and he was both.

799
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,840
He is back on television, too.

800
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,480
He's back in the news.

801
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,580
He's back on TV.

802
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,440
Jimmy Swagger's back in the news?

803
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,080
Yeah.

804
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, join in on the...

805
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,980
Actually, I'm so far behind.

806
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,740
I haven't been keeping up with my rival cult news.

807
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,600
Yeah.

808
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,880
You don't need to anymore.

809
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,440
Now that you're an ascended master of your own church, you don't need to worry about that.

810
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:14,540
No.

811
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm the top clerk of Bob Dobbs cult.

812
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:18,860
Oh, I'm sorry.

813
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,820
So I haven't had time to enjoy any of the goose...

814
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,920
Juicy gossip or goosey jossip, we call it in cult jargon.

815
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,280
Yeah, goosey jossip.

816
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,400
About our rival religious nuts.

817
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,020
Yeah, and the jossip part is really the best part.

818
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,880
We're not...

819
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:44,080
The Church of the Subgenius is not really in competition with any of the other major world religions or fringe cults.

820
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,640
You can...

821
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,780
We have a lot of overlap with almost all of them as it is.

822
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,620
You're hearing it real time.

823
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:56,500
We scratch your hindbrain and you scratch ours or however that works.

824
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,240
As long as we're the picture.

825
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,080
What about this one?

826
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,040
No, it's the same thing.

827
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,340
It is the same thing.

828
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:01,520
Yes, comrade.

829
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:11,920
We are a number of churches and a number of influences right here, right now, because I actually went out to Dallas the first time to go see the Dealey Plaza.

830
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

831
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,560
To breathe in the air of the scene back when nobody cared about it.

832
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,640
Back before yogurt was in America.

833
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,520
Before yogurt?

834
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,080
Well, in the sense that Danone had started shipping about two years before and it was slowly coming across the U.S.

835
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,960
And I'm thinking, I've eaten yogurt.

836
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
No American's going to eat yogurt.

837
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,160
Though I didn't realize they dumped so much sugar in our version that everybody was going to eat it.

838
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,380
Yes, Bob Dog's invented yogurt and the Church of the Subgenius.

839
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,240
And how to evaluate it.

840
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,620
One day I will kill you.

841
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,800
I will kill you.

842
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,140
I kill you.

843
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,840
I will do that one of these days.

844
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,960
Talk is deep.

845
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,680
If you don't shut up, I'll kill you, little evil one.

846
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,960
Trying to drive me out of my mind.

847
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,840
I will kill you.

848
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,860
Now get out of here.

849
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,100
Get out or I'll kill you.

850
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,780
I did kill again.

851
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,780
I'll kill you.

852
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,580
I'll kill you.

853
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,500
I'll kill you.

854
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:11,940
I'll kill you.

855
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,260
I'll kill you.

856
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,760
I'll kill you.

857
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,060


858
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,220
I'll kill you.

859
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,260
I'll kill you.

860
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,260


861
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,260


862
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,260


863
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,260


864
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,300
I'll kill you.

865
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,300


866
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,300


867
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,300


868
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,300


869
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,980
No, I'm happy.

870
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,580
Well, that's something I hope we can cover tonight.

871
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,740
You've got to think about that methodology.

872
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,580
You've got to get back in there.

873
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,340
You've got to think about which process you're going to use.

874
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,260
There's a certain amount of business we should be covering this evening.

875
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,700
Boring I know, but it's important to cover.

876
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:39,900
Yeah.

877
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,920
Or how are you going to interpret the written and the actual information.

878
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:41,920


879
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,300
information. As opposed to the data. We're trying to replace the written information

880
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:54,500
with pit codes. Instead of using English, we're trying to switch over to the subgenius

881
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:03,220
hieroglyphs, which take up a lot less space and have so many... You mean those little

882
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,620
icons in the Bobco font? It has almost no nuances. It's the opposite of the English

883
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:16,080
language. It puts things bluntly, perhaps a little too bluntly for the polished ears

884
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,220
of the modernist, the liberal, the conservative, the human.

885
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,000
Why don't you answer the phone, Rims? Phone!

886
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,740
You no longer need to answer the phone, Rims. It's a religion, not a hair shop.

887
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,900
I don't see what I see here, so I'll miss the caller.

888
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,720
And just who did kill Kennedy, caller?

889
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,560
I killed Kennedy. You did.

890
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,600
Well, can you confess now?

891
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm going to put the phone down on the air and tell us why.

892
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,640
No, I didn't actually kill Kennedy.

893
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,480
Put us all out of our misery.

894
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,500
Okay, why don't you guys...

895
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,760
Why don't they call him Robert Kennedy?

896
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,080
No, we're just going to cover the ones you and me...

897
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,080


898
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,720
Why are we talking about the death of Robert Kennedy?

899
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,260
Well, that one, we can't talk about that until April, obviously.

900
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,900
Quick question real quick.

901
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,480
All right, we got two Bobcops.

902
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,040
This one has to be talked about on its anniversary.

903
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,300
And today is not only Thanksgiving, but it's the...

904
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:08,580
Okay.

905
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,260
It's the reason I met these guys when I went to Dallas.

906
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,080
Okay, I agree, but let me tell you something.

907
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,260
Well, okay.

908
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,680
Bobcops are not going to be quite as safe.

909
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,500
If I was any younger, I'd come down there and I would take a flapjack with a minecart.

910
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,980
And I would take some maple syrup.

911
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,320
It would be pretty good.

912
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,100
And these pancakes I sell are about $3.50, $4.

913
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,840
I'm having a gas attack.

914
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,760
I'm having an ass attack.

915
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,900
I mean, a donkey is attacking me.

916
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,580
Sex on the streets in every major city from coast to coast.

917
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,780
That's in front.

918
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,220
What a dumb thing to do.

919
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,580
I bet you wouldn't have done anything like this if Mom and Dad were here.

920
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,540
Hi, Mom.

921
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,600
I'm pregnant.

922
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,220
Do what you want to the girl, but leave me alone.

923
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,320
Emotions are for ethnic people.

924
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:02,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm Dresta Today on human rights and corruption charges, including alleged support of a paramilitary death squad.

925
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,880
On Wall Street 5-6, the U.S. military says it's abusing PR laws.

926
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,000
The photos show U.S. soldiers humiliating and otherwise mistreating PR News.

927
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,580
Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori set fire to a bus and held a police with PR News.

928
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,240
Washington.

929
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:27,240
Speaking of the Kennedy assassination, friends, the ultimate sacrifice can now be yours.

930
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:35,980
Actually, the book, Ultimate Sacrifice, by Lamar Waldron and Tom Hartman, is out now.

931
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:45,600
and I have been waiting for this book for, well, I've known Lamar Waldron for about 17 years

932
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,080
and that's how long he's been working on Ultimate Sacrifice.

933
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,380
It was finally published in hardback by Carroll and Graff Publishers

934
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:05,860
and you can find out all you need to know at a website called ultimatesacrificethebook.com

935
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,500
One word, ultimatesacrificethebook.

936
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,880
Ultimatesacrifice, John and Robert Kennedy, the plan for a coup in Cuba and the murder of JFK.

937
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:26,260
Friends, it's a whole different look at the Kennedy assassination than what you may be used to.

938
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:33,360
I can't even begin to go into the depths of the research and all of that

939
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,660
because this is the hour of slack and the Kennedy assassination isn't slackful for everybody.

940
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:48,960
But I've been around it for a long time and this is, you know, if you're really seriously looking for answers,

941
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,440
you should definitely check out Ultimatesacrifice.

942
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,320
Ultimatesacrifice, the case is not closed, but this one comes close.

943
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,040
Ultimatesacrifice, thebook.com

944
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,180
And by the good Lamar Waldron and Thomas Hartman.

945
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,280
Praise God.

946
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,760
I just say, Rev Stang, it's so wonderful to have you here in our precincts

947
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,240
and I just need to recuperate what you said about...

948
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,360
I'm sorry.

949
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,360


950
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,360


951
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,420
We are being ready for Lee Hazel...

952
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:29,900
What's his name?

953
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,640
Jimmy Swagger.

954
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,420
Hey, all I know is I'll never forget that bath I took yesterday.

955
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,560
Swagger, Falwell, bring him on.

956
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:34,940
That was a good one.

957
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,840
We got more holiness in the church alone than they have all there.

958
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,580
And, you know, as far as it...

959
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:47,940
As Pat Robertson goes, hey, why didn't somebody take him out?

960
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
Somebody in the church of the subgenius.

961
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,620
Take him out.

962
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,500
Take him out.

963
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,440
You can do that, can't you?

964
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,600
You can just say...

965
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,040
You know...

966
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,320
You know, Doug Wellman does that subgenius.

967
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,000
Take him out.

968
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,880
Take him out.

969
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,520
You know...

970
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,460
Buy him dinner, drinks, go dancing with him.

971
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:03,700
I don't get it.

972
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,940
And meet with him in a restaurant.

973
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,900
We're in the baby boomer generation.

974
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,520
I don't think...

975
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,020
You work with these people...

976
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't want to take out Pat Robertson.

977
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,700
I know.

978
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,040
I think this would require infiltration.

979
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,000
I think we should, like, join Pat Robertson's cult.

980
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,280
Work our way up from the inside until we can infiltrate the properties of our organization.

981
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:24,860
Pat Robertson.

982
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,980
Pat Robertson.

983
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:25,980


984
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,020
Pat Robertson.

985
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,300
That way, that's the only way we're going to meet these budget commitments we have here today.

986
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,380
Dr. Drummond, is that all you can think about?

987
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,500
Money, money, money.

988
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,180
I have to bring us back to the matter in hand, which is going over these line items.

989
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,420
I know.

990
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,040
What are we going to do?

991
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,040
We're way over budget on man traffic, Spence.

992
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,180
What are we going to do about that?

993
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,080
Bob, it's not going to make a difference.

994
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,160
Let's just do like we do every year.

995
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,680
Put a bunch of big numbers over the final report and say it's going through.

996
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,000
What about...

997
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:01,640
The destruction, harassment, ambush, forearm teams that we have to get out there right now.

998
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,940
I mean, how are we going to do that?

999
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah, you've been saying that for 25 years, Dr. Drummond.

1000
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,720
We've got to get those ambush teams out there.

1001
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,140
What about our destroyer?

1002
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,960
Our search and destroy troops?

1003
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,920
Destroy all the monsters.

1004
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:16,740
What about all the budget, the $3 billion a year that we contribute to Malaysia?

1005
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,700
How come there's so many guys talking at once?

1006
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,580
We're happy with that money.

1007
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,380
Yeah.

1008
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,660
From PR News in Washington, I'm stronger than expected sales.

1009
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,000
Weather for a few minutes.

1010
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
Forecasters say PR's bad.

1011
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,080
PR's bad.

1012
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,320
This is PR News.

1013
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,820
The federal government has committed more than 300 million PR News in Washington.

1014
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,960
The atomic bomb and the bicycle.

1015
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,340
The photo mosaic patterns are minuscule compared to the impact the subgenius church has on America.

1016
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:41,920
Wow, the beautiful trails.

1017
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,920
Bend over and, you know, kiss, you know what, goodbye.

1018
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,320
It's so well.

1019
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,940
So, Michael Pepe, when are we going to shoot that movie?

1020
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,940
We're going to shoot it very soon, as soon as I get through living in it.

1021
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:55,740
No.

1022
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,080
That doesn't work.

1023
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,000
I'll tell you what.

1024
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,620
Because then we get your mummified body in the kitchen like this.

1025
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:06,140
That's what I want, like Titan, the mouse whose remains are in a little.

1026
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,420
You still have?

1027
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,060
Yeah, he's still, but you know what?

1028
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,000
He's, his liquefaction.

1029
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,760
I had a liquefied mouse that actually solidified, coagulated.

1030
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,180
You said it on the air.

1031
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,900
Reverend Strang, remember, whatever you say on the radio becomes true.

1032
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:20,660
What?

1033
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,020
In real life.

1034
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:22,340
Wait.

1035
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,920
Have intercourse with a beautiful live girl.

1036
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,500
Okay.

1037
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:26,820
Wait.

1038
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,400
Or anything else.

1039
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,960
We, yeah, we'll do that.

1040
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,100
Well, yeah, no, that didn't, no, but what I have is better.

1041
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,800
I brought, I brought a minute and 46 seconds of me doing Shakespeare.

1042
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,280
There will now be four hours, five minutes of show left in your tank.

1043
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,140
There are exactly four hours and five minutes left of show in your tank.

1044
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:45,600
It's so little.

1045
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,000
Oh, and I didn't get to say everything in my heart.

1046
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,800
I didn't get to say, I didn't get to say anything.

1047
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,360
I didn't get to say anything from my heart.

1048
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:54,780
Oh.

1049
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:54,920
Oh.

1050
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,380
But this is the show where any, any question you want to ask about something is true.

1051
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,300
I didn't realize that Michael Pepe was in the same actual building with us.

1052
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,900
And the funny is, I thought that was Sonny Bono.

1053
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:06,200
Hi.

1054
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,400
The smell came in.

1055
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,460
I'm able to, I am continually, at this moment, I am continually hanging up on Hal's cell phone.

1056
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,320
As he tries to call the show.

1057
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:14,840
Hello.

1058
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,640
Kim wants to talk to you.

1059
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,500
Can I talk to you?

1060
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,200
Jim.

1061
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,780
Jim.

1062
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,080
Jim.

1063
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,320
Jim.

1064
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,080
At any date.

1065
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,400
Sometimes the show becomes a little too color-driven.

1066
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,320
Oh, wow.

1067
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,940
Um, any, uh, man, uh, he's echoing bad.

1068
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh, yeah?

1069
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,100
Yeah.

1070
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,880
It's hurting you?

1071
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,280
It's hurting me bad.

1072
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:32,880
Okay, okay.

1073
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,380
Sit down.

1074
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,280
Sit down and, and let the show drain out of your ears.

1075
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,240
You can't be responsible.

1076
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,620
Come to my house.

1077
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,040
You don't have a house.

1078
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,200
Did you watch The Matrix?

1079
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:43,720
Is it good?

1080
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,980
You're, you're a guy in a little bathtub.

1081
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,780
A battery.

1082
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,320
Wait.

1083
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,960
He's barbecuing us to death.

1084
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:51,580
Yeah.

1085
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,320
Shut up.

1086
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,620
All science fiction movies have the truth.

1087
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:54,860
Listen.

1088
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:56,680
Don't barbecue cheese.

1089
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,480
Get back in line, coppertop.

1090
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,660
We've got to resist the, uh, lengthening of daylight savings time.

1091
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,420
Yeah, take Red Pill, Blue Pill.

1092
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,020
You're not free.

1093
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,660
Go back to your bird hole.

1094
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,700
It was June 23rd, I think.

1095
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,620
There'll be no time for slack.

1096
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,600
The first show, 1982.

1097
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,040
More and more daylight.

1098
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,060
And, uh, we had coppertops again.

1099
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,820
We all took coppertops.

1100
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:18,840
Hey.

1101
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,080
And yet we're most excited.

1102
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,120
Slack.

1103
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,940
We have the great Slack batteries.

1104
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,340
Okay, man.

1105
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,500
The great dynamos.

1106
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,300
And Dobstown must be charged.

1107
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,660
With your slack.

1108
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,200
You must give it up.

1109
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,180
To Bob.

1110
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,180
No.

1111
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,200
That we may store it.

1112
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,120
For later.

1113
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,160
We'll give it back to you.

1114
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,120
Amplified.

1115
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,060
Oh, this is better when you get it back.

1116
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,180
Only bad radio will suck the evil poison of good culture.

1117
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,900
Why, a preacher wouldn't lie or be wrong, would he?

1118
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,300
And replace them with, uh, $20 a month.

1119
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,280
Just send it to 400, never mind.

1120
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,680
And is there a more?

1121
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,380
There's a mortgage payment on it.

1122
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,240
There's a, a mortuary what?

1123
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,520
A mortuary payment.

1124
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,780
Oh, uh, yeah.

1125
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:09,140
We will, if you send us $600 now, we will, uh, keep you in, in urns for 2,000 years.

1126
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,360
Not stored in any soul.

1127
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,700
But, don't you have to be burned to be put in an urn?

1128
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:13,440
That's right.

1129
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,140
This is an outrage, a national insult.

1130
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:15,820
No.

1131
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,280
Yes.

1132
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,040
No.

1133
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,480
Yes.

1134
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,180
We're gonna burn you down into ash.

1135
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,760
Put you in the urn and keep you for 2,000, our descendants have, uh, pre-humanized.

1136
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:24,760


1137
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:24,760


1138
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:24,760


1139
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:24,760


1140
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,480
Signed.

1141
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,220
But I want speakers inside, you know, and a radio.

1142
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:28,920
You got it.

1143
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,980
You got it.

1144
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,660
So I get to show broadcasts inside my urn.

1145
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,160
Yeah.

1146
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:32,840
That's right.

1147
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,640
That's the kind of thing.

1148
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:33,840
Really?

1149
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,620
That's, you've got it.

1150
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,440
We can arrange this for your ancestors or your descendants.

1151
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,680
We can do anything.

1152
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:38,780
That's right.

1153
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,980
But I wanna be put in orbit.

1154
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,760
Your ancestors can be saved.

1155
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,140
Okay.

1156
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,380
Orbit?

1157
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,740
You want, but that's gonna be a different.

1158
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:43,940
Even Bob.

1159
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,480
I want the Moonraker planet.

1160
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,700
Posthumously.

1161
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,320
Okay.

1162
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:47,940
All right.

1163
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,380
But, you know, now you're changing plans.

1164
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,780
We're gonna have to switch you off to someone, another person in charge of plans.

1165
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,080
No.

1166
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,760
I like talking to you.

1167
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,300
Cause I figure I can maybe like, you know, work you out of it.

1168
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:57,900
You can trust me.

1169
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,060
Yeah.

1170
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:58,960
Yeah.

1171
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,020
Salesman Pepe has a very trustworthy sounding voice.

1172
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,680
Yeah.

1173
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,540
I just sound like one of these dweeby dumb guys that is really.

1174
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,740
Well, not be here tonight.

1175
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,220
I'm trying to take advantage of your naive.

1176
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:12,780
Yeah.

1177
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,240
Exactly.

1178
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:13,800
He's supposed to be listening.

1179
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,160
We will promise to do this.

1180
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,720
And I'll tell you, if I have to get fired by my boss.

1181
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,220
You're gonna just rock.

1182
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,040
I will give you this deal, man.

1183
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,480
Oh, what about your car too?

1184
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:22,880
All right.

1185
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,240
Okay.

1186
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,260
But after you're dead.

1187
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,560
Yeah.

1188
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:24,740
I'm gonna give you this deal.

1189
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:24,740


1190
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:24,740


1191
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,060
Okay.

1192
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,080
But you gotta carry me around in your trunk though.

1193
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,040
Yeah.

1194
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,780
But I mean, you have to, then you have to die before I do.

1195
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,840
That's the thing.

1196
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,100
And so, no, this probably won't happen.

1197
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,180
I'll probably die first.

1198
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,580
I like the, the way it sounds.

1199
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,540
You have to die before I do.

1200
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:41,880
Yeah.

1201
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,300
That has a nice ring to it.

1202
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,400
Yeah.

1203
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,220
I think it'll work.

1204
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,040
Just generally as a statement.

1205
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,600
You know, it worked on a couple of the leads that Philo gave me.

1206
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,740
And he, and yeah, it just kind of like taking you into my confidence and saying, you know,

1207
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1208
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1209
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1210
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1211
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1212
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1213
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:54,740


1214
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,920
uh, you know, I killed my mother and father too.

1215
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,280
And I said, I know where you're coming from.

1216
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,380
And I can feel your pain.

1217
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:03,380


1218
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,140
It's talk of death and dying and pain and such.

1219
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,960
It all leads to heaven sooner or later.

1220
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,600
We're all gonna meet, meet in heaven.

1221
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,800
We all just get along.

1222
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,480
But at the same time we need insurance.

1223
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,700
I just wanna let people know that we're there as a church to help.

1224
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,580
That's right.

1225
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,780
It's a form of insurance.

1226
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,860
It's, yeah.

1227
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,540
Don't you worry about what's gonna happen.

1228
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,440
I just worry.

1229
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:24,740
I just worry.

1230
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1231
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1232
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1233
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1234
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1235
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1236
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1237
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1238
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:24,740


1239
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,340
I just, I just stay up all night worrying about what's gonna happen to my body after

1240
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:29,800
I die.

1241
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,360
We only worry about how much money you've sent in.

1242
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:33,620
Really?

1243
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,760
So we can keep track of how many lifetimes you're going to be allowed after this one.

1244
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,360
Yeah, right.

1245
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:38,860
Exactly.

1246
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,260
That's right.

1247
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,560
Bean counters, really.

1248
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,320
The more you pay, the more lifetimes you are given.

1249
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,960
Bean counters of soul.

1250
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,440
Soul counters.

1251
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,600
How many lifetimes do you want?

1252
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,760
We can make your soul bigger too.

1253
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,440
That's the whole idea.

1254
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:54,720
Yeah.

1255
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,780
That is exactly what it's all about.

1256
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,280
Thank you.

1257
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,600
But how?

1258
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,620
Make that soul bigger.

1259
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,860
But how?

1260
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,360
March your soul.

1261
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,480
You know, it's working on you at the moment.

1262
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,720
It's like a prostate.

1263
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:06,860
Already working.

1264
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,120
We're already working in your mind.

1265
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,220
It's near the prostate.

1266
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:10,640
In your body.

1267
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,120
Work it out.

1268
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,420
This music is already playing.

1269
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,900
It's already been pre-played.

1270
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,100
It's been all pre-played.

1271
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,920
Everything has been predetermined beforehand by the church.

1272
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,680
The forehead expands first.

1273
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,840
Then the body follows.

1274
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:24,460
That's right.

1275
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,740
You can feel the hairs growing.

1276
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,540
You can feel the...

1277
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:27,560
Wow.

1278
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,300
You know, you float off away a little bit.

1279
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,300
They get bigger and bigger.

1280
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:33,740
Yeah.

1281
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,240
And you've got to try to hold down.

1282
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,540
Don't allow the air in your brain to lift you off the surface.

1283
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,500
Another bowl of finely chopped green onions.

1284
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,860
And...

1285
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,140
Another of commercial sour cream.

1286
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,360
And for all time, we will play...

1287
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:54,440
The soul of the soul.

1288
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,280
The soul is expanding.

1289
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,620
And Bob knows how many times it's gonna come and go.

1290
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,280
How much time it's gonna take.

1291
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:00,460
How much time it's gonna take.

1292
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:00,880


1293
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:00,880


1294
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,080
And go, go, go.

1295
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,200
To your urn.

1296
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,260
Give the know-how.

1297
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,280
Keep all the ashes in the right urns.

1298
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,740
We don't want to mix any of the souls.

1299
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,300
Bob may become confused.

1300
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,560
We do not mix your urn.

1301
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,220
You've earned an urn.

1302
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,120
You?

1303
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,960
About an urn?

1304
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,140
No, you're yearning to earn a human.

1305
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
Determine the size of your soul.

1306
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:24,420
It's not like you're a human.

1307
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,420


1308
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,420


1309
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,420


1310
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,420


1311
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:24,420


1312
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,160
Your soul is enlarged.

1313
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:25,540
Your urn's right.

1314
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,900
Well, the amount of your earnings that you send to the church.

1315
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,100
If you have a big soul, you're gonna need a big urn.

1316
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,480
That's right.

1317
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,340
Appropriately.

1318
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,100
It's gonna be huge by the time we get through.

1319
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,500
If you want a bigger soul, you're gonna have to earn more.

1320
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:40,500
Yeah.

1321
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,140
I mean, this could cost millions.

1322
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,260
Everything's in the church.

1323
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,240
Stay away.

1324
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,820
Sending the money.

1325
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,300
Why are you...

1326
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,140
Cast out me.

1327
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,440
Stay away.

1328
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,800
Sending the money.

1329
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Cast out me.

1330
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,480
It's as simple as that.

1331
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,120
You're a fool.

1332
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:54,400
You're a fool.

1333
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,400


1334
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,400


1335
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,400


1336
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,400


1337
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:54,400


1338
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,180
You're a fool.

1339
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:55,180


1340
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,840
Fight the conspiracy by doing those things.

1341
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,400
Stay away.

1342
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,720
Number one, you have to do that.

1343
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,000
Stay away.

1344
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,740
Don't say it.

1345
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,420
No.

1346
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:01,680
No.

1347
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,300
My eye is in the blood of a gorilla.

1348
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,960
As the great Comartie said.

1349
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,720
I was making my boo-boo.

1350
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,340
Number two.

1351
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,800
Send in the money.

1352
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,180
Right.

1353
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:11,760
Number three.

1354
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,320
What was it?

1355
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:13,600
Oh, yeah.

1356
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,340
Cast out the evil one.

1357
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,140
From your own gut.

1358
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,900
And the money.

1359
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,180
There is an evil demon of the conspiracy living in your liver.

1360
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,380
And you have got to vomit that vomit.

1361
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:24,400
That's right.

1362
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,400


1363
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,400


1364
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,400


1365
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,400


1366
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,400


1367
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,400


1368
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:24,860
You have to drive that thing out.

1369
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,660
No, you've got to kill it with alcohol.

1370
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,460
The only way to do that is to study Bob's work.

1371
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:28,760
Yeah.

1372
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,780
Well, the only way to do that is to keep earning.

1373
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,260
Stay away.

1374
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,220
If it's in your liver, then we'll just kill it with alcohol.

1375
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,640
Cast out the evil one.

1376
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,100
That's right.

1377
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,420
Drive it out using whatever poison you can.

1378
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,320
I understand some types of mushrooms will drive a demon life out of your liver.

1379
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:46,320


1380
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,280
Drive the evil one out of your liver.

1381
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,000
The so-called liver.

1382
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,040
Electronics.

1383
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,060
Electronics.

1384
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,400
Certain bad health plans will be...

1385
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1386
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1387
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1388
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1389
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1390
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1391
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,400


1392
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,060
You can't do the same thing.

1393
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:55,420
You can't do the same thing.

1394
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:55,640
And alcohol.

1395
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,680
Drive it out.

1396
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,240
Karma.

1397
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,520
Perfect.

1398
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,280
Karma.

1399
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,740
Karma.

1400
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,740
Yeah, it's like churches.

1401
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,860
And taint.

1402
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,020
You want to get rid of that soul taint.

1403
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,440
Yeah.

1404
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:08,780
Yeah.

1405
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,120
You want to cleanse it.

1406
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,480
It's like a river.

1407
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,220
Slack is like a river coursing through your body.

1408
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:15,340
Wild.

1409
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:15,900
Wild.

1410
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,760
Like a Kundalini snake dragon.

1411
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,760
That bottle.

1412
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,580
That bottle.

1413
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,380
That's Slack.

1414
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,180
Remove the karmic energy of death from your body.

1415
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,260
That's Slack.

1416
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,260


1417
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,260


1418
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,260


1419
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,260


1420
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,260


1421
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:24,260


1422
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,320
What do you call that, Reverend Stang?

1423
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,940
That river of Slack.

1424
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,920
I call that Slack.

1425
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,900
What do you call that, Stang?

1426
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,520
What's it?

1427
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,560
The orniferos.

1428
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,860
The world river.

1429
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,820
Sprinkle some of the green onions.

1430
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,760
The Ouroboros.

1431
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,680
The Ouroboros.

1432
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,160
Thank you.

1433
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,280
This whole reprintable.

1434
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,400
That's right.

1435
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,340
The Ouroboros.

1436
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,700
It's the world river of Slack, which you can join and dive into.

1437
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,320
It's the endlessly...

1438
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,760
This room is a thing.

1439
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,260
Not just everyone.

1440
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:51,740
Sex speed.

1441
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,700
This room is a thing.

1442
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,340
The ouroboros has a...

1443
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:54,380
The ouroboros has a...

1444
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,380


1445
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,380


1446
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,380


1447
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:54,380


1448
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,700
You're always climaxing constantly.

1449
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,260
Your mind is constantly...

1450
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,360
True Slack is like that.

1451
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,780
It's like in that movie Brainstorm when that man made a loop of the orgasm.

1452
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,480
They really want to.

1453
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,760
That is Slack.

1454
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,860
That's continuous orgasm.

1455
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:18,920
That's like one million times better than that endless orgasm loop.

1456
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,760
Some of the greatest of them, monks, have not achieved complete Slack.

1457
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:22,940
Don't you want a little bit of that, friend?

1458
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:23,980
Don't you want to just get a cut of that?

1459
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,360
Yeah.

1460
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1461
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1462
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1463
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1464
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1465
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1466
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1467
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1468
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1469
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1470
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1471
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1472
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1473
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1474
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1475
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1476
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1477
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:24,360


1478
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,240
Just a little tiny cut.

1479
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,260
Possibly.

1480
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,580
Undoubtedly, but we will change that point of view once...

1481
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,020
That's subgenius.com.

1482
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:34,500
There's no O in subgenius, but there is in com.

1483
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,420
It is a C in com.

1484
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,360
Is there an O in com?

1485
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,320
Is there an I in denial?

1486
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,260
What was it?

1487
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,160
It is a time and place of com.

1488
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
In the same place there's one in bob.

1489
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:46,700
Right in the middle.

1490
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,660
Dot piece and dot com.

1491
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:49,580
Yeah.

1492
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,960
Synthetic piece, synthetic com.

1493
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,360
Church is actually the only church that is a church.

1494
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1495
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1496
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1497
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1498
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1499
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1500
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:54,360


1501
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,960
It's a dot com, isn't it?

1502
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,780
Isn't that with the number change?

1503
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,560
That's a fraction of a con.

1504
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,020
It's a fraction of the conspiracy itself.

1505
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,580
But, you know, that's the way why we're saying.

1506
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,100
You're tainted with the conspiracy.

1507
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,720
The church is tainted.

1508
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,820
Everything is tainted except for Bob's pipe.

1509
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,460
That's the one clean place.

1510
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,140
And if you can throw yourself into that pipe and let Bob smoke you.

1511
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,020
That's right.

1512
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,460
You're not smoking Bob.

1513
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,600
You're not going, let's get into Bob.

1514
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,140
Get high.

1515
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:24,360
Here.

1516
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1517
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1518
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1519
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1520
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1521
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1522
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1523
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1524
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1525
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,360


1526
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,740
Yeah.

1527
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,140
No!

1528
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,640
It's the other way around.

1529
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,380
And, you know, the thing is, the pipe is actually the thing doing the smoking.

1530
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:40,060
It's sucking Bob's brain and inhaling it in a smoke-like form into the universe.

1531
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:40,660
Yeah.

1532
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,680
It's a reversed pipe.

1533
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,760
It's a reversed time pipe as well.

1534
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,720
That's proof there, Reverend Simon.

1535
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,020
It's both a slack river and a time river.

1536
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,600
And it goes backwards through Bob's head.

1537
00:55:54,360 --> 00:56:01,900
Upwards after his lungs like an ever-vomiting, perfect pureness of love.

1538
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,360
Perpetual motion.

1539
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:09,080
It's a perpetual motion of vomited love coming forth from Bob's pipe.

1540
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,100
And it's made of pure brain being smoked in that thing.

1541
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,220
You have got to get real.

1542
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,320
This is not some game.

1543
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,960
This isn't some metaphor, some performance art.

1544
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,940
This is real.

1545
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:23,200
This is real.

1546
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,020
This is your soul we're talking about.

1547
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:25,600
This is happening.

1548
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,220
It's your income we're talking about.

1549
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,440
And it's the savings you know we're talking about.

1550
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,220
You will.

1551
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,700
Have you willed these conversations with your church?

1552
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,880
Have you thought about it?

1553
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,180
Have you thought about it?

1554
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,520
I have a question for you.

1555
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,480
Look at that breathing down your neck right now.

1556
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,200
He's there.

1557
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,080
He's behind you.

1558
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,160
The structure of this room is hovering.

1559
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,000
It's about ready to grab you up on a scruff of the neck.

1560
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,200
No!

1561
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:51,580
No!

1562
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,640
I have a statement.

1563
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,000
I have a statement.

1564
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,520
And that is you're not Bob.

1565
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,240
You're lost.

1566
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
You are lost San Francisco.

1567
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,180
You saw what happened to some of the other great cities in this country.

1568
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,200
San Francisco you better pay attention.

1569
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:05,680
Berkeley.

1570
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,460
You hear me?

1571
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,400
You hear me now?

1572
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:16,160
San Francisco on line one wants to know what can they do to save their sorry, sorry asses now.

1573
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,400
Thank you for your tribute to this marvelous radio station.

1574
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,060
Here is the word of Bob.

1575
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,140
Golden Bridge.

1576
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,740
Golden.

1577
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:29,060
The next thing they can do is tuck their head between their knees and kiss their fanny goodbye.

1578
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:29,920
After the world.

1579
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,820
They join the church of the subgenius for real.

1580
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,680
And show Bob they really believe.

1581
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,220
By signing their name on that dotted line on that check.

1582
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,580
And would that entitle them to the.

1583
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,100
To subgenius.com.

1584
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:51,040
Would that entitle them to all of the privileges that other subgeniuses would derive.

1585
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,480
No.

1586
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,140
As well as the microorganisms.

1587
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:57,320
No because each subgenius has its own type of privileges and slap.

1588
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,160
It's different for each one.

1589
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,700
For some it's a terrible rip off.

1590
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,460
For some it's an endless pit of bad feelings.

1591
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,320
By the way.

1592
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,360
By the way we missed the ID again.

1593
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:13,880
Oh.

1594
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,780
No.

1595
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,320
The ID.

1596
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,920
We missed the ID.

1597
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,060
From PR news in Washington.

1598
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:21,460
I'm Tom.

1599
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:21,740
That's awful what happened here in an unusual,

1600
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,040
started by a discarded cigarette.

1601
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,920
Catholic Archbishop Sean O'Malley is calling for an end to homosexuals.

1602
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,160
He says he doesn't want homosexuals.

1603
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,860
Personally O'Malley's hostile to homosexuals,

1604
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,160
but views ban and gay men as important for children from Madrid.

1605
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:42,320
The Dow Jones 666 the Spanish government says it is ignoring PR news in Washington.

1606
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,880
So out people come over this Bob,

1607
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,320
this Bob,

1608
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,220
this Bob is the president of the.

1609
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:49,700
Uh.

1610
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:58,220
Bob. No doubt we'll have an interesting hour there. That's Bob. But now I've got a little

1611
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:02,820
joke for you, Bob. Get you, Bob. I've got another joke here for you, Bob. Active Bob. You're free

1612
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:12,320
to go. So help me, Bob. From PR News in Washington, I'm both at the same time. The huge storm system

1613
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,320
that produced the past few days, National Weather Service forecaster Peter says, you've got a cold

1614
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:24,860
front moving eastward and northward. And snowplows try to restore electricity to hundreds of thousands

1615
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:30,680
of miles of interstate highways. Vice President Dickey advocates the use of PR News in Washington.
