You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Soap Genius Hour of Swag!
Oh yes friends and we are going to get right into it.
I don't want to wait. I don't want to wait around.
I'm not going to do the usual 10 minute long intro to the show.
Because friends, as Henny Youngman once said, I wanted to become an atheist but I gave up for they have no holidays.
Well friends, when you're a subgenius you don't have to worry about that because our biggest holiday is coming right up.
In fact, by the time you hear this show it probably will have already happened and you won't be able to hear this show.
Unless you have been a minister with Bob.
An ordinarian.
A day minister and thus, like I have been by the time you hear this show, lifted up in power and glory onto the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
Friends, because five days from the time that I'm making this tape is July 5th, well 1999.
And in...
The end is nigh and the time is nigh for their...
...arizal.
The ariizal...
...is a-coming.
Bob...
...is a-coming.
And if I keep up like this much longer, I will too.
Friends, because this is...
It is that which we have spent our precious thirty dollars for.
It is that which is why we became ordained ministers in this church of Bob.
This church of slack.
This church of...
The subgenius.
And it is because of this that we...
That we do these things.
That we play these tapes that I've got coming up.
Friends, because even though I'm off planet by the time you hear this, I want to rub it in.
I want to make you sick if you're sitting behind listening to this.
I want to make you sick by the fact that you didn't spend your thirty dollars to get on Bob's rocket.
Or to make you sick that you...
In case X-Day doesn't happen this time.
That you did spend that money.
And didn't get on Bob's rocket.
And Bob screwed up again.
But friends, that only means we weren't ready.
And he's just been testing us.
Oh, yes.
This music in the background is Thelrion.
And, uh...
And, friends, the things that we have coming up besides the escape vessels and the X-Saucers.
And the destruction of the conspiracy.
And the peaks and the normals.
And the conspiracy of the dunces that has held us down, friends.
That has robbed away the slack of the abnormal.
And has made us think that it is perfectly natural to go to, for instance, work for a living.
Or to, for instance, get married in order that God and the law will think everything's cool.
Well, anyway, friends, I don't want to get into that.
What I want to get into, though, are these incredible CDs we've gotten from so many of our friends.
And famous amateurs.
And, um, Negative Land and Chumbawamba have...
This CD out, which we will be playing.
I have this amazing Bran Flakes sound collage material that is cool as hell.
We've got Eddie the Rat.
Similar strange sound collages.
And yet another one like that.
We've also got media barrages from, of course, Steinstein's Secret Orchestra.
We have recordings from the DeVivals.
My God, there's been spirit-filled, fire-flame-filled DeVivals all over this great...
But tainted land.
In Portland, Seattle, we'll have...
You'll be hearing the preaching of the great preachers in those places.
And you'll be hearing Susie the Floozy's final apocalyptic radio show.
The beautiful, luscious Susie the Floozy.
You'll be hearing Friday Jones' smoky, breathy voice promising torture and damnation for you and your friends.
You'll hear the new media barrage from the Ministry of Found Objects.
And the new music that was given to me last next day by Heather Hillman.
And what, like I said, in the background, what you've just been hearing is...
was Therion.
I guess that was the end of their grand finale.
What a shame.
I had a little rant here I wanted to go ahead and read and get it over with right at the beginning of the show.
And that music probably would have been just right.
But instead we'll just go with this sort of a...
This is Ron Slabe's electronic music.
Just to give us sort of a rug.
And this was a...
Friends, this is a rant that doesn't have a damn thing to do with X Day.
And it's fairly short.
But I wanted to read it because I never got around to it.
I don't think.
I don't think I ever did read this one to y'all.
It was a rant that came along after the Monica Gate problems.
Um...
Oddly enough, some conservatives think that if you criticize conservatives that means you love President Clinton.
They...
Still don't get it.
I could care less about which dummy...
Well, that's the point of this rant, friends.
I have learned an important lesson.
Wait a minute.
That ain't gonna cut it.
That ain't gonna cut it.
I gotta put on something that'll cut it.
That ain't gonna cut no ice.
Where is my damn...
Now I know that if I stick just anything by E-S-O in, it'll almost certainly be perfect.
If I flip this over and go like this.
What'd I tell you?
Okay.
Friends, because I have learned an important lesson from that tiny civil war that flared up briefly.
There on alt-binary slack.
Because my job is to bash rival religious nuts, false prophets, and all-pinks, right?
Well, I gotta admit, in studying all the evil crimes of my enemies, the religious nuts,
a certain local kind of which are more numerous and vocal over on what's called the conservative side,
I got so into that hate that I started to forget the crimes of the other religious nuts.
The one referred to, if rarely by itself, as liberal.
And this is a good example of why the conspiracy set it up so that we would appear to have only two basic options.
Both of them totally screwed up, actually.
Both of them there for nothing more than to control us.
The United States alone, potentially, friends, if you think about it, often,
offers over 275 million options for who could control us.
And needless to say, they leave out the only possible correct option,
which is the word of Bob!
The terms liberal and conservative have become practically meaningless nowadays, friends.
Because like the Bible, they can mean so many things to so many different people
that they kind of cancel themselves out in internal contradictions.
But each side uses the other side.
The other as an excuse to remove different kinds of slack.
One robs this kind of slack.
The other robs that kind of slack.
Whichever one steals the most diverts your divine hate towards itself and away from the other.
And then they have you exactly where they wanted you.
On one of their sides, friends.
Stuck to the tar baby of the conspiracy.
And so...
I have resolved to prime my hate dynamo by broadening my education
so as to cover the crimes of all false prophets and thus to better smite all pinks.
It might not be a bad idea for other sub-genii,
especially the ones who are as mule-headed and agitated and or as superior as myself,
to kind of check their oil, too.
We must remember that, according to the Bible,
according to Dobbs,
any politician who does not have a membership card in its pocket
is absolutely not to be trusted.
And any politician who has a sub-genius membership card in its pocket
is absolutely not to be trusted.
So, you know, perhaps the republic goons and the democratons
are engaged in total self-destruction even as we speak.
But even so, they would only be replaced by two more
bear traps for suckers.
You know, the refertarian party versus the liberform party, maybe, or something.
But it certainly won't be the patriopsychotic anarcho-materialist party.
Anything but that!
Because then there'd be no conspiracy at all, friends!
No, no conspiracy at all.
But as Fran Lebowitz said,
humility is no substitute for a good personality.
And Bob Dobbs has neither.
But as Sam Levinson said,
and Bob would agree,
it's so simple to be wise,
just think of something stupid to say,
and then don't say it.
And I think that really that's pretty much the way Bob pulls it off.
That said, friends, let's me just shut up
and move on into this beautiful,
beautiful explorations of X-Day.
And friends, it's what you're missing.
And also, and probably what I'm missing too,
if Bob's...
No, I'm not even gonna think that way.
And all this other tape.
So...
Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Well I can't keep saying this.
Enjoy, oh yeah.




Next week we get on with this new documentary.
We look forward to seeing you all next week on the Little City.
Happy New Year.
See you all then, see you next time.
Happy New Year!
messages.
In the year of the dragon, lots of men disappear. Quiet as is kept. They won't be back next year.
Johnny Domino was one of San Francisco's hottest young jazz musicians.
But fate and a cosmic event were about to change his life forever.
What the doctors told him seemed impossible.
John, your brain has managed to acquire the capacity to pick up certain frequencies like a radio.
They're dark. I'm only hearing bad stuff.
Yes, exactly. You're tuned to the frequency of evil.
Then a spirit forms in the open air,П Energize, that spares no trace.
овой мне!


Yeah I wasДа
this way
Ugh
to misery land.
Are you ready to accept a miracle in your life?
Yes?
Put a glide in your stride and dip in your hip
and come on to the moon.
Then listen to this tape.
Miracles can happen.
They do.
Are you ready to accept a miracle in your life?
Papa, no!
Hurry, we've got no time to lose!
Going so soon?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Why, my little party's just beginning.
Crack, crack like mice, rats.
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away.
We'll let them think about it a little first.
It's time to pray, America.
There's a new sitcom coming, folks.
It's called Armageddon.
Or Armageddon.
That's what it's called, Armageddon!
The greatest war of all wars will be fought.
The Battle of Armageddon will be fought.
The blood will flow in the streets
up to the bridles of the horses for 200 miles.
Oh, this is a gap!
Oh!
Oh!
Lean forward to it, Mr. Stan.
You are the basic truth in us.
You are the reality.
We will never let you down.
And we will always be grateful.
I'll tell you what.
Five dogs came to town to set you free!
Surely, I come quickly.
Amen.
My!
People come and go.

They go so quickly here.
In both instances, he's coming literally, visibly, and bodily.
Brother, every time I see another spaceship going to the moon
in the exploration of the moon,
and soon driving the new automobiles they're making for the moon,
I say in my heart, he must be coming soon now.
Come.
Let each one who hears them say the same.
Come.
Let the thirsty one come.
Anyone who wants to, without charge.
He who has said all things, declares,
Yes, I am coming soon.
God said, taste and see.
Just try it for yourself.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Frightening him like that when he came to you for help!
Silence!
With a snapper!
The beneficent Oz has every intention of granting your requests.
What's that? What is he saying?
What is he saying?
At first, you must prove yourselves worthy.
By the power of God.
By performing a very small task.
He didn't tell us to clean up the fish pond.
He said to fish in it.
In the universe, we're in a world full of action.
Something is happening.
We're in the race of the young generation.
We're on the go.
We want the domination.
Something is happening.
Something is happening now.
Yeah!
Oh!
Watch out for us.
We're an atonic reaction.
Something is happening.
We've got the pressure of a new motivation.
We're gonna live in one to change this formation.
Something is happening.
Something is happening now.
Oh!
And now we are on the verge of the greatest and the final war.
If we have an all-out war now, let me tell you something.
It will be the last.
And a blue ribbon panel of experts from MIT and Harvard University were asked to do a study using all of the computers, the military experts, and everything else to study and see what is the possibility of a nuclear war in this century.
They came back and they said, we expect a limited nuclear war before 1984 and an all-out nuclear holocaust before 1999.
And they said that we see it as inevitable.
And there's good reason for that.
Because of the wonderful things you know.
Those awful days that are still ahead for you and me.
Beginning in chapter 3 of 2 Peter, verses 10 through 14.
But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.
Some have thought this means perhaps a nuclear blast.
And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.
That's tremendous heat isn't it?
The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?
I suppose I could put on my black costume and fly over the Emerald City a few times on my flaming broomstick.
Double.
Double.
Double.
Double.
Double.
Double toiol and trouble.
Fire burns and cauldrons bubble.
This is a potent weird truth
That we've cooked up just for you.
Just look inside
Just look inside
And see what it is we've done
It's made of uranium
And it's called the atomic bomb
Ah, yes, the hard things
Yes, friends, that amazing collage of end-of-the-world material
was by my beautiful Reverend Susie the Floozy.
And, yeah, I think those things are brains.
She has got to be one of the most
skilled audio collagists in the whole of Asia.
And by the time you hear this,
I will be on the escape vessels with Susie the Floozy.
God, what strange chemistry that could create,
who knows?
Oh, and actually, the very beginning of that collage involved
what's not by her.
The very beginning was a new piece we got in
called...
From the Ministry of Found Objects.
That's a new ministry in our church
with this tape called Half-Assed X-Day Song Barrage,
which is of a terrible technical quality.
But, hell, let's just move on to something of...
Because we're moving on, friends.
We are moving on.
We're out of here.
...lights in one month at Brushwood.
Amazing.
There it is.
Sub-genius.
Dot com.
For more information.
From up here in the escape vessels,
we see the Earth blinking and winking down below.
There are some garbled signals, though, coming through
as we look out the windows.
It looks like G. Gordon Gordon and Stang
on the edge of a wing or something,
or eating chicken wings or something.
Oh, we're just sitting out here on the wing in our moon pants,
playing, sipping,
and playing with ourselves,
sitting out on the wing of the escape vessel.
Well, your voice is gone, man.
When your diapers fill up,
those moon pants are ready to jump.
Man, he did have a cold after X-Day.
That's why we party in our moon pants.
Well, why are the radio...
You know, I didn't know that the radio station
was going to be down by the engine room.
We're not in a good spot at all.
We're deluding ourselves.
We're kidding ourselves, you guys.
We were.
But we're not this year.
We're still on Earth.
Damn it, listen to me.
We don't know what it was.
We are not kidding.
This year, we have the rockets.
Come on, I mean, come on, snap out of it, you guys.
I can face it.
X-Day came.
X-Day went.
Well, you were tired and feathered.
Because we didn't have rockets.
That was the problem.
But we have rockets this year.
I think you can well imagine.
Big ones.
But on the other hand, you know,
I think a lot of people and a lot of subgeniuses,
in fact, Dr. Lake Hume himself,
was...
saying, well, I guess this is the end of the church,
and I was going, what the hell are you talking about?
And it was only the beginning.
It was only the beginning.
That's what X-Day was.
It was only the beginning.
It was only a way to weed out the chaff, right?
You got to get the chaff off of the kernels there.
Yeah, my rocket is definitely bigger than yours.
My smart bomb.
My bomb is smarter than yours.
And I've got a long fuse.
Not at all, Hal.
How do you mean?
Yeah.
Well, it's rather difficult to define.
Well, say it.
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.
Well, I know I've never completed my thought process.
The safest place to be is right at the launch pad.
That there are some extremely awful,
hard things about this mission.
Of course, it involves subgeniuses.
Everything depends on how long we can stall them
while still showing results.
And we have shown results.
Well, this is great, but you can't have enough.
200 years, we'll be back in 1990, 1999.
And they will be.
And what if in 1999, Dobbs strings them along a little further?
We might end up having an X-Day gut blowout.
There will be no need for that.
On a yearly basis.
There will be no need after this year.
If the X's don't come and get us,
nobody will ever allow us to have a party on their land again.
And here's an example soundtrack from the party
we had last year at that camp around.
No borders looking for it.
Angels looking fit and mean.
Try to stand up.
This is the new goat.
Blood wrestling.
There's a beautiful girl.
And an obese man called El Gordo.
Wrestling.
Yes, it's quite a spectacle, friends, these X-Day events.
And we hope to see you there in the past.
Once we've traveled back in time and time controlled it,
we'll see how you would do it right.
We've had a second chance, you see.
If we could only create a time controlled loop
that would give all of us that second chance
to do this all again.
My god, I'm so scared.
I can't believe this.
Put together one more time.
Put together one more time.

Put together one more time.

Put together one more time.
Put together one more time.
Put together one more time.
Get together one more time.
Get together one more time.
Get together one more time.
Get together one more time.


One more time.
Hey, come on, honey.
I'm not giving in.
But last week, we fired a big boy rocket out of Cape Brushwood
against a possible Holocaust or evangelical encampments.
Because, well, the NASA-jellicles, of which I am the only one,
some big phony sky, and the leguminati.
It has been rumored, have been having secret discussions
referring to a possible peace accord
between the evangelicals and the Holocaustals.
We'll just see about that.
One hundred years away
The leguminati and the NASA-jellicles
Beware and be warned.
The Leguminati and the NASA-jellicles
The Leguminati and the NASA-jellicles

I realize
It's cantidad
A thousand times
That, together with Cette écoeur

Via ces ét� Ireland

Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Watch out for some of those hot blinders.
You've been taking.
You know the ones that apply you too low.
Yeah.
Look out for some of those seven lives you've been taking.
To see the ones that apply you too low.
Yeah.
Talk about with the power of soul.
Anything is possible.
With the power.
Of you.
Anything you want to do.
Of you.

Flyin' through the air on the kite every day and every night.
Just to take a risk.
Sometimes the weather ain't right.
Yeah, playin' too much of one toy, baby.
Just to be a escape to the trip of nights.
Oh yeah.
And you look around and see old Jollyfish.
Yeah.
He said, floatation's groovy, baby.
It's just too much.




And even he'll tell you then
Yeah, getting high every day is easy
And it's floating around
Even a jolly bitch will agree to that
Yeah, I'm staying with the power
On you
The way you wanna be, baby
Look out now
With the power on you
And it's anything you want to do
With the power, power of soul
And everything that's so
With the power, the power of you
All your brothers and sisters
Get together and live together
With the power of soul
And everything that's so

With the power, the power of you
Anything you wanna do
Yeah, just when you're thinking about old Bubba,
the one that didn't wanna join the church,
well, the TV on this escape vessel in front of you
lights up and there's this shot of Bubba down there
eating a rotten rat
and hiding from the death
machines that the rogue pinks made
from the stolen womb of parts
and he'll, Bubba'll be down there
muttering to himself
Oh, how could I do it?
That was so stupid
I could've been saved
But no, I didn't send my twenty dollars
Oh God, here comes another rogue beast
And here I am in this festering pile
of rat-wasted dead people
and stripped bare skulls
If only I could die
If only I could die
But I can't, I can't
Why, if only Bob was here now
I'd give him my twenty dollars
I'd give him forty dollars
I'd give you everything I own, Bob, please
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs
Didn't trust him twenty dollars worth
Okay, fine, fine
No skin off our teeth
Pay lip service
Wear that Bob t-shirt
Be real hip
But when the Bob Dobbs show up
Those saucers come
Well, you're either on the bus
Or you're off the bus
As those great proto-sub-geni used to say
And the dumbest nerd could get on the bus for twenty bucks
Well, actually, those twenty dollars don't count
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade
But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are
At least made it possible for their betters
To ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses
And they'll be an orientation film
That they'll show you when you're ruptured up
You know, because otherwise it might be
Kind of confusing
This orientation film
It's kind of projected into your head
It's introduced by Princess We Are Doe
Queen of all the UFOs
Who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon
Slash Viking Brunhilde
With metal pointed breastplates
And a horned helmet
And a horned helmet
And all this UFO insignia on anything
And she is the mistress of the path of least resistance
And she narrates this film
And it's like, you will hear and obey
Take off your clothes
And you can watch the
You can either watch the orientation film
Or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day
Or you can just, you know, go back to
Having your fun with the different silences
You go through all sorts of evil

And all the scenes are
Back and forth
It's also pretty common
We'll begin by entreting batteries
So
And talk about
The opposite of the ideal
And what there's going to be
jealousy. It's, you'll always, it's like, there's no sense of possessiveness because on that,
in that no zone of the saucers, time ceases to exist, or at least it feels that way. And you
don't need to be grasping anymore like you did on Earth. The overwhelming feeling that you get on
the, on the escape vessels is like, wow, the best part is it lasts as long as I want it to,
and I can take forever. I'm immortal for now, and I don't have the urge to grab this and keep it
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing. I don't have to kill or defeat another
monkey man to hang on to these, these big round soft things. I have plenty of time to get to those
other big soft round things, more than I could ever use. My pipe overfloweth, and the big round
soft thing shuts.
Help follow me through the land of Dobbs, and I will dwell in the cliff in between forever.
Hey, baby, where do you come from?
Well, she looked at me and smiled and looked at this face and said, I'm coming from the land of a new
present, so
then I said, hey, baby, where you trying to go to?
Then she says, I'm gonna spit, spread a line, be some ice, and I'll hold on to love to you and you.
Hey, would I like to come along?
Yes, I'd like to come along.
Would you like to come along, should I speak?
Yes, take me along right now.
Take me along.
I honestly don't know whether it was the future or the past.
Okay, we're good down to the last minute, the final minute.
We will be.
Wait, now we're down to.
There is something that we will be.
We will be last, by the way.
We're getting down to 40 seconds.
Four Kool-Aids.
35 seconds.

rockets directly
at the people
that will be waiting
to swat down the rockets with their
sticks or catch the rockets with their
big nets.
But we will launch horizontal launched
rockets at
the combatants.
You really don't
want to miss this. Man
versus rocket event
at XX Day.
That's right. This is going to be
an event to end
literally
all events.
How can you beat that?
How can you beat that? Rockets
launched at people. That
is better than
shooting bullets at people.
People will catch bullets in their teeth.
We're shooting rockets
at people who will be defending
themselves with nothing but
defending themselves only with the football
uniforms they'll be wearing. But they will be
offending themselves
or defending the goal
with the big sticks and the fish
nets to swat rockets out of the
air. So if you'd like to see rockets
being swatted out of the
air in this fashion
or an alternate would be
if the rocket is not swatted out of the air
and it achieves its objective
of either taking out one of the
opponents or
scoring a goal.
Now how do they score a goal?
Well, we'll come up with that.
Maybe they score.
What's their goal if they swat a rocket out of the sky?
If they literally can swat
it right out of the sky? Because it's
only going to be traveling about 15 feet
high.
But

and then the villagers gathered up the sheep and they all went off into the desert
they're all like trying to scurry away
the complexities of the nuances that the musicians are bringing to this particular
production arises out of a far-needed

Psalm
Word That Easter
Start with revivalist preachers.
Hallelujah. Praise God.
The fire and brimstone Pentecostals and fundamentalists.
Go to the church.
Sit in the rear about three quarters of the way back.
Repetitive music will be played while the people come in for service.
A repetitive beat.
45 to 72 beats per minute.
A rhythm close to the beat of a human heart.
The music is probably the same for every service or incorporates the same beat.
Watch the people waiting for the service to begin.
Many will exhibit slightly dilated eyes.
Often they will begin swaying back and forth with their hands in the air
while sitting in the service.
The assistant pastor will probably come out and he usually speaks with a pretty good voice role.
The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 45 to 60 beats per minute.
The Lord is good.
Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
Next, a group of young women in sweet and pure chiffon dresses might come out to sing a song.
In the middle of the song, one of the girls might be smitten by the spirit and fall down or react as if possessed.
At this point, hypnosis and conversion tactics are being mixed.
In the background, a 45-beat per minute voice role from the assistant preacher might exhort,
give a song.
Give to God.
Give to God.
Oh, ye of little faith.
What can I say?
Yes, foolish mortals, beware.
The dog's bird has landed.
He's Bob.
Bob don't ever change.
He's Bob.
Oh,
always will be Bob.
His pipe is the one with the doll that rains on the roof like fire.
His neck is the one with the wattle inflaming your desire.
He's Bob.
Come on, Oaf.
Bob don't ever change.
He's Bob.
Always will be Bob.
Bob had a woman named Connie.
She was a righteous frail.
She had a lot of friends named Johnny.
When Bobby hit the trail.
He's Bob.
Bob don't ever change.



change. It's Bob. Always will be Bob. Bob was the god of the forest who claims his jungle pride.
His pet was a brontosaurus that Bob he used to ride. He's Bob. Bob don't ever change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob.
Ladies and gentlemen, Ivan Stang, The Water God.
I'm here for you. Are you ready to accept a miracle in your life?
Well, I don't know whether that's getting through to you or not there at home. I'm hearing some
strange things in my headphones. Apparently some bleed through from the last feature, but
that's impossible.
Tonight, we will take a live penetrating look at the Chupa Chupa subgenius.
A kamikaze gang of cat burglars and child prostitutes conjuring cash from chaos.
Did you hear that?
Give up. Give up.
Come on.
I'll go soon.
Get out of here.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.

Stop.
