1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:10,780
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,200
A mighty, mighty time.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,740
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,880
So we're going to add real experiences to your database.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,880
We want power! We want power! We want power!

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,280
No, no, no.

7
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,040
No, no, no.

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,700
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:56,240
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie, It's a Wonderful Life.

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,920
No trouble.

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,220
Just get set and get going.

12
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,960
Hey, recording.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,400
Everything's going fine.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,220
No trouble.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,320
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:13,980
Bob?

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,120
Bob?

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,480
Ray!

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,220
Bob!

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,580
You can read along with me in your book.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,800
You will know it is time to turn the page when you hear R2-D2 beat.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,060
Oh!

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,120
The revolutionary

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,260
that

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,440
did

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,460
half

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,560
over

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,780
and

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,140
oped

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,200
a new being through forbidden knowledge previously kept secret for centuries by the jealous priesthoods

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,920
of many religions. Caution. Improper viewing techniques may lead in some persons to dependency,

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,360
seizures, cranial fits, priapic conditions, micturition, sternutation, subtle glandular

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,880
mutations, and in some territories, legal arrest. However, if the viewer follows instructions and

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,140
trusts completely in Bob, this tape can produce an unsurpassable beatific experience that can last

36
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:36,320
for hours, days, weeks, possibly even centuries. This videotape bears a patented Dobsdrome PowerShell

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,800
time code, which may cause some home video decks to react unpredictably. Although only a small

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,760
percentage of playback systems or their owners have suffered permanent damage from this signal,

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,060
the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated is not responsible for injuries or damages inflicted

40
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,000
by paranormal events during tape play mode.

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,520
The tape also contains a subliminal hypnopediatrics trance inducement tone, operating beyond the range of human perception.

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:14,620
However, pets in the viewing room may exhibit unusual behavior, as may small children and certain less evolved adults.

43
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,220
If such behavior anomalies last more than two days after viewing, consult a physician.

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,220
Bob? Bob? Bob?

45
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:46,540
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind. Every time I say, see, hear, or think.

46
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,480
Bob?

47
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:54,380
That's your key phrase. It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

48
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,780
We are controlling transmission.

49
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:05,640
However, this brainwave-enfolding signal is generally harmless and should actually enhance your learning abilities during the program.

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,800
Special interactive holosonic stereo effects produced on the Altomate Cerebral Synclock Interocitor

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,000
are designed to trigger stem cleavage, or brain division, between the forebrain and hindbrain.

52
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,260
Using newly discovered break-thinking principles, the viewer's brainwaves are locked into synchronization

53
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,760
with the tape's underlying signal.

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,420
This tape is then used to generate signal suggestions by means of neuroelectric pulses.

55
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,440
Plant growth and gas mileage of nearby automobiles may be affected.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,780
For the unworthy, this tape may be a one-way ticket down a bottomless mental pit from which there can be no escape.

57
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:50,840
In unreceptive viewers, there is a danger of synaptic backfire in the brain pan, caused by overheating of the attention gland.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,740
This dense packing of brain cells without proper organic coolants, such as fries,

59
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,120
has been blamed for three recent cases of spontaneous human combustion.

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,340
Do not over-medicate.

61
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,380
High dosages have so sensitized the third nostril receptors of some viewers

62
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,940
that they were unable to stop seeing the tape even after it had been turned off.

63
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,760
This tape is to be used only by the person to whom it is prescribed.

64
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,360
Do not operate a motor vehicle following viewing.

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,360
Do not operate heavy farm machinery at speeds over 70 miles an hour.

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
The Demon of the World.

67
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,440
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.

68
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,480
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

69
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,140
Always resurface from the hypnosis slowly.

70
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,720
Coming out of the tape has been likened to a total rebirth process, if managed successfully.

71
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:54,620
If you have trouble re-entering the earth plane, focus on Bob and chant his name until you remember your own.

72
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,060
What exactly does this do for them?

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,080
It causes them to forget everything they have learned and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

74
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,840
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,400
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,380
There is absolutely no other possibility.

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:56,720
If you follow these instructions, you will experience the power of the divine.

81
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,700
It is a profound cathartic reaction to the flow of archetypal images and racial memories.

82
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,280
You may find yourself laughing and crying convulsively and even astrally projecting.

83
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,820
These are normal.

84
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,540
Enjoy them.

85
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,520
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

86
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:29,260
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

87
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,400
Subgenius.

88

The.

104
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,040
Hour.

105
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,400
The hour of slack, dear friends.

106
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,220
Yes.

107
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,220
What is your answer?

108
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,880
Laser calling.

109
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,040
Okay, we got the balance.

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,380
Why did this happen so quickly?

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,420
I think they're wrong, though.

112
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,200
I think there is hope.

113
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,860
And friends, those of you listening to the hour of slack for the first time,

114
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,800
you should call the station and ask the questions, which you must surely have.

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,080
You may speak to Will O'Dobbs here at 823-7490.

116
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,760
Please do that.

117
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:21,660
Please do call Will O'Dobbs, 823-7490, and beg of him for slack.

118
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,980
Because you ain't going to get it from this radio program.

119
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,540
Actually, you will, friends.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,680
We don't really take the slack away.

121
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,420
Call 823-8534.

122
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,700
What is your reason?

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
What is your reason?

124
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,960
How can I be happy?

125
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,380
What is your cause?

126
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,440
How can I be happy?

127
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,460
What is your reason?

128
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,640
What is your reason?

129
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,680
What is your cause?

130
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,620
That's Hinton.

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
Tim Plahr in the background.

132
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,940
By the way, I gave you that time.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,860
I don't know why I did that.

134
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,940
I gave you the wrong number there.

135
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,260
823-7490 is the number to call.

136
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,380
Yeah, well, why do you think they call it subgenius?

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
You've heard that before.

138
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,940
Friends, you may have noticed that the Republicans are running two rich boys for president.

139
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,420
Now, I don't mean to get real partisan with this show because we're not Democrats or Republicans.

140
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,140
Generally, subgeniuses are what you call patriopsychotic anarcho-materialists.

141
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:49,100
However, I was in New York a couple of weeks ago, and the theory that is going around the New York media people,

142
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,240
people in big radio stations, big conspiracy newspapers, big, big entertainment,

143
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,960
the theory is that the Republicans, by getting George Bush and Quayle in there,

144
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,640
are trying to throw the election.

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,440
They don't want a Republican administration to take the blame for what they know is about to happen.

146
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,900
In other words, the Republicans realize that there will be an inevitable economic crash,

147
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,900
moral decline, environmental horror beyond human imagining.

148
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,340
And so they'd rather let the Republicans, I mean the Democrats, take the blame.

149
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,600
And if you think about it, it kind of makes sense.

150
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,780
I mean, they obviously don't expect every good old boy to vote for these two prep school dudes,

151
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,660
you know, no matter what their merits may be, if any, which is still questionable.

152
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,740
And so they want, like I say, the Democrats to take the blame.

153
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,560
And obviously, as we all know, the public is dumb enough to believe just that,

154
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,280
so that four years later, the Republicans can get in for good.

155
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,860
Good.

156
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,780
And I do mean for good.

157
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,600
Good, you see.

158
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,660
That's the whole idea behind it.

159
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,160
So, friends, don't just vote for president.

160
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
I want you to get out there and vote, but vote for Bob for everything.

161
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,420
Bob for everything, dear friends.

162
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,140
Let Bob take the blame.

163
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,100
Let Bob take the fall.

164
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,860
Let Bob take the rap.

165
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,700
Let Bob be the Lee Harvey Oswald.

166
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,580
J.R. Bob Dobbs is glad to be the sacrifice.

167
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,020
He's the official lamb, if you'll just elect him world overlord.

168
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
What is your mission?

169
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,560
What is your mission?

170
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,500
That is your mission, dear friends.

171
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,640
Thanks to all who pledged last time.

172
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,360
We did have a, well, half-decent turnout.

173
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,480
Half-decent.

174
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,160
And we really, by that token, we appreciate all the more those who did manage to pledge.

175
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,000
And thank you all.

176
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,780
Again, if you have to know, call 888-722-7222.

177
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,500
823-7490.

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,620
That's our car.

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,820
I will be alone with this for the next 30 minutes.

180
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,060
Oh, gosh.

181
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,900
Hey.

182
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,300
Hey.

183
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:33,840
Hey.

184
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,120


185
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,260


186
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,780
Hey.

187
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


188
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


189
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


190
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


191
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


192
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


193
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


194
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


195
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


196
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


197
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:34,780


198
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,320
Hey.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,040
Hey.

200
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,560
Hey.

201
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,160
Hey.

202
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,120
Hey.

203
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,440
Hey.

204
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,640
Hey.

205
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,900
Hey.

206
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,440
Hey.

207
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,000
Hey.

208
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,600
Hey.

209
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:46,600


210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:46,840
Hey.

211
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:46,940
Hey.

212
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,740
Hey.

213
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,180
Hey.

214
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


215
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


216
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,580


217
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,860
Hey.

218
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:49,860


219
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:49,860


220
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,580
Hey.

221
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,600
Hey.

222
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,960
Little realized even by leading scientists, there are really only two races,

223
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,500
actually two distinct species of so-called human beings.

224
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,900
If you gaze upon any given street, normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

225
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,000
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary-looking crowd,

226
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,700
on an ordinary day, a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.

227
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:37,580
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that carries the rare subgenius gene.

228
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,340
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe, a new dimension,

229
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,940
coexisting not always in harmony alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,260
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

231
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,440
Now, at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

232
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,100
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

233
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,260
Behold us, for we are the subgeniuses!

234
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,000
My name is Reverend Ivan Stank.

235
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,980
I am the...

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,340
last sole survivor of the Battle of Dobstown,

237
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,660
popularly called Bob's Last Stand.

238
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,280
I knowed J.R. Bob Dobbs for what he was,

239
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,560
and I knowed the subgeniuses for what they was.

240
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,340
Turn that thing on!

241
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,560
Put on them headphones.

242
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,100
111 years ago,

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,700
when I was 33 years old,

244
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,400
right after the atomic wars,

245
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:03,660
my church was rubbed out by a band of wild pink boys.

246
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,240
Wait a minute!

247
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,540
It's showtime.

248
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,580
Time for the subgenius hour and a half.

249
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,400
The show that dare not even exist.

250
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,120
Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime!

251
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,980
Time for the subgenius hour and a half. The show that dare not even exist. Join us now as we rocket away out of normal time into showtime!

252
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,300
And Jane or Hyperclete's beats for ye.

253
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,760
And Jane or Hyperclete's beats for ye.

254
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,340
You won't want to miss the startling new horror film from Jane or Hyperclete's Film Studios in conjunction with Bob and Jeff Pictures.

255
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,380
Yes, this is a classic tale of terror designed to make you shiver in your boots.

256
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Joan, that thing back over there by the acid pool.

257
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,040
My God, it ain't got no fiiiice!

258
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,980
No, you won't want to miss the show.

259
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,580
You won't want to miss the show.

260
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,940
Joan, that thing back over there by the acid pool.

261
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,100
My God, it ain't got no fiiiiiice!

262
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,400
Joan, that thing back over there by the acid pool.

263
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,400


264
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,660
Hey Frank, you know that thing we were looking at the other day?

265
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,220
You know that thing over there by the acid pool what pulled Joan and them in or whatever?

266
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,620
I just got to looking at that thing and I just happened to notice...

267
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,320
It ain't got no faaaaaiice!

268
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,780
Yes, officer, he was right over there. He was by the acid pool.

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,480
And Joe was just telling me about it.

270
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,760
And I said I couldn't believe it.

271
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,580
I couldn't believe there was some kind of thing by the acid pool that didn't have no face.

272
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,600
I heard stories about it, how it pulled Joan and them in and everything,

273
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,000
but I didn't believe them.

274
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,660
And now my husband's gone, and they say the murderer didn't have a face,

275
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,940
and they say he's dead, and they say the killer didn't have a face.

276
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,440
Pretty weird, that's all I can say.

277
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,720
As far as the monster not having a face,

278
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,940
personally, I think that's just a bunch of...

279
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,420
If you could give us the facts, ma'am,

280
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,160
if you could simply try to stick to the facts.

281
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,620
Well, I don't care.

282
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,080
You can kill all my children as long as the murderer's got a face.

283
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,460
You can take my grandpa and my uncle.

284
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,660
He ain't got no legs.

285
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,400
You can kill him.

286
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,420
You can kill him dead as long as you don't try to say that the murderer ain't got a face.

287
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,540
Frank, he's gone.

288
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,000
He's gone.

289
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,060
And they're trying to tell me that the murderer ain't got a face.

290
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,760
You're trying to say that he ain't got no face!

291
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,300
Well, he was down there by the acid pool.

292
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,880
Now, exactly what acid pool are you referring to, Mr. Ferguson?

293
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,340
Well, you know, down there, Simmons Acid Pool,

294
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,940
right down there, back over there where they saw a thing

295
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,400
where it didn't have a face.

296
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,960
It didn't have no face.

297
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
I remember blue.

298
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,680
There were blue lights all around the room.

299
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,540
And what about the face, ma'am?

300
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,660
Did you get a glimpse of the face?

301
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,920
The face?

302
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,620
Certainly I saw the face.

303
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,080
It was rather long.

304
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,440
It looked sort of like...

305
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,540
Sort of like...

306
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,540
Well, I've got nothing to worry about.

307
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm just going to stay away from Simmons Acid Pool and close to you, Bill.

308
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,160
Bill?

309
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,380
Bill?

310
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,200
What's wrong with your nose?

311
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,740
Bill, it feels like it's made out of rubber.

312
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,300
Oh, that ain't nothing.

313
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,200
It's just something I do to protect the others.

314
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,600
Bill, this is a mask.

315
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,420
What are you doing wearing a mask, Bill?

316
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,800
This isn't Halloween.

317
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,480
What did it look like?

318
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,440
Well, it was...

319
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,460
Oh, I'd say it was sort of...

320
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,560
Oh, well, I could definitely say that it...

321
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,500
I can't remember.

322
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,920
A thing?

323
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,120
It had no face?

324
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,560
Back over there behind Simmons Acid Pool?

325
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,440
Yeah, my son told me about that.

326
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,300
I don't believe that.

327
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,460
He takes him pills all the time.

328
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,080
Now, I seen a thing that didn't have no head over there by the Hathaway's Acid Pool.

329
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,380
And it seems I called...

330
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:55,400
Well, tell of quite a few things missing their bodily parts over at Jones Acid Pool.

331
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,920
I believe there's somebody seen an old man with no legs.

332
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,400
Or maybe he had his legs, maybe he just lost his car keys or something like that.

333
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,860
Thought you might be interested, Sheriff.

334
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,160
I caught this mess of crappie down over behind Simmons Acid Pool.

335
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,360
Now, this one here is a pretty nice-sized crappie.

336
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,660
It's...

337
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,380
It's perfectly well-formed.

338
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,380


339
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,380


340
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,380


341
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,380


342
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,040
completely natural in every way.

343
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,080
Minus its face!

344
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,160
No, you won't want to miss the spine-tingling, mind-numbing horror of

345
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,520
Joan, that thing back over there by the acid pool.

346
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,260
My God, it ain't got no face.

347
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,640
This terrifying facial feature is rated R.

348
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,980
A corpse with no face? That's a damn lie.

349
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,960
It was alive.

350
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,180
It was alive.

351
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,040
Oh, well, dear friends, that was Janer Hypercletes,

352
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,040
the immortal Janer Hypercletes, with the thing-with-no-face ad.

353
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,340
Can you believe that guy's trying to get jobs with that tape?

354
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,440
Hope your left channel is working. I really do.

355
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,960
We've got some great news in.

356
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,480
This is going to be kind of a news show tonight,

357
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,240
because the new issue of Fortean Times has come in,

358
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,860
and in the meantime, you can call, for more information, 823-7490,

359
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,720
to find out more about the Church of the Subgenius and the Hour of Slack.

360
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
Yeah, this magazine, Fortean Times from England,

361
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,440
study of weirdness in general, fantastic magazine.

362
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,680
I'll go straight to the news here.

363
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,960
Here's a little stretch of clippings about holes in heads.

364
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,200
Human beings continue to survive the most horrific,

365
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,040
head injuries.

366
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,040
Two recent examples are well up to standard.

367
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,500
James Sexton of California was shot six times in the head

368
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,980
and lived to tell the tale.

369
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,000
The .22 caliber bullets were fired at him while he slept,

370
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,780
probably by his former roommate, police said.

371
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,340
One slug was lodged behind the 40-year-old's eye,

372
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,160
but none penetrated the brain.

373
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,220
Doctors said they had no plans to remove any of the bullets.

374
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,360
Robert Holton, here in another story,

375
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,260
said he speared himself,

376
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,220
in the temple,

377
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,220
with a six-inch nail

378
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,260
by accidentally treading on a piece of wood he was using

379
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,540
to build a garden shed.

380
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,960
The plank sprang up and hit him in the face.

381
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,200
Holton, 28, ran indoors with the nail still embedded in his skull.

382
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,820
His wife called an ambulance,

383
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,560
but he was unable to get into the vehicle

384
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,480
because the wood got in the way.

385
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,320
Firemen had to saw through the metal

386
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,040
before he could be taken to the hospital.

387
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,160
The remainder of the nail was later removed,

388
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,860
and he was admitted to a hospital in Manchester.

389
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,340
The animal news of zoo suicides is just one of many,

390
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,360
but very poignant, I think.

391
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,520
Poignant.

392
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,100
Whatever. I'm from Texas.

393
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,120
A zebra couple tried to escape from Sarajevo Zoo in Yugoslavia,

394
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,820
but were foiled by keepers,

395
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,640
and the female broke her spine.

396
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,700
She later killed herself

397
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,820
by smashing her head against the ground.

398
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,120
A zebra, friends,

399
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,860
committed suicide by head smashing.

400
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,700
However, here's some revenge for you.

401
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,680
On 27 February, police in Nairobi, Kenya,

402
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,340
were hunting a hippopotamus

403
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,300
that charged out of a sewage tank

404
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,380
in which it had been wallowing

405
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,540
and attacked a man on a bicycle,

406
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,740
injuring his head, back, and thigh

407
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,760
before disappearing into a suburb.

408
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,540
And one last one here.

409
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,880
We'll come back to these in a minute.

410
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,220
You can hear these in the background now.

411
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,100
And see on the slide coming up.

412
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,060
Killer bees have been a steadily growing problem since 1956,

413
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,960
when a variety of African honey bee

414
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,360
was crossed with local European honey bees

415
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,800
at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil

416
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,200
in a mistaken effort to improve honey production.

417
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,700
They advanced at a rate of 300 miles a year

418
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,340
through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia.

419
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,360
Up to 500 people have been stung to death in Colombia.

420
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,820
They attacked a school,

421
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,820
killing one child and sending dozens to the hospital.

422
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,980
Farmers reported cattle stampeding in terror,

423
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,020
and the finding of horse carcasses

424
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,240
stung a million times and bloated beyond recognition.

425
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,860
Breeders hope to overwhelm the insects

426
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,120
with the genes of the tamer European bees.

427
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,440
Africanized queens will be trapped

428
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,740
and replaced with European queens.

429
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,940
New hive boxes will be, quote,

430
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,060
pre-queened, unquote, with European queen bees.

431
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,420
And Africanized swarms will be infiltrated

432
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,660
with European drones.

433
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,640
And you know, that last paragraph I just read

434
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,180
has got to break some sort of a record.

435
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,620
I honestly don't know what that record would be for,

436
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,440
but praise Bob.

437
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,040
Here we see the...

438
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,040
These are the cargo cultists, aren't they?

439
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,460
And this is Philo's key, which is a copy,

440
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,120
not the original.

441
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,760
They keep it in there.

442
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,240
Those...

443
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,120
Wash off before the Monday morning news comes in.

444
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,840
...give their...

445
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,640
God, look at this stuff. They're gonna reave.

446
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,460
See, it's...

447
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,620
It's the young virgin being brought into the house of the key.

448
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,860
They eat the heart, then they cook the virgin, and...

449
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,640
Not a pretty sight, but we shouldn't judge them

450
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,200
by our rules and regulations.

451
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,100
That's right. This is something they've been doing

452
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,980
for thousands and thousands of years,

453
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,860
one of the oldest tribes in Africa, and they...

454
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,640
You know from where you come from...

455
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,000
Was it in Africa, or where is it?

456
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,280
We don't want a constipated version of our thoughts

457
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,460
to be broadcast over...

458
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,580
Come on, please, don't. Yeah.

459
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,280
We need to demonstrate some restraint,

460
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,820
some modesty, as it were,

461
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,580
befitting our station as subgeniuses and as...

462
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,080
Yes, I'm proud to say it, Earthmen.

463
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,040
Earthmen.

464
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,720
And then the tribal song, I'm sure...

465
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,540
I like Earth, and I'll go send it to the...

466
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
...the male members...

467
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,140
And the nun here, who we have come in and...

468
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,200
Well, I bet you he's getting some.

469
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:16,920
Oh, yeah. Is this...

470
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,760
This isn't pledge time, is it?

471
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,300
No, we're using Glade.

472
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,020
Waxed beauty instantly, as you've done.

473
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,820
...on a number of levels,

474
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,200
back into other people on the show.

475
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,860
Well, one guy here...

476
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,920
Folks, you wouldn't believe it.

477
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,600
One guy here actually has toilet paper

478
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,780
wrapped around his head.

479
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,560
The natives did it to me.

480
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,000
It's unreal.

481
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I dare not take it off.

482
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,220
I can't believe it.

483
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,060
It was a mark of favor.

484
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,420
I mean, I'm from the Midwest,

485
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,740
and in the Midwest, things are really normal

486
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,920
compared to what they're like out here.

487
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,360
Maybe they're gonna take it off for us.

488
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,380
Maybe you don't do...

489
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,180
But when I got here this morning, it was like,

490
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,860
hey, you know, you have to do this show

491
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,580
in the middle of the night.

492
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,480
Oh, yeah, okay.

493
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,680
So we got here in the middle of the night,

494
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,700
and there's all these guys, these weird people here.

495
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,360
One of them has toilet paper wrapped around his head.

496
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,220
He looks kind of, uh...

497
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,920
kind of official.

498
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,220
I think he looks very stately.

499
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,600
Looks like a representative of Charmin or something.

500
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
Yes, it's really Charmin in my stateroom,

501
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,940
and I'd like to invite some of you stately babes in

502
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,780
to share it with me.

503
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,760
You get me?

504
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,580
Catch my drift?

505
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,680
I think that's what you're supposed to say.

506
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,160
Oh, well, I don't want to say that.

507
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,160


508
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,860
I don't want to, you know,

509
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,580
I don't want to telegraph my punch.

510
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,900
Yeah, but who can believe somebody that has...

511
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,540
Spinkies like this?

512
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,140
What could you...

513
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,020
How can you believe a guy that has toilet paper around his head?

514
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,740
Oh, friends, that is...

515
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,020
That is the KPFA weekly subgenius show

516
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,240
coming from Berkeley, California.

517
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,640
Not coming right now.

518
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,600
Came a long time ago, over and over again,

519
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,400
just like Bob,

520
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,220
and, uh...

521
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,420
with the special guest, Dr. Philo Drummond.

522
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,380
Your mission, should you decide to accept it,

523
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,220
is to destabilize this small forum...

524
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,860
I'd like to just grab a big ol' handful of applesauce

525
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,960
and rub it up my chest.

526
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,820
And that's the way they go, just on and on and on.

527
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,660
How about Smithfield ham and fish?

528
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,980
Can you imagine having to listen to that

529
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,000
for an hour and a half every Saturday morning at 4.30 a.m.?

530
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,940
Well, that's what happens to subgeniuses in Berkeley

531
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,820
who don't pay their pledges to K-N-O-N in Dallas, friends.

532
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,580
This is Ken Nordeen.

533
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,500
What did I say wrong?

534
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,960
Listen, I didn't mean it.

535
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,640
Look, you're working for me.

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,160
I didn't mean it.

537
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:27,940
Oh...

538
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,260
I know, but I'm not like one of those cartoons.

539
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,280
It's ridiculous.

540
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,900
Look, you're the secretary, I'm the boss.

541
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,920
I'm sorry I said what I said.

542
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,800
Listen, when you come into my office, I'd like to give you a letter.

543
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,520
Won't you please come in?

544
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,960
I mean, we can talk about it.

545
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,160
Listen, there's no sense to this.

546
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,600
I mean, I don't want to stand out here and talk about...

547
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,380
I'm sorry I said what I said.

548
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,600
I could tell right away that I'd done the wrong thing.

549
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,460
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.

550
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll go into the office, and then when you...

551
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,020
When you want to come in, you can come in and we'll...

552
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,240
We'll talk it over.

553
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,100
Okay?

554
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
Look, I said I was sorry.

555
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,280
Hmm...

556
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,920
Hmm...

557
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,780
Well, go ahead.

558
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,980
You made a mistake.

559
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,600
Well, yeah, erase it.

560
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,280
A mistake, too.

561
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,540
I shouldn't have said what I...

562
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,420
Said.

563
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm sorry.

564
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,580
Well...

565
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,460
If you want to come into the office, okay.

566
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,620
I'll talk with you.

567
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,660
If you don't, that's up to you.

568
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,420
I just say that I'm sorry.

569
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,840
Sure you wouldn't like to go down and have a drink and we could talk about it?

570
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,120
Just the two of us?

571
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,580
Maybe over a drink you'd feel better.

572
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,000
Look, I... I'm glad that you're working here for me, see?

573
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,900
I want you around.

574
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,840
Come on, let's go downstairs, huh?

575
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,660
Stop typing.

576
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,840
I mean, don't type anymore.

577
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,860
Come on, stop.

578
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,140
Okay, it's your funeral.

579
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,240
You'll be sorry.

580
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,720
You won't get a job like this again.

581
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,940
You'll see.

582
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,140
I got a few more letters for you to type.

583
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,720
I'll bring them out.

584
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,680
Okay.

585
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:03,940
Bye.

586
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,760
Bye.

587
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:05,880
Bye.

588
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,520
Bye.

589
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,260
Thanks.

590
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:10,280
Bye.

591
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,280


592
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:10,280


593
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,140
Bye.

594
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,160
Bye.

595
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,140
But I have a, um, a sort of, uh, uh, secret.

596
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,400
I, um, I've become a bubble gum fancier.

597
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,760
Joe rhetoric stillこんにちは

598
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,100
But what is a subgenius?

599
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,440
But what is a subgenius?

600
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,680
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans whose nonsensical laws and customs we have

601
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:34,880
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans whose nonsensical laws and customs we have

602
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,940
forced to obey?

603
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,640
bay, why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage?

604
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:49,940
Examine this seemingly docile crowd, and know that in some few, simmering beneath a placid

605
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:57,580
surface, there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness, ready at

606
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:02,960
any moment to explode outward, often with catastrophic results.

607
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,400
Look at the word subgenius.

608
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,020
It doesn't simply mean just below a genius.

609
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,640
The intelligence level of subgenius is not the same as the intelligence level of a genius.

610
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,680
But what is a subgenius?

611
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:24,780
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans, whose nonsensical laws and customs

612
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,420
we have been forced to obey?

613
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,020
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage?

614
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,940
Examine this seemingly docile crowd, and know that in some few, simmering beneath a placid

615
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:47,860
surface, there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness, ready at

616
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:53,200
any moment to explode outward, often with catastrophic results.

617
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,600
Look at the word subgenius.

618
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,160
It doesn't simply mean just below a genius.

619
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,920
The intelligence...

620
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:02,920


621
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:09,280
level of subgeniuses can range far, far below genius. It's not the so-called intelligence

622
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:15,180
that really matters after all, but how it is used. The subgenius does not pretend to

623
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:21,920
super knowledge, but to sub-knowledge, knowledge of the under things, the horror earth from

624
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:28,560
whose darkness issue the Nazi hell creatures and other demons of the abyss. It is in contemplation

625
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,280
of these under things, the underwear lurking just below the clothing of existence, that

626
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,340
the subgeni display what genius they have. The study of this substratum, the foundation

627
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,200
garment underlying reality, is the subgenius's strength, for it is from this source that

628
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,520
he or she taps the infinite resources of a force that is completely incomprehensible

629
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,740
to humans, the force of slack.

630
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:10,540
Somewhere, I say to you today, there's a handful, and I don't know why y'all worried

631
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,620
about Ronald Regan, or worried about the Democrats, or worried about the Republicans, and they

632
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:19,180
got you black folks, they really got y'all in a trick. These are the good guys, these

633
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,520
are the bad guys. Democrat liberals are the good guys, Republican conservatives are the

634
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,540
bad guys. Are you serious? Come on, let's be honest, there's some good Democrat liberals

635
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:33,280
there's some good Republicans conservatives, about three of them in the whole country,

636
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,980
and the rest of them ain't nothing but a bunch of mangy dogs. But they got y'all playing

637
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:44,060
this game when it don't make no difference which party is in, the same handful of manipulators

638
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:50,520
take their business. They're the ones that every game they play, they play it with you.

639
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,280
Y'all get your little whiskey, get your little snort, get your little reefer, get your little

640
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,540
uh... Are you serious? The same people that's fixing to kill you? You're not gonna get your

641
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,540


642
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,540


643
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:58,960
reefer, you're gonna get your reefer. The same people that's fixing to kill you, puts the

644
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,000
drugs out here for you. How many of y'all know that? Let me see your hands. Some of

645
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,080
y'all got your hands up and got a reefer in your pocket. And see when I leave, gonna

646
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:19,100
be lighting up, come on. That nigga can rap, kid. And they got your head so messed up,

647
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:25,320
everybody got their high and don't like nobody else's. Yeah, the whiskey drinkers have always

648
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,740
looked down on the winos.

649
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,420
Reefer smokers now got an attitude about whiskey drinkers. And all at once the cocaine

650
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,780
snorters think they're more sophisticated than the reefer smokers. And the coffee drinkers

651
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:48,560
hate them all. And yet there is more stomach cancer caused in America every day from drinking

652
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:54,200
coffee than lung cancer from smoking cigarettes. And after enough of us been riding it long

653
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,540
enough, Harvard University with their old tricky self had finally come to terms with

654
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:58,820
that.

655
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,160
I ain't gonna pour a

656
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:15,120
S nella, saluger quattro, skinny 모양i.

657
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:22,380
But I am Chic Bus counter Pharisee.

658
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,640
Now look ahead on and ok here's a clip I think we're about to hear.

659
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,940
Tina MacMahon Corona Cells.

660
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,400
Gina Prince So.

661
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,060
That's kind of sad.

662
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,280
Because they've manipulated us to the extent that these educational institutions ain't nothing but tricks.

663
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,720
And if they was what they're supposed to be, y'all wouldn't be doing half the negative stuff y'all be going down on these campuses.

664
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,280
Something wrong.

665
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,780
The same murdering pimps that manipulates the world, these is the ones that put these educational systems together.

666
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,960
And they didn't put them together to educate you, but to manipulate your mind.

667
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:08,560
And all of them were put together to do one thing, to teach you how to make a living so you would never understand how to live.

668
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,960
That's what it's all about.

669
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,740
And most of y'all in colleges across this country, you can't do nothing to change it because most of y'all go to college under false pretense.

670
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,220
Half of y'all go to college because your mother and father went to college.

671
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,600
The other half go because they didn't go.

672
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,680
I got two children in college and I give them two instructions.

673
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,480
Don't go to college, go to God.

674
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:44,120
That means spend as much time dealing with that God force as you do dealing with that trigonometry and all that other old game they be running down.

675
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,240
Because ain't nobody game, you serious?

676
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,660
And the sad part about it is most of y'all don't even know it's a game.

677
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,360
The hell y'all sitting reading Shakespeare.

678
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,940
Your Shakespeare wouldn't read that mess if he was back here now.

679
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,100
You serious?

680
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:55,420
You serious?

681
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:05,560
They got y'all's heads so white, y'all will walk across this campus and won't even speak to one another trying to go to some class to read some old Shakespearean mess.

682
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,260
Pass a damn human bean to go read some dad stuff.

683
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,520
And you niggas do it.

684
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,340
You niggas got attitude.

685
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,900
This nigga don't like this nigga.

686
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,080
This group don't like y'all.

687
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,480
Crazy.

688
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,080
That whole game.

689
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,180
Somewhere.

690
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,460
Somewhere.

691
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:24,840
Somewhere.

692
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:24,860
Somewhere.

693
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,560
That whole thing.

694
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:34,420
You got to understand that the true education facilities is in the top of your head.

695
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,040
Not in no college or university.

696
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,200
Controlled by the same force that controls the university.

697
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:46,440
And that true education facility in the top of your head will never open up until it's around an oasis of love.

698
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,940
Most of these colleges and universities are nothing but cesspools of hatred.

699
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,560
That whole game.

700
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,380
That whole game.

701
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,820
So much.

702
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:54,820


703
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:54,940
So much.

704
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,720
No Stupidity.

705
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,380
That whole thing.

706
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,660
We're a crazy living valued yet.

707
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,240
I said no stupidity and that rumor doesn't work.

708
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,400
And that rumor doesn't work for any damn Deepak love their mouths.

709
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,800
There

710
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,800
You think it just happened to happen in the same country where the government had to admit that they injected...

711
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
Oh, yes, friends, that's Dick Gregory.

712
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,300
Dick Gregory.

713
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,820
I'm going to cut that one off because I think I played the rest of that sequence not too long ago on another show.

714
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,540
Man, what a ranter.

715
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,020
What a ranter.

716
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,860
A fine, fine subgenius, I'd say.

717
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,780
And this little song from Byron Werner sort of caps it off.

718
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,600
The industrial symphony you are hearing emanates from the turbines and dynamos of the greatest toy factory in the world,

719
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,700
B.G. Bigelow, Inc. Incorporated.

720
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,500
Let us open the window of the puppet department and listen.

721
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,540
The world is full of a number of things and one of them is people.

722
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,800
But people is the escape that people escape from most.

723
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,620
They take to gin and to histamine, to aspirin, Picasso and Tel Aviv.

724
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,760
And some take consolidated gas.

725
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,780
Or the Saturday evening post.

726
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,580
We pity you, we do, for all the ills that ail you.

727
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,860
But here's good news for you, you needn't be a failure.

728
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,480
A failure.

729
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,780
Tiddly I, tiddly A, tiddly all your trouble away.

730
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,540
You, too, can be a puppet.

731
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,080
You, too.

732
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,420
Be a puppet.

733
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,780
Man, man, silly man, fool of human folly.

734
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,680
Why be a brave old fan, Ku Klux Klan, when you can be Ku Klux Klan and Ollie?

735
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,100
Tiddly I, tiddly D, you can be just as happy as we.

736
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,380
Be a puppet, not an old friend.

737
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,080
Come out of the woodwork, brother.

738
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,880
And join the brotherhood of man.

739
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,660
The brotherhood.

740
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,660
The brotherhood of man.

741
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:33,220
The conspiracy media, unable to ignore the church, has attempted to discredit it as a mere joke, a pathetic satire.

742
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,280
The reason?

743
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,600
Slack is simply beyond their emotional grasp.

744
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,680
Slack.

745
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,340
What is it?

746
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,860
Well, if you have to ask, you'll probably never know.

747
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,100
You were born with original slack, an infinite supply of it.

748
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,180
But the conspiracy has most of it now.

749
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,200
They don't even know what it is, but that hasn't stopped them from stealing it away.

750
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,660
How do you think you ended up a slave to their so-called work?

751
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,340
True slack is, by definition, indefinable.

752
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,420
It is a kind of direct perception, unfettered by common sense.

753
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,000
It is not merely laziness.

754
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,720
It is rather a kind of active sloth.

755
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,760
Slack in its purified form is a kind of pure slack.

756
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:20,760


757
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,980
Its pure form makes happiness seem like agony by comparison.

758
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:30,600
Next to slack, the nirvana known to mystics and saints is like endless torment.

759
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,900
Slack is different for each person.

760
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,380
Although, for much of the world, slack is nothing more than a good meal.

761
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,400
One might call it something for nothing.

762
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:50,760
But the normals, the mediocritans, the somnambulax and pseudo-sub-slacks,

763
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:50,760


764
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,620
have tried to make it something which we've been led to believe we must work to buy.

765
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,720
It is this yearning for slackness that separates us from them.

766
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,720
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness,

767
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,580
his hours consumed by meaningless toil, interspersed with meaningless leisure.

768
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,440
Yet he never feels cheated. He thinks it's natural.

769
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,240
Perhaps we should pity them.

770
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,300
But face it, most people are venal jerks.

771
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,140
Half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse.

772
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,420
And stampeding you along with them.

773
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,780
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocritans, these pink boys,

774
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,160
these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens?

775
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,520
These normals who have made normality the norm?

776
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Pinks. Pinks are but living stereotypes.

777
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,220
Insensate meat puppets and mere food tubes who lack and fear

778
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,760
the spark of originality that ignites every so genius soul.

779
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,580
But the long senseless march into slacklessness may soon come to an end.

780
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,060
Although it won't be without a bitter struggle, but at least there is hope.

781
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,540
For in this, the 20th century, we have seen the coming of a savior.

782
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,520
A beacon of slack.

783
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,960
A banner behind which we may unite.

784
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:29,060
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his mighty Church of the Subgenius.

785
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,680
Are we then to understand that when Bob says we must learn to pull the wool over our own eyes,

786
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,580
that he is merely abetting an insidious form of self-delusion?

787
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,880
Is he saying that we shouldn't even look for the truth?

788
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,420
Is Bob saying, like Heisenberg,

789
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,960
that we can never know what the hell is really going on?

790
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,600
I think not.

791
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,300
Bob, however, is cognizant of the fact that besides the shabby little lies

792
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,300
we feed ourselves from day to day as we struggle to cope with technoboredom,

793
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:09,160
we're all being force-fed a gross pablum of aftruths, sensationalized statistics

794
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:16,540
and downright propaganda by a vast monolithic network operated by and for the conspiracy.

795
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,460
Through such deception, the conspiracy is daily cheating us all out of our life essence,

796
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,340
our money, our health, and most important of all, our slack.

797
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,640
That's right, our slack.

798
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,840
They draw it off like vampires in the night.

799
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,600
They are pulling the wool over our eyes. Constantly.

800
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,000
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons,

801
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,620
let us do it to ourselves for our own reasons.

802
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,260
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

803
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,520
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.

804
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,280
Some ways are fun.

805
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,500
For many of us there is no physical escape from their clutches

806
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:04,120
or any hope of it until the exorcists come and the followers of Yahweh One prevail.

807
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,200
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

808
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,080
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

809
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,980
This allows us to control our own reality.

810
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,500
Gives us the clarity of perspective to be able to sit back and look at it all,

811
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,040
and I mean all, and simply say if they can't take a joke.

812
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:32,340
Then and only then will slack begin to drop gently like a soothing dew into our tortured lives.

813
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,040
After all, it should be every person's choice to curse God and die if that was what they wish.

814
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,260
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods, did we not create them?

815
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,540
Where indeed would Yahweh One be without the human race to torment and pester?

816
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,080
I'll put it to you, the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

817
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,580
if there was nothing more entertaining than cherubims and seraphims and numby-pumby flaming angels

818
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,480
sitting around up there on damp clouds and arping and trumpeting all 24 hours a bloody day,

819
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,620
and you can bank on that.

820
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,020
Why should we be any different to that?

821
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,460
Why shouldn't our lives be more entertaining and more real

822
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,680
than any glowing three-color phosphor image on the television screen?

823
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,500
Why shouldn't we grab reality by the throat and shake it until it does work?

824
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,000
Until it turns what we want it to, until once again we find slack?

825
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:27,140
Just as the primitive fire-walkers of Ceylon can deny a reality in which fire burns

826
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,340
and thus pass unscathed across white-hot stones,

827
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,760
so can the subgenius deny the existence of a world without slack

828
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,580
and cast out the false prophets and the pink boys.

829
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,160
All it requires is faith, faith in Bob and faith in ourselves.

830
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,240
Are we not the dreamers of the dream?

831
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,460
and is all that is within that dream not ourselves?

832
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,460
Life is no more than a brief illusion,

833
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,000
a flickering real-time movie in the theater of our minds.

834
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,820
And if you don't like the way your movie is going,

835
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,240
perhaps you better ask yourself why not.

836
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,620
After all, it is your movie.

837
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,420
And despite what anyone else may have told you,

838
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,540
you are the director as well as the protagonist.

839
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,440
Aff.

840
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,920
Oh, yes, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon trying to get in cuss words on me.

841
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,100
That's why you hear me fade things out every now and then.

842
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,900
You know, it's a sad but true thang

843
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:30,360
about the rules and regulations regarding profanity here in this country.

844
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,500
You know what I mean, but I'll tell you, man.

845
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,480
I'll tell you what.

846
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,900
Tonight, you pukes are gonna sleep

847
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,700
with your bobheads.

848
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:41,980
And posters.

849
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,260
Because this is the only religion you people are going to get.

850
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,200
Your days of Hail Marian,

851
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,000
old sister Jane Rotten crotch through her purdy black nun's habit

852
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,920
are over.

853
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,000
You're married to this dob's head,

854
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,600
this weapon of paper and ink,

855
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,500
and you will be faithful.

856
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,240
Prepare to mount your bunk, mate.

857
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:04,900
Mount!

858
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:06,640
Pray!

859
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,420
This is my church.

860
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,180
There are many,

861
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:11,980
many more like it,

862
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,780
but this one is mine.

863
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,400
My church is my best friend.

864
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,620
It is my life.

865
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:25,600
I will master it as I master my sacred abnormality.

866
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,140
Without me, my church is useless.

867
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,660
Without my church, I am useless.

868
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,600
I must keep my slack true.

869
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:39,300
I must get more slack than my enemy,

870
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,420
who is trying to knock me out.

871
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,580
I must normalize me.

872
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,600
I must convert him before he converts me.

873
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,080
I will.

874
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,340
Before Bob, I swear this creed.

875
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:58,620
My church and myself are defenders of this country.

876
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,120
We are the masters of our enemy.

877
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,200
We are the saviors of Earth.

878
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,040
So be it until there is no conspiracy,

879
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,100
but slack or death.

880
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,320
Amen!

881
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,800
Swinging love corpses in the background.

882
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,520
Yes, millions of men and women are in the same lamentable plight today.

883
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,160
And not one in ten can guess the cause.

884
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,400
That's the insidious thing about amnesia.

885
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,680
It drags you down, slows your mind,

886
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,980
and robs you of your joys and pleasures.

887
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,480
Yet you hardly realize that you're slipping.

888
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,920
You're right, Roy.

889
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:06,820
Isn't that true?

890
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,020
The eye of light is looking right through you.

891
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,660
God bless you.

892
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,020
You know, the folks at French Lick Springs Hotel in French Lick, Indiana,

893
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:19,360
that's America's greatest health retort.

894
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,800
The home of Pluto water.

895
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,840
If you can call that a home, Ray, the light's shining. Go.

896
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,220
That's true. That's true. That's true.

897
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,740
You know, we have two excellent golf courses down there.

898
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,580
Three?

899
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,060
Splendid. No, only two.

900
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,800
Ah, but the eye of light sees three, Ray.

901
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,220
It sees three wonderful, wonderful golf courses.

902
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,760
I see. I see.

903
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,500
Go ahead. Go ahead.

904
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,200
The power's coming up through the table.

905
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,040
Splendid, splendid riding facilities.

906
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,400
You're a weird pastor.

907
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,460
Ride. Ride on. I'm on you.

908
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,580
I'm with you. Ride.

909
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,020
And lots of outdoor amusements are provided.

910
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,760
Yes, but God's looking down on everything you do outdoors, friend.

911
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,160
God's got his eye on your eye, so watch out and keep going, Charlie.

912
00:50:59,280 --> 00:50:59,880
Carry an umbrella.

913
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,280
Decide right now to turn the tables on old man gloom, huh?

914
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,300
Turn them upside down.

915
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,940
Take Pluto water every morning for ten mornings.

916
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,900
And see a new world.

917
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,560
In ten days.

918
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,840
See two new worlds, dear friend.

919
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,600
Two new worlds.

920
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,480
You're gonna need to.

921
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,800
Down, Pluto. Down.

922
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,200
Larry?

923
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,120
Well, by golly, God said...

924
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,240
Look, Pluto's making more water.

925
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:18,480
Huh?

926
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,480
That's okay, St. John.

927
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,260
And God said...

928
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,640
This is when I was with God in Miami.

929
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:33,380
He said, uh, Harry, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it.

930
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,420
Do you know what subdue means?

931
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,060
Ah.

932
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,920
Is it like sublet?

933
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,940
Hey, Harry, is that guy down there asking you questions again?

934
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,500
No, dear friends, janitors of all the lonely houses in the world.

935
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,900
I know you've had your bad times.

936
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,320
And I know you've had your good times.

937
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,580
Doing things you didn't understand.

938
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
God bless you, Pastor.

939
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,800
But things are changing, friends.

940
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,280
The eye of God is looking down upon you right now.

941
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,420
Who asked you, Pastor?

942
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,920
Look him back in the eye, dear friends.

943
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,880
I can't see.

944
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,300
Either can God, dear friends, because love and radio is blind.

945
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,160
Don't blink.

946
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,380
Don't blink, dear friends.

947
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,120
My radio's on the blink.

948
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,120
My radio's on the blink, dear friends.

949
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,360
God, I love your eyes, Father.

950
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:24,500
Eye, just one eye, the eye of love, spelled I, the letter I, without the letter...

951
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,040
What could we do, dear friends?

952
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:34,900
And remember, friends, it's been brought to you today by Snifters Humorous Napkins, and

953
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:34,900


954
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:34,900


955
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:34,900


956
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:34,900


957
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,220
thanks to those who drive us to the語 Ábreas

958
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,080
if we can yours.

959
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,560
Oh, yes dear friends.

960
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,900
ツ

961
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,300
Blow up women and extra parts.

962
00:52:48,460 --> 00:53:03,840
Oh, yes, dear friends.

963
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:11,380
Well, well, what used to be the dancing cigarettes wails away horribly in the background.

964
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,800
I was hoping to get in more of this hideous news here from the 14 Times.

965
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:27,220
I should mention that a 900-pound sturgeon, 11 feet long, was found dead in Lake Washington, Seattle on 5th of November, 1987.

966
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,800
The monstrous fish was believed to be over 80 years old and may have died of old age.

967
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,740
On the other hand, Orit Kikashvili, a 26-year-old Israeli woman, gave birth to a boy five months

968
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,360
after she was born.

969
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,460
She was declared clinically dead.

970
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:51,540
These are all true stories, friends, brought to you from 14 Times by way of the Church of the Subgenius.

971
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,800
Let's see.

972
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,980
Good, good.

973
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,260
Oh, here's a good one.

974
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:02,680
In October 87, Moscow Radio reported that a fisherman's dog disappeared while swimming

975
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,760
across the Pechora River in northern Siberia.

976
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:11,040
Moments later, the fisherman cast his net and hauled in a massive pike, five feet long,

977
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,720
with a tail sticking out of its jaws.

978
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,320
He cut it open and his dog struggled out, barking, and apparently none the worse for its experience.

979
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:27,880
This angler in Suffolk tossed a message in a bottle into the North Sea, and it ended up

980
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,920
in a shark's stomach at a street market in Rwanda in Central Africa, according to the

981
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,140
letter which he received.

982
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,220
So, you know those letters in the bottle, they do get around.

983
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,360
If you're that frustrated, you can always do this.

984
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,580
You can do that, or you can write to the Church of the Subgenius at, and you need to get

985
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,160
a pencil ready.

986
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,540
I know most of you do out there.

987
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,860
Get a pencil ready.

988
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,000
I'll read you one more little story here.

989
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,340
This one sounds like faux floor to me.

990
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,260
A biology student out fishing with three friends off the coast of Mexico caught a shark.

991
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:11,160
Cutting it open, he discovered his own stolen gold Rolex wristwatch on a man's severed arm.

992
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,760
Police took fingerprints in a bid to identify the thief.

993
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,840
Yes, friends, it's a world without slack out there.

994
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't know what's so funny about that, actually.

995
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,940
I'd be horrified.

996
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,800
And, yes, you can write for free information on the Church of the Subgenius from Bob at

997
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,140
P.O.

998
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:37,240
Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

999
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,460
Once again, that's Box 140306.

1000
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:46,140
Box in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1001
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,640
Just address that letter to Bob.

1002
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,760
It won't get to him, but Willa Dobbs or me will have to deal with it.

1003
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,380
Who cares?

1004
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,100
Is there a typical subgenius?

1005
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,500
Of course not.

1006
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,360
The very thought is blasphemy.

1007
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,920
The only thing that most subgeniuses have in common is that they're all different, and

1008
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,380
they have nothing in common with the conspiracy, the pink meat masses which grope and clutch

1009
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,080
around us.

1010
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,340
The Church is, shall we say, a disorderly.

1011
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,180
It's an unorganized religion which theoretically should not exist simply because it's composed

1012
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,980
of people who are not joiners.

1013
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,920
Eccentrics, unpredictables, true visionaries.

1014
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,260
They share only the quest for slack and the love of their spiritual teacher, the living

1015
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,580
avatar of slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1016
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,180
But just who is this man, Bob?

1017
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,220
Some call him the slack master, the high epon, the saint.

1018
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:41,340
The saint.

1019
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,000
The saint of sales.

1020
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:48,880
Others call him liar, pimp, whoremonger, a sleazy con man foisting his dangerous scam

1021
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,740
off on gullible suckers.

1022
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:58,760
Well, dear friend, J.R. Bob Dobbs isn't some outmoded, overused deity from ancient fairy

1023
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,760
tales, but a living, bleeding deity for today.

1024
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,440
The finely appointed messenger of slack.

1025
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,780
Thank you, Bob.

1026
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,340
This is Conrad.

1027
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,260
K-N-O-N 89.3 FM, Dallas.

1028
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,400
I'm Robert Wisdom.

1029
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:16,620
This is American Music Party.

1030
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:27,120
Tonight, uh, we'll be playing, uh, Gospel Connection number five.

1031
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,460
Start off with Albert King, Angel of Mercy.

1032
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,280
I went to work this morning.

1033
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,020
My foreman looked me in the eye.

1034
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:01,240
He said, fella, I don't know what's wrong with you, but you look sick enough to die.

1035
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:08,800
He sent me to the company doctor, and he examined me from head to toe.

1036
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,340
What's wrong with you?

1037
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:11,340


1038
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,860
Whatever's wrong with you, young man?

1039
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,460
My x-ray just won't show.

1040
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:26,240
I said, Angel of Mercy, won't you please look down on me?

1041
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,420
Angel of Mercy.

1042
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,120
A little mercy's all I need.

1043
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:41,320
Angel of Mercy.

1044
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,320


1045
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:41,320


1046
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,300
Angel of Mercy.

1047
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,380
Angel of Mercy.

1048
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:46,900
Angel of Mercy.

1049
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,260
The finance company.

1050
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,200
They just come to cheat my check.

1051
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,940
They said they want a payment by Friday.

1052
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,040
Or they want all of the furniture back.

1053
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,480
I went to the credit union.

1054
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,520
To try to get myself along.

1055
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,300
They said I wouldn't.

1056
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,680
They would let you have it, young man.

1057
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,720
But we guess that you won't be workin' here much longer.

1058
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:19,240
Angel of Mercy.

1059
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,980
Would you please look down on me?

1060
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,480
Oh, Angel of Mercy.

1061
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,760
A little mercy's all I need.

1062
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,400
Oh, yeah, right

1063
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,400
Oh, yeah

1064
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,920
Oh

1065
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,480
Oh

1066
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,040
Oh

1067
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,220
Oh

1068
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,920
Oh

1069
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,180
Oh

1070
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,960
Oh

1071
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,260
Oh

1072
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:17,460
Oh

1073
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,060
Oh

1074
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,560
Oh

1075
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:20,560


1076
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,360
Okay

1077
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,120
Okay

1078
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:22,740
Okay

1079
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,680
Okay

1080
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,860
Cut my lights off this morning

1081
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,160
To set my furniture outdoors

1082
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,780
I was listening to the weatherman a while ago

1083
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,600
And he said it's gonna rain and snow

1084
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,160
My daughter got pneumonia

1085
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,260
And my son is down with the flu

1086
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,420
My whole family's suffering from malnutrition

1087
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,060
And I can't even hold them through

1088
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,300
I said, angel of mercy

1089
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,100
Won't you please look down on me

1090
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,460
Oh, angel of mercy

1091
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,700
A little mercy

1092
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,240
Oh, angel of mercy

1093
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,620
This is all I need

1094
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,080
Those steps that lead

1095
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,900
To any church

1096
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,540
Form a stairway

1097
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,840
To a star

1098
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,700
They're part of God

1099
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,620
And should be tried

1100
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,480
More often

1101
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:07,220
Than they are

1102
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,680
I'll be leaving
