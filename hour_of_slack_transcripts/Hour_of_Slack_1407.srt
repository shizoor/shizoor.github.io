1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,600
No wonder millions and millions of ladies say, I love body temperature.

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,220
Morning, ladies.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,840
Good morning. Who are you?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,640
I'm usually called Old Tyler.

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,220
That's my husband's name.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm sorry, but illegal possession of uranium is the one charge we can't hang on you.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,760
I suppose you haven't seen Son of Kong lately, the touching monkey band scene.

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,940
A new Son of Kong?

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,280
No, the old movie.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,800
The one where Carl Denham goes back to Skull Island.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,160
I saw that probably the week it came out, I remember.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,060
In 1933?

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,660
Oh my God, no.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,820
Come on, Mr. Michael Pepe.

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,040
That's a little bit much even for me to believe in.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,320
What was the one in the 50s, the Son of Kong?

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,680
There was no Son of Kong in the 50s.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,480
Well, they showed it in 1960.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:08,180
Okay, now there was the De Laurentiis King Kong had a sequel that had a wife of Kong.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,260
That's right, they brought in Mrs. Kong.

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,540
Yeah, Mrs. What was the name of that?

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,920
Boy, did they degrade the whole brand with that.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,360
That is called King Kong Escapes.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,720
But I'm talking about when Carl Denham was bankrupted because of...

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,580
Blue Jeans.

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,740
...of bringing King Kong to America, he had to escape hidden with his head under a blanket in a junk truck.

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,300
But Captain Englehorn took him on board and they cruised the South Seas.

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,580
Yes.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,040
And one night on a South Sea island of some kind.

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,860
Well, let me set the setting for you.

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,760
The palm trees were swaying.

32
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,020
You know that's the wrong music, right?

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,300
Okay, just checking.

34
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,160
Actually, it was in some place like Sang Karang or...

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,620
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,480
Or Rack-A-Jack or something like that.

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,040
Indonesian.

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, it was in Indonesian.

39
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,860
Let's get some peanut.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,260
Some peanut.

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,720
Well, they come to this...

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,500
Well, no, let's go back.

43
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,480
I mean, what happens in the movie?

44
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,320
What happens is there's nothing to do in this tiny town.

45
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:16,980
And so Englehorn and Denham stroll into this ridiculously small circus where trained monkeys are trying to play these instruments.

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,960
And, you know, these stolid, betel nut-chewing islanders are watching it with no flicker of emotion.

47
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,380
And they're like, oh, my God.

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,700
And the scene goes on and on.

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,300
It's amazing.

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,920
You see all the monkeys playing their various instruments.

51
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,580
Wow, I would love to see.

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,500
I have to look at that.

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,280
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,880
I'm just glad K-Rob never didn't hear you say that.

55
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,140
And then a horrible fire destroys the entire establishment.

56
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,520
So, you know, that...

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,840
An exciting, fast-moving tracking shot.

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,240
Well, how did they end up on Skull Island after that boring beginning?

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,480
How did they get the fuck Skull Island?

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,320
They have met the guy who gave them the map in the first place.

61
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,600
Oh.

62
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:53,940
Oh.

63
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh.

64
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,140
Oh.

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,360
Oh.

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,480
Oh.

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,700
Oh.

68
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


69
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


70
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


71
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


72
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


73
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


74
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:54,700


75
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,400
Oh.

76
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,440
Oh.

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,320
Oh.

78
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:06,820
Oh.

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:07,840


80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:07,920


81
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


82
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


83
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


84
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


86
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


87
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


88
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


89
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


90
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


91
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


93
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


94
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


95
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,360


96
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,180
And they throw the capitalist bosses, that is to say, Englehorn and Denham, overboard

97
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,500
at Skull Island.

98
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,040
And they run into giant mammals there, don't they?

99
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,420
It's not just dinosaurs.

100
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,840
A giant cave bear.

101
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,380
Yes.

102
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,760
Mammoths?

103
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,520
Perhaps?

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,120
Sabertooth?

105
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,060
No, they run into a cave bear and a nothosaurus and a styracosaurus.

106
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,460
And they're saved by the baby Kong, who's kind of an albino, pig-legged Kong.

107
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,320
Yes, he makes all sorts of terrible gestures which ruin the entire movie.

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,700
He spoils the film with his goofy gestures, which they insisted on putting in to make him lovable.

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,540
Shrugging and mugging and winking and so on.

110
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,880
It's funny how you can kill a whole zoner in one.

111
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,740
Poor old Kong.

112
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,820
Not a patch on his old man.

113
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,980
And the people are tiny up in the top.

114
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,260
They discover that there is a treasure on the island after all, which is something that Nils HelmstrÃ¶m just made up.

115
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,540
And they get it.

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,700
And they get it by lifting it off the penis and testicles of an enormous statue, which they discover in a cave.

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,700
Of Bob?

118
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,000
It's not of Bob, but it's of a strange, evil-looking idol.

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,060
No, no, of Bob.

120
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,180
But as soon as they pull this off what has to be...

121
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,160
I mean, look at it.

122
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Oh, oh, no.

123
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,860
Oh, my God, look at it.

124
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,480
Good heavens.

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
I can't believe you're showing it right here to our audience.

126
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,320
I can't believe it either because I've been silenced by a technical...

127
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,400
It's a penis attached to a...

128
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,120
Problem.

129
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,180
A glob of pulsating...

130
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,020
Are we going out?

131
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,480
Yes.

132
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,880
Yeah, Hal, everything is going fine.

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
Mass fat cells...

134
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,440
Not for me.

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
Just your headphones are here on the problem.

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,400
My headphones?

137
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,920
There we go.

138
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,920
Work on that headphone.

139
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,020
Hey, zip up your pants.

140
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,860
Hey, what are you doing?

141
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,300
Oh, my God, that's not your headphone.

142
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,880
Press those pants.

143
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,740
Give me 20.

144
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, and at the end...

145
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,880
I can't hear you.

146
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:11,720
Just in the last 80 minutes or 60 minutes of the movie, Skull Island finally has its convulsive earthquake

147
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:19,180
that causes it to sink beneath the waves forever with Baby Kong standing at the very tip top of the island...

148
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,400
To rescue Denim.

149
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,040
...holding Denim.

150
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,540
...holding Denim.

151
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:21,620
Definitely.

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,180
It's exploited.

153
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,560
Denim?

154
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,940
Well, then what happens to Baby Kong?

155
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,200
Yes, that was...

156
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,340
It's all product...

157
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,060
Wait, he's wearing Levi's?

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,800
What happens to Baby Kong at the end?

159
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,000
He drowns and dies.

160
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,540
He really?

161
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,300
And he doesn't float.

162
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,080
Wow.

163
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,800
He drowns and dies and he doesn't float.

164
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,160
He's holding up Carl Denim, but the island...

165
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,700
I never saw that.

166
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,560
...the ocean closes over his head.

167
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
He's a Jesus Kong.

168
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,500
Yeah.

169
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,720
He dies for the exploitative capitalist Carl Denim.

170
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,220
Wow.

171
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,900
And there's no more Kongs.

172
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,360
No more...

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,580
Or Megaphymatus Kong.

174
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,600
They did save the treasure that took off the island.

175
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,360
Species name.

176
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,420
But the moment they took it off, the entire island sunk beneath the ocean.

177
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,420
But they recovered with Mighty Joe Young, right?

178
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,300
I mean...

179
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,960
Mighty Joe Young was only...

180
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,140
That's a different creature entire.

181
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,560
That's just a big gorilla.

182
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,760
A really big gorilla.

183
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,680
That's how back when you were growing up...

184
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,740
But the way it was presented to me in the 60s, there were three movies.

185
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,680
On late night television.

186
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,120
King Kong.

187
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,480
No, on the matinee in the theater.

188
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,340
King Kong, Son of Kong, Mighty Joe Young.

189
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,900
The three main stop motion tapes.

190
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,580
And they had gone...

191
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,180
With Jiggly...

192
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,700
Godzilla.

193
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,120
And they all were presented as if...

194
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,000
Jiggly hair movies.

195
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
They just came out.

196
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,080
As if they were new movies that had just come out.

197
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,740
They are eternally new movies.

198
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
The Darth Vader theme, so you can get a beer.

199
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:32,860
Right?

200
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,800
Well, they...

201
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,620
They're...

202
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,400
Like Mighty Joe Young, you're saying it's from the 30s.

203
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,500
It is not.

204
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,500
Mighty Joe Young comes from the 40s, from 1946.

205
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,560
40s, okay then.

206
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,880
Well...

207
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,700
That was Ray Harryhausen's first professional monster movie job.

208
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,520
So they made money from him.

209
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,160
He's showing that movie for 40 years.

210
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,160


211
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,160


212
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,340
40 years.

213
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,220
Mighty Joe Young has some astounding stop motion.

214
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,120
And kids never ever stop.

215
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,400
Especially the version I have.

216
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,560
It's really, really amazing.

217
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,260
Yeah.

218
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,080
It's...

219
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,300
It's never been equal.

220
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,520
Like Frankenstein or what I am.

221
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
I saw...

222
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,320
I happened to see the remake of Mighty Joe Young recently with...

223
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,100
What's his name?

224
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,020
That Texas boy.

225
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh.

226
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,380
Bill...

227
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,280
George Bush.

228
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,340
With the three names.

229
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,720
Yeah.

230
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:13,740


231
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,080
I saw him.

232
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,860
And...

233
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,500
No, Tommy Lee.

234
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,400
Monster with the girl.

235
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,120
What year is that?

236
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,200
You don't have the...

237
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,780
No...

238
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,500
I don't think I even heard of it.

239
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Tommy Lee's so much better.

240
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,500
Late 90s, I think.

241
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,040
It's a guy in a suit, but it's the best guy in a suit.

242
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,640
Wait a minute.

243
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,000
It's Rick Baker and his absolute best.

244
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,300
It's a CG gorilla all the way.

245
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,740
No, in Mighty Joe Young?

246
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,820
In the one that they recently made?

247
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,260
It's computer generated.

248
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:41,860
No.

249
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:42,740
No.

250
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,180
Really?

251
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,780
It's the best guy in a suit.

252
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,580
You're sure Rick said...

253
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,120
Well, no.

254
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,180
Rick Baker did the design and someone else was wearing the suit.

255
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,980
They probably...

256
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,100
It's a computer generator.

257
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,100


258
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,100


259
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,100


260
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,100


261
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,900
I think he had a suit for some shots, I guess, but for the most part...

262
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,860
Mr. CG, I wasn't that far along then.

263
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,240
They didn't do hair like that.

264
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,200
They were beating the drum about it and tooting their horn about how this movie represented

265
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,640
a giant advance.

266
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,620
It may have been a giant advance in compositing.

267
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,360
What is that?

268
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,480
Which is half the short...

269
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,980
The man who designed Yoda just died recently and he got the job because of the hair on

270
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,020
the monkeys in 2001.

271
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,900
Oh.

272
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,720
That was apparently a...

273
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,520
Those aren't monkeys.

274
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,000
Nice.

275
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,440
They're apes.

276
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,260
Oh, you mean...

277
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,300
And then Lucas said that he thought he didn't get the special effects Oscar for it because

278
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:32,080
he thought they were so dumb that the people who judge were so dumb that they thought they

279
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,020
were probably real monkeys because they look so good.

280
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,500
I didn't think they looked like real monkeys, but the hair was amazing.

281
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,120
It was some combination of human hair and horse hair and some other kind of hair.

282
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,480
I thought they looked humanoid.

283
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,380
They were fine.

284
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,020
They were rather humanoid.

285
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,700
Pithecanthropoe.

286
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,160
They were great.

287
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,120
That whole thing was mesmerizing.

288
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,220
Pithecanthropoe.

289
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,300
Pithecanthropoe.

290
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,740
Pithecanthropoe.

291
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,020
Pithecanthropoe?

292
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,020


293
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,360
Or...

294
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,880
They later evolved into both homo sapiens, homo subgenius, homo excelsior...

295
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,460
I see.

296
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,860
...and the Kongs, which is mega primatus kongs.

297
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,760
What about gigantopithecus?

298
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
Of course.

299
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,420
Gigantopithecus.

300
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,140
And what...

301
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,360
I try to not to draw attention to those because...

302
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,160
What is it?

303
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,080
...I don't want people to catch him and hunt him and...

304
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,180
Primal anthropithecus?

305
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,040
Bigfoot should always remain right on the edge of fish.

306
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,720
That's why whenever you listen to subgenius, you'll always hear something about the

307
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,720


308
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,720


309
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,720


310
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
radio, they always talk about how

311
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,180
go to New York to find that creature.

312
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,880
Or the center of town.

313
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,720
I don't know if there's an urban yeti.

314
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,940
Hiding in plain sight, you mean.

315
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, kind of.

316
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,320
That one Kardashian sister.

317
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,700
It's misdirection.

318
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,160
There's no question.

319
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,920
I think the creatures across the street are punas.

320
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,400
There's no question Gigantopithecus

321
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
actually existed at one time.

322
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,800
The only reason to ask is

323
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,960
are they really extinct or are they

324
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,320
in fact the elusive yeti?

325
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,300
Smart enough to hide

326
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,660
and make it

327
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,680
a game that he always wins.

328
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,200
If I may point out,

329
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,700
what Reb Stang...

330
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,980
I guess that's the music.

331
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,760
That's as far as we paid for the music.

332
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,800
It's right to that part in the score.

333
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,440
What Reb Stang was saying earlier,

334
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,100
the condition you were describing

335
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,620
earlier I think is called

336
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,820
a stetopithecus.

337
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,860
Which condition?

338
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,720
The condition of the buttocks

339
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,420
becoming unusually

340
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,220
swelling and bloated

341
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,360
and becoming

342
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,160
unusually distended

343
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,940
like the hot and taut Venus.

344
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,480
Exactly.

345
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,380
It's called stetopithecus.

346
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,940
And the buttocks come out

347
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,320
often in a shelf like

348
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,100
more or less parallel

349
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,880
horizontal to the ground.

350
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,180
Well, it's for water storage

351
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,500
like the camel's hump.

352
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,940
Exactly.

353
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,620
And also the young can be

354
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,020
carried on the back

355
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,280
on the huge rack like

356
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,000
ass.

357
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,220
It sounds worse with every

358
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,680
moment as you describe it.

359
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,420
Yeah.

360
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,100
Go call, call.

361
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,860
This is the same strategy as

362
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,420
the giant brown-backed

363
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,760
spider.

364
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,440
It's the young riding on its back.

365
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,340
And if I were

366
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,220
over there, then Get Back

367
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,680
would suddenly come up by the London Symphony Orchestra.

368
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,240
It would come on backwards though.

369
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,320
And they face with the

370
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,280
open booty.

371
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,660
I like big butts and I cannot lie.

372
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,260
You other brothers can't deny.

373
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,300
When a girl walks in with a itty bitty waist

374
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,140
and a round thing in your face.

375
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,300
You get sprung, you wanna pull up tight.

376
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,020
You notice that butt was stuffed

377
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,380
deep in the jeans she's wearing.

378
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring.

379
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,240
Oobay.

380
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,860
I wanna get with ya.

381
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,140
Take your pretty picture.

382
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,240
My homeboys tried to warn me.

383
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,440
But that butt you got makes me so horny.

384
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,640
Oob, rumpled smooth skin.

385
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,600
You say you wanna get in my bands.

386
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,040
Well, use me, use me.

387
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,540
Cause you ain't that rich, coobee.

388
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,240
I've seen them dancing.

389
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,940
To hell with romancing.

390
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,140
Cause she's sweat, wet.

391
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,300
Gotta go like a turtle.

392
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,920
I'm tired of magazines.

393
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,220
Saying flat butts are the thing.

394
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,580
Take the average black man and ask him that.

395
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,520
She gotta pack much back.

396
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,180
So fellas, fellas.

397
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,720
Has your girlfriend got the butt?

398
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,540
Tell her to shake it, shake it.

399
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,380
Shake that healthy butt.

400
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,060
Baby got it.

401
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,280
Now baby, face with the open booty.

402
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,160
Baby got it.

403
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,460
Baby got it.

404
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,460


405
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,780
Now baby, face with the open booty.

406
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,300
Baby got it.

407
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:54,760
Baby got it.

408
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,020
Now baby, face with the open booty.

409
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,580
Baby got it.

410
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,820
Baby got it.

411
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,420
I like em round and big.

412
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,020
And when I'm throwing a gig.

413
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,940
I just can't help myself from acting like an animal.

414
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,660
Here's my scandal.

415
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,260
I'm just a child.

416
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:16,260


417
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,140
I want to get you home.

418
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,940
Whoa, double up.

419
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,740
Whoa, whoa.

420
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,320
I ain't talking about Playboy.

421
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,020
Silicone pots are made for toys.

422
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,820
I want them real thick and juicy.

423
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,940
So find that juicy double.

424
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,680
Johnny C's in trouble.

425
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,240
Begging for a piece of that bubble.

426
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,400
So I'm looking at bike videos.

427
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
Knock me bimbos walking like hoes.

428
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,740
You can have them bimbos.

429
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,140
I'll keep my limo like Flojo.

430
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,480
A word to the Pixel Sisters.

431
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,120
I won't get with ya.

432
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,900
I won't cuss or hit ya.

433
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,900
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna

434
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,840
till the break of dawn.

435
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,680
Baby, I got it going on.

436
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
A lot of simps won't like this song.

437
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,560
Cause them punks like to hit it and quit.

438
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,000
And I'd rather stay and play.

439
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,260
Cause I'm long and I'm strong.

440
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,040
And I'm down to get the friction on.

441
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,480
So.

442
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,420
Ladies, ladies.

443
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,740
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes.

444
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,320
Then turn around and stick it out.

445
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,440
Even white boys got to shout.

446
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,080
Baby, got back.

447
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
Baby, got back.

448
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,940
Baby, got back.

449
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,900
Baby, got back.

450
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Baby, got back.

451
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,600


452
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,260
Actually, when it comes to females,

453
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,680
Cosmo does not have very much to do at all with my selection.

454
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,620
I mean, 36, 24, 36.

455
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,140
Maybe if she's 5'3".

456
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,600
So your girlfriend rules a Honda.

457
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,500
Playing work out tapes by Fonda.

458
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of a Honda.

459
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,700
My anaconda don't want me.

460
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,720
Unless you have got a motor in the back of a Honda.

461
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,340
So let me model you this.

462
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,340


463
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:41,520
But I'm going for what the bordered Martin I can

464
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,700
Yeah.

465
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,740
I can make my own.

466
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,200
rough and smooth.

467
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,200


468
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,560
Yoæµ

469
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,700
yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo ya yo ya ya ya ya ya ya You, you, you!

470
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,720
You ain't in this thing

471
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,340
Give me a sister

472
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,860
I can't resist her

473
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,520
Red beans and rice didn't miss her

474
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,780
Some knucklehead tried to diss

475
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,460
Cause his girls are on my list

476
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,420
He had a game but he chose to hit em

477
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,100
And I pull up quick to get with em

478
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,380
So ladies

479
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,980
If the buddies around

480
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,200
Then you wanna triple X roll down

481
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,420
You down one nine hundred

482
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,880
Johnny C and

483
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,360
Kick them nasty thoughts

484
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,400
Baby got back

485
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,600
Baby got back

Baby got back

508
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:45,320
Baby got back

509
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:01,180
Nemo

510
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,120
Play

511
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,120

Play

529
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:21,520


530
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,400
I'll play it for you sometime.

531
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,060
Now we're having a McCartney-esque goodbye.

532
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,480
A course in a subgenius thing.

533
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,520
I'll convert from one format to another.

534
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,160
That's just the kind of thing I'm looking forward to.

535
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,680
Oh, man.

536
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,900
We're saying goodbye.

537
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,200
My manic-depressive is kicking in.

538
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,380
You're, like, freaking out, man?

539
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,760
Don't worry.

540
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,820
Everything's going to be fine.

541
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,820
And we have some giant pills the size of atomic submarines.

542
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,720
I went on tour with those giant pills in 77.

543
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,400
Yes, I've had those giant pills.

544
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,020
They were made by the man who would, years later, make the giant, wonderful bobhead.

545
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,580
On the giant?

546
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,920
Did you actually swallow one of those?

547
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,980
And he made giant pills and pillboxes.

548
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,160
Yeah.

549
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,820
And pillbox hats.

550
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,160
But you would choke to death.

551
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,900
No, atheists.

552
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,900
And the band was called The Tubes.

553
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,220
The Tubes.

554
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,780
The Tubes.

555
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,880
The Tubes pills take you.

556
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,860
Hurley Gates was one of the girls.

557
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,220
That was the greatest song ever.

558
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,740
White punks on dope.

559
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,920
Yeah, it was.

560
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,480
It inspired a generation.

561
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,640
I didn't like their music all that much.

562
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,880
Jane, that one song, and also Doernacker, remember?

563
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,940
Jane Doernacker.

564
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,480
I spent that tour in the back of the bus with Jane Doernacker and Hurley Gates,

565
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,060
talking the whole time about her dream about dying in the river in a helicopter.

566
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,340
Right, exactly.

567
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
Wanting to do that.

568
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,480
No, she did say she thought she'd die in water coming in from the air, falling from the sky.

569
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,180
She dreamed about that.

570
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,320
And so it happened.

571
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,740
She had a couple of talents.

572
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,000
And Hurley Gates had a band with Pearl Harbor and the...

573
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,620
Yeah, remember?

574
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,600
Explosion.

575
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,720
Yes, thank you.

576
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,620
Yeah, during the punk era.

577
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,740
That was a great band, Pearl Harbor and the Explosion.

578
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,000
It was, and she was...

579
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,940
Pearl was beautiful.

580
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,300
She's still around.

581
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,480
She was.

582
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,920
She's friends with...

583
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,460
She is still around?

584
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,800
Yeah, she's friends with Barbara Lou, the girl that appeared on Mondo 2000.

585
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:19,280
And also Barbara Golden, who plays, you know, who comes before us once a month.

586
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,780
Yes.

587
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,880
I was just talking about Prairie Prince and somebody else from the Tubes.

588
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,840
Oh, yeah.

589
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,100
Being at some event soon.

590
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,540
Oh, yeah.

591
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,460
Because they had an air...

592
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,540
I'm probably 80 years old.

593
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,840
I used to be in the Tubes.

594
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,920
Air spray art company.

595
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,420
And so in his bedroom, he had like an amazing view of the desert.

596
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,120
This wall, you know, long walls, just forever the desert.

597
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,080
What do you mean?

598
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,320
He spray painted the desert on his wall?

599
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,460
Yeah, that kind of airbrush.

600
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,120
Airbrush painting.

601
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,860
Yeah, it was a masterpiece.

602
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,240
Oh, like a...

603
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,560
Parches.

604
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:49,840
Right.

605
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,740
It takes a lot of paint.

606
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,380
Like a Geiger.

607
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,720
To view the whole desert.

608
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
It does, but then you run over in the morning and it's gone.

609
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,620
Well, what is it?

610
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:55,860
It's just two colors.

611
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,380
I saw the painted desert last year, but I saw it in the night.

612
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,360
Geiger actually worked.

613
00:28:59,460 --> 00:28:59,860
He makes in oil.

614
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,680
I know.

615
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,060
See, that's the desert needs...

616
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,500
Yeah, that one needs to be seen.

617
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,220
All deserts really need to be seen.

618
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,720
Need to be seen.

619
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,100
Sunrise and sunset is the best.

620
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,400
I see.

621
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,060
They have different aspects during all the day.

622
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,800
All day, all night is wonderful.

623
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,520
But yeah, sunrise and sunset, the oblique lighting really punches in the brain.

624
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,440
It is nice to go where there's little animals running around, though, to provide more interest.

625
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,100
Yeah, everybody should go to the high desert and concentrate on little rears.

626
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,540
Once again, it depends on what little animals you mean.

627
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,320
Well, little jackrabbits or...

628
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,140
Oh, yeah, they're all right.

629
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,680
Little jackalots.

630
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,740
Jackrabbits, okay.

631
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,780
This music makes you want to order more beer.

632
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,120
I don't want to see a bear.

633
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,800
Deer.

634
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,440
There's beer in the icebox.

635
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,140
You know, Armadillo.

636
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,300
Okay, here's...

637
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,660
Mom's telling us what to do.

638
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,220
Go get a beer out of the icebox if you want it.

639
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,020
I think it's all gone.

640
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
What am I supposed to do?

641
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,040
I want an ice cream cone.

642
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,980
Well, you're supposed to.

643
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,800
Growing up is...

644
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Get me a Pepsi.

645
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,680
I want an ice cream cone.

646
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,520
I want an ice cream cone.

647
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,540
See, that's the nature of growing up.

648
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,400
I want an Easter egg.

649
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:54,960
I want an Easter egg.

650
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,500
Just get me a Pepsi and...

651
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,940
I want, I want...

652
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,200
Mike, you're on drugs.

653
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,260
Mike, you're on drugs.

654
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,060
I will kill on a rough beer.

655
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,420
Literally, Mike, you're on beer.

656
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,560
Mike, you're on drugs.

657
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,100
Mom, give me a Pepsi.

658
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,360
Okay, so this village, this entire village will die until I get beer.

659
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,680
This village is revolting.

660
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,780
Yes, I agree.

661
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,880
Remember the king of id?

662
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,840
He's the one that said that first.

663
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,020
Yeah, and in the last frame will be him jumping to a chopper saying...

664
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,540
Is it id?

665
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:28,800
You don't know what id is.

666
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,920
Id is...

667
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,580
Did he have any cores?

668
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,080
No, it couldn't have been id.

669
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,580
Now, what are you talking about?

670
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,080
The id monster in...

671
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,480
The cartoon.

672
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,400
The cartoon where the guy said...

673
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,240
The kingdom of id?

674
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,780
The guy said the peasants are revolting.

675
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes, it was a comic strip.

676
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,880
Yeah.

677
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,700
From your Sunday...

678
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,920
The wizard of id.

679
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,040
Id?

680
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes, a comic strip running in the newspaper now.

681
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,740
ID.

682
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,020
ID.

683
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,320
The wizard of id.

684
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:53,640
Wow.

685
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,780
Yes, it's on.

686
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,600
That puts a whole...

687
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,880
I hadn't thought about that.

688
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,840
He would go up against King Frank.

689
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,700
He's a Freudian.

690
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,120
A Ferdinandian.

691
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,460
Remember Little King Ferdinand?

692
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,980
Ferdinand, yes, I do.

693
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,400
The Little King.

694
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,280
The Little King, yeah.

695
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:07,640
Right.

696
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,580
Oh, was he small?

697
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
Drawn by Otto Sobel.

698
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,400
Great little...

699
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,640
Yeah.

700
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,220
Yeah, right.

701
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,840
He had a pyramidal shape.

702
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,760
Yes, yes.

703
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,540
An ermine coat.

704
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,500
He never said anything.

705
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,440
His name was id.

706
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,880
There were Little King cartoons, which were quite wonderful, too.

707
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,500
Animated Little King cartoons back in the day.

708
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,420
I know I saw them, but I don't know.

709
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:23,980
They must be...

710
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,800
Supposedly, K-Rob has all those, right?

711
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,080
Another byproduct of the Fleischer studio.

712
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,700
I don't know what K-Rob has.

713
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,940
His treasuries are mighty and wonderful, but I...

714
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,740
You never know.

715
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,860
A lot of stuff, surprisingly, is still available, because nobody really knows who owns it.

716
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,820
Certain early cartoons, nobody seems to want to lay claim to Porky the Giant Killer or

717
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,540
something like that.

718
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,520
What a fun cartoon it is.

719
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,520
There's many cartoons that should not be made into movies.

720
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,820
Porky forced to play a toy piano.

721
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,020
For better or for worse.

722
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,140
Forever and ever.

723
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:57,960
Lin Johnson.

724
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
Oh, my God.

725
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,880
Lyndon Baines Johnson.

726
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,940
Sorry.

727
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,220
You mean for better or for worse?

728
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah.

729
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,820
It's like a stupid...

730
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,940
I don't know.

731
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,360
It's kind of Ozzie and Harriet for the millennial generation, I guess.

732
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Or for the 90s generation.

733
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,200
But we're not on the air, are we?

734
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,020
We are on the air.

735
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,400
It's just my headphones that can't hear it.

736
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,100
Your headphones?

737
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,860
Are they out?

738
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,560
No.

739
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,420
We're going to hear it in a moment.

740
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,460
I assure you, you're going out over the air to be heard by tens in this area.

741
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,360
I can't hear it.

742
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,400
If we put it out, will anybody hear it?

743
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,900
Why, we have nine authenticated viewers right now, and at the peak, 20 viewers.

744
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,560
My God.

745
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,860
Viewers of radio.

746
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,840
20 people.

747
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,980
So, 11 have heard.

748
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,320
My God's bigger than you.

749
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,040
All right, let's do it.

750
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,960
How many of those people...

751
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,300
I know, that's not good.

752
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:53,460


753
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,260
And the Lord said...

754
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,980
How many of those people have their clothes off?

755
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,420
Let there be great whales.

756
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,440
That's the quality...

757
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,180
Walking around with their clothes off.

758
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,160
That's...

759
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,560
He vexes me.

760
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,760
We know chicks love to listen to our masculine voices.

761
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,320
He vexes me.

762
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,360
They do?

763
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,740
Oh, yes, of course.

764
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,480
Coming over here.

765
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,620
John Kennedy.

766
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,100
No pun intended.

767
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,140
That's why they all left the studio some time ago.

768
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,560
Apparently.

769
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,520
Well, it reminds me of an amusing anecdote.

770
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,780
What was that?

771
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,740
We're also sensitive guys.

772
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,420
It's hard to be a radio audience.

773
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,840
Oh, yeah, I'm a sensitive guy, too.

774
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,240
You're about as sensitive as a power shovel, but I'm really sensitive.

775
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:26,640
You're not a vaccine.

776
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,400
You're not a vaccine.

777
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,940
Just sniff this patchouli.

778
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,060
Just to stand around and watch other people doing it doesn't make any sense.

779
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,280
I love the forests and the fields and the walking on the beach and the birds.

780
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,300
Yes, the little birds of the sky.

781
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,840
Listen to the mockingbirds.

782
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,240
Are you getting a radiocarpal tunnel, Evan Stang?

783
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,720
I've been fighting all manner of joint-related problems.

784
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,380
It's all right.

785
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,940
I've had too many joints.

786
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,380
If you want another joint...

787
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,240
No, no, no.

788
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,720
I would like some, and I'm...

789
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,660
I don't want any more.

790
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,620
I want to...

791
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,280
Here it comes.

792
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,420
I just want...

793
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,240
Well, I do, because my joints are aching, too.

794
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,280
Now your joints are aching for jellied slouts and bacon.

795
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,980
Where's my glucosamine?

796
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,680
For pork smith, Smith, you're super tricky, folks.

797
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,720
Shots.

798
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,260
Reb Stang, I'll tell you.

799
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,860
And there's my vitamin G.

800
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,120
The way you were shaking that hand, you've been holding too many little mice.

801
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,500
You've been holding on to mice.

802
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,860
He's been living in the other world.

803
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm not.

804
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:27,360
I'm not.

805
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,360


806
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,360


807
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,360


808
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,360


809
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,360


810
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,360


811
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,260
Don't say what I was...

812
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,080
Identity as Stangor.

813
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,820
Something.

814
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,560
You've been...

815
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,920
You've been using your wrist a lot, Reb Stang.

816
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,480
That Stang's really something.

817
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,060
His wrist is the most...

818
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,260
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

819
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Or we can call it scratching the squirrel.

820
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,700
It's really the most supple wrist I've ever seen.

821
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,780
A couple of supple.

822
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,680
I think it kind of jumped out of its socket or something.

823
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:48,980
Ew.

824
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,980
I hate that.

825
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,360
It kind of just...

826
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,820
Oh, there it goes.

827
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,680
I do get...

828
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,480
Sock it to me.

829
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,280
I hate to admit, I get mouse and remote control.

830
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,360
I hate to admit, I get mouse and remote control.

831
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,240
It's a little carpool.

832
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,860
Tunnel.

833
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,680
Yeah, I'm going that way.

834
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,920
Go, Stang, go.

835
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,880
Wait, he's taking his clothes off.

836
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,640
You, look at...

837
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,620
Come on.

838
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,440
Just look at...

839
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,660
Put me in so uptight, you guys.

840
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,500
Be free.

841
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,840
Hey.

842
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,720
We're with you, Stang.

843
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,380
We're following along.

844
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,340
We're with you.

845
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
What's the matter, you afraid?

846
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,820
No, we're coming.

847
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,300
Hold on.

848
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:23,920
Wait up.

849
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,400
Give a guy a break.

850
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,880
Don't you want to be cool?

851
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,100
Don't you want to be cool?

852
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,340
Don't you want to be cool?

853
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,060
Nobody's doing it.

854
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm coming.

855
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,000
Hold on.

856
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,920
Yeah.

857
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:31,860
Yeah.

858
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,080
You beat me out there.

859
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,900
Oh, my God.

860
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,420
The horror.

861
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,820
The vertiginous horror.

862
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,300
Wait, is this...

863
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,720
Madness.

864
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,340
That's why we're nude, because then the monster attacks us.

865
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,100
And we are defenseless.

866
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,380
I got my man thing out.

867
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,560
Well, throw a towel over there.

868
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,460
Man by day.

869
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,220
And, you know, I'm just loving it, baby, because it's San Francisco.

870
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,880
All right, all right.

871
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,680
Yes, the magic of radio.

872
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,080
We call it...

873
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,600
Stem load.

874
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,980
Stem load?

875
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,880
Stem load?

876
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,060
From stem to stern.

877
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,660
It's called stem to stern.

878
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,240
It's called wasting your stem cells, as Onan did when he spilt his seeds.

879
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:17,000
Dr. DeBruyck's friend was complaining last night about menopause, because apparently...

880
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,200
Really?

881
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,300
Yeah, he's having the change.

882
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:20,940
It's very real.

883
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,920
He's going through the change.

884
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,900
Oh, my God.

885
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,580
But on him, you wouldn't notice, though.

886
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,540
That sounds so sad.

887
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,700
But everybody else had better watch out.

888
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:28,700


889
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,480
What happens to you?

890
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,520
Certain physical signs appear.

891
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,180
Oh, you wear mommy jeans.

892
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,460
I don't wear mommy jeans.

893
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,580
Do you wear mommy jeans?

894
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,480
I don't even know what mommy jeans are.

895
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,700
I don't believe I can...

896
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,580
I take your meaning.

897
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,000
I know about moon pants.

898
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,740
I'm speaking the bottoms.

899
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,140
So do you do...

900
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,320
Are you in menopause?

901
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,340
Like, what do you do now?

902
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,760
No, no, no.

903
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm not sure.

904
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,220
Well, I forget things, but I think that's due to...

905
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,540
What foof are all in Terradiddle?

906
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,320
Balderdash.

907
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,080
Pure balderdash.

908
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:56,880
Balderdash.

909
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,060
Balderdash.

910
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,060


911
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,720
I forget things even when I was young, when I was smoking froth.

912
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,880
Well, that may have had something to do with it.

913
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,320
I would do that now, but...

914
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,920
Actually, I can tell you...

915
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,140
I got news for you.

916
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,860
...a memory booster or enhancer.

917
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,840
Even people who don't smoke froth have terrible memories.

918
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,260
That's right.

919
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,960
Even folks who don't smoke froth forget everything in their life.

920
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,320
Why is that?

921
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,540
Because they say everything you've experienced is stored.

922
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,200
Here's my memory right here.

923
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,860
I store it on a folded-up sheet of paper.

924
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,720
On an extrasomatic system.

925
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,360
That's old school.

926
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,880
I use a pen.

927
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,180
Recently...

928
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,960
You use an artifact.

929
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,540
...on the Scrub Genius Forum, somebody posed the question,

930
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,880
when was the last time you used a pencil?

931
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,620
And about half of the people could think of one time in the last year

932
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:52,520
that they had used a pencil, but then the old fogies like Reverend Susie the Floozy

933
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,380
and G. Gordon Gordon and myself were all...

934
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:54,680
And me.

935
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,020
Well, an hour ago.

936
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,660
Yeah, exactly.

937
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,320
Five minutes ago.

938
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,200
Why didn't you see me pencil sharpener?

939
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,000
Wow, yeah.

940
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,860
Yeah, I constantly use a pencil.

941
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,540
I like pencil.

942
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,120
Number two.

943
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,380
Yeah, I use them all the time.

944
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,500
But my erasers always dry out.

945
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:06,860
But we're old, you see.

946
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,500
Exactly.

947
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,220
Yes, it's true.

948
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,040
We are fading fast.

949
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,220
Even I don't use...

950
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,020
But that's okay.

951
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,420
That's exactly how it's supposed to happen.

952
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,520
They don't teach you how to map or person.

953
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,020
I can feel myself...

954
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,520
No, they don't have to do figures.

955
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,020
I can feel myself turning into my grandmother.

956
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,880
They do.

957
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,340
Well, my sacred grandmother.

958
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:25,960
The Uber child.

959
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,460
On the Uber.

960
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,480
I feel myself coming up with the same thoughts

961
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,240
that I would hear her say to me when I was so young.

962
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,740
I thought, you're crazy, old lady.

963
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,740
And now those same roads are in my head.

964
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,580
And I'm thinking, that's what she meant.

965
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,640
Well, what did she tell you?

966
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,620
You mean, do your math?

967
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,140
Well, it was that.

968
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:41,560
But that was...

969
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,700
I remember the new math.

970
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,620
We did have that.

971
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,620
No one else had that.

972
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,680
Is it the new math?

973
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,040
Please help us.

974
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,560
Tell us.

975
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,520
No, I'm sorry.

976
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,980
I can't share that with you on the air.

977
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,980
The new math?

978
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,640
Yeah.

979
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,360
No, the secret lore passed down.

980
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,340
Because then, yeah, if you say it on the radio,

981
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,120
it becomes true.

982
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:56,720
Right.

983
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,220
I know.

984
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,120
Now they're calling.

985
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm not going to be able to answer.

986
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,400
Don't answer that.

987
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,080
We can't give these secrets away.

988
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,500
They are classified.

989
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,420
She died.

990
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,880
Church business only.

991
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,060
She tried to kill herself.

992
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,260
Me too.

993
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,720
First rule of forbidden science.

994
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,120
Really?

995
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,660
Wow.

996
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,380
Yes.

997
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
Was her name Wellman?

998
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,300
Chapter 11.

999
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,120
That's all you need to know.

1000
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,020
Verse than ever.

1001
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,980
Nor McCoy, nor Hatfield, nor Smith, nor Drummond.

1002
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,420
Yeah.

1003
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,320
Well, you know what they found about the brains of the Hatfields, I believe.

1004
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:33,160
What they did see was that they had a chronic genetic disease, which inclined them to be

1005
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,080
unable to control their anger.

1006
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,440
Their temper.

1007
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:35,720
Yeah.

1008
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,020
They didn't have enough mass in the neocortical area to...

1009
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,860
Are you a Hatfield, my friend, or are you a McCoy?

1010
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,860
But I don't know which one.

1011
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,900
I forget which side.

1012
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,560
Ren Hatfield and Stephen McCoy.

1013
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,140
Which is the important thing.

1014
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,580
But one of them just couldn't control their anger.

1015
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,640
And subsequent generations...

1016
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,760
Hatfield Anger Management Corporation.

1017
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,280
The Hatfield guys were a little more violent.

1018
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,440
Right.

1019
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,440


1020
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:56,660
Yeah.

1021
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,480
And the book I was reading was all about...

1022
00:39:59,480 --> 00:39:59,540
It's a criminal brain.

1023
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,220
Just like Dr. Xavier would say.

1024
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,480
The endless history of violence that goes through those myths and feuds all the way

1025
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,580
into our century and becomes a story to us like Beverly Hillbillies or my favorite, Petticoat

1026
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,000
Junction.

1027
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,280
Yeah.

1028
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,060
That's a sexist shit.

1029
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,840
Well, there was a...

1030
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,540
There was no show.

1031
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,200
It's just girls.

1032
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,420
I know, but they never appeared.

1033
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,020
I know.

1034
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,780
I confused him.

1035
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:29,120
There were shows that I don't remember because he's just a few years older.

1036
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,860
They're on the internet.

1037
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,860
Look on the internet.

1038
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,580
I know, but...

1039
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,800
Yeah, but you remember to look at them on the internet.

1040
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,500
You should look at them.

1041
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,460
Because you remember the show.

1042
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:36,880
The show.

1043
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,820
I can't remember the name.

1044
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,840
It's ultra cool compared to anything they did after that.

1045
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,000
You can't remember the show.

1046
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,520
You can't remember the show.

1047
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,340
You just don't remember the name.

1048
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,280
The more these shows went on, the less they came based on anything real.

1049
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:47,760
Yeah.

1050
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,900
That's why I love Petticoat Junction.

1051
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,660
What little I remember.

1052
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,620
Because there's nothing real except the girls and the...

1053
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:53,700
No.

1054
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Well, I was more of a Green Acres man.

1055
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,100
I was a Green Acres fan myself.

1056
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,540
Well, you had a little bit more television there.

1057
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,400
Green Acres was a co-show of Petticoat Junction.

1058
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,340
But her sister was kind of...

1059
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,960
Sometimes there was actual fusion and crossover between the two shows.

1060
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,800
And she was like Eddie Albert on it, which kind of...

1061
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:15,180
The yokels in Green Acres used to watch Petticoat Junction on their television.

1062
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,700
Oh, yeah.

1063
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,740
Because it was more country-fied, even more crude and rural.

1064
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,000
Right.

1065
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,920
Did it ever cross over into the Marvel universe, though?

1066
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,140
Not for hundreds of years.

1067
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,280
Not yet.

1068
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:25,940
But in time...

1069
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,060
Would Mr. Douglas ever have to tangle with Doc Ock?

1070
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:29,540
Ever.

1071
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,600
That would be great.

1072
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,800
Doc, Marvel has yet to tackle Doc Ock.

1073
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,720
I have a scene.

1074
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,680
Is it from Beverly Hillbillies where...

1075
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,980
Did Spider-Man have to fight Mr. Haney?

1076
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,560
Not even during Batman, of course.

1077
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,820
Doc Ock needs a special part from Mr. Haney's store.

1078
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,920
It's Beverly Hillbillies.

1079
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,020
Finding it proves difficult.

1080
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:48,660
I know.

1081
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,360
D.C. really just dominated TV.

1082
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,040
I mean, over Marvel.

1083
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:54,560
Why?

1084
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,680
He waited 30...

1085
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,880
30 years, Stan Lee.

1086
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,200
The time was ripe.

1087
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,180
It was incubating.

1088
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,040
And now it is ready to decant.

1089
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,980
The time was ripe.

1090
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,000
He had to wait for those artists to die.

1091
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,320
Yes.

1092
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,160
Jack Kirby.

1093
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,080
I didn't say that.

1094
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,460
I didn't say that.

1095
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,520
They set certain standards of balloon dialogue.

1096
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,200
Am I on?

1097
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,140
Okay, good.

1098
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,600
Thank you.

1099
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:15,780
Keep going.

1100
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,540
It certainly influenced my text writing style.

1101
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,640
I had a tendency to rant.

1102
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,900
I kind of quit doing that.

1103
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,040
They ranted.

1104
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,200
Everybody ranted.

1105
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,380
Monsters ranted.

1106
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,040
Scientists ranted in those comics.

1107
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,140
They went on and on.

1108
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,600
For am I not Goo-Gam, son of legume?

1109
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,980
Did I not rescue the princess of Ra?

1110
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,560
For this is not the way of Grunthorpe.

1111
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,480
Asterisk.

1112
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,880
No, you know, editor's note from issues 11.

1113
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,660
Am I not Cock-a-hoom?

1114
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,700
15, 17, and 19.

1115
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,360
There was a monster made of wood who came from Planet X,

1116
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,240
and he said,

1117
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,820
For I am Groot, the lord of all the timber.

1118
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,040
In the universe.

1119
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,480
Did he wear underpants like the rest of those monsters?

1120
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,940
So you've set fire to them.

1121
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,120
Because the one weird thing about these huge blobby monsters,

1122
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,840
Kirby always drew like swimming trunks on them.

1123
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,440
So they'd be decent.

1124
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,200
Right.

1125
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:17,000
You can't just have a huge blobby humanoid giant.

1126
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,440
It has to have a neat pair of pants on it.

1127
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,120
Approved by the Comics Code.

1128
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,620
He tried to stay close to the human body.

1129
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,820
Would the Comics Code have even...

1130
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,900
He did not always stay close to the human body.

1131
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,100
What about his most infamous creation,

1132
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,180
Fin Fang Foom?

1133
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,980
Those commies.

1134
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,640
Not humanoid at all.

1135
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,180
Those commies deserved it.

1136
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,320
Fin Fang Foom.

1137
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,540
That was revenge.

1138
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,180
I don't even know what that is.

1139
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,680
Communist Chinese agents pursuing a victim down an alley

1140
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,400
when suddenly they reel back in horror

1141
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,860
because of that graffiti.

1142
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,180
That graffiti up ahead.

1143
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,580
That terrifying graffiti that says,

1144
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,480
Fin Fang Foom.

1145
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,300
And then it turns out to be,

1146
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,920
ultimately it turns out to be a dragon-like monster.

1147
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,980
Not a humanoid.

1148
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,440
And it punishes the commies.

1149
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,940
One of my favorites of those is the Easter Island heads.

1150
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,680
Adolf Hitler.

1151
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,920
There's got a whole body underneath there.

1152
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,720
Yeah, they actually turn out to be real heads

1153
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,560
of these huge stone-like giants that come tearing out.

1154
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,200
It's just like Fingo.

1155
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,840
Oh, that's beautiful.

1156
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,740
And all the time,

1157
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,400
they're ranting.

1158
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,300
They're bellowing.

1159
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,920
Foolish humans who dare to think

1160
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,140
they can stand beneath the mighty onslaught of...

1161
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,460
But then the scientist uses a rock pit

1162
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,500
to break a little rock.

1163
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,160
Oh my God, their power is too great.

1164
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,460
We must flee and never invade this planet again.

1165
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,940
Or if they're made of fire,

1166
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,780
he lights a match and blows it out.

1167
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,440
Do you have this comic still?

1168
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:50,400
He melts an ice cube.

1169
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,700
Hal just cognated.

1170
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,540
I have a lot of comics with no cover at all.

1171
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:54,640
I thought I smelled something.

1172
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:54,800
I thought I smelled something.

1173
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,260
I just...

1174
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

1175
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,860
we're getting ready to wind it up.

1176
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,640
We're going to make the final pitch

1177
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,080
and, uh...

1178
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,240
Yes, the end of the first chapter.

1179
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,040
Yes.

1180
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,300
In a story which will grow longer and longer.

1181
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,620
Yes, indeed.

1182
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,540
Strange tales.

1183
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,340
Those were the big...

1184
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:11,880
Well, I was...

1185
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,020
You mean Fin Fang Foo?

1186
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:13,900
Um...

1187
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,820
I think they were the oldest.

1188
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,380
And then Tales of Suspense.

1189
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,840
And then Tales to Astonish.

1190
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,880
Tales of Suspenders.

1191
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,600
In that order.

1192
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,220
Because many of them...

1193
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,640
There's 60, 80 issues gone by that...

1194
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,420
That I just don't have.

1195
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,100
And I've always felt the hole in my life.

1196
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:28,880
You don't have them.

1197
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,620
Because of the...

1198
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:29,740
No.

1199
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,020
I started, you know, with the superhero era.

1200
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,140
See, if you've been loved...

1201
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,020
I started with FF25.

1202
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,020
If you had been loved,

1203
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,500
then your teacher from grade school...

1204
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,840
Yes.

1205
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,360
Decades ago would have called

1206
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,440
and returned those comics to you.

1207
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,480
That's right.

1208
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,020
But instead, you were...

1209
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,920
You know, your family turned you out.

1210
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,420
And you had only the comic books to warm you

1211
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,560
in the streets of Boston as a child.

1212
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,700
Hey, how about...

1213
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,560
Has anyone in this room...

1214
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,200
Any experience with a comic book called

1215
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,860
Kona, Monarch of Monster Isle?

1216
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:01,880
I have.

1217
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,100
I remember.

1218
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,600
The first...

1219
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,480
The most bizarre comics ever.

1220
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,080
Yes.

1221
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,120
I've got them, Dr. Howell.

1222
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,180
In fact, I have Kona going all the way up through

1223
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,180
like number 20 or so.

1224
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,840
It's not only a lost dinosaur inhabited land,

1225
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,120
but it's one that suffers bizarre mutations and...

1226
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,420
And giantism.

1227
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,860
Even further giantism.

1228
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,120
Giantism.

1229
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,360
Giant dinosaurs, giant insects.

1230
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:26,840
Right.

1231
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,780
Spiders grow the size of dinosaurs

1232
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,480
and fight Tyrannosauruses who get infected

1233
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,300
and then grow to that much bigger size.

1234
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,960
Right.

1235
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,800
And they end up forming a mountain

1236
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,980
of giant mutated dinosaur and insect flesh.

1237
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,400
Right.

1238
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,160
Seeking a pheromone...

1239
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,180
Every kid's dream.

1240
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,820
...that Dr. What's-His-Name has invented

1241
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,040
to lure them away.

1242
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,180
And then they crack through the ocean...

1243
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,500
No, they break through into the cave...

1244
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,720
...with a wave of mutations...

1245
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,220
Mutants.

1246
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,700
...which is full of animals...

1247
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,420
And giant mutant sharks that gobble up all the rest.

1248
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,680
...mixed up together like a gorilla with an ostrich's legs.

1249
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,120
Oh, yeah.

1250
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,780
Like a rabbit with a lion's behind.

1251
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,160
Like a lion and an alien monster.

1252
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,640
And then they fight with the dinosaurs.

1253
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,200
It was really bizarre.

1254
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,460
And then it got...

1255
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,780
After the first three issues,

1256
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,580
it's almost like somebody else took over

1257
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,740
and it became normal.

1258
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,480
The land of the lost.

1259
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,080
Right.

1260
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,920
The land of the lost actually was a ripoff.

1261
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,500
Like DC.

1262
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,900
Well, things had to settle down.

1263
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,600
Monarch and Monster Eye.

1264
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,360
There couldn't be a giant bio-crisis in every issue.

1265
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,040
I'm getting all bogged down.

1266
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,840
Can't move as fast on show.

1267
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,320
In a froggy, bog-infested bog.

1268
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,340
What's happening?

1269
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,100
Drunk deals.

1270
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,700
What's happening?

1271
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,740
Oh, we're freaking out now.

1272
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,100
The cancer of superstition.

1273
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,320
It's the sandbox of pain.

1274
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,940
Everyone talking at once.

1275
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,140
Was this like Pink Floyd?

1276
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,940
That's the only way we'll keep the dark ones away.

1277
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,880
Keep talking.

1278
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,700
Like kindergarten.

1279
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,320
Kids in a sandbox.

1280
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:59,160
I assume we've got the outro guests over there.

1281
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,780
At the same time, like meth head kindergarteners.

1282
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,640
They can have worked it out.

1283
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,700
Kindergarten meth heads?

1284
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,400
Yes.

1285
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:05,800
Right.

1286
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, that was a great meth head.

1287
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,380
Kindergarten meth heads.

1288
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,360
What meth heads?

1289
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,980
They were awesome.

1290
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,400
Oh, kindergarten meth heads.

1291
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,140
I saw them in the open for...

1292
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:16,920
Right.

1293
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,020
Well, they named themselves after that movie,

1294
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,700
Kindergarten Meth Heads.

1295
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,400
With Arnold Schwarzenegger.

1296
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,800
The size project, that second album.

1297
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,200
Nursery school...

1298
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,960
Nursery school dropout.

1299
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,740
Nursery school tramp.

1300
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,380
Now, the nursery school crack heads was like a rip off that they...

1301
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:34,980
Yeah.

1302
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,780
Straight to DVD.

1303
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,480
Right.

1304
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,320
Didn't work.

1305
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,780
It just does sound like a little girl's band, you know?

1306
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,280
Girl generation and little girl crack heads are opening, you know, for 12 year olds.

1307
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,500
Oh, it's not real, Dad.

1308
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,040
Yes, it's mad, it's cracked, it's...

1309
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,700
Just characters.

1310
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,540
Yeah, like Sailor Moon.

1311
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,500
Sailor Moon in your time.

1312
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,880
I think we could do a K-pop band like that.

1313
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,040
And Hal's still in love with the French girl that was at the...

1314
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,240
Oh, I know, the naked girl?

1315
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,620
Yes, she was so charming.

1316
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,620
We all loved her.

1317
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,840
All are in love with her.

1318
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,120
Still.

1319
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,440
I didn't know she was French.

1320
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,660
Yes.

1321
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,500
She was French.

1322
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,160
She was.

1323
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:12,980
She is French.

1324
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,200
And she will be French long after we die.

1325
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,980
It seems so, being so young and vigorous.

1326
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:19,780
Viva la France.

1327
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,360
Maybe.

1328
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,360
And full of something that blurred her out.

1329
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,460
It seemed during the evening.

1330
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,480
She looked like she was on a blurry voyage.

1331
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,760
I'd go close up in her face and just...

1332
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,020
Why?

1333
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,920
She was just high on life.

1334
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,320
Then she'd kind of come back and do it.

1335
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,720
I thought you meant she was always out of focus.

1336
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,440
She had taken some drug that caused her to be out of focus.

1337
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,080
She did well.

1338
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,160
She knew exactly how to move and what to do.

1339
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:42,620
Yes.

1340
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,920
She was theatrical and stage.

1341
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,320
I think they were getting a kick out of the old guy with the camera kind of thing, you know.

1342
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,040
Oh, yeah.

1343
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,240
Not the old guy with the camera.

1344
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,960
Just to have...

1345
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,320
That was their audience, huh?

1346
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:52,920
Yes.

1347
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,200
Yes, it's getting for me to do time to close down the show.

1348
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:04,680
And remind all my fans that bullying and braggadocio never get you anywhere.

1349
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,160
Or maybe not.

1350
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,860
And also...

1351
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:12,100
But you get to beat up all the pencil necks and the wimps.

1352
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,840
Pencil neck baboons.

1353
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,360
Yes, the sickly...

1354
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,940
Are you talking about the nattering bulbs of negativism?

1355
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,200
Mutations of nature's honest rule.

1356
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,880
The pencil neck baboons?

1357
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,900
Well, it's...

1358
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,260
Let's not get too specific to particular afflictions and cases.

1359
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,880
Of the spiral agnew.

1360
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,540
The spiral agnew fracture.

1361
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,460
Yes, one of the most corrupt vice presidents in history.

1362
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,520
He was something, wasn't he?

1363
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,880
He liked to go to strip clubs.

1364
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,260
Yes, and this nattering the bulbs of negativism.

1365
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,020
And the...

1366
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,440
You know what?

1367
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,400
All that crap was not originating with agnew.

1368
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,500
It was written by William Sapphire.

1369
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,680
Really?

1370
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,760
What I heard...

1371
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,660
Nattering the bulbs of negativism was a Sapphire lie.

1372
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,180
That's right.

1373
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,140
I thought it was written by that woman.

1374
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,020
On the other hand, Governor Agnew was one of the most corrupt politicians in American history.

1375
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:02,260
Yes.

1376
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,260
As befits any politician that comes out of Maryland.

1377
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,080
Yes.

1378
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,720
Is that true?

1379
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,440
Oh, yeah.

1380
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,160
Or New Jersey.

1381
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,060
Or one of our oldest states.

1382
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:09,280
How do you think they call it Maryland?

1383
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,060
Or Illinois.

1384
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,000
Well, it's just it's one of the oldest states.

1385
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,600
It was the capital of the U.S. for all those sorts of things.

1386
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,300
And, yeah, the deals go way back in the old family.

1387
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,760
It's also the geopolitical...

1388
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,520
And Virginia's like that.

1389
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,660
Oh, yeah.

1390
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,560
Virginia's more important than any other state.

1391
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:22,740
Virginia's more important than any other state.

1392
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,380
The United States and the Union.

1393
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,200
A hundred.

1394
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,760
Did you see any of those?

1395
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,940
I saw Abraham Lincoln Vampire.

1396
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,560
Were we talking about...

1397
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,200
Yeah, because it's...

1398
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,140
I read the book and really enjoyed it.

1399
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,720
And to see the movie, I was very disappointed because it turned into an action flick.

1400
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,160
And it's a pretty funny, clever, silly book about Civil War history.

1401
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,980
Plus, he also did one of Jane Austen and...

1402
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,240
That's what I've heard.

1403
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,200
Ghouls, which I have not read yet.

1404
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,320
And then there's one about...

1405
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,760
Did you read?

1406
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,020
Read?

1407
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,240
More.

1408
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,880
You were here when I watched TV.

1409
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:55,440
Exactly.

1410
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,200
Read books, man.

1411
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,100
I am.

1412
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,640
Read.

1413
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,160
Read a book, read a man.

1414
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,680
Because you can see the book thing shrinking in front of you.

1415
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,180
I know.

1416
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,300
The whole...

1417
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:02,680
It's frightening.

1418
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:02,880
I'm trying to read a book now.

1419
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,780
But it's not about books.

1420
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,180
It's way beyond books now.

1421
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,880
What's happening is the end of ownership.

1422
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,920
I know.

1423
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,780
You can't...

1424
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,020
Dammit!

1425
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,880
You can't get paid if you write a book.

1426
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,660
That's the thing.

1427
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,100
Try to...

1428
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,680
You can't get paid directly.

1429
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:13,940
See?

1430
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,440
The conspiracy is making Reverend Stang...

1431
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,960
Eat his hand.

1432
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,380
...into a marionette.

1433
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:19,820
Right.

1434
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,640
He can't help it, but he...

1435
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,060
It's making me hit myself in the face.

1436
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:24,440
Yeah.

1437
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,180
Conspiracies.

1438
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,660
And it will until you pay those taxes.

1439
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,100
It's going to make me set my face on fire any minute now.

1440
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,380
You have to cut his strings.

1441
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,600
Oh, no!

1442
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,520
Don't do that.

1443
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,500
Stop making me hurt myself.

1444
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:36,940
Me!

1445
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,480
Stop doing that to me.

1446
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,400
Me!

1447
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,840
Don't make him hurt himself.

1448
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:41,980
Stop me!

1449
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:42,600
Lord, me!

1450
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,680
Wow, he's gone completely...

1451
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,140
That was the Demi-Urge.

1452
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,960
The Demi-Urge makes him hit himself.

1453
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,020
The Demi-Urge?

1454
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,600
His...

1455
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,720
The little demigod?

1456
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,120
He sprints off his left ear.

1457
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,140
Thanks, Bob.

1458
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,520
I needed that.

1459
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,200
Do any demigods show up at X-Day?

1460
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,960
I hope so.

1461
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,700
God.

1462
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,040
Supposedly, goddesses show up.

1463
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,320
Are there goddesses?

1464
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,540
You mean a real X-Day?

1465
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,940
Yeah, at X-Day Drills.

1466
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,160
Yeah, X-Day Drills.

1467
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,460
Oh, oh.

1468
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,260
Well, we had some girls in funny costumes.

1469
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,020
They had...

1470
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,840
They had...

1471
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,380
They had interesting costumes.

1472
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,780
There were three of them.

1473
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,480
And they had penile and breast-like...

1474
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,220
appendages all over them.

1475
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:23,780
Oh!

1476
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,620
So they're true subgeni.

1477
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,160
It's like a bunch of rubbery fake breasts

1478
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,100
and little pointing and phallic things.

1479
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,960
I can't think of anything that's more subgenius than that.

1480
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,480
It was kind of gross.

1481
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,080
At midnight the day...

1482
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,540
July 5th.

1483
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,080
Or July 4th.

1484
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,280
Midnight, July 4th.

1485
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,380
They were on stage

1486
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,400
and the drunken boys of the...

1487
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:49,940
Very well.

1488
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,960
Bobby...

1489
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:50,980
Bobby...

1490
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:51,440
I'm 90%.

1491
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,360
The tribe were broken down.

1492
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,840
They made a tableau that was unseemly

1493
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,560
when seen on video in retrospect.

1494
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,900
I was not there.

1495
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,500
I was hiding out

1496
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,920
because we were planning to arrive by helicopter

1497
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,640
at quarter of seven in the morning.

1498
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,680
We really did.

1499
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,360
We had a...

1500
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,340
Jesus had lined up a helicopter

1501
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,660
but the weather was too misty.

1502
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,180
Oh, damn.

1503
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,280
We couldn't fly so we had to do a limousine.

1504
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,960
Oh, too bad.

1505
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,200
But still, that's pretty...

1506
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,760
Pretty prestigious.

1507
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,180
Yeah.

1508
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,620
I mean, it costs a buck

1509
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,060
but it's worth it.

1510
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,180
I...

1511
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,780
And then I got thrown in the pond

1512
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,900
and dunked.

1513
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,360
That year was the limousine year?

1514
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:31,780
Yeah.

1515
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,580
Wow.

1516
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,720
I stepped out of the limousine

1517
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,860
wearing a tuxedo

1518
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,700
and ended up with a...

1519
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,000
tarred and feathered

1520
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,940
and thrown in the amoeba pond.

1521
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,800
That's mundane human year 1998.

1522
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,620
Right, right.

1523
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,060
Of course.

1524
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,540
1998 con year.

1525
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,040
Yeah.

1526
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,840
It's the primitive time.

1527
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:50,720
Conspiracy year.

1528
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,920
1998.

1529
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,580
I'm quite...

1530
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,000
Yes, right.

1531
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,240
The tribe must decapitate

1532
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,740
or assassinate its own pharaoh

1533
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,100
or king in order to...

1534
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,000
Well, not necessarily

1535
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,180
if a suitable sacrifice can be found.

1536
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,920
But it's funny.

1537
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:03,940
In some cases,

1538
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,220
the king must be eaten.

1539
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,320
The way I hear this story come back to me,

1540
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,740
I was literally tarred and feathered

1541
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,780
by angry people.

1542
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,820
But actually, it was honey

1543
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,880
and I paid for the feathers,

1544
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,300
the pink feathers myself.

1545
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,780
That was all planned.

1546
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,780
Well, I hope Judge Punch never...

1547
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,840
It was the brilliant Papa Joe Mama.

1548
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,020
As they were pouring honey on me,

1549
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,540
Papa Joe yelled out,

1550
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,800
it's motor oil.

1551
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,320
And from that point on,

1552
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,740
that was gospel.

1553
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,100
I had been dunked in motor oil.

1554
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:36,740
Sure, yeah.

1555
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,840
A very clever propagandist.

1556
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,200
The unplanned part.

1557
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,520
Very political.

1558
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,980
Being thrown in the pond was not planned.

1559
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,200
Thrown in the pond.

1560
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,100
And I wish I'd been able to step

1561
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,200
just a little bit deeper

1562
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,180
into the world.

1563
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,460
I was going to be a little bit more

1564
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:51,460


1565
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,620
You wouldn't be able to see

1566
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,580
where my package ended.

1567
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,580
And you wouldn't be...

1568
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,920
Which would leave it up to the imagination.

1569
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,860
But as it is...

1570
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,900
You know, I just looked like

1571
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,880
a guy would look

1572
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,720
if he had 300 people laughing

1573
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,160
at his nakedness.

1574
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,080
So what's most people's

1575
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,160
most dreadful nightmare

1576
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,840
is my memory of a big party

1577
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,340
that really happened.

1578
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,880
I really did have 300 people

1579
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,180
pointing at my nakedness.

1580
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,120
And laughing.

1581
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,480
Because the aliens hadn't shown up.

1582
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,860
Well, you know,

1583
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,960
I think I dream about

1584
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,020
my worst nightmare.

1585
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:29,980
Like I was Bob.

1586
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,400
Like it was all my fault.

1587
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,860
Like I ran the exes schedule.

1588
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,540
Faithless.

1589
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,020
A bunch of...

1590
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,000
What are you going to dream about?

1591
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,180
They suck on the finger

1592
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,820
instead of going where the finger points.

1593
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,720
If your dream has come true,

1594
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,160
what are you going to dream about now?

1595
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,120
I don't.

1596
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,980
I just play...

1597
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,840
I've retired from reality.

1598
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,660
And I just play video games

1599
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,660
and read novels.

1600
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,120
Yes.

1601
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,040
There you go.

1602
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,700
I just try to focus on the positive

1603
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,680
and have a piece of gum

1604
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,060
and I hope it tastes good.

1605
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,360
I just hide from everything real.

1606
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,320
Alright, for exercise...

1607
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,700
I hide from everything real in my life.

1608
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,880
I think that's the rest of that.

1609
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,980
For exercise,

1610
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,820
I stagger a few steps

1611
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,240
and fall into a coma.

1612
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,180
Yeah, but I've seen that.

1613
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,460
I've driven up to pick up

1614
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,120
Michael Pepe

1615
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:20,820
for some good reason.

1616
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,300
He's in a business meeting

1617
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,700
and he's running down the street

1618
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,400
naked with 300 people chasing him

1619
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,140
in a coma.

1620
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,560
Oh, okay.

1621
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,240
I thought I was the only one.

1622
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,640
We should have a support group.

1623
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:30,600
Yeah, I know.

1624
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,080
Two guys.

1625
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,140
People that are in there

1626
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,760
traumatized

1627
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,120
and yet now numb

1628
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,860
and can't...

1629
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,660
Yes, horribly numb.

1630
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,620
...notice it when people

1631
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,480
chase them down the street.

1632
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,240
You haven't seen me

1633
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,780
in that situation since then.

1634
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,760
Me neither.

1635
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,140
I've learned my lesson.

1636
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:45,860
I don't mess with that.

1637
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,260
Well, the thing is,

1638
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,540
it's worth the pictures, I think.

1639
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,480
Don't get these girls excited.

1640
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,860
All these things are worth the pictures

1641
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,800
because people look at them.

1642
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,060
Look at all these strange photographs

1643
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,780
and they're turned into a symbol font.

1644
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,620
You don't go see that stuff.

1645
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,140
Well, they know you're popes

1646
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,040
in a great cult

1647
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,840
and they're not sure about what it is

1648
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,300
but they know it's going to overtake

1649
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,500
the nation and the world.

1650
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,620
As time has overtaken us

1651
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,800
because now it's time to end

1652
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,540
our vigil here.

1653
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,660
That was ten minutes ago.

1654
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,520
Yes, at this time

1655
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,180
the Ask Dr. Hal show

1656
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,380
live on radio

1657
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,540
ends its broadcast day

1658
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,700
on RadioValencia.fm

1659
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:19,880
and...

1660
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,040
RadioValencia.fm

1661
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,520
is showing you

1662
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,760

Let's clear out of this.
