1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,320
Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue the broadcast.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,460
This time we take you to Washington for a special broadcast on the national emergency.

3
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,080
I just make up my news.

4
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,560
I don't even get it anymore.

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,580
It's like I waste time getting it.

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,160
What bothered make it up?

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,500
You can see it when you check out the grocery store.

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,320
I just make up news now.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,080
I mean, anytime I want.

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,900
When I think about news, I just think in my head.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,080
Earthquake in China.

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,560
There's one right now.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,420
We said it on the radio, so it'll happen.

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Disease wipes out all bats.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,660
I hate saying we have to be careful about what we say because things will come true.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,300
And then we'll be sad.

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,560
Just write the news.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,480
We make it.

19
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,920
We make it.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,280
And when we can't make it, we make it up.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,180
And when we can't make it up, we steal it.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,860
And when we can't.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,520
We steal it.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,020
We plagiarize it.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,660
When we can't plagiarize it, we go out into the hallway and we find a genius.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:37,940
Our.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,600
Thanks to the large for all these collages.

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,720
Collages.

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,920
The collages tonight are all by the large.

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,740
Just send them in today.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,420
In fact.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,600
In fact.

33
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:13,960

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,360
In fact.

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,780
In fact.

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,380
In fact.

40
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,380


41
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:22,780


42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:22,960
In fact.

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,060
In fact.

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,060


45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,180
In fact.

46
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,200
In fact.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,380
In fact.

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,780
In fact.

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,760
In fact.

50
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,740
In fact.

51
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,360
In fact.

52
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:27,820
In fact.

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,420
Bye.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,300
Dear Bob.

55
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm standing outside of Bob.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,420
San Francisco.

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
Thanks, large.

58
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,180
Sorry we missed you when we were there.

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,600
Me too.

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,500
But we'll explain soon.

61
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,040
And, um, and, um, um.

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,400
All right.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
Well, um.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,160
Um.

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,420
Usually, um.

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

67
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,940
Doesn't answer you.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,840
The man does.

69
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,940
Thank you.

70
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,540
Tardy-or- ה׀은 수ert.

71
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,740
Good night, everybody.

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:17,620
Bye.

73
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,520
Bye.

74
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,220
Bye.

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,420


76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,840
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,960
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

78
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,980
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,060
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

80
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,820
This, friends, you may have guessed, this is a show about a guy named Bob.

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,880
Not to be confused with Slander Bob, who did this little cut-up and has a new streaming,

82
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,700
all Subgenius shows, streaming all the time, all shows.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,240
You can look at subgenius.com radio page for details.

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,800
Terrible sound.

85
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,300
Brave and deep in the sands of time.

86
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,640
Are the names of those who struggle for perfection in the dream.

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,140
Deep in the sands of time.

88
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,220
Are the names of the, are the names of the, for perfection, for perfection in the dream.

89
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,720
For perfection in the dream.

90
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,740
Oh!

91
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,660
Large morphological differences.

92
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,800
Yeah, and also the, uh, the sheer numbers become something else entirely.

93
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Well, of course it's not, uh, as it used to be.

94
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,940
That caller is far gone.

95
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,560
He's a gone gosling.

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,780
Oh, I hope we get another caller.

97
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,140
Well, that caller failed.

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,260
I hope his brain works.

99
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,400
I hope his brain works.

100
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:58,500
I hope his brain works.

101
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,640
I hope he's here.

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,760
To step up to responsibility.

103
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh, he can hear us.

104
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm still here.

105
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,540
There he is.

106
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:02,940
Hi!

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,680
Yes.

108
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,220
That's what the satellite does.

109
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,680
How are you?

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
I've never seen that before.

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,620
Oh, so good.

112
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,420
I'm staying awake till my flight, so here I am.

113
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,420
Yeah, I bet you didn't know she could fly.

114
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,340
You know, but doesn't that take, like, a layer of skin off each time you fly or something?

115
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
You lose a week.

116
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,300
Individuals talking, they're simultaneous, like, sometimes they're...

117
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,160
All the speech...

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,220
All the speech...

119
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,960
All the speech is like a mattress that you're weaving all the time.

120
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,420
Sometimes you gotta take it down a notch.

121
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,280
Sometimes you push it up, you know, push the feeling up, so you can keep it all night going on.

122
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,220
Yes, a nice, soft, comfortable mattress for you to enhance yourself.

123
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,480
Yeah, you can lay down your head.

124
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,360
And you know, hidden in the lining of that mattress is a $100 bill, but you'll have to snip it all to pieces in order to find it.

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,060
Take the skin away and make the blanket out.

126
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,180
I think this stuff worked.

127
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,720
Then you won't be able to sleep.

128
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,560
For this guy.

129
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,740
And make sure that no bed bugs reside in your mattress.

130
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,520
These tiny insects can create irritation.

131
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,900
It could be your own blood if the bed bugs are rustling between the sheets.

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,860
Yes, your bed and your immediate environment could be...

133
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,560
Seething with bed bugs.

134
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,920
Hey, did you just say...

135
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,260
Don't you want to be too hot, right?

136
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,040
About a tent pole?

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,960
A tent pole?

138
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,940
Well, um...

139
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,580
No, not you, Hal. This guy...

140
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,320
No, no, no.

141
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,280
Sometimes you gotta know how to let go, you know.

142
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:49,040
Otherwise, you can't even process anything if you just keep on pounding and pounding, you know, full on all the time, 24-7, all night.

143
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,260
Yeah, you get people really sweaty and, you know, going on and raving and, you know, popping pills and doing stuff, but...

144
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,560
Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,040
You gotta know...

146
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,320
You gotta know when to ease it down.

147
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,940
Maybe you float with the ghosts, you know.

148
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,820
I'm maybe not getting maybe too high here, but...

149
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,020
Oh, what did I say?

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,420
Oh...

151
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,680
You can float with the ghosts, soar with the spirits, and have fun with the phantoms.

152
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,220
Should we do a little recap on ghosts?

153
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,640
Yeah.

154
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,620
I said we weren't.

155
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,640
We talked a year ago.

156
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,820
Maybe it was last week.

157
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,300
I don't know.

158
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,120
The weeks are passing so fast.

159
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,320
The time is quirling.

160
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,860
How many days are there in a week?

161
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,320
I don't know.

162
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,460
Maybe seven in this planet.

163
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,100
Yes.

164
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,380
Try to exercise time.

165
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm sure.

166
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,760
Float with the ghosts.

167
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,800
Have fun with the phantoms.

168
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,860
Soar with the spirits.

169
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,800
Have fun with the phantoms.

170
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,660
Float with the ghosts.

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,900
Have fun with the phantoms.

172
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,120
Float with the phantoms.

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,120


174
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,120


175
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,120


176
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,500
Have fun with the phantoms.

177
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:01,860
...

178
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:01,860


179
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,200
...

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,200


181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,260
...

182
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,260


183
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,260


184
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,380
...

185
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,380


186
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,380
Thank you.

187
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Thank you.

188
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,540
Thank you.

189
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,740
Thank you.

190
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:06,520
Thank you.

191
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,760
Thank you.

192
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,560
Thank you.

193
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,840
Thank you.

194
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,580
Thank you.

195
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,920
Thank you.

196
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,840
Thank you.

197
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,760
Thank you.

198
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:18,540


199
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:18,540


200
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,460
Different.

201
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,800
Oh, I see.

202
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,220
Yeah.

203
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,840
Yeah.

204
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,060
I'll write that in here.

205
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,260
Oh, yes.

206
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,860
It's true.

207
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,640
It's so true.

208
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,880
X-Day is a coming friends.

209
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,360
So the amino acids will be there.

210
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:43,700
Dr. Howell, the Evolution Control Committee has just been announced.

211
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,200
They'll be there and all our regulars that you expect at X-Day.

212
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,560
But Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence were very wrong about something there.

213
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,840
X-Day festivities will not be held in New York.

214
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
The old place in Sherman is taint.

215
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,500
It's the one place that X-Day just ain't.

216
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,820
We thought of Vegas and more, but none of them made the score.

217
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
There's Sinfaltimus' yard in New Jersey.

218
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,240
And the Stang Ranch in Texarkerzy.

219
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,560
But things being how they are, a new place to play you can bet we did scout.

220
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,680
But the big, big bucks we need we ain't got.

221
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,020
Got.

222
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,580
So is Stang.

223
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,260
Stereo's where it plays out.

224
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:44,200
Why, it's good old reliable J-R-J-R-J-R-J-R-Bob Dobbs.

225
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,160
If you're looking for weirdos, this here is the spot.

226
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,480
Lookie where we have found it's pretty damn hot.

227
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,960
Not for good old reliable J-R-J-R-J-R-J-R-Bob Dobbs.

228
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,400
It's the youngest established permanent floating X-Day.

229
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,560
Now in Ohio.

230
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,760
There are weird abnormals everywhere, everywhere.

231
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,380
There are bizzare cuties everywhere.

232
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,320
And an awful lot of slackin' for the subs that get a backin'.

233
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,220
If we only were that bastard J-R-Bob, we could be a millionaire.

234
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,680
That's our good old reliable J-R-J-R-J-R-J-R-Bob Dobbs.

235
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,420
If you're looking for mutants, this here is the club.

236
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,500
You know you ain't no genius.

237
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,720
You're only a sub.

238
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,140
At the end of the world we call X-Day.

239
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,020
X-Day.

240
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,600
X-Day.

241
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,060
It's the 14th.

242
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,560
It's the youngest established permanent floating X-Day.

243
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,860
Now in Ohio.

244
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,660
Where's the party?

245
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,380
When's the day?

246
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,380
Gotta have X-Day so we all get saved.

247
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,500
It's the youngest established.

248
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,000
Established.

249
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,640
.

250
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,040
Permanent.

251
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,600
Floating.

252
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,420
X-Day.

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,280
Now in Ohio.

254
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,300
.

255
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,400
Are you guys singing Can Do, the horse can do already?

256
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,280
Yeah, I just heard and I hear the hum.

257
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,500
That's what I was just gonna ask you if it is unbearable.

258
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,280
I got the hum right here.

259
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
It's found in praise.

260
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,300
queer, but we can still be

261
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,200
singing cause we're all here.

262
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,500
Dave, shake your phone. Shake your head around.

263
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,420
Okay. I just shook

264
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
my head and one of the bolts fell out of the

265
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,660
back of my neck. Oh man, no!

266
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,280
And they're one of the priceless

267
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,380
ones too. The ones that are

268
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,100
engraved by hand.

269
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,300
The hum. The horrible

270
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,680
hum. That is pretty horrible.

271
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
Is it pretty horrible? Yeah.

272
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
It's fairly horrible.

273
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,140
Now we have known the hum

274
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,580
to slowly go away.

275
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,480
Or else for the listeners here to get

276
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,860
used to the hum. The buzz.

277
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,800
You can get a buzz off Dave's phone, man.

278
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,220
Yeah, man. It's the buzz.

279
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,120
It's kind of a bad buzz, but you know, it's like

280
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,540
you know, sometimes

281
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,580
you get a bad buzz, but at least you got one.

282
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,120
Yeah.

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,380
We are copping

284
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,080
a pretty bad buzz. Yeah, man.

285
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,340
Do you

286
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,960
think trying to call back

287
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,560
would do anything?

288
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,500
I will try it.

289
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,660
Give it a try. I couldn't wait.

290
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll give it a try.

291
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,520
I'll be watching. It's like chicken soup,

292
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,900
you know. I mean, it couldn't wait.

293
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,320
It couldn't wait. Okay, try it.

294
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:38,800
Alright.

295
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,680
Give him some chicken soup.

296
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,860
See, it's so nice when there's no...

297
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,400
Give him some chicken soup.

298
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,100
He's dead.

299
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,940
It couldn't wait.

300
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,480
What?

301
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,520
What?

302
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,640
Okay, now we wait for Dave to call back.

303
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,160
What's that

304
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
theme that you do with the...

305
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,520
when you're waiting?

306
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,660
Na na na na na na na na na

307
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,200
na na na na na na

308
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,700
na na na na na na na na na

309
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:11,900
na na na na na na na na na

310
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


311
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


312
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,480
I swore I wouldn't sing again.

313
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,860
Na na na na na na na na na na

314
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:15,860


315
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,620
It still stinks.

316
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,680
Uh, yes.

317
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,260
It is tainted.

318
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,160
He got the buzz right here.

319
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,100
It's all really clear.

320
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,000
It could be tainted on both ends.

321
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,140
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt it

322
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,480
because it went along with what you were talking about.

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,340
singing. The taint?

324
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,540
The taint. Yeah, Sherman has

325
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,220
the taint.

326
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,460
The taint and the crispy rolls. Yeah, so we really are moving

327
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,280
next day to Wisteria in Ohio.

328
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,640
Southern Ohio, if people did not

329
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,380
know that yet.

330
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,360
And I'll soon have proof

331
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,220
of why that's a real good idea

332
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,800
on the air.

333
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,500
Now, friends,

334
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,740
we

335
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,620
didn't especially want to

336
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,640
tell every stalker out there

337
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,620
on the internet that our house

338
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,540
was going to be empty for an

339
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,740
indefinite time. But you still did.

340
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,260
Well, no, we didn't.

341
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,600
We lied quite

342
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,460
a bit. Last December

343
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,560
19th, we left the Slacker Mansion

344
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,540
for what ended up being a

345
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,180
two-month cross-country driving

346
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,400
vacation. And then some.

347
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,700
Ever since

348
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,540
Princess Wee retired from her

349
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,580
job at Weather Control, we've been planning

350
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,840
this because we have grandsons

351
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,140
and nephews and

352
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,360
created monsters in California

353
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,420
and old friends that we had to see.

354
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,380
And, uh...

355
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,460
Some of them were monsters.

356
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,300
There are no

357
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,560
monsters here.

358
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,080
But, uh,

359
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,580
by gobs, we got so much

360
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,660
slack and so relatively

361
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,480
few moments of abject mortal

362
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,540
terror that we're going to do it all again as soon as

363
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,380
we pay off our massive credit card debt

364
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,140
that we built up.

365
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,460
And, of course, the sex change operation's

366
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,120
going to hit you pretty penny too without...

367
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,920
health insurance of the right kind.

368
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Yes, I had to have my sex changed

369
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
and then changed back again.

370
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,060
Well, I thought you were going for the fourth

371
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,780
alternative, as they call it now.

372
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,980
Becoming all, and not

373
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,640
androgynous, but trisexual.

374
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,300
No, that's for big movie directors.

375
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,880
Not, not, uh,

376
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,620
sacred scribes like me.

377
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,260
Big time niners.

378
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,120
No, uh, you know, although Princess

379
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,540
Wee is retired,

380
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,320
I, Stang, am not.

381
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,820
And for every three days,

382
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,800
I had to, while on this long vacation,

383
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,820
I had to turn on a computer

384
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,660
and connect to somebody's Wi-Fi

385
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,820
and work for an hour or two

386
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,860
checking mail and orders

387
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,080
and lurking and filling orders

388
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,940
out of this little mini office that I had

389
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,180
developed in the back of the iVan.

390
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,500
I even edited

391
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,020
parts of a couple of radio shows in the

392
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,380
car while we drove.

393
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,020
I mean, while she drove, not while we drove.

394
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,880
We didn't both. Actually, she...

395
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,600
We dabbled inanely into the window

396
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
while she drove. We did do that.

397
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,980
We brought a lot of CDs, but we mainly

398
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,840
dabbled inanely. Now, usually,

399
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,020
she drove and I navigated because

400
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,300
I...

401
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,940
It's kind of like where I'm the Spock

402
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,720
and she's the Bones

403
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,400
and there's no Kirk

404
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,620
or Scotty.

405
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
You have a GPS unit implanted in your head.

406
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,040
Yes, I am the hard drive,

407
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,440
so to speak,

408
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,200
while she is the motherboard,

409
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,940
the processor. I remember all the

410
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,980
details and the maps and the highway numbers

411
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,220
and where we're going,

412
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,640
but she knows why

413
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,180
we're going because she lives in the now

414
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,220
like a rewardian subgenius

415
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,420
whereas I live in time-controlled

416
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,560
Vulcan Jedi

417
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,060
mentat consciousness like a human computer

418
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,280
with a buzz in my head all the damn

419
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,700
time.

420
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,880
So that's why it makes such little

421
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,200
difference to you, the sound of the aperture.

422
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,420
It's because you've got your own dangling

423
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,980
gangly in your own apertures.

424
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,720
Well said.

425
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,880
Well said.

426
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,960
Reverend Zafod in Dallas

427
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,860
described us. He said

428
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,100
this just came off the top of his head.

429
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,940
He goes, true Yeti mates are like

430
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,560
Siamese twins joined at the crotch.

431
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,160
I thought that was touching.

432
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,620
At the crotch.

433
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,940
Why must you be so brusque in your sexual illusions

434
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,580
and metaphors? You referred to we as a motherboard

435
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,740
because she's a female

436
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,860
and yourself very conveniently is...

437
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,560
I'm the hard drive, baby.

438
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,660
See, that's just like

439
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,280
sexual advertisement for staying.

440
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,080
You've seen me drive.

441
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,140
Drive hard.

442
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,520
And that's why she drove, actually.

443
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,240
Now we

444
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,560
stayed in some marvelous cheap motels

445
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,760
including one with

446
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,920
an atom on it in

447
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,040
Alamogordo called the Satellite Motel

448
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,140
that I'd always wanted to stay in because I saw a picture

449
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,100
of it. And we did. And it sucked.

450
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,020
But we also stayed with

451
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,040
old friends and family whenever we

452
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
could because they feed you a lot better

453
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,780
than cheap motels do and they throw

454
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,040
much...

455
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,020
Much better parties.

456
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,560
Mmm.

457
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,020
Fabulous parties and fabulous food.

458
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,700
So you just partied across

459
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,860
the land where it was lovely

460
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,300
while we were all suffocating and dying up here.

461
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes. We did not see snow

462
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,420
except on

463
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,960
trails in Bryce Canyon

464
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,080
for two months.

465
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,900
We spent

466
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,060
all of today shoveling

467
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,960
our driveway just so that we could get down

468
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,980
here to the show, but we're in good shape

469
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,860
for it. Well, actually,

470
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,400
our legs were in good shape.

471
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,680
Our backs are weak, but our legs

472
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
are strong. I'm afraid you've

473
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
gotten used to sunlight, which is

474
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,360
really, really bad for you.

475
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:42,800
Yes.

476
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,560
You exuberant

477
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,860
ability

478
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,960
able to

479
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,200
Hey, Dave, I have a solution

480
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
for about the buzz.

481
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,120
Talk as loud as you can

482
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,220
and then I can pull your volume down and the

483
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,700
buzz will be relatively small.

484
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,600
I'm good. Shout.

485
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,940
I'm sorry.

486
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,300
Yeah, no, that's good.

487
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,500
That actually worked?

488
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,660
Well, no, but

489
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,080
you know, somewhere in between.

490
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm sure we can find a compromise.

491
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,340
If I pull the receiver part away

492
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,420
far enough from my ear, it actually

493
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,000
sounds that I have like, you know,

494
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,580
I'm just inside the closet

495
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,500
with the brooms and the mop

496
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,740
and the bucket talking to myself

497
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,900
again as usual.

498
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,380
Dave, I have a question.

499
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,200
Do you have

500
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,700
in your house anywhere

501
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,260
a plastic model kit

502
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,360
of the character known

503
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,660
as Rat Fink,

504
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,400
the Ed Big Daddy Roth mascot

505
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,520
creature from the base

506
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,500
of Weird Art of Cross?

507
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,780
Which I have kept.

508
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,120
You have drawings of Rat Fink?

509
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,380
Yeah, I know Rat Fink.

510
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,120
Drawings that you have made?

511
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,080
No, no, the ones by

512
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,100
Ed Big Daddy Roth.

513
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:55,840
Oh, okay.

514
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,320
Well, see, here's the thing.

515
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,540
Uh, we stayed with

516
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,140
Reverend Angry Larry in Detroit

517
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,420
not too long ago, and we noticed that

518
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,720
he has a plastic Rat Fink

519
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,020
model just like we do.

520
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,460
Well, next we stayed

521
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,720
with Potter Nostril in West Virginia

522
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,420
and he had a

523
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,500
painted Rat Fink plastic

524
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,340
model out among his

525
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,720
other stuff.

526
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,120
His stuff

527
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,500
makes his house pretty much the

528
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,480
coolest subgenius house. But then we stayed

529
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,060
with Sterno, Pope's

530
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,260
Sterno Docs in Arkansas, and he had

531
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,380
a Rat Fink in his living room.

532
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,740
Five Rat Finks in a row.

533
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,260
I know that Philo used to have one.

534
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,340
We stayed there, and Princess Wee's

535
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,040
brother had one. We stayed there.

536
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,280
So now we have to buy

537
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,140
one for you and our friend Dr.

538
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,900
Tillis.

539
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,140
And my dad.

540
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,440
About half

541
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
of the houses of the subgeniuses

542
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,000
have Rat Fink models.

543
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,660
Fairly prominently displayed.

544
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,160
I would bet that Reverend Susie the Flusie

545
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,760
has one. Oh, certainly.

546
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,260
And yeah, like she said,

547
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,300
they usually are prominently displayed.

548
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:08,660
Now,

549
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,920
but then there are

550
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,160
mystery animals. Rat Fink is known

551
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,620
to everybody, but guess what, Dave?

552
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,300
We're staying on Stang Ranch

553
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,560
in Stang County, Texas

554
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,100
in Stangsville with

555
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
my dad and

556
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,280
my brother and my sister and all the

557
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,560
other wild and wonderful Stangs

558
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:27,800
of

559
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,100
North Texas.

560
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,240
And we learned that

561
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,900
there's a mystery animal

562
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,620
running around on our property.

563
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,020
And we saw it.

564
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,940
It is an elk antelope

565
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,760
deer monster of some kind.

566
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,880
Apparently some kind of African ungulate

567
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,820
that we theorize

568
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,220
escaped from a safari ranch

569
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,540
because there is one nearby.

570
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,720
Well, if there is one, then that

571
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,420
you know, you can't just say

572
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,440
it.

573
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,920
But seriously,

574
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,980
we see deer all the time.

575
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
These are not deer.

576
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,840
They don't know what they are.

577
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,280
They have a strange gait.

578
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,900
They're sort of like phantom cats,

579
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,900
but we call them phantom

580
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,400
elopes or phantalopes.

581
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,040
And they're real.

582
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,320
And they've created their own environment right there in Texas.

583
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,440
This is beautiful. And they should probably

584
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,600
maybe get some development grants

585
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,760
and then maybe, you know,

586
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,860
when the time is right,

587
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,880
try and build a mall or something.

588
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,520
What?

589
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,360
The mystery animals?

590
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,100
Uh-huh.

591
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,060
No, somebody's going to build a

592
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,880
mall out there anyway.

593
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,740
I'm depending on that for my retirement.

594
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,160
But speaking of which...

595
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,720
If there won't be any antelope malls forthcoming,

596
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,800
I don't know why that wouldn't

597
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,440
sound like a good idea to some people.

598
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,540
I'm sorry.

599
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,760
It's all right.

600
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,660
Well, just think of the little antlered things

601
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,480
frolicking about.

602
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,580
First place, nobody knows what the hell they are.

603
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,100
So then, you know, you get people

604
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,620
to run the outside of the

605
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,420
containment area and they charge

606
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,300
money to come and see because they don't know,

607
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,040
you know, what it is.

608
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,620
And perhaps if you're on some sort of junket

609
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,880
with the university, you could try and interview

610
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,780
the little critters and see what they are.

611
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
Well, Dave, here's the thing.

612
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,780
Somebody already did that.

613
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,000
And that's how they escaped from that place

614
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
where somebody was doing that.

615
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:15,920
Seriously.

616
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,300
And that's how they probably ended up on

617
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,120
Stang property.

618
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,280
Well, I certainly expect to see him on

619
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,340
somebody's mantelpiece real soon.

620
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,120
We...

621
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,680
Uh...

622
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
We did also collect on our trip,

623
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,440
we collected new sacred subgenius slogans

624
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,420
from other subgeniuses.

625
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:36,880
I've got...

626
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,540
Well, you want to hear one?

627
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,000
You're going to.

628
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,200
Reverend Zaphod would just sort of reason

630
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,440
this out in front of us.

631
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,500
He said, with...

632
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,560
When you have your subgenius minister's card

633
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,300
in your wallet, that means Bob is always

634
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,960
covering your butt.

635
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,640
He's covering your...

636
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,420
Can I say it?

637
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:57,940
Ass.

638
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,120
Yeah.

639
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,600
Literally.

640
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,640
Well, actually, he's only covering half your ass.

641
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,740
It's half-ass coverage, but that's Bob for you.

642
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,140
As Zaphod pointed out.

643
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,740
We went to Zaphod's birthday party

644
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,900
at Club Dada in Dallas,

645
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,780
which was also a CD release party.

646
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,760
Man, was that fun.

647
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,340
But get this.

648
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,300
To our total surprise,

649
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,920
the opening band was led by this guy,

650
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,080
Princess Wego's.

651
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,200
Isn't that your son's wife's...

652
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,720
Brother?

653
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,920
And it did.

654
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,320
It just happened.

655
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,780
We just happened to stumble into a performance

656
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:39,160
by my daughter-in-law's brother, Clay Pendergrass,

657
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,600
who plays in Los Vaqueros Electronicos.

658
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,020
The electric cowboys.

659
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,900
Yeah.

660
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,140
Sorry.

661
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,780
I thought they were going to be a Mexican-American

662
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,660
electronic band, but he basically is just rock songs.

663
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,000
And...

664
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,920
Man.

665
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,100
Very electric.

666
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,400
And he's got the biggest manner of upbeat songs.

667
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,640
Man, that fits the music so well.

668
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,000
That is so synchronistically messed.

669
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,420
It makes me wonder if your pilgrimage didn't have some sort of deeper,

670
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,720
deeper meaning than you can possibly understand.

671
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,940
Well, we did go.

672
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,040
Of course, you did get that fork out of your butt.

673
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:14,640
Huh?

674
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,960
We removed the fork long enough, and we went deep.

675
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,720
We hiked deep, deep, deep, deep down.

676
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,100
We're deep downers.

677
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,840
We hiked around Stang Ranch

678
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,320
and Dinosaur World and Enchanted Rock in Texas.

679
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,180
Well, Stanky, did you see any pumas out there

680
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,020
while you was looking for wild critters?

681
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:42,060
We did, in fact, see signs such as Moose Crossing,

682
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,120
Beaver Crossing, and Cougar Crossing next 10 miles.

683
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,340
And we're not really used to seeing highway signs

684
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,680
in North America saying, beware of lions.

685
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,340
But we enjoyed seeing them.

686
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,220
We did not actually see the lions.

687
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,660
So many of the fish here back east and in the north and the Midwest

688
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,800
and so forth in Great Lakes do not know that there are rabbits

689
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,000
with really, really long ears.

690
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,840
And antlers.

691
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,540
Yeah.

692
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,160
Antlered, I saw many, many jackalopes.

693
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,160
They were all dead and stuffed, I'm afraid.

694
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,660
Of course.

695
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,960
But we did see those.

696
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,200
Lots.

697
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:25,540
We went deep, deep into the center of the earth at Carlsbad Caverns.

698
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh, my gosh.

699
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,960
We went through, we trudged through hell at White Sands Missile Testing Range.

700
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,780
Oh, they're so close together, too.

701
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,440
It's such a wonderful trip to go from one type of radiation

702
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,400
from the earth's core to the other type created by Manly.

703
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,200
Actually, we were, Mr. Sister asked us to pick up some trinitite

704
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,480
while we were in Rock Store area.

705
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,760
Trinitite is the glassy stuff that was formed from the sand

706
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,280
when they set off the first atomic bomb.

707
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,240
It was a bomb near White Sands.

708
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,720
Near Los Alamos?

709
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,740
Well, Los Alamos is where they developed it,

710
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,160
but they didn't actually blast it there.

711
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,580
Well, it's all just a short drive away.

712
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,600
We fought the devil in the Valley of Fire.

713
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,560
Oh, my God.

714
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,880
We went through the bad, bad El Malpais.

715
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,520
In fact, we stumbled into a cave, an unprepared cave,

716
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,340
a cave that we found ourselves.

717
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,780
Exploring, yes, deeply into.

718
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,920
And then, when we came out, we learned that we weren't supposed

719
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,860
to go into caves because bats are contracting white-nose disease.

720
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,020
White-nose syndrome.

721
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,360
White-nose syndrome, WNS, from a fungus on the coats

722
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,780
of cave dwellers like ourselves.

723
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,780
Spear owners.

724
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,940
We read every signature at El Morro in New Mexico.

725
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,500
Were there petroglyphs, or were they just signatures written by people saying,

726
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,240
Hi, I really thought it was cool here?

727
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,200
Everything.

728
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,100
From petroglyphs to Rudy plus Rudy to,

729
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,680
Ay, el Capitan del Morro del Palo Alto,

730
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,740
in the name of the King of Spain,

731
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,200
do declare this blah, blah, blah, beautifully etched stuff.

732
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,160
We saw the Grand Canyon, but we didn't fall off the backside.

733
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
We were careful.

734
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,380
No, we didn't.

735
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,340
We saw Hollywood and all the weirdos there.

736
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,000
And Morro Rock, not to be confused with El Morro.

737
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,400
I've seen it, too.

738
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,580
And we went to the Muir Woods.

739
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,260
It had the red woods.

740
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,800
Muir even, honey.

741
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,460
Muir, the Muir Woods.

742
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,820
And the graveyards of the Bay Area where we desecrated.

743
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,400
We actually took photo ops with puzzling evidence and how and lies

744
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,920
and Bishop Jerry and Philo and the overman.

745
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,960
And we took pictures where we weren't supposed to,

746
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,760
in the tomb of the bishops.

747
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,620
At Chinese cemeteries.

748
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,600
Because they're different.

749
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,580
They're for rich people is what they are.

750
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,820
And we used them.

751
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,180
Oh, you were on Haywood over there.

752
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,600
There's some incredibly rich cemeteries.

753
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,700
It's just south of San Francisco.

754
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,580
I can't remember the name.

755
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,360
Daily City?

756
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,820
Costco or something like that.

757
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
Went to Santa Cruz Beach.

758
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
We broke for him in Stinson Beach.

759
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,180
And we stumbled, looking for privacy,

760
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,980
we stumbled upon Red Rock State Park, which rocks.

761
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,940
And it's red.

762
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,200
Real red.

763
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:27,480
And our favorite place just about was this place Philo and Wellman

764
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,700
showed me pictures of.

765
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,020
The Alabama Hills, which are not in Alabama,

766
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,380
but are in Lone Pine, California.

767
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,180
And that's where they shot all those movies.

768
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,140
All of them.

769
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,560
It's the place where.

770
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,160
All of what movies?

771
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,080
You stand in these, it's just gorgeous rock formations.

772
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,900
Everywhere you look.

773
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,060
Very, very rugged.

774
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,540
And you go, that's the rock where the Apache jumps off the rock

775
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,440
onto the stuntman's back on the horse.

776
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,020
And that's Mars on that Twilight Zone.

777
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,860
Gunga Din.

778
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,820
And Gunga Din was shot.

779
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,300
That's where Gunga Din died.

780
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,380
And Death Valley.

781
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,880
Well, Death Valley wasn't shot there, but we went there.

782
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,540
Well, that's also where they shot the party with Peter Schellers

783
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,000
trying to pretend he was Gunga Din.

784
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:16,460
And that's where they shot up all their borax with their 20-meal teams

785
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,540
with Ronald Reagan.

786
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,020
Thank God they didn't shoot him with a gun,

787
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,580
as was previously planned.

788
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,300
But Death Valley was not really all that well-named.

789
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,200
There's a lot of life.

790
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,620
You know, Dave, we were looking for the place where they filmed

791
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,860
those Roadrunner and Coyote cartoons.

792
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,680
And we found places that looked just like that,

793
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,320
but they always had the scrubby grass,

794
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,180
which I suspect the animators were just too lazy to draw.

795
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,660
They deleted the sagebrush and so forth.

796
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,540
Speaking of movie sets,

797
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:56,420
we went to Las Vegas and explored both new Las Vegas

798
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,660
and old rotting Las Vegas.

799
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,400
Now that sounds like fun.

800
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,520
We didn't gamble or drink their drinks.

801
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,100
But, yeah, you kind of have to see a lot of this stuff to believe it.

802
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,020
And Zion National Monument, where we saw the throne of God

803
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,840
and rocks with funny names, you know,

804
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,900
like the Pettifor, the miniskirt, the nine angels of death.

805
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,840
Bryce Canyon, which we'd always wanted to do,

806
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,460
walked five hours down and five hours up.

807
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,560
Gazing at a hoodoo there.

808
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,180
Yeah.

809
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,900
I walked up for half an hour and almost passed out in Bryce Canyon.

810
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,420
Said, I'm going to get my Yankee buns back on down to the car.

811
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,560
Well, we were there at the right time.

812
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,600
You know, it's off season.

813
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,280
It was winter.

814
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,780
There was hardly anybody around.

815
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,620
You could drive your car right up to the parking lot

816
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,040
instead of getting on the shuttle bus.

817
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,640
Yeah.

818
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,700
With a hundred other people.

819
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,280
We went to Monument Valley.

820
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,060
And it was funny to be on the reservation again.

821
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,180
It's not the kind of reservation I'm used to.

822
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,400
I was used to the—I lived on the Lakota Reservation,

823
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,100
although I was just a Washichu.

824
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,640
And you still are a Washichu.

825
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,580
Yeah, we are.

826
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,060
We are.

827
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,440
And we—

828
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,160
There was a sign, a billboard we noticed in the Navajo area that said,

829
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,900
we need more res ball, not meth.

830
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,180
And I thought, well, it figures it.

831
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,340
I can see how meth could be a problem like it is with all depressed areas.

832
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,040
Yes.

833
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,200
Out in the country.

834
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,340
But what the hell is res ball?

835
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:46,020
Res ball is intramural sports among different people in different schools on the res.

836
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,320
Say like there's three or four schools in the res.

837
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,020
They all play beast ball or banel ball.

838
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,700
Sometimes they actually just get a large rubber ball and bang each other over the head.

839
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,480
It's hard being rough and tough.

840
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,860
And it's even more so on the res where there's so little poverty and so much disagreement.

841
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,620
They play kickball and ow my balls.

842
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,700
Yeah.

843
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Yeah, there's, you know, that's the thing about Native Americans for a long time.

844
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
We certainly had a sense of humor.

845
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,300
So we can't discredit the perhaps without calling up some officer in the tribal law.

846
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,480
Government and saying, hey, look, what does it mean?

847
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,180
Would have to conjecture that it means someone has inflated their balls.

848
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,280
Well, are you making fun of me, Dave?

849
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,480
No, I was going to go on for another half hour.

850
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:43,380
The stupid we did actually go wandering around an abandoned Native American ancestral play blowing neighborhood.

851
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,560
The Bandelier National Monument.

852
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,220
I love that stuff so much.

853
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,080
And it's scary, too, to be walking among the ancestors, so to speak.

854
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,000
They're not my ancestors.

855
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,240
My ancestors were living in Scotland and throwing spears at this time.

856
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:07,760
These guys, these guys, the ancestral play blinds had some pretty cool places carved into rocks into the soft, tough.

857
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,440
That tough is not so tough.

858
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,460
But we did manage to get lost in the desert at night a couple of times.

859
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,880
We had the panic virus.

860
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,840
We had the virus in the toilet zone, you might say.

861
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,600
I was never so happy to see that sign that said restrooms after wandering around.

862
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,540
So we weren't in the part of Bandelier that is famous.

863
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,620
We were in an area that's lesser known that's actually outside the park.

864
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,280
And we met the range.

865
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,280
We got there late, kind of as the sun was starting to go down.

866
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,520
And there was a ranger leaving.

867
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,860
And we said, is this can we go in here this late?

868
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,960
And he goes, oh, yeah, yeah.

869
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,640
It's going to be a bright moon tonight.

870
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,540
You can't get lost.

871
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,040
Didn't know he was talking to subgeniuses.

872
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,480
Yeah, really.

873
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,000
He said, we want to arrest you for being in the park after dark and we don't lock up or anything.

874
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:05,000
And then we proceeded to climb for an hour through the half coolest place in the world.

875
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:11,600
That's the best time to try and go in a huge park is near twilight to climb the highest thing for, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

876
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,380
It really does.

877
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,840
Well, you know, it occurred to me that if, say, I was in a park, I was going to be in a park.

878
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:15,840


879
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:29,280
But if you say, dobs forbid, if the econocataclysm happened to come before X Day, some of us would be warlords, road warrior warlords, might want to take over the visitor centers at certain national monuments.

880
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,080
Because they're often very easily defended.

881
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,580
In some cases, they've been defended for thousands of years with only one road in.

882
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,400
So I've got dubs on Rock City in Chattanooga.

883
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,740
And I've got dibs on it.

884
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,580
Well, they say there's little condominiums in the park.

885
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,920
That's the difference between the Yankee and the Fort Worth boy.

886
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,540
I've got dibs.

887
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm going to throw milk dubs at them poe buckers down there.

888
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,060
I'm throwing milk dubs at them poe buckers.

889
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,220
I actually heard a kid say something like that.

890
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,580
Dubs versus dibs?

891
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,040
Yes.

892
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,080
Phyla, it reminds me of a, I could say this version of Phyla's quote.

893
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,440
People are the poe buckers of the world.

894
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,040
Oh.

895
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,480
And.

896
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:22,520
And Dave, you'll be glad to know that we took an average of 900 digital photos per day with our top number being almost 1400 the day we did Bryce Canyon.

897
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:32,080
And unfortunately, there were 900 people that you did not make sign release forms and are now going to sue you, especially people of three indigenous nations.

898
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,840
No, actually, we were very.

899
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,520
Oil companies.

900
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:43,720
I am not a person who takes pictures of Indians without asking them how much it's going to cost.

901
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:51,320
First, we thought you were one of those guys that got in the car and pulled up to the mall at four corners and just said, dance, dance, dance.

902
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,620
No, we follow the picture rolls.

903
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,360
Yeah, we follow the picture rolls.

904
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,620
No.

905
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,720
But see, Dave, the thing is, we don't just take pictures of the beautiful places of our nation.

906
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,440
We really like the messed up places, the kitschy and the quaint, the roadside bull dada.

907
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,700
And most of all, and these are the most common, the dilapidated streets.

908
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,900
The structures of rotting.

909
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,740
The decay of our American culture.

910
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,580
And you told me about this and I got mad.

911
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,400
You'd like to go by those old hay silos that look like they're 2000 years old and they are and they're falling down.

912
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:24,820
Yeah.

913
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,920
And like the abandoned gas stations, boarded up diners corner.

914
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
Yeah, we call them the lapos.

915
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,200
Yeah.

916
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,880
The lapos were the lapo photographers.

917
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,400
One of the look your house.

918
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,440
You should have gone in northern New Mexico, which serves delicious.

919
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,680
The lapos.

920
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,680
Yeah.

921
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,160
Yum, yum.

922
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,840
Delapos.

923
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,140
They're not Mexican style either.

924
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,980
A lot of people think there's that New Mexican cuisine is the same as Mexican.

925
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,820
And for you cuisine fanatics, I would beg to differ.

926
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,680
It has elements in common.

927
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,580
Both are products of Indian cultures and Spanish culture.

928
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,680
But New Mexico was not a part of Mexico.

929
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,900
It was part of New Spain, like California and Arizona, before it was seeded by both the Mexicans and the Americans.

930
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,920
A lot of people forget that Mexico is.

931
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,880
Also North America.

932
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,220
I know.

933
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,100
That's something people tend to think.

934
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,080
It's like, oh, wait for it.

935
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:20,840
Yeah, well.

936
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:21,640
Well, what can we do about it?

937
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,880
You know what's sad, Dave?

938
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:33,040
Among other things, when you avoid the interstates and just drive on back roads, you see a lot of those delapos in this once rich nation.

939
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,140
I know.

940
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:42,900
And another sad thing about this once freedom loving nation is that people are so much more polite to short haired men than long haired men.

941
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,600
And so much more cooperative.

942
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:52,160
And so much less likely to pull you over for tailgating and search your van and take away all your medical habifrop zipulops.

943
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:02,320
And because of that, Dave, we spent the entire two months in disguise as the dumb tourists, Mr.

944
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:02,900
And Mrs.

945
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,340
Smith from Ohio.

946
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,540
But you were really from Alpha Centauri, just like in the music.

947
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,000
Oh, no.

948
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,600
I'm really Reverend Stang, the cult leader from Dobstown.

949
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:12,880
But we're from the city.

950
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,600
And for two months I kept my long cult leader ponytail as thin and gray as it is.

951
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,060
I kept it tucked up inside a Greek fisherman's hat, even in San Francisco and Santa Fe.

952
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:32,240
But I did it there because I didn't want to be mistaken for those pompous, smug ponytail wearing old hippie blue hairs.

953
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:42,520
But you could have in an earlier day, you could have been mistaken for one of the swarthy fishermen who plied his trade up and down the coast from San Francisco to Santa Cruz.

954
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,240
Yeah, well, a Greek fisherman.

955
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:54,240
Selling large grouper and other cabadon-type fish with teeth that can actually rip off a human being's arm in less than 45 hours, given the right kind of incentive.

956
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,160
It's really a very dangerous world.

957
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,400
We had a dangerous moment.

958
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,380
It's a dangerous world, Dave.

959
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,940
It's a dangerous world.

960
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,400
It's a dangerous world.

961
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:06,980
For you.

962
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,220
For you.

963
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,700
And for the, for us.

964
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,500
We're driving a podcast.

965
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,200
Highway 1 in California, which goes right along the coast.

966
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:26,020
And we pulled over at an overlook at sunset just to look at the beautiful snorting and moving rocks.

967
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,540
And that's when we realized that those, they weren't rocks.

968
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,540
They were gigantic animals the size of dinosaurs called elephant seals.

969
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,320
And they glared at us with their baleful black eyes.

970
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,540
And then they honked and brayed.

971
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,500
As if to say, keep taking pictures, pink boy.

972
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,480
I could flop up there and crush you in a second.

973
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,360
I was paranoid about that the whole rest of the drive.

974
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,520
Up through these mountain roads, I was thinking, man, those elephant seals, they're going to jump up onto the road.

975
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,960
Only two, don't take one or two of them to completely stop the car.

976
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:09,560
Yes, he kept describing to me, it's going to be the attack of the killer elephant seals.

977
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,080
Wait, wait, you'll see.

978
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,620
They're going to be up here any minute now.

979
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,040
They're going to be all over our car.

980
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:14,600
You'll wait.

981
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,040
You'll see.

982
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:26,620
Well, you know, when you're driving through the desert at night, you got the risk of giant 50-foot women, giant aliens, giant tarantulas, even giant jackrabbits.

983
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:35,620
There's actually real terror things that can happen, like rocks can fall down on your head or you could fall off the side into the ocean.

984
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,680
You fall off the backside.

985
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,920
You can fall off the backside.

986
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:40,920


987
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,060
You can fall off the backside.

988
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,500
You can fall off the backside.

989
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:41,960
And you're going to be exhausted.

990
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,280
I remember being attacked when I lived out there by some seals.

991
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:57,780
But the weirdest thing was seeing a large whale decomposing on the beach where I used to go run when I pretended to use my body.

992
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,020
And they didn't know what to do with it.

993
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,700
And whale blubber is very stinky.

994
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,620
So I decided that I would perhaps make a cologne out of it.

995
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,840
Or I would bottle it or put it in jars and set it out on the window and let it distill in the sun.

996
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,080
You wouldn't be the first one.

997
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:22,540
But it wasn't until I realized that this oil, this whale oil that I've been making all this time, was starting to have strange properties.

998
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:29,600
Well, but you know, part of the whale's inner juices, the ambergris, is used in perfume.

999
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:30,520
Yes.

1000
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,000
Because it will hold a stink, I guess, or something.

1001
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,980
We saw strange creatures.

1002
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,820
We saw a lot of rocks and sand.

1003
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,480
We saw sticks.

1004
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:53,680
We looked at so many rocks and sticks that I caught Princess Wee's disease of seeing faces in every rock and every gnarly tumor on every tree.

1005
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,760
I did that out there, too.

1006
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,680
Especially in highlands and clouds and stuff, I would see plenty of faces.

1007
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,980
It's just such a grander scale of us Easterners who do not know.

1008
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,360
You know, Dave, I think your buzz has gone away.

1009
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,920
Oh, it went away a while ago.

1010
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,580
Yeah.

1011
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,160
I could have turned you up earlier.

1012
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,200
That buzz totally chilled.

1013
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:35,280
You know what the very best, the most greatest experience of the whole trip was for me, and this is going to sound corny to my subgenius friends, but it was making my little grandson laugh for hours on end by doing the same stupid thing over and over and over again.

1014
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,400
He's only two and a half.

1015
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,340
And they're on the thing.

1016
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:39,340


1017
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,580
They're in the same peer group.

1018
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:41,120
Yeah.

1019
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:47,680
And my grandson recognized that in his grandfather, and they had the best times.

1020
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,180
It was just...

1021
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,160
Being stupid.

1022
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,720
The best.

1023
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,100
Okay, so that's what you're talking about with the court order and stuff?

1024
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,280
Ha.

1025
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,640
Keeping it away.

1026
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,580
Actually, that's a different plan, and I don't want to talk about that on the radio.

1027
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,920
Away from my child.

1028
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:08,940
We have a plan to get the church back in the news again, but I don't want to blow it by killing it.

1029
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,060
He's just teasing me.

1030
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,600
He talks about that anyway.

1031
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:22,820
The worst experience we had was we were in the Flagstaff Motel, and I got online and became convinced that my business was destroyed.

1032
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:38,920
Subgenius.com, the subgenius website, was offline because our internet server company had just changed owners, and my email didn't work and nothing worked, and I thought, oh my God, we're going to have to move the whole 40,000 gigs to a new server while on the road.

1033
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,740
While missing orders and importing an email, and yet, you know what?

1034
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,120
You didn't care.

1035
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:52,040
I went into the Grand Canyon thinking that my business had been destroyed, and I didn't let it bother me a bit, and I'm real proud of that.

1036
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,340
I'm real proud of it, too.

1037
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:53,760
I'm just blown off.

1038
00:49:53,860 --> 00:50:02,080
I asked you at one previous time if you ever had a weird experience there, because I guess it's a weird place, but I had a weird experience there.

1039
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:08,900
My wife and child and I were walking there in the Grand Canyon, and a low buzzing hummingbird.

1040
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:08,900


1041
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:16,000
It was about waist high, and it kind of bended the air, and it was very, very frightening.

1042
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,580
I told other people of this, and they said, man, there's all kinds of spooky stuff going on there.

1043
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:27,400
Chaz told me a story, our friend who has gone to the Grand Canyon.

1044
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,360
He knows what all those buzzing weird shapes are now.

1045
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,620
Yes.

1046
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,040
He probably is one of them.

1047
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,420
Did you ever hear his story about now?

1048
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,740
He could have made it up because he was into that Carlos Castaneda stuff.

1049
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:38,900
Yeah.

1050
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,660
But Michelle corroborated it.

1051
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,680
Do you remember the story about the medicine man making noises all night?

1052
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,180
Did it take place in Arizona?

1053
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,620
In the Grand Canyon.

1054
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,160
What about a medicine man making noises?

1055
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,240
I've heard many.

1056
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,340
I'm afraid I've had to listen to medicine men make noises all night many times.

1057
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:08,520
See, that's unusual to us Easterners, also hearing people going, and stuff, and lighting fires and dancing around, especially if it's your neighbors, you know?

1058
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:20,320
I happen to have lived on an Indian reservation, and all of my neighbors were Native Americans, and two of them were famous fancy dancers' brothers, the Hermione Horses brothers.

1059
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,760
I remember that movie, too.

1060
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,620
Anyway, you know what turned out?

1061
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:35,620
The reason that I thought my business had been destroyed was only because the Subgenius website, subgenius.com, is banned from Super 8 Motel Wi-Fi.

1062
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,600
And rightfully so.

1063
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:49,320
It is a pornographic, lewd, and disturbingly, disgustingly strange, unusual, and eccentrically erratic, and yet nearly almost erotic experience to go to the site of the Church of the Subgenius.

1064
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,680
Subgenius.com?

1065
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:57,120
Subgenius, by the way, is not spelled with an O, but dot and com.

1066
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,660
O.

1067
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,820
And if you want to go there, remember, spell it T-H-E-I-R, just to irritate.

1068
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,340
Oh my gosh, we've only got five minutes.

1069
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,980
We've only got five minutes left to go.

1070
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,120
Drive 1.2 miles and turn evil.

1071
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,120
Drive 3.5 miles and turn into a bat.

1072
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,960
Turn left and turn invisible.

1073
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,640
Drive three miles and then turn gay.

1074
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,820
Turn right and then turn and run.

1075
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,640
Drive 1.8 miles and turn into Mr. Hyde.

1076
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,060
Drive 10 miles and turn inside out.

1077
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,240
Drive four miles and turn Republican.

1078
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:33,260
Turn left and turn right, then turn stupid, then turn left and turn right, then drive off the unfinished bridge and turn into a zombie.

1079
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,300
And turn, turn, turn.

1080
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,520
And turn the burgers.

1081
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,520
They're getting crisp on one side.

1082
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,420
Drive one mile and bear to the bone.

1083
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,780
And run over a bear.

1084
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,880
Turn cold against your enemies and your own friends.

1085
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,380
Drive 10,000 miles and turn around and go back and do nothing.

1086
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,700
Oh, that's what we're doing. We did do that.

1087
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:55,120
Mr. Sister loaned us his GPS and now we're hooked on GPS.

1088
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,400
I don't think I could drive to the post office without her.

1089
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:04,800
See, you've lost the Neanderthal skills of our ancestral peoples who knew all...

1090
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:13,700
Probably what the weather was going to be for the next six months just by going out and smelling a dainty fart and raising their finger in the air.

1091
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,360
And placing it first, of course, in their mucus-laden noses, which we have no more mucus.

1092
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,280
No more mucus!

1093
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,820
I could talk about boogers and butts, but I will refrain from that.

1094
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,060
Okay, all right. I know I've brought it to a lower plane.

1095
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,800
So I'll elevate my...

1096
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:44,200
I'll elevate once again by saying that we have lost those skills of the Iceman Mummy and those others who used to be able to do all kinds of stuff like be bot-fish.

1097
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,920
Drive with a map? You mean using a map to navigate?

1098
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:53,440
Well, actually, I had three maps, a AAA guidebook, and the GPS, but...

1099
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,160
Ugg and Ort did well with the maps.

1100
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,340
I want to mention...

1101
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:57,540
You named them?

1102
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,400
Dave, you'll be proud of us.

1103
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,780
Although Twilight Zone music is in the background, we're not going to be able to do that.

1104
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,560
We watched television instead of the Twilight Zone.

1105
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,440
And, uh...

1106
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,420
But we didn't see the news for a long time.

1107
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,900
Actually, I did read the news at one point and learned about a one-fingered dinosaur discovered in China.

1108
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,420
Mini black holes the size of an atomic nucleus that are theorized to exist.

1109
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:30,280
I learned that somebody had made a crop circle in an Indonesian rice paddy, which must have been a rather soggy crop circle.

1110
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,760
And I learned that only one finger of the rice paddy was in the crop circle.

1111
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:32,780
And that's why I'm so proud of you.

1112
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:38,000
And I learned that only one-fifth of American students have any real science education to speak of.

1113
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,940
But here's something good, though.

1114
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,160
I did learn this was also statistics in the news.

1115
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:50,420
Utah has the most pornography, which figures, since they're the most prudish, uptight...

1116
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,540
Right, it's a Mormon land, and they should have more to balance the Mormonism.

1117
00:54:54,620 --> 00:55:00,640
Ohio is the nerdiest state with the most nerds.

1118
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,520
California has the most air pollution.

1119
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,700
Texas has the fewest high school graduates per capita.

1120
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:11,180
Arizona has the worst alcoholism.

1121
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,600
Nevada has the worst crime, even though everything's legal there.

1122
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,600
New Mexico has the most antisocial people, and Arkansas has the lowest credit rating score in general.

1123
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,600
Wow.

1124
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,960
And while watching TV with my son,

1125
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,860
I watched the show Family Guy for the first time.

1126
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,420
I have yet to see it because it's still not subtitled.

1127
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,680
I watched a bunch of them.

1128
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,080
If you watch two or three with your son, it's actually funny.

1129
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:50,020
We saw a funny show called Tosh.0, which was snarky and we liked.

1130
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,880
But my favorite show of all, you know, I don't watch much TV,

1131
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,240
but I discovered this all-Spanish network called Telemundo.

1132
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,000
Mm-hmm.

1133
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:58,860
And they had a...

1134
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,120
dating and miniskirt contest on it that I think I'm going to watch all the time from now on.

1135
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,440
And my Spanish is starting to come back.

1136
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,880
We spent all that time in the Southwest, and, you know, everything's written in both languages.

1137
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,640
And my Espanol, it just started to regreso.

1138
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,520
Yeah.

1139
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:17,600
So...

1140
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,740
The 12 Hearts was his favorite show.

1141
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,580
Los 12 Corazones.

1142
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,080
Los 12.

1143
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,080
Oh, and one last thing.

1144
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,160
The very worst place we were at

1145
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,280
was the Whole Foods store in Santa Fe.

1146
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,920
And I just...

1147
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,260
I can't even...

1148
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,460
I felt so...

1149
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,060
I felt like a vampire must feel in a church.

1150
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,680
Well, that's how well we're doing about it.

1151
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,480
In the Santa Fe Whole Foods, the smugness and hipness level...

1152
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,440
You know, for a subgenius,

1153
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,420
ugh, it was just kind of hard to take.

1154
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,840
Princess Wee's much more tolerant of that sort of stuff.

1155
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,300
Anyway, it's almost time for us to...

1156
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,300
I mean, it really is about time to get off of this show,

1157
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,800
which is the Hour of Slack number 1,098.

1158
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,580
We're coming up near the show 13013.

1159
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,660
1998?

1160
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,080
Sort of. 1298.

1161
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,160
Wow!

1162
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,220
We're off a little bit.

1163
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,600
That's almost 13.

1164
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:15,800
We...

1165
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,880
Which is, in the Swiss alphabet, the number 13

1166
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,780
does mean procreation, high foreheads, and lack of bowel...

1167
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,280
Good point.

1168
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:26,640
...strawl.

1169
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,180
Well, I'm going to go now, I think.

1170
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,660
We're going to get off the air,

1171
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,660
and I think we'll go back in here puzzling evidence,

1172
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,180
and Dr. Hale will talk about the highway.

1173
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,440
I'm going to fade you out, Dave. Bye.

1174
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,440
Bye, Dave!

1175
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,820
It's been nice hearing about your adventure.

1176
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,700
He's fading out.

1177
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,400
It's been nice hearing you.

1178
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,180
Dave, fade yourself out this time.

1179
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:45,860
Okay.

1180
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,400
I'm...

1181
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,520
Oh, I forgot how to do that.

1182
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:49,780
That...

1183
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,400
Sorry.

1184
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,700
He's doing pretty good. That's pretty realistic.

1185
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,820
No, he's doing it. He's doing it.

1186
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,000
Almost out.

1187
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,360
Okay, that's... He's gone now.

1188
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,040
He's locked, he's dropped.

1189
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,100
No, not locked. I don't want him locked.

1190
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,460
I don't want him holed.

1191
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,120
I want him to drop.

1192
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:07,660
Drop and...

1193
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,660
Lock it and load.

1194
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,640
Play.

1195
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,760
Wake up and smell the coffee.

1196
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,860
Collar just fell asleep...

1197
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,040
...at the side of the freeway.

1198
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,340
Yes, I know, with the engine idling,

1199
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,660
flashers flashing,

1200
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,900
and those are the guys standing outside the coffee.

1201
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,320
No, but seriously,

1202
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,020
they're over there on the side of the road,

1203
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,640
on the soft shoulder,

1204
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,520
and pretty soon the highway patrol will be long to mop up

1205
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,420
and clean the highway for Jesus.

1206
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah, I think it's about time for us to

1207
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,040
think about packing up and heading out.

1208
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,300
You can fall off the back side!
