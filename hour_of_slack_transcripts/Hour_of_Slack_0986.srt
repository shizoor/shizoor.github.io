1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
If you have a medical condition that causes bleeding, you should use Gordon's Delicious Bite-Sized Corn Kids.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,120
Bite-sized pieces of kids. Resistible. Whether they're your kids or not.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,380
Additional rare but serious side effects could occur.

4
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,220
From PR News in Washington, I'm sobbing and pleading for help.

5
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,880
Thousands of Californians are being warned that Bob's may have stolen their bus service.

6
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,900
The state has a law to warn them when Bob's in Modesto.

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,980
Bob's bus service took effect today in Suburban.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
The governor has declared a state of emergency.

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,480
The Senate is expected to vote today to raise the fines for allowing PR News in Washington.

10
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,000
We have enough trouble with the younger generation today without having it encouraged by

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,860
The Subgenius Power of Swag.

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,740
There is nothing the matter with

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,240
The Subgenius Power of Swag

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,280
that I can see.

15
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Then perhaps you're Bob.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,240
Now wait a minute.

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,520
If that's the kind of entertainment you're planning to present, there will be no

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,800
Subgenius.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
Power of Swag.

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,040
Hey, let's stop at this ranch here.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,980
Looks like a pleasant place.

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,820
Maybe we can...

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,820
Just get out of here.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,280
I'm gonna piss.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,100
Ah.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,500
Look at this.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,020
Look at the...

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,180
There's some people riding out.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,860
A guy in his kid walking down the street here.

30
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
They're on horses.

31
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,540
I think it is the nearest sheriff.

32
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,780
Uh-oh.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,160
I don't like the way he's slapping that big club into the palm of his hand.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,560
There's some fish in there all.

35
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,880
I don't like that skinny little redneck that's got the giant gun.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm next to him.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,500
And the cattle prod in his other hand.

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,860
And that little boy wearing a clan button.

39
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,800
That guy's half fish.

40
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,240
He's got a noose with 13 knots in it.

41
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,960
I don't think us northern liberals should have come down to this little southern town, guys.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,900
And pee here.

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,620
It's too late now.

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,520
Show him no fear.

45
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,920
Well, I guess we're just gonna march right into that Mayberry lunch counter then, huh?

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,440
That's right.

47
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,320
Have some lube outside.

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,040
Just sit down and ask the beast.

49
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,140
Serve Lloyd.

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,060
Just like him, all the humans.

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,920
Now, men.

52
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,000
The first rule is...

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Obey the subgenius power of the sun.

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,260
Secondly, if you're wise, you'll begin rehabilitation.

55
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,700
Prohibition, yes or no, gid tenors, skillet lickers, 1930.

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,300
Say, fellas, see that fella coming down the road with that black coat on?

57
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,900
His name is Mr. Stadenko.

58
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,920
And Mr. Stadenko is a narcotics officer.

59
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,720
Well, he's the fella that made a speech last night at Hogwall on Prohibition.

60
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,660
Yeah, I guess he's coming over here to talk to us about all that...

61
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,620
Green, uh, leafy substance.

62
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,120
Let Mac talk to him.

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,780
He'll get him told.

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,100
How do you do, gentlemen?

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,200
How do you do, sir?

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,500
I heard your music and thought I'd come over and talk to you a while and possibly hear

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,820
some more music later on.

68
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,620
All right, one, two, three, four, hit it.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,880
It's my intention to make a talk on Prohibition and the evils of...

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,420
Marijuana.

71
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,780
...at the town hall tonight.

72
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Well, when we first see you coming up the road up the aisle, why, we had you figured

73
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,620
out to be a...

74
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,600
Narcotics officer.

75
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,760
...from your looks.

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,160
I guess you've noticed in the papers that the wet party is trying to bring back...

77
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,900
Pot, that's right.

78
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,440
...joint.

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,280
Uh, joint.

80
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Reefer, man.

81
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,600
Uh, uh, yes, reefer.

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
Well, if it's ever been gone anywhere, I'd love to know where it's been.

83
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,360
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,100
My God.

85
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,400
Why, we've had Prohibition for the last 50 years.

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,400


87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,820
Well, we ain't never heard nothing about it up here on this mountain.

88
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,180
We've been making and selling...

89
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,340
Lebanese blonde hash.

90
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,320
...for the last 60 years.

91
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,040
I can tell right now that you're not a Prohibitionist.

92
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,580
A what?

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,120
A Prohibitionist.

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,340
Are there any Prohibitionists in this part of the country?

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,420
Dave's not here.

96
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,680
I see you don't know what Prohibition means.

97
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
No, never heard tell of it.

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,820
Prohibition was a law that was passed for the good of mankind, restricting the making

99
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,380
or selling of...

100
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


101
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


102
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


103
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


104
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


105
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


106
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


107
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


108
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


109
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,380


110
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,500
...of any kind of...

111
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,420
Talk about gold.

112
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,400
No, it's Michoacan, man.

113
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,040
Michoacan.

114
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,580
Homegrown.

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,540
Yes, you slick British politicians is always getting up some kind of new fangle to make

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,560
life more miserable than what it is.

117
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,460
Oh, man.

118
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,860
And you call that Prohibition law a thing for the good of mankind, just taking all

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,980
his privileges away.

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,780
I don't call that very good.

121
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
Well, I don't know about that.

122
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,220
Well, I know one thing.

123
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,200
It's you're talking too much anyhow, and you ain't been invited.

124
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,360
Well, I don't know about that.

125
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,360


126
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,500
I know you're talking too much anyhow, and you ain't been invited.

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,680
Well, I know you're talking too much anyhow, and you ain't been invited up here, and furthermore

128
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,920
you're butting into the music, so boys, come on and play us another little tune now.

129
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,180
Don't bogart that joint.

130
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,000
Hi, brother.

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
You know the name of that star tune the boys is a-fiddlin'?

132
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,160
I don't believe I do.

133
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,580
Oh, that's the new National Anthem.

134
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,480
That's the new National Anthem.

135
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,660
Oh, that's the new National Anthem.

136
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,100
Oh, that's the new National Anthem.

137
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,340
Oh, that's the new National Anthem.

138
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,200
Hey, this is great, man.

139
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:30,820
Hey, this is great, man.

140
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,520
Well, gentlemen, the amendment says that anyone that violates this law is a criminal and subject

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,180
to punishment and imprisonment.

142
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,100
Officer O'Malley, the FBI, you're busted.

143
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,480
Well, what's the biggest jail in the United States?

144
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
Sing Sing prison.

145
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,160
Well, is it big enough to hold everybody in the United States?

146
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,580
Why, certainly not.

147
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,080
Well, they better start billing them one that will if they expect to enforce that law.

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Oh, I don't think everyone violates the prohibition law.

149
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,320


150
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,340
Maybe not, but everyone on this mountain has for the last 60 years.

151
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,860
Hey, well, let's get stoned, huh?

152
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:05,940
Here we go.

153
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,400
There's no use talking, brother.

154
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,780
You can't prohibit nothing.

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,860
I'll have to bid you gentlemen goodbye.

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,520
I hardly think it would be worthwhile to make a talk on temperance in this neighborhood.

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,840
Hey, man, I gotta hang up.

158
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,580
There's someone pounding at the door.

159
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,520
Oh, there's a boy in a split-two, man.

160
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,420
Hey, hey, hey.

161
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,640
Hey, hey, hey.

162
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:26,980
Hey, hey, hey.

163
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,620
Hey, hey, hey.

164
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:27,620


165
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:27,960
Hey, hey, hey.

166
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,300
Hey, hey, hey.

167
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,300


168
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,300


169
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,300


170
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,300


171
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,300


172
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Well, I guess we read him a page out of the right book that time, boys.

173
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,660
And our first contestant today on Let's Make a Dope Deal is former head of the philosophy

174
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,040
department at Harvard University.

175
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,640
He is the holder of a Ph.D., an M.A., a B.A., and is a BMF besides.

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,380
Would you please give a big warm welcome for Bob.

177
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,520
Bob.

178
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,580
What a happy sound.

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,360
Bob.

180
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
It's the happiest sound I've found.

181
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,180
You may clap, rap, clap, slap, but Bob makes the world go round.

182
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm bringing you a shoe rack.

183
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


184
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


185
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


186
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


187
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


188
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


189
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,280


190
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,140
Yes, dear friends, that was Reverend Shane Smirker did that very last little bit.

191
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,260
But before that, the Cheech and Chong prohibition business was by a new contributor,

192
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,120
Reverend Sud Sana of the Chinese Liberation Clanch, something like that.

193
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,640
I can barely remember anything, friends.

194
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,700
And yet it's the amino acids in the background right now.

195
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:32,660
And now we're going to go back in time to a little bit of DeVival and Winterstar of 2003,

196
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,100
where we were talking about the subject of tonight's show.

197
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,000
And after that, we'll go back even further in time to Media Barrage number three,

198
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,180
the classic subgenius album on the subject of sex, sickness, and slack.

199
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,220
See, this was all a very sudden thing.

200
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,560
This LSD.

201
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,380
Every history guy was going to be here.

202
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
But believe it or not, somebody who writes books about LSD flaked out.

203
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,100
Didn't make it.

204
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
I could tell you all kinds of history of LSD,

205
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,020
except that I can't remember any of my personal history of LSD,

206
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,060
except in the most theoretical way.

207
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,500
Yeah, I remember I was with these guys and we did that and we went to a concert,

208
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,620
but that's not anything that I remember.

209
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,620
I remember all these other things that you can't even say.

210
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,560
Ex-Child Star Sally LeRoy, 24, vegetarian, mystic, acid head.

211
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Mystic kid's head while he vomits and wretches sitting on a curbstone at 4 o'clock in the morning.

212
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,960
And when his knees get enough starch back in him so he can stand up and empty his pockets,

213
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,240
you can bet he'll turn out a stick or two of marijuana.

214
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,680
And you can double your stash.

215
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,800
And with all your money, he'll be holding a sugar cube or a cap or two.

216
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,840
So don't you con me with your mind expansion, slop.

217
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,120
I deal with kids every day.

218
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,940
I try to clean up the mess that people like you make out of them.

219
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm the expert here. You're not.

220
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Really?

221
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,020
When's the last time you were asked to appear on television?

222
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,580
I am the new way to go, the way of the future.

223
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,840
I can't begin to fill all my personal appearance requests.

224
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,140
I'm not just news, my friend. I make news. Big news.

225
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,340
So did Judas.

226
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,180
The way of the future.

227
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,600
The way of the future.

228
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,060
The way of the future.

229
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,620
The way of the future.

230
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
The way of the future.

231
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,060
You know what God says the end result of vile affections is?

232
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,580
He says you're going to become so perverted in your lifestyle, hear me.

233
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,680
You're not simply going to smoke cigarettes and inject needles into your collapsing veins.

234
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,380
You're not simply going to guzzle down alcohol.

235
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,160
But you're going to be so depraved that your women are going to begin to make wimps.

236
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,020
And your men are going to begin to make love to men.

237
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,040
I'm just not a coffee lover.

238
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,140
I think what makes folk get needy and need to be taught about coffee is because some people drink it religiously.

239
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,140
They have to have it.

240
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
They can't make it without it.

241
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,940
They build their life around coffee.

242
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,320
Like a drug addict does.

243
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,860
And some folk build their life around RC.

244
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,100
And some folk build their life around RC.

245
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,200
I said get on with the floor, get on with the floor, boy.

246
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,120
People are going to think, yes they're going to think.

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,980
People are going to, people are going to think you're spas.

248
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,180
I remember the first spike that I sank in my vein.

249
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,100
The warmth my body felt.

250
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,100
The peace in my brain.

251
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,360
But then it took two dollars a day to get me high.

252
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,860
But my habit increased.

253
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,580
So sick I could cry.

254
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,860
Nights I prowled the streets with one thought in my head.

255
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,360
Just to get money for my fix.

256
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,660
And then return to bed.

257
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
It started me on my road to crime.

258
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,020
Caused my loved one sorrow.

259
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,820
He's so great, let him prove it.

260
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,020
You know, it was...

261
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,300
If you hold your next question just a moment.

262
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,600
We'll come right back, ladies and gentlemen, to Mr. Lynch and Mr. Greenwood.

263
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,500
After these words from our sponsor.

264
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't mean to interrupt.

265
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,700
I mean, I...

266
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:35,140
I'd like to mention that some of you young people might be especially interested in our novel and quaint gourmet's drug culture here in the future.

267
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,960
First off, you can try our atomic dirt.

268
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,340
It's very organic.

269
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,020
Some of our more rowdy and dissatisfied teens will inject only once, of course, pure cancer for that indescribable three-week death rush.

270
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,220
We have a disease called communicable stupor, or the drug bug.

271
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,440
A contagious hallucinogenic state which passes swiftly from one person to another and makes them happy.

272
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
Whether they want to be or not.

273
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,340
Always a thriller when unexpected.

274
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,920
Wow, wow, wow.

275
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,420
Now, brains, come and have a cup of coffee.

276
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,000
Damn good coffee.

277
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,220
And hot.

278
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,320
Mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain.

279
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,780
Oh, well, any decent blend of scotch will do that.

280
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

281
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

282
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes. Yes.

283
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,300
Ah, yes, his head's been ripped off.

284
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,160
I'll get you another.

285
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,740
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines.

286
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,220
By Sco Auslander.

287
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,460
From PR News in Washington, I'm criticized for criminal activity carried out by PR News in Indian-administered Kashmir.

288
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,440
For PR News, I'm flattened by helicopters and planes

289
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,880
because several hills still had heavy freezing Sreenagar in New Delhi.

290
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,740
Simply dicks on the table.

291
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,240
Bob now has the right to remove a feeding tube from brain-damaged PR News in Washington.

292
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,660
Drugs don't blow minds.

293
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,400
People blow minds.

294
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,920
Drugs don't even have minds.

295
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,120
They don't have nervous systems.

296
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,480
They don't have lungs and hearts that'll stop from doing too much central nervous system depressants.

297
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,240
They're like guns.

298
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,960
They're just inert, cool things.

299
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,860
And how you use them is up to you.

300
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,800
Unfortunately, it's also up to the cops.

301
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,220
That's a little rough.

302
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,740
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears of the liberals and the modernists.

303
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,140
So they soften it down, you see.

304
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,320
And of course, they would read that verse,

305
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,400
Let God be true in every man.

306
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,700
Be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance in my opinion, they'd say.

307
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,220
Ha, ha, ha.

308
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,040
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

309
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,820
Yeah.

310
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
But the Bible says,

311
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,140
Let God be true and let every man be a liar.

312
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,020
Oh, let Bob be true and every man be pea-shy, friends.

313
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,840
There's some Media Barrage number three there, our new old subgenius album.

314
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,460
But now, friends, I'm going to play some more Tom and Joe.

315
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,660
This particular song by Tom and Joe, which is coming up,

316
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,480
is about...

317
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,660
Lettuce Opium.

318
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,260
That standby of head shops in the 70s.

319
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,760
They actually used to sell something called lettuce opium

320
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,940
that was supposed to get you high.

321
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,980
It was supposedly made from lettuce and it was this black tarry stuff.

322
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,720
And if you smoked enough of it...

323
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,940
Well, anyway, this song is truly pure, my friends.

324
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,140
Pure 1967 yellow barrel sunshine.

325
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,320
And it's a smart oneself,

326
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:58,720
Jeremy B.

327
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,720


328
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:58,860
and he knows all sorts of literature.

329
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:07,280
The ine uniquipe number...

330
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,820
What is over here?

331
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,460
R license of the library's...

332
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,440
It comes from a plant

333
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,540
Normally thought of as friendly

334
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,160
But it's not friendly

335
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,760
And that's no lie

336
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,340
Those nasty fixings

337
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,880
Solid fixings bring you down

338
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,460
Spin you around

339
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,940
And make you hide

340
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,000
Walking in the light

341
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,740
Stepping on a ride

342
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,160
And I'm in

343
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,640
And now let us say

344
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,500
Let us pray

345
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,480
For our souls

346
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,060
Let us pray

347
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,240
Beyond Scott Me

348
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,620
Out of control

349
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,380
I am vegetable guy

350
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm not a plant

351
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,520
I'm not a plant

352
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,260
I'm not a plant

353
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,580
I'm not a plant

354
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,220
I'm not a plant

355
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,460
I'm not a plant

356
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,180
It comes from a plant

357
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,260
Normally thought of as friendly

358
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,320
But it's not friendly

359
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,860
But it's not friendly

360
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,700
And that's not mine

361
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,100
Those nasty fixings

362
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,760
Saddy fixings

363
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,380
Bring you down

364
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,260
Spill you around

365
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,540
And make you high

366
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,340
Ask the railroad man

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,260
They'll toss up your brain

368
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,580
But stay in the light

369
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,340
They'll eat your mind alive

370
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,480
And now let us say

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,320
Let us say

372
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,320


373
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,220
Let us pray

374
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,160
For our souls

375
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,640
Let us hope

376
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,820
We've got me

377
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,120
Out of control

378
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:42,320
Out of control

379
00:19:50,420 --> 00:20:12,320
Out of control

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:42,320
Out of control

381
00:20:52,840 --> 00:21:12,320
Out of control

382
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,020
Out of control

383
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


384
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


385
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


386
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


387
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


388
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


389
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,020


390
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,300
Why did the music just stop?

391
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,920
I mean it just completely quit.

392
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,980
And that was Tom and Joe.

393
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,960
The amazing Tom and Joe

394
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,640
with their song Lettuce Opium.

395
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,260
You can get more information about Tom and Joe

396
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,000
only by emailing Tom or Joe

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,500
at this email address.

398
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,320
Bdeberculo

399
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:45,940
That's B-D-E-B-O-R-C-U-L-O

400
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,260
Bdeberculo at Yahoo.com

401
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,240
And now friends back to

402
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,420
the old subgenius truth

403
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,560
in the album Media Barrage

404
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,320
number three

405
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
Sex, Sickness and Slap.

406
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,560
People have took uppers and downers

407
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,780
and rollers and

408
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,260
and every kind of a pill

409
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,280
and every kind of a drink

410
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,360
and these fellas go out

411
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,460
and turn these bottles up.

412
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,040
You know what?

413
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,480
What they're doing?

414
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,640
They're looking for something

415
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,400
that'll make them have a high feeling.

416
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,140
Oh, I want you to know

417
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,920
you talk about a high feeling.

418
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,540
I've been high on Jesus for 39 years.

419
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,040
Hallelujah.

420
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,500
Glory to God.

421
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,740
And I'm getting higher and higher all the time.

422
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,120
And one thing about this high that I'm got

423
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,280
I hope it don't give me no illusions.

424
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,220
Amen.

425
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,040
The high that I get on is a reality.

426
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,940
Everything that I see is real.

427
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,860
That's reading the fly team.

428
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,120
Now you need to make up in your mind.

429
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,960
What are you doing?

430
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,360
What's up?

431
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,800
You're in for a shot.

432
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,420
Yes.

433
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,700
Go to some of the schools here in Irving

434
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,980
and watch the kids take out their little vials of liquor

435
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,320
and put it in their orange juice.

436
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,720
Or go to some of the classrooms that

437
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,440
one young lady told me

438
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,260
that the marijuana that they smoke right in the classroom

439
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,560
is so strong it makes her sick.

440
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,260
What do you think about that, friends?

441
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,000
You want to do something about it?

442
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,460
Someone said to Barry McGuire

443
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,700
that all you Christians,

444
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,660
you're all the same.

445
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,380
You've all been brainwashed.

446
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,700
And Barry thought for a moment.

447
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,320
He said, yes, that's true.

448
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,280
But you sinners have been brainwashed also.

449
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,700
The only difference between you sinners

450
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,800
and us Christians is that

451
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,120
us Christians, we have chosen

452
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,680
to wash our brains.

453
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,800
The current Love Burger situation

454
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,120
is getting out of hand.

455
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,340
Praise God.

456
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,260
Praise God.

457
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,940
Praise God.

458
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,260
Yeah.

459
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:38,760


460
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,140
And that's a cat it is my the cat.

461
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,900
You're in the disproportionately

462
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,160
vulnerable body because the vegetables

463
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,160


464
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,160


465
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,160


466
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,160


467
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,100
Are you, are you?

468
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,500
Am I her?

469
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:57,620
No, I am not her?

470
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Oh, a cold.

471
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,040
I like Captain Drummond.

472
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,320
Bob, give me more pills, Bob.

473
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,060
Bob, give me more pills, please.

474
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,920
If you could just send three more of those pills, I'd feel a whole lot better.

475
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,520
I just took the last one, Bob.

476
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,080
The last pill.

477
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,100
I'll need some more for the next year.

478
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,360
Drink, Bob.

479
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,940
Drink, Bob.

480
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,120
Dr. Bob.

481
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,700
Dr. Bob.

482
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,120
Dr. Bob.

483
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,820
Dr. Bob.

484
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,380
Dr. Bob.

485
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:03,000
Dr. Bob.

486
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,960
Doctors for Bob!

487
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,640
Doctors! Doctors for Bob!

488
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,500
Bob! Bob!

489
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,140
Alright, listen.

490
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,420
All that

491
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,900
Moriah jump in the fire

492
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,940
Fire too hot, jump in the pot

493
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,980
Pot too black, jump in the crack

494
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,040
Crack too high, jump in the sky

495
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,980
Sky too blue, jump in canoe

496
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,260
Canoe too shallow, jump in the tallow

497
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,220
Tallow too soft, jump in the loft

498
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,200
Loft too rotten, jump in the cotton

499
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,100
Cotton so white she stay there all night

500
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,700
And you ain't heard the last

501
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,680
Ernest Teeter.

502
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,440
Y'all need to send us some drugs real fast.

503
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,760
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, now let's talk to him.

504
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,520
Come on, Bob!

505
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,560
Send drugs.

506
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Bob, we're trying to teach you.

507
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,340
If you're for real, show us some stuff.

508
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,340
Show us amphetamines.

509
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,780
Send 3-7-14

510
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,460
Cut us some amphetamine slack, man.

511
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
We need to get out of here.

512
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,920
I want some nice turkey crack.

513
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,980
Really? Okay.

514
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,520
Hash, opium, amphetamines.

515
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,020
Whoa, Bob, why don't you come through for us?

516
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,620
Heroin, heroin, heroin.

517
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,960
If you listen, Bob, now's your chance.

518
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,520
Send us drugs.

519
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,300
Send us drugs.

520
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,520
We're depending on you.

521
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,160
LSD.

522
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,340
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher

523
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,720
in Dallas, Texas.

524
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,640
And he's a good man,

525
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,580
except that he don't buy me two glasses

526
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,080
of Fletcher's beer.

527
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,460
And I said,

528
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,380
I love you, boy.

529
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,980
And I'm gonna tell you, if I can't whoop him,

530
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,780
I'll go down.

531
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,540
All right, friend!

532
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
He's going down!

533
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

534
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,200
Yeah, this is

535
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,160
miracle wisdom coming through from all over.

536
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,280
We want

537
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,540
people to know that the patriotic

538
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,860
subgenius church has no

539
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,300
age barriers and no limits.

540
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
We've saved many

541
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,080
friends that were in the bondage of

542
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,460
alcoholism and

543
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,440
drug abuse and homosexuality

544
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,680
and lesbianism. Yes, we've taken them in

545
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,520
and now they're making more money than

546
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
ever at it! God will not put

547
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,720
up with it forever. No.

548
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
No, he'll do something about it.

549
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,580
And dear child of his, if you're

550
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,680
living in a home where there's

551
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,440
sin, where there's cursing,

552
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,820
where there's swearing, where there's

553
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,780
alcohol, being drunk,

554
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,260
and where there's drunkenness,

555
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,680
where there's all sorts of

556
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,520
wickedness, God

557
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,400
will help you. God

558
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,560
will help you. If

559
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
God has to, he'll smite the

560
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,360
cheekbone, he'll break the teeth

561
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
of those that are coming against

562
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,680
you. And the ones who

563
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,700
escape from your assembly line, the rare ones,

564
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,360
you call them delinquents,

565
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,820
weirdos, hippies, pill heads, freaks, pot heads.

566
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,480
You tell them they're sick,

567
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,680
they know better.

568
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,540
Behave yourself, cause

569
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,480
the Lord's looking and booking. But

570
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
the Holy Ghost is God

571
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,320
authorized detective

572
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,780
agency. The Holy Ghost

573
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,380
is God's high sheriff

574
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,440
that has come to restore

575
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
and get back for you,

576
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,080
bring back to you

577
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
those things that the devil

578
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,400
has stolen.

579
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,500
Freeze! Alright, hold it right there. You're under

580
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,600
arrest. Okay, spread them. Get your hands up there.

581
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,440
Okay, now you. Uh, yeah, he'll be in town.

582
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,320
He'll be back. You have the right to remain

held against you and probably will. You have the right

587
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,720

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,700

pizza. You have a right to wear checks with

595
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,360
is posted you may waive this right.

596
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,520
You have a right to wave and whistle at police

597
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,660

permitting. You have a right to exercise

with safflower oil mayonnaise and a glass

601
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,520

602
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,600

bankable property. If you have no

607
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,580

608
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,680
provided. You have a right to a selection of

You have a right to an after-dinner mint. If

614
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,600

a milkshake, a milkshake will be provided by

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,220
the court. All right, take him away.

620
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,780
Yeah!

621
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,740
Okay.

622
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,440
And that was Dr. Howell, my friends.

623
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,160
The good Dr. Howell on KPFA with puzzling evidence

624
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,440
in the olden days. And thanks to Phineas Narco

625
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,960
for preserving those particular cuts. And now

626
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,900
back to Media Barrage 3.

627
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,680
I'll never forget when I was young, I was

628
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,640
25 and a male hustler. I remember being beaten

629
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,840
up by this entire fleet of Marines. They just tossed

630
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,980
me like an old volleyball over the net, back and

631
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,020
forth, back and forth. So my body was bleeding,

632
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,740
bleeding, but I had come 87 times in five passes

633
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,400
over the net.

634
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,760
Pretty good indication of all the wonderful

635
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,940
people that are out there. Wow, look at that.

636
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,320
That's amazing. And it's a pleasant ending to

637
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,360
kind of a sad situation. It certainly is.

638
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,400
One of those endings that we look for but so

639
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,680
rarely find in this business. That's right.

640
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,740
And the dance of the

641
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,520
creep's widow.

642
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,400
That was a bitch over in the corner

643
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,140
fucking herself with a cane.

644
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,180
When the bitch started to get the feeling,

645
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,220
down from the ceiling,

646
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,960
fell the hunchback

647
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,100
of Notre Dame.

648
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,440
The father had prayed for every lunch man and woman

649
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,460
bar girl right now.

650
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,620
He looked like a bad hurl.

651
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,280
Oh, yeah.

652
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,440
You luscious monkey woman, you.

653
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,180
Oh, yeah.

654
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,400
Oh, yeah.

655
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:38,960
Oh, yeah.

656
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,720
Take this banana.

657
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,320
But Dr. Drummond, but Dr. Drummond,

658
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,420
we can't fuck them.

659
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,820
We're reverence. We're ministers.

660
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,600
That's right, sir. The church of the subgenius.

661
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,920
We are holiness. We must abstain.

662
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,980
And you know what they really want?

663
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,280
They want Bob to fuck them.

664
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,860
That's right. But God,

665
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,160
if they only knew. The burning hot

666
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,920
steel tool of

667
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,300
Bob.

668
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,740
What kind of woman could take him?

669
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,220
Well, he's got one in every state.

670
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,220
Where did she live?

671
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,440
He finds them. They must be the...

672
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,240
I mean, they must be mutant women,

673
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,020
you know, to be able to handle them.

674
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,260
They've had transplants.

675
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,740
Over women.

676
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
Over womb men.

677
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,800
Steel sleeve put up there.

678
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,200
Dr. Robert Bob.

679
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,280
Dr. Robert Bob.

680
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,760
And I was so excited.

681
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,620
And I was so turned on.

682
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,820
I just wanted to find out where the devil was.

683
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,000
I wanted to go beat him.

684
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,380
Go get him and just beat him up.

685
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,760
I mean, I was just...

686
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,440
Oh, I just wanted to preach so bad.

687
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,100
And I preached all the way home in the car.

688
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,000
And I said, devil, wherever you're at,

689
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,740
you just put my name down.

690
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,960
Because I want to be one of your top candidates.

691
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,980
Because I'm going to do more to hurt you

692
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,780
than you can ever dream of.

693
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,300
And I say I was turned on.

694
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,940
And I went in and I stopped at this grocery store

695
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,680
and I went in there.

696
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,180
And I got my cheese and I got my bologna

697
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,840
and I got my beer bottles and your wine and everything.

698
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,920
And then I looked behind the cash register.

699
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,740
And it was just

700
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,540
row after row after row of filthy magazines.

701
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,400
And something came all over me.

702
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,620
And something came all over me.

703
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,400
I know what it was. It was the Holy Ghost.

704
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,260
The Holy Ghost came on me when I looked in the magazine.

705
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:24,280
The Holy Ghost came on me when I looked in the magazine.

706
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,200
And I said, Alex, it just makes me sick.

707
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,640
Think evil.

708
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,860
Do evil.

709
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,100
Be evil.

710
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,800
The end of evil will carry you

711
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,840
to the shores of paradise.

712
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
That's evil in a lot.

713
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,520
I'm going to be preaching to you preachers.

714
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,980
What do we know about the beyond?

715
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,520
Do we know what's behind the beyond?

716
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,440
The pastor got this Adam

717
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,440


718
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm afraid some of us hardly know what's beyond behind me.

719
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,200
Don't you all get mad at me now.

720
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,720
Everybody knows we come here every year

721
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,600
so they put a program on in the church

722
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,260
to tie you up.

723
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,280
Eleven.

724
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,520
Two.

725
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,060
Three.

726
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,620
Four.

727
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,840
Five.

728
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:07,880
Six.

729
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:08,760
Seven.

730
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,400
Eight.

731
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,400
Nine.

732
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,180
Ten.

733
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,440
Eleven.

734
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,020
Twelve.

735
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,900
Thirteen.

736
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,160
Fifteen.

737
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:33,160


738
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,400
Twelve.

739
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,240
Rajah.

740
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:46,400
Nine.

741
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:46,440
Ten.

742
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,260
Eleven.

743
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:47,760
Twelve.

744
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,040
Nin.

745
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,480
Twenty.

746
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,820
Thirteen.

747
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,500
Twelve.

748
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,680
Fifteen.

749
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,140
Fifteen.

750
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,140


751
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,140


752
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,780
Christ. We're going to see literally millions of Christians. They're going to march through the

753
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,320
streets. We're going to preach on the television, on the radio. We're going to start controlling

754
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,320
society because we're tired of being pushed around. And I'm tired of the devil lying and

755
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:23,040
stealing and cheating people's lives. And the only truth is our Lord Jesus Christ. And we are not

756
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,460
going to hide. We are not going to be intimidated. We are not going to be pushed around, but we're

757
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,840
going to stand up for righteousness and stand up for godliness. To make these Christians into a

758
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,980
political force. They don't want us involved. Let's tell them we're not listening to them anymore.

759
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:49,760
We're going to be involved. If you think our solution is political, you too have been deceived.

760
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:57,440
Don't you commit yourself to some political party or politician. You commit yourself to

761
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:57,440


762
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:04,760
the principles of God and demand those parties and politicians align themselves with the eternal

763
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,100
values in this book. And America will be forever the greatest nation on this earth.

764
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:16,060
It isn't going to take Ronald Reagan three years to learn about the godless aggressive nature of

765
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:23,320
communism. Over the last two or three decades, the federal government seems to have forgotten

766
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,260
both that old time religion and that

767
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:27,440
old time religion.

768
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,380
The old time constitution.

769
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:57,340
I suggest to you, friend, it's time for a change. Will this patriotic Christian zeal carry over into

770
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,340
political action?

771
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:14,100
Someone to blame us. Someone to follow. Someone to shame us. Someone to follow. Someone to rule us. Someone to not be.

772
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,120
Won't you be brother? Be brother.

773
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,860
Be brother.

774
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,720
Be brother.

775
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,320
Bob says you'd say to know what you're worth.

776
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,060
Really, thank you.

777
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:36,720
I believe that God can put you in the right place at the right time to hear exactly what you need to hear.

778
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,020
So, if you would, send us your dollar.

779
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,180
Send your money in on the double. Don't worry, it's a doctor.

780
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:53,680
Well, people, you can get yourself in work and just double. Put your hand, put your hand on the radio.

781
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,200
People today, they have jungle.

782
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,620
Music.

783
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,240
Over the radio, they twist their body like in some kind of sex act.

784
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,800
You say, well, that's plain.

785
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,860
But that's no plain what you see on your television every day.

786
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,400
And that educates the young people.

787
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,920
And they have this jungle, perverse music.

788
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,700
This music that's perverted.

789
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,860
I believe all music should belong to the Lord.

790
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,360
But the music they have on these records that you buy down at the record store,

791
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,320
they're made by devil worshipers.

792
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:33,020
You can take those records and run them backwards, and you can hear Satan talking on there.

793
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:45,660
Now, the electric prunes for Fox, bringing you the exciting new sound of the Fox Wawa pedal.

794
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,720
Let the electric prunes demonstrate the difference.

795
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,840
Play it prunes first without the Wawa pedal.

796
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,040
Now, listen to the difference when you push that Fox Wawa pedal down.

797
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,500
You can even make your guitar sound like a centaur.

798
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,660
And it's pretty spectacular stuff that we're putting out here, really.

799
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:20,540
So, Bob is the one that will give us the inside information that the aliens are coming, be in position to power, and all this.

800
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,100
Bob can...

801
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,920
Can make you survive the coming econocataclysms.

802
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Now, a lot of people do not realize how many people involved in the rock and roll conspiracy are also involved in your church.

803
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,500
And one of them I've heard rumors about was Graham Parker, that he was.

804
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,600
That's right. Graham Parker is real big.

805
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,440
He's been ordering much more literature from England than we've ever gotten a request for before.

806
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,680
And he's been distributing it.

807
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,820
He's one of our biggest...

808
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
One of our biggest exponents right now.

809
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,880
Devo, on the other hand, is vehemently anti-subgenius.

810
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,860
Those guys feel that we're moving in on their act.

811
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,300
That's right.

812
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:07,160
We're stealing their fans because they're just entertainers, whereas what we're doling out is true cosmic wisdom.

813
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:15,660
They stumbled across some little bit of information, and they haven't proceeded to completely delve into it yet.

814
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,880
But I think that's why they feel an infringement.

815
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,260
It's the now sound. It's what's happening.

816
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:21,980
That's why.

817
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,820
The Electric Prunes.

818
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,180
Animals.

819
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:23,880
Hermans.

820
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,200
Hermans.

821
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,160
Paul Revere and the Raiders.

822
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:25,620
Stones.

823
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,240
The Seeds.

824
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,180
Are all using the Vox Wawa pedal, and it works with any amplifier.

825
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,080
He's a liar.

826
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,580
The demon is a liar.

827
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,460
He would like to confuse us.

828
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:49,300
I have a feeling that friends, but the rock and roll bands, the young people listen to, we've had testimonial letters from people who were once demon possessed.

829
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,220
The lead singer for Kiss.

830
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,020
Or...

831
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,540
Or...

832
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:52,820
Or...

833
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:52,820


834
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
The ACDC band.

835
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,000
Mick Jagger.

836
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,040
That's who he is.

837
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:56,520
Mick Jagger.

838
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
He wrote us, and he said...

839
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,940
He said, what so many say.

840
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,820
So many in prison.

841
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,340
So many lost individuals everywhere.

842
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,820
He said, I was in the power of...

843
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,300
Of what can I call it but them, is the way he put it.

844
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,660
Them.

845
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,680
He didn't care whether it was the green energy demons from the fourth dimension, the UFO people, the men in black, the CIA.

846
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,040
He didn't care who it was.

847
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,740
He had been on the road for 18 years straight.

848
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,380
Around the corner, he started to record.

849
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,740
So they wanted to Millionaires.

850
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,500
He was taking me on.

851
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:45,000
He had so many

852
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,740
million dollars.

853
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,400
this to him he'd he'd he'd learn about it he'd read about it but it you know it never was it

854
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,360
never was real until they learned what the the power the power that could do for him and he'd

855
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,040
try out all the the drugs and the demonic sex music they'd do and the young tiny girls and

856
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,120
fat boys that they'd find out in the special markets and and the young uh the young people

857
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:21,320

00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,080
became intelligent from

903
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,920
being such mean badasses

904
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,840
that they cracked open the skulls of their

905
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,040
dumber fellows and ate their brains.

906
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,940
Terence McKenna teaches us,

907
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,980
no, it was the apes that ate the mushrooms

908
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,340
who became more intelligent.

909
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,080
I think it's,

910
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,000
actually, it just makes me hungry for brains

911
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,700
and mushrooms.

912
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,080
But, you know,

913
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,320
now we're stuck with

914
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,140
maybe Alzheimer's is a good

915
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,880
legal high.

916
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,740
My mom is not in bad

917
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,640
spirits. She sees movies

918
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,880
that the rest of us don't get to see.

919
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,180
She tried to convince us

920
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,920
of a movie she'd seen that my

921
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,040
brother had made, and finally my brother had to

922
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,880
go, I didn't make that movie.

923
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,820
It was part of your dream or something.

924
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,040
And she went, her response was,

925
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,140
well, all I can say is

926
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,140
you people are missing a damn

927
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:39,980
good movie.

928
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,860
The more I thought about it,

929
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,920
well, you know, they say your

930
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,080
reality is what you make

931
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,720
it and so forth, so

932
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,780
maybe it's a good legal high.

933
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,120
Larry compared it

934
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,160
to good Columbia marijuana.

935
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,000
Well, see,

936
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,660
that's what I'm saying. I have practice.

937
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,100
I keep all those notes. I've got tattoos

938
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,540
on my chest.

939
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,960
Read backwards in the mirror, the whole

940
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,340
business.

941
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,840
But, you can get high other ways,

942
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,600
besides eating,

943
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:10,980
beef, or

944
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,440
waiting until you get old,

945
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:14,860
or whatever.

946
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,460
Preaching is not a bad way to get high.

947
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,520
Now, I'm not doing it

948
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,400
now because my

949
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,940
doctor told me not to, but

950
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,700
many preachers, you'll notice,

951
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,340
preach with this cadence

952
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,960
and they go, Bob,

953
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,260
it will give you slack, and you

954
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,860
will have so much slack,

955
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,500
you will be like, well,

956
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,860
I don't want to keep going because I'll get too high.

957
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,640
It's the high of

958
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:40,880
hyperventilation.

959
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,740
And I know from experience

960
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,040
that it really works.

961
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,740
The preacher gets so worked up,

962
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,920
he's breathing like that,

963
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,200
it, you know,

964
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,620
God only knows how many brain cells

965
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,440
are sloughing off to the side

966
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,100
as the oxygen is being deprived.

967
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,520
But, he sees a clearer

968
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,160
and clearer picture of God

969
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,020
and the city of heaven

970
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,940
and Jesus, and next thing

971
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,460
you know, everybody in the audience

972
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,480
is getting with him, and they're

973
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,800
getting high, and they're preaching,

974
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,900
and they're breathing like that, and God

975
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,880
himself walks into the room wearing his

976
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,140
Sunday best, friends, and

977
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,440
that is what religion is all about.

978
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,320
I guess.

979
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,220
It doesn't happen in subgenius

980
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,620
things very much because we don't have much

981
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,500
faith.

982
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,320
I was thinking yesterday about how

983
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,640
if I got cancer, faith healers

984
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,840
wouldn't be able to heal me.

985
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,560
But,

986
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,500
I'm one of those

987
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,220
people that if I was charged,

988
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,940
enough by the hospital,

989
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,620
I might have faith in that.

990
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,500
$50,000 to cure your cancer,

991
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:47,460
I wouldn't have enough faith.

992
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,840
If I was $100,000 in debt,

993
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,020
I might well be able to beat it.

994
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,280
You know?

995
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,940
Yeah, I have that.

996
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,180
$100,000, they

997
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,240
couldn't be lying about that.

998
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,680
Those are the easiest

999
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,240
lies to believe, I guess,

1000
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,220
they say.

1001
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,300
I read the angel's stone.

1002
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,200
Deep thunder rolled

1003
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,460
in my heart.

1004
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:09,860
I tanked my shoes.

1005
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,560
Flushing as the fire spoke.

1006
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,960
It's not an easy thing to me

1007
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,000
to make up your lies.

1008
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,260
I'm single.

1009
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,960
What can he do for you?

1010
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,260
If only you could see what I've seen

1011
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,440
with your eyes.

1012
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,080
I want more

1013
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,460
life.

1014
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,160
late,

1015
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,940
and

1016
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,440
we're

1017
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,220
It was

1018
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,680
recent that

1019
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,340
I talked about

1020
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:32,580
how

1021
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,580


1022
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,580


1023
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,580


1024
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:32,840
the

1025
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:32,900
man that

1026
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,880
You are being

1027
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:33,880


1028
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:33,880


1029
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:33,880


1030
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,040
has it made you

1031
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,780
what I

1032
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:34,980
feel like

1033
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,300
we should be

1034
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,300


1035
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:35,640
people

1036
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:35,640


1037
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,000
Right,

1038
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,000


1039
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,460
feel remembering

1040
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:37,460


1041
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:37,460


1042
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,620
if possible.

1043
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:38,620


1044
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:38,700
together again,

1045
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:38,980
could

1046
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,280
do everything

1047
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,280


1048
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,340
to do,

1049
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:39,460


1050
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,440
what I've seen with your eyes.

1051
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,320
What seems to be the problem?

1052
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,420
Death.

1053
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,840
If only you could see

1054
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,940
what I've seen with your eyes.

1055
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,480
And to make every hand be made.

1056
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,600
You were made as well as we could make you,

1057
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,660
but not to last.

1058
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,120
If only you could see

1059
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,180
what I've seen with your eyes.

1060
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,360
I've done questionable things

1061
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,420
and some extraordinary things

1062
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,720
reveled in my time.

1063
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,460
If only you could see

1064
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,500
what I've seen with your eyes.

1065
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,940
And to make every hand be made.

1066
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,080
You were made as well as we could make you,

1067
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,180
but not to last.

1068
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,780
If only you could see

1069
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,780
what I've seen with your eyes.

1070
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,260
Nothing the god of biomechanics

1071
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,160
would let you in heaven.

1072
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,540
A light that burns twice as bright

1073
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,440
burns half as long.

1074
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,880
And you have burned so very, very brightly.

1075
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,500
If only you could see

1076
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,520
what I've seen with your eyes.

1077
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,660
You better get it up!

1078
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,080
I'm gonna have to kick it!

1079
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,060
Well, you notice Bob's pipe

1080
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,580
is not exactly clenched within his teeth,

1081
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,760
but actually meets his clenched teeth.

1082
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,560
His teeth are all the way together.

1083
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,440
You can tell by inspecting the smile.

1084
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,060
That goes in the ass's turn!

1085
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,340
Well, I...

1086
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,820
So he can lick chicken wings!

1087
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,800
From PR News in Washington,

1088
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,700
unfair to low-income single mothers and others.

1089
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,540
Democrats lost their job last night

1090
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,340
to be beat up by the Democrats.

1091
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:08,340


1092
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,440
The CDC is waiting in line

1093
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,460
outside a health clinic

1094
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,580
near a crowded market.

1095
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,780
A defense attorney is said to be

1096
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,500
eating regularly

1097
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,840
and sitting in an armchair.

1098
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,080
In Washington,

1099
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,600
the Senate is orchestrating

1100
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,980
the $11 billion accounting fraud

1101
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,000
at PR News in Washington.

1102
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,120
We have a 10-15 at the 7-11

1103
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,240
at 12-34.

1104
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,660
It occurred at 12-45.

1105
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,520
And we have the store attendant

1106
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,420
bending over and grabbing his ankles

1107
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,860
and we're photographing the area.

1108
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,940
He talked to the TV,

1109
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,240
we're talking to the kiddie now.

1110
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,680
We're trying to find out

1111
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,000
from the kiddie just what happened.

1112
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,940
Stand by while I'm done.

1113
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,240


1114
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:50,500
I'm done with this.

1115
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,920
Stand by, over.

1116
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,480
Maybe Cher can explain all this.

1117
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,580
I have to explain it to you.

1118
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,920
I have to explain it to you.

1119
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:07,920


1120
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:08,400
It's been over.

1121
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,260
Okay, now put the law number

1122
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,440
of the law into the rectum.

1123
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,620
Okay, now pull up here.

1124
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,680
Oh, no, that's not how it goes.

1125
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,740
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1126
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:15,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1127
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,060
That's not show.

1128
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,560
Not right.

1129
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,440
No, no, no, no, no.

1130
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,040
No, no, no, no.

1131
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:18,900
Silas got it.

1132
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,040
Bob's in combination with LSD

1133
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,020
will make warp noids

1134
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,960
out of all the current

1135
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:28,880
Love Burger situation

1136
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,120
is getting out of hand.

1137
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,400
Praise Bob.

1138
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,280
Praise Bob.

1139
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,740
Praise Bob.

1140
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,500
And she came out to me.

1141
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,440
She was in the Navy.

1142
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,540
You're on drugs.

1143
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:37,920
Do you have drugs?

1144
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,640
She goes, I know you are.

1145
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,340
She goes, don't.

1146
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,360
She goes, I know what

1147
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,080
you're going through.

1148
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,340
I've taken drugs before.

1149
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:43,840
And then she

1150
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,260
splashed her ID in my face.

1151
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,220
And like she had

1152
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,120
these two guys with her.

1153
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,520
She goes, don't worry, Linda.

1154
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,860
We're your friends.

1155
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,180
Get out, you bum.

1156
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,540
We don't want your

1157
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,700
kind in here anymore.

1158
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,900
Now try to give me a job.

1159
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,520
Feeding chickens

1160
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,360
and washing down hogs.

1161
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,900
But that meant standing up

1162
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,000
all the time.

1163
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,100
And standing up to me

1164
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,340
is just like dying.

1165
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,800
I'm so lazy

1166
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,660
that I could cry.

1167
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,060
But tears

1168
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,880
are just too lazy

1169
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,160
to fall out my eyes.

1170
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,300
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

1171
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,040
I'm so

1172
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,620
messed up.

1173
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,220
This next song

1174
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,460
was originally Funk Zookie.

1175
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,100
And now it's called Opium.

1176
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,940
Prozac, coffee, marijuana.

1177
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,240
I don't know what's all out there.

1178
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,460
So this song's about opium.

1179
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,260
Oh, dancers,

1180
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,440
dancers.

1181
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,480
She enters the den of opium

1182
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,740
She sees a bishop is overdressed

1183
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,520
She can't see the cardinal's shoes

1184
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,300
I bet they're blue suede too

1185
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,260
All the leaders, great and small

1186
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,240
Hide behind the wall of the wall

1187
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,100
Behind the velvet wall

1188
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,920
She is the deepest water

1189
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,780
that runs within the den

1190
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,160
of opium

1191
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,500
Opium

1192
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,200
Gold and bronze

1193
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,880
Green and grey

1194
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,240
And the fairies

1195
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,240


1196
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:07,240


1197
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:07,420
of yellow and black

1198
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,460
Every blackest bitch

1199
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,080
Blows a smoke that's been

1200
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,500
known to slay

1201
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,120
The mightiest of men

1202
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,280
All the leaders, great and small

1203
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,100
Hide behind the velvet wall

1204
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,900
She is the deepest water

1205
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,780
that runs within the den

1206
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,380
of opium

1207
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:35,800
metres

1208
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:37,240


1209
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:37,240


1210
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,760
I'll be out

1211
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,480
Everybody listen up!

1212
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,280
She left with her soul intact

1213
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,140
She never kissed the fascist lips

1214
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,060
She did partake of the poppy wonder

1215
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:31,020
And escaped before the blitz

1216
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,680
All the leaders, great and small

1217
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,220
Hide behind the wall

1218
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,460
The velvet wall

1219
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,280
She is the deepest water that runs

1220
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,280
Within the depth

1221
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,880
Of Ophium

1222
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,120
Ophium

1223
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,640
Ophium

1224
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,220
Ophium

1225
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:00,380
Ophium

1226
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,560
Ophium

1227
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,080
Ophium

1228
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,140
A little bit

1229
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,560
A little bit of Thelonious Bosch there

1230
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:12,440
Recorded live at Starwood

1231
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,380

From PR News in Washington

1239
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,640
I'm the mother of a juvenile murderer

1240
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,400
A Wichita man warns that most police

1241
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,560
Float around in a balloon without stopping

1242
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,980
He said Pieg took a refused request

1243
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,140
To test for a request refused

1244
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:45,860
PR's unsolved murder case is up 15 at 2067

1245
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,240
Interpol officials have created a special task force

1246
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,000
To investigate PR News in Washington

1247
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,320
Friends, Fernand and Andy Lee Murr did that

1248
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,580
And does the PR News

1249
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,420
You're listening to Hour of Slack number 986

1250

With the amino acids in the background

1251
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,660
Much of the show is from the old subgenius album

1252
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,820

But now, friends

1269
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,960
That preacher was talking earlier in the show

1270
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,540
About how the devil talks backwards

1271
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,900
On these rock and roll albums

1272
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,740
And, well, he talks backwards

1273
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,260
On weird noise mixes, too

1274
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,320
In fact, all of the following

1275
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,280
Is made from one tiny short little clip

1276
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,640
Of yours truly sort of coughing or snorting

1277
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,160
And yet, if you listen on FROP

1278
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,380
You will hear the devil talking backwards

1279
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,140
On this cut

1280
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,760
This cut by my band

1281
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,940
With Princess Wee

1282
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,680
Pooh Water Towel

1283
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,600
Station personnel may just want to fade out from this

1284
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,800
And in so doing

1285
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,600
Save their listeners' very souls

1286
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,880
The demon is a liar

1287
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,840
He would like to confuse us

1288
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,860
Yes, sir

1289
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,140
Yes, sir

1290
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,140


1291
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:32,700
Yes, sir

1292
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,140
Yes, sir

1293
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:34,300
Yes, sir

1294
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:34,760
Yes, sir

1295
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:34,820
Yes, sir

1296
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,020
Yes, sir

1297
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:35,360
Yes, sir

1298
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:35,540
Yes, sir

1299
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,020
Yes, sir

1300
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,020


1301
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,020


1302
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,020


1303
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,020


1304
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,020


1305
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:36,180
Yes, sir

1306
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,180


1307
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,260
Yes, sir

1308
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,900
Yes, sir

1309
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:40,900


1310
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:40,900


1311
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:40,900


1312
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:40,900


1313
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,720
Just off, I just, I'm fissed

1314
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,820
I'm into this

1315
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:50,920
I am

1316
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,080
Here, c'mon

1317
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:51,920
Straight forward

1318
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,000
Cool

1319
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,200
Zoe

1320
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,800
Tschrooung

1321
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,420
So

1322
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,800
Did you turn it off?

1323
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,180
I now get decided to turn it off

1324
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,180


1325
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,600
It's because of the sound of hell

1326
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,180
I

1327
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:36,600


1328
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,060
You can take those records and run them backwards

1329
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,860
and you hear Satan talking on there.

1330
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,440
And now for the internet listeners only,

1331
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,760
the great Bob Richley.

1332
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,180
Praise this Bob.

1333
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,840
My tongue had been completely, completely scalded

1334
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,760
by this hot breath of the St. Bernard that used to come down.

1335
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,560
He was the leader. He'd lick me, he'd lick me.

1336
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,800
Years later in a gay bar when I was a,

1337
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,860
the proprietor of a gay bar and we had shows at night,

1338
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,600
the same St. Bernard came in.

1339
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,820
He's covered with shit.

1340
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,900
He had this terrible accident to his bowel, his lower bowel.

1341
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,400
And it exploded.

1342
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,360
I forgave him.

1343
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,140
I forgave him on the spot.

1344
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,000
Gave him.

1345
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,400
Big hairy devil.

1346
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,560
We went together for about three years at St. Bernard.

1347
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:09,680
He died in my arms.

1348
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,720
Just panting and carrying away his huge, huge hair-like penis.

1349
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,120
Drooping down.

1350
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,960
I have it mounted now, chromed.

1351
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,060
It's in a shadow box in my den.

1352
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,480
Perhaps you'd like to see it.

1353
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,240
We'll play a game on my Brunswick pool table.

1354
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,420
And you can stare hard at my St. Bernard penis there at all.

1355
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,580
Of course.

1356
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Some of the chrome has eaten away and the foul growths that have emanated from that flesh spot

1357
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:44,940
have just come like a staghorn fern just kind of growing out of the shack or shadow box.

1358
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,340
It's an interesting display.

1359
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,080
Some local medical students come over every three hours and look at it.

1360
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,300
They get so turned on, I have to relieve them.

1361
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:58,560
It's a privilege for an 87-year-old queen to just suck them dry.

1362
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,900
Of course, I faint by the third cock, but what's the difference?
