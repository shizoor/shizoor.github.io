1
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:21,980
823-7490, 823-7490, 823-7490, 823-7490, oh, by the way, dear friends, you're listening

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:35,360
to radio station KNON here in Dallas, Texas, KNON 89.3 FM, actually in Dallas, but broadcasting

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,880
to the mid-cities, Fort Worth, and whatever else you might want to call the Metroplex.

4
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,440
And I think we're going to change pace just a bit from the last show, because it's pledge

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,300
drive time, dear friends, oh, yeah.

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:59,580
Yes, once again, pledge drive, and we're going to build it up as much as we possibly can.

7
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,520
823-7490, 823-7490, 823-7490.

8
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,540
20, 20, 24 hours ago, I won't be submitted.

9
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,140
Nothing to do, nowhere to go.

10
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,380
I won't be submitted to a little word check given to the show.

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
Hurry, hurry, hurry, before I go to go.

12
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,940
I can't get to my fingers, I can't get to my toes, oh, no.

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,120
I won't be submitted.

14
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,340
I want to be sedated.

15
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, I bet you do want to be sedated.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,660
I bet you do.

17
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,080
But Jane, go into it, dear friends, because this is a subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,320
in the middle of a pledge drive show.

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,280
Frankly, I don't know if you realize what that means, but that means we don't fool around.

20
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,820
When we do a pledge drive, dear friends, we do it to the hilt.

21
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,860
We plunge that meat axe as deep as we possibly can.

22
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:47,840
Or we take your fistful of dollars just as deep as we can into our own checkbook.

23
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,760
Oh, yes.

24
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,480
So, come, a big gibs a golly goshin', better puke your peat on full throttle potentate,

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,580
elsewise your wants will be waggin' down on mammy's hind nanny.

26
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,960
Why can't your peeser pop a squeezer when the gushers are goin' all normal-like?

27
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,800
Got you no geyser sense in your sneezin' chamber, boy?

28
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Heistin' a empty platter in your bean bag?

29
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,080
Where's your roller balls, eh?

30
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,300
I can't grop me no love grow on this loose...

31
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,820
juju muju band.

32
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,080
You gon' have to spreech English, Jake.

33
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,340
Get right with your muscle snake, snunk monkey.

34
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,580
Quit spritzin' your plizzerer lessen its snowin' white lute juice, baby.

35
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,940
Elsewise, your pleatin' bleeder's blowin' hot water.

36
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,180
You go blind or please your neither tryin' not to.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Either way, you're gettin' up on the wrong orbit for this kinda free-kneedin', bleedin' side trade, eh?

38
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
I'm gonna get the gear.

39
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,420
Well, aren't you gon' just stand there like a dammy nickel slug,

40
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,240
or you gonna plus your plimper and righteous hargin' it, pee-boy?

41
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,020
Got weenie ribbers and fluter tubes, don't you?

42
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,120
Join gumption with the true and the seed brave,

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,160
and pee for Bob, man, and send your jeans.

44
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:14,480
Buy out the gland owners with what you earned with your skinny peelin' face of pain.

45
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,380
This has been your enunciator.

46
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,420
Thank me.

47
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,420
Well, thank you.

48
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,020
Okay.

49
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,980
Sing some sad K-N-O-N songs.

50
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,660
Bob days, the Bob days in K-N-O-N.

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,480
The Bob days in K-N-O-N.

52
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,860
The Bob days in K-N-O-N.

53
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,360
The Bob days in K-N-O-N.

54
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,480
Today.

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,640
Today.

56
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,640
Today.

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,460
Bob, Bob, Bob.

58
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,100
That's right, dear friends.

59
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,940
Bob, Bob, Bob.

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,780
It is the K-N-O-N days of Bob day, or whatever-

61
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,280
Oh, what is the deal here?!

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,460
Here's the deal.

63
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,080
You know, I was just as surprised as you may be-

64
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,220
Melissa and the Pre-Antibodies of Honey Bear作ю

65
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,040
... because the the pledge drive came upon me-

66
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,360
just as unexpectedly as it may have upon you.

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,240
I was informed only last Tuesday

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,660
that our beloved station here

69
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,920
was not only not anywhere close to going to 50,000 watts

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,160
as the previous quote regime had suggested,

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,900
but in fact that the station was Jimmy darn near losing

72
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,560
not only its gas bill, but even its electric bill,

73
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,320
that is the transmitter, friends,

74
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,520
the transmitter of KNON,

75
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,260
despite what previous shows may not have said,

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,060
unless, I mean, we're going to lose it.

77
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,300
It's an absolutely serious situation this time.

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,200
We shall lose that mighty transmitter

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,960
unless we all, and that means me and you, friends,

80
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,820
raise some big bucks right quick.

81
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,000
You know, the bills, the conspiracy,

82
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,740
may not be an equal opportunity employer,

83
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,100
but the bills of the station are an equal opportunity destroyer.

84
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,040
Now, I know you've heard all this before.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,200
In fact, you heard a lot more than what we're about to give you.

86
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,020
You heard promises.

87
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,540
Promises that didn't come true.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
Now, this time it ain't even that.

89
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,100
It ain't promises.

90
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,540
It's nothing but pure begging.

91
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,320
I mean, friends, we are just trying to stay on the air, period.

92
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,700
And if we go off by FCC rules,

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,540
we don't go off.

94
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:47,980
We go off temporarily.

95
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,400
There is no such thing as temporarily off the air

96
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
to them at the FCC.

97
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,260
We go off, we're gone, baby.

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,600
Gone.

99
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,360
Now, I can keep sending my show out to other cities.

100
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,580
Great.

101
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,000
A lot of good that does you, huh?

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,720
Since you're not going to move to any of those places,

103
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,920
why don't you just call in a bit of a pledge

104
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,600
at 823-7490.

105
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,520
Eh?

106
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,020
Just a bit of a pledge.

107
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,400
Just a...

108
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,100
Like a big bit of a pledge, as a matter of fact.

109
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,520
In fact, in fact, this time, for the first time,

110
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,420
this is how serious it is, this pledge drive.

111
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
We ain't fooling around.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,280
You can just frankly show up right here at the station tonight.

113
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,500
That's right.

114
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,760
From 10 o'clock to 10.30, actually,

115
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
would be the best time for you to do it.

116
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,200
Show up at the station here at KNON on San Jacinto Street.

117
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,360
Drop off a check or a pure Federal Reserve conspiracy cash note.

118
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,300
I mean, we don't...

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,540
We don't care where it comes from.

120
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,580
We don't care if you made that extra money delivering pizza

121
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,400
or if you got it from laundering the government's cocaine money

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,260
through Bahama banks in order to finance arms

123
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,240
for the anti-communist weirdos.

124
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:58,900
We don't care.

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,060
In fact, that's fine with me.

126
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
It can be tainted money.

127
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,860
It can be ill-gotten gains.

128
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,640
It can be spoiled money.

129
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,560
We just plain need some green, man.

130
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,480
We need some cabbage and gravel, you know?

131
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,800
I mean, I can break down the expenses of the station

132
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,940
as they did at the...

133
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,280
What?

134
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:16,980
A staff meeting.

135
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,080
But you, like me, as a fellow business person,

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,740
experienced in just what it costs to put on a decent 60-minute tank,

137
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,780
much less a station,

138
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,180
you'd be appalled.

139
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,440
I mean, the staff collectively gets less than you do,

140
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,060
and there's four of them and only one of you.

141
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,580
The transmission bills, well, that's more like big business.

142
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,300
It's a horrifying, frightening thing, dear friends,

143
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,740
and no wonder we only have freedom of radio here in the United States.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,120
Nobody else but Japan can afford it.

145
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,080
In Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia,

146
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,240
the TV stations are run by the drug lords.

147
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,600
Well, friends, the frop lords can't run this station without your help.

148
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,240
Call 823-7490 and get this.

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,000
This time, dear friends, to show you how much we care,

150
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,440
each person who calls in tonight with a pledge,

151
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,640
we will not only say your name over the air,

152
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,120
not only...

153
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,340
Not only will we thank you profusely, grovelingly, toadyingly,

154
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,740
we will sing your name.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,880
We shall sing out, I swear it,

156
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,340
those who call in, we shall sing out thy names,

157
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,860
aloud, in praise of what you have done for this station,

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,240
which might otherwise die,

159
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,260
as just as Davey was actually smushed by Goliath's foot,

160
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,980
despite what you may have heard in other reference tomes,

161
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,880
have we got any calls yet?

162
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
We have two calls in.

163
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,020
This is our first chance to go ahead and sing those out.

164
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,940
Dear Brother Reverend Shimon here,

165
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,900
Will O'Dobbs, St. Will O'Dobbs,

166
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,120
and Popess Dominatrix Cecilia.

167
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,840
Friends, what are the names that we have here?

168
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,580
Let me see it.

169
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,200
And then, okay.

170
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,620
Okay.

171
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,700
Oh, gosh, we're going to have to have separate copies.

172
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,620
Here comes another one.

173
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

174
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Let's start with

175
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Sean Richburg.

176
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,820
And also another pledge in from

177
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Tracy Schultz.

178
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,900
Oh, yes.

179
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,860
Dear friends.

180
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,140
And here is why you need to keep calling in.

181
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,020
I'm going to give you...

182
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,060
We're finally getting some...

183
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,360
I see.

184
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,540
They just wanted the vanity.

185
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,420
The vanity of the subgeniuses.

186
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,060
I don't blame you.

187
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,780
I'm the same way.

188
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm going to play you a tape.

189
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,380
This is one of the original tapes tonight.

190
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,400
It's going to tell you exactly why you need

191
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
to pledge.

192
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,740
Come down here and...

193
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,500
Friends, we're serious.

194
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,040
Okay.

195
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,380
Yeah.

196
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,380
Well, actually...

197
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,520
Hello, friends.

198
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,960
And welcome.

199
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,600
You know, most of you out there must be feeling

200
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,100
pretty smug with yourselves.

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,960
After all, you're alive.

202
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
You're healthy.

203
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,000
Your life's insured.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,340
There's a little money set aside in case of accidents.

205
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,040
What more could you ask for?

206
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,040
These are good times.

207
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,540
Easy money.

208
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,620
Easy sex.

209
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,720
VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds occupied.

210
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,360
You know, they say that the golden age is never the present age.

211
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,460
They really do say that.

212
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,740
But we look all around us everywhere,

213
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,040
and what do we see?

214
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,020
Golden opportunity.

215
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,320
Well, friends, that's just calm before the storm

216
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,960
because tonight's sermon is entitled

217
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,080
X-Day 1998.

218
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,560
Day of reckoning.

219
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,660
We all know vaguely what X-Day is.

220
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,880
Bob told us himself.

221
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,280
That it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

222
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,920
The X's shall land and whisk the good subgenies off

223
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,080
to a never-ending pleasure cruise of the cosmos.

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,820
But what of the pinks that remain on Earth?

225
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,300
What will happen to the a-holes that are left behind?

226
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,320
Well, friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate,

227
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,320
the fact is they'll get exactly what they deserve.

228
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Now, to any real subgenie, giving the normal what he deserves

229
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,960
is about the cruelest thing he can do.

230
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,340
And that's the same normal that a normal could ever receive.

231
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,920
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

232
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,100
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name of Bob.

233
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,540
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world

234
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,520
and turned it into an ever-growing bureaucratic governmental monster

235
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,600
that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck-passing, and fill-in-the-blank.

236
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Then, once the creature's rot-filled gut sprues out the digested combination of

237
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,080
all the vices before-mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth,

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,320
what's the result?

239
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,960
Why, the conspiracy, of course!

240
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,740
And this pile of stinking defecation we're supposed to kneel before,

241
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,880
and worship, and serve?

242
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,060
Never!

243
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,760
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule

244
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,260
on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays,

245
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,280
X-Day 1998!

246
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,580
Dreaded by them, but not by us.

247
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,980
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and see what the normals have in store for them, shall we?

248
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,960
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways,

249
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,100
not all of which are immediately recognized as divine in origin.

250
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,620
Indeed, since Bob transcends time, so does his word.

251
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,200
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

252
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,740
In this story, the Martians, then a synonym for aliens, later to be known as X-ists,

253
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,120
have landed and started to round up the normals.

254
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,080
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future of mankind.

255
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,860
The smarter one asserts, quote,

256
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,900
I've thought it all out.

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Right now, we're caught as we're wanted.

258
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,480
An X-ist only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

259
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
But they won't keep on doing that.

260
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,880
They'll begin catching us systematic-like,

261
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,300
keeping the best, and storing us in cages and things.

262
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,220
They haven't begun on us yet.

263
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,240
Not begun.

264
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,880
Later he goes on to say,

265
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,520
All those little office workers that used to live in these houses,

266
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,380
they'll be no good.

267
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,360
They haven't any stuff in them.

268
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,900
They used to run, run off to work.

269
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,980
I have seen hundreds of them running and catching their commuter trains in the morning,

270
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,960
afraid that they'd get canned if they didn't.

271
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,940
Running back at night, afraid that they wouldn't be in time for work.

272
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,140
They'll be in the middle of the night,

273
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,140


274
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,660
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,780
Yay, and on Sundays, worried about the hereafter.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,940
Well, the X-ist will be a godsend for those guys.

277
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,520
Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, and no worries.

278
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,980
Yeah, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs,

279
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,880
they'll come and be glad to be caught.

280
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,780
Now this is 1938, mind you.

281
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,940
He goes on to say finally,

282
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,540
That's not all.

283
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,280
These X-ists are going to make pets of some of them, train them to do tricks.

284
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,620
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.

285
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,260
Yay, and some maybe, they'll train to hunt us.

286
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,280
Yes, they will.

287
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,080
There's men who will do it gladly.

288
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,920
Well, friends, how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

289
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,200
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938,

290
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:18,240
on CBS, it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for reprieve.

291
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,440
They repented, they begged forgiveness, and yet, just a few days later,

292
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:31,360
after Bob Orson Welles in the War of the Worlds broadcast was described by the conspiracy as nothing more than a joke,

293
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,240
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life as if nothing had ever happened.

294
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,180
They came so close to getting a second chance in men in their ways, but,

295
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,100
they blew it.

296
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,760
They went back to the conspiracy masters, and for their loyalty,

297
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,500
they were genously rewarded with yet another world war.

298
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,740
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

299
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,020
Well, they haven't seen nothing yet.

300
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,180
Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

301
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,820
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy.

302
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,360
And like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients,

303
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,320
if you're caught in the nuclear holocaust and your skin begins to melt,

304
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,420
don't panic.

305
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,100
This is perfectly normal.

306
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:17,320
Yes, friends, just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

307
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,720
What? Did I say doomed to die?

308
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,420
I should have said lucky to die, for blessed are the dead after X-Day arrives.

309
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,780
The doomed are the unlucky pink survivors who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless exes.

310
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,880
Cruel to them, but not to us.

311
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,200
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses for the pinks,

312
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,040
but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

313
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,600
We'll be surfing the celestial stars,

314
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,060
smoking our froth,

315
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,280
unweaving our slack,

316
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,100
and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow.

317
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,020
Because in space, friends, there isn't.

318
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,920
Only back on Earth will there be a tomorrow.

319
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,000
And then the next day, and then the next.

320
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,360
It'll be an eternal hell without end.

321
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,360
And we'll be enjoying it all in the heavens on closed-circuit TV.

322
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,260
Because we won't want to miss a single revenge-filled minute.

323
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,840
Praise Bob.

324
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,880
Amen.

325
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,480
Amen.

326
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,440
And dear friends,

327
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,480
oh, the mighty Papa Joe Mama has spake again.

328
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,740
And I'm gonna speak real quick,

329
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,960
just so some of you know just what's going on here.

330
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,780
We are having a pledge drive.

331
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,860
We do require a lot of money to keep this station on the air.

332
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,460
And for pledges under $25,

333
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,440
why, you get a whole program schedule.

334
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,580
How about that?

335
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,820
But for $25, you get the schedule, the bumper sticker,

336
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,580
the K-N-O-N,

337
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,480
rec proof bumper sticker,

338
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,400
and the calendar.

339
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,740
The calendar which prevents your bills from coming before you're ready to pay them.

340
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,040
The bumper sticker which prevents your car from going into a spin on North Central.

341
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
For $35, a t-shirt,

342
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,000
which you can come down here at the station right now and pick up.

343
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,020
Bring that $35 to the station right now, dear friends.

344
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,820
We'll take it.

345
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,760
We'll take that money.

346
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,960
We'll hand you the t-shirt.

347
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,020
$45, same thing,

348
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,080
but we'll actually mail it to you.

349
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,300
And $100, and friends,

350
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,160
you can get anything you want.

351
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,800
Just call us up and let us know.

352
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,640
In fact, I believe someone did.

353
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,020
Did they not call in a $100 pledge?

354
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,780
We know them.

355
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,880
Friends, let us sing out the praises once again of the names of those true and faithful

356
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,920
who have come unto us.

357
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,040
All right.

358
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,860
Now, friend, you can go ahead and call while we're singing these names.

359
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,280
Don't worry.

360
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,080
Then we'll sing you later.

361
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,960
Thank you, oh dear friend,

362
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,740
Derrick Anderson.

363
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,260
Terry Ferry.

364
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,760
Larry Fong.

365
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,420
Foster.

366
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,940
Man, this is sounding good.

367
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,820
Oh, we're doctors.

368
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,400
We're doctors.

369
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,080
Ken Jenos.

370
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,640
Gary Mitchell.

371
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,560
Oh, and friends,

372
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,640
we do appreciate every spare penny.

373
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,340
We get, believe me,

374
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,680
the station manager is pacing back and forth in the room trying to make sure we aren't too silly,

375
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:54,280
and yet that we do get that money in because I've gone through it before,

376
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,540
and it probably is going to come up on one of these tapes,

377
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,560
which I'm going to go to so as to keep you from sitting there listening to me.

378
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,000
Thank you.

379
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,260
Hallelujah.

380
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Oh, hallelujah.

381
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,740
Oh, we can do it.

382
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,100
Thank you.

383
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,540
And over the airwaves,

384
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,680
the pressure to buy, to give, to pledge was relentless.

385
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,340
And although we've got hundreds and thousands that are so faithful,

386
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,480
and God bless you,

387
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,220
God bless you for your faithfulness,

388
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,540
still there are hundreds and hundreds,

389
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,420
maybe thousands who are not faithful,

390
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,500
who made the pledge and for some reason or another haven't sent it in.

391
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,960
And when we count on that,

392
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,380
and it doesn't come in everything,

393
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,040
everything suffers.

394
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,700
We are even having a hard time meeting the payroll right now,

395
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,320
and the people that we have working for PTL have families too.

396
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,300
They have bills too.

397
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,560
Jim Baker's running costs exceeded $2 million a week.

398
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:07,000
This baby that I'm holding in my hands is one of the first babies...

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,840
The first mutants.

400
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,040
...that has been saved...

401
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,540
by Bob.

402
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,200
...through the outreach of the people that...

403
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,620
What do you want to say to them today?

404
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,280
Look at his three eyes, his six legs.

405
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,280
He's one of the first saved.

406
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,660
...with a plan to help them as a ministry.

407
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,320
I know.

408
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,540
They wouldn't ask if they didn't need it.

409
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,480
And maybe get tired of hearing them ask for money and stuff.

410
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,820
But if they don't ask,

411
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,380
sometimes either partners won't give.

412
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,640
Give me the ammunition.

413
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't make me beg and plead.

414
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,700
Please.

415
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,000
Give me the ammunition.

416
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,120
I've got the soldiers, I've got the troops, I've got the weapons.

417
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,160
No figures are broadcast to show what percentage of their income

418
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,200
the television evangelists devote to good works.

419
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,700
...big godparent homes for little pregnant girls.

420
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,260
That's why I'm asking you to help me, because I cannot do this alone.

421
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,820
But when it comes to the pitch,

422
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,840
good works are always top priority, and hearts are tied to you.

423
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,960
Jerry, as a faith point, I'll give you $15 a month.

424
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,220
Few people understood this better than Jim Baker.

425
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,360
Heaven's Club is specifically for young people that are seriously debilitated.

426
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,480
Unless you're living, he needs a social life founded in Christ.

427
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,060
He needs his financial obligations met.

428
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,720
So call.

429
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,720
If he'd only call 823-7490.

430
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,040
Oh, there's another one.

431
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,800
And whenever you die, Lily, you don't have to worry anymore,

432
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,620
because if you died tonight, then you would be with the Lord in heaven.

433
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,660
Lily's gonna be with Bob, but what about you, dear friend?

434
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,960
...have made it profitable and powerful.

435
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,060
And your address?

436
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
We don't even have to have your address.

437
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,980
You can come to our address.

438
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,840
Alright, could I have your zip code?

439
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,660
Uh, do the people in the camp...

440
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,220
We sure are.

441
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,740
I'd just like to let you know that there are a lot of good Christian people

442
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,760
that are adamantly opposed to what you're doing.

443
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,400
Well, yeah, I know, I know. We don't care about them. Look.

444
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:23,840
Yes.

445
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,040
I always hit the wrong deck.

446
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,880
Friends, you can come down to, what is it, 44...

447
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,460
4415 San Jacinto.

448
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,120
4415 San Jacinto!

449
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,460
Yeah!

450
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,360
And, uh, actually, just hand your money right to Willa Dobbs, Pope S.C.

451
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,360
You've been wanting to meet Pope S.C., haven't you, boys, huh?

452
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,880
Yeah. And how about Reverend Shimon, okay?

453
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,740
Well, no, I don't...you don't want to meet Reverend Shimon.

454
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,540
And, uh, of course, I'm gonna hide out if I possibly can, but...

455
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,140
Oh, dear friends, do we have new names that we should read out yet?

456
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,260
Just only one?

457
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,160
But it's a big one.

458
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,720
One big name.

459
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,720
And it is...

460
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,380
A hundred dollar name.

461
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,980
Bob Martin.

462
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,620
Only one, eh? Only one's come in in all that time.

463
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,800
You know, I'm beginning to feel a little different than I did before.

464
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,420
I mean, at first it was sounding like we were doing real good.

465
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:43,580
This pledge drive was starting off powerful and cool and, like, tons of things going on at once and the phones ringing and wildness and craziness.

466
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,760
But, uh, now...

467
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,060
Well, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let Dr. Zug's Riff speak for me.

468
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,820
He ain't gonna...you...by the way, by the way, this is another reason to pledge to the Hour of Slack.

469
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:02,740
We get tapes from people like Zug's Riff that are not being released, uh, in any other fashion.

470
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,720
They go only to the friends.

471
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,600
Of these people.

472
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:13,080
Because, uh, SST Records, though they may play some of his stuff, they ain't gonna play his best because they're part of the conspiracy.

473
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:13,960
They have to be.

474
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,300
Just like us.

475
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,820
But...

476
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,760
Of course, we're fighting fire with fire, see?

477
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,540
So we need some of your fire...set a fire under our butts so we get moving again, friends.

478
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,480
That's no way to talk.

479
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,660
Don't ask me to speak a word.

480
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,760
I'm fed up with all your bullsh-t.

481
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,260
Soon I'll go away, but you'll find another victim.

482
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
You'll find another victim.

483
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,820
You say that I'm paranoid.

484
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,700
It makes me...

485
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,280
Sense.

486
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,240
You think you're blameless.

487
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,100
You just write me off.

488
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,840
Jack.

489
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
And go on with your business.

490
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,400
And go on with your business.

491
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,360
Don't ask why you're on my side.

492
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,060
When you like me for more reasons.

493
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,860
You don't have a clue to what in the hell I'm after.

494
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,660
What in the hell I'm after.

495
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,600
What in the hell I'm after.

496
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,100
What the f-ck are you looking at?

497
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
What in the hell I'm gonna pick up my guitar.

498
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,520
And play it for myself.

499
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,460
And no one else.

500
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,100
No more freebies.

501
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,660
And if I can't pay my bills.

502
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,240
I'll never lose the will of the people.

503
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,820
It's not that I haven't tried.

504
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,500
But there's a limit to my patience.

505
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,420
Bet your ass.

506
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,900
You spend your money on bullshit.

507
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,900
Reward the many idiots.

508
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Who are just in with the bucks.

509
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,780
And pack up opportunities.

510
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,520
Who get stronger as they make you.

511
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,620
They're blind to you when you believe it.

512
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,300
Just like a devil I think they're through.

513
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,760
Their business is all the same.

514
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,560
They can barely write their own name.

515
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,740
By supporting them.

516
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,900
What does that make you?

517
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,440
By giving money to a stranger.

518
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,280
While neglecting the deeds of your own.

519
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,760
Harvest what you can and what remains.

520
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,460
Because tomorrow you'll be empty and alone.

521
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,080
I feel like I'm doing this with nothing.

522
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,820
Don't have a house, can't pay the rent.

523
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,140
Why go to shows by those who didn't get it.

524
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,620
The whole affair's an embarrassment.

525
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,280
You spend your money on bullshit.

526
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,960
Reward the many idiots.

527
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,160
Who are just in with the bucks.

528
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,080
And pack up opportunities.

529
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,980
Who get stronger as they make you.

530
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,980
They're blind to you when you believe it.

531
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,580
Just like a devil I think they're through.

532
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,960
The music is all the same

533
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,320
They can tell me right now

534
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm led by such working men

535
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,320
What did I make you?

536
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,200
This is your chance, dear friends

537
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,880
Call 823-7490

538
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,940
Please do

539
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,640
Or come on down to the station

540
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,460
4415 San Jacinto

541
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,780
At North Carroll

542
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,580
More or less at North Carroll and Ross

543
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,940
We're going to dare and let you all come down here

544
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,780
I mean, half of you are going to be

545
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,360
White supremacists and Christian fanatics

546
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,080
Wanting to kill us

547
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,900
That's okay, as long as the station

548
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,520
Is able to pay its gas bills this week

549
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,820
And keep the transmitter up

550
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,420
That's all we're hoping for

551
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,560
It's all we're hoping for

552
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:27,560


553
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,240
At this point, and believe you me

554
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,080
We need every bitter

555
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,960
Bitter, bitterly earned penny

556
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,840
Oh, yeah

557
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,000
Ouch!

558
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,800
Yeah, well, chances are

559
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,560
Next pledge drive, there may not be

560
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,980
A pledge drive, that's right

561
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,040
You won't have to listen to

562
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,260
Boring pledge rants like this

563
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,020
Ever again

564
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,160
However, you also

565
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
Won't be able to listen to

566
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
The hour of slack ever again

567
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,500
Or the late night punk shows

568
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,280
Or the afternoon redneck music shows

569
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,340
Or the weird Sunday shows

570
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,260
Or even the early morning gospel shows

571
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,660
And that'll be the end

572
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,440
Dear friends, the end

573
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,900
Of not only the true word of Bob

574
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,300
Being preached in Dallas

575
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,100
But even the true word of Jesus

576
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,000
For Christ's sake

577
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,420
If you don't pledge

578
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,920
And K&ON goes down

579
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,060
Every preacher you hear on the radio

580
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,080
Will be a

581
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,300
White preacher

582
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,880
Or might as well be

583
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,020
You know, pinkness comes in all colors

584
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,780
Just like subgenius does

585
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,140
And I don't know about you

586
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:36,780
But about the

587
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,600
Only about one white preacher

588
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,180
In a hundred is for real

589
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,780
Like myself

590
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,260
Sorry to get racial about it

591
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,060
But that's sort of what it's all about

592
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,520
Without K&ON, dear friends

593
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,020
Dallas radio will be just as white

594
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,760
As the Joker's

595
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,660
Pale hiney itself

596
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,920
So what is it that we want?

597
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,700
We want you to call

598
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,200
823-7490

599
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,080
And make that pledge

600
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,260
We want living sacrifices

601
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,080
That's all

602
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,280
That's all we want

603
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,220
No big deal

604
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,460
We want people simply to give up

605
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,000
What they love the most

606
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,880
Their money

607
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,700
And we want a fair amount of it too

608
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,480
To tell the truth

609
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,560
We used to beg for five dollar pledges

610
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,380
Shoot

611
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,160
Shoot

612
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,660
That was a mistake, dear friends

613
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,120
The five dollar pledges

614
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,420
Don't even bother to pay

615
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,300
Because in modern America

616
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,340
Five dollars is worth nothing

617
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,020
Nothing

618
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,320
We have got to get

619
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,640
A fair number

620
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,300
Of thirty dollar pledges

621
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,900
That's right

622
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,980
Thirty dollars

623
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,020
It probably takes a lot of you

624
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,880
Six hours

625
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,920
A whole day maybe

626
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,820
To earn that much

627
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,000
Some even longer

628
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,280
Some, like me

629
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,300
Can earn it in five minutes

630
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,360
Every three years

631
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,640
So I know what I'm asking for

632
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,340
I know it's a sacrifice

633
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,860
And, well, hey man

634
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,800
Let's get down to it

635
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,920
Just why should you give up

636
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,060
That hard-earned three clams

637
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
To keep the station on the air?

638
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,740
Is that why?

639
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,340
To keep KNON on?

640
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,500
Well, no, not really

641
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,980
If you get rational about it

642
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,920
You're right

643
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,860
Some other guy might pay your thirty dollars

644
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,780
And if you're like me

645
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,820
You'd just as soon get free radio for free

646
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,340
And you'd love KNON

647
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,780
And you can assume

648
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,160
You'll probably continue to get it

649
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,080
If at its currently sad broadcast power

650
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,300
Whether you pledge or not

651
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,680
Maybe

652
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,340
But that's a big but

653
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,860
But!

654
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,260
That doesn't really enter into the argument anyway

655
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,780
Should you pledge in order to become buddies

656
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,820
With your KNON DJ heroes?

657
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,220
And scapegoats?

658
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,780
No

659
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,580
You don't see us that way

660
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,180
You see us DJs

661
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,880
As ordinary slobs like you

662
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
You're no fools

663
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,600
So nix that reason

664
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,900
Should you pledge in order to

665
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,620
Help the minorities and the poor folks?

666
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,460
Oh, hell no

667
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,580
I mean, that's hypocritical

668
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,040
Bleeding heart

669
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,960
Liberal

670
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,740
Patronizing thinking

671
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,420
And I doubt if any of you listeners

672
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,880
Are of that disgusting persuasion

673
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Because you know that the minorities

674
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,120
Who are actually majorities anyway now

675
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,300
Don't want help

676
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,100
They want slack on their own terms!

677
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,380
Just like you do!

678
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,220
And they don't mind earning it

679
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,980
Leastwise not the subgenius ones

680
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,600
So why give money to KNON?

681
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,140
Well, here's why

682
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,000
For the worst and least rational reason of all

683
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,740
For moral reasons, dear friends

684
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,860
It's as simple as that

685
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,100
Moral reasons

686
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,340
And there's not even any point

687
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,180
In my trying to define good morality to you

688
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:53,060
Either you get it or you don't

689
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,840
As a matter of fact, that's a stupid

690
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,540
Even that's a stupid reason

691
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,760
Reason to give money to call in

692
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,860
Is so we can get out of here, man

693
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,220
I mean, look, we need, we

694
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,260
How many names do we have to sing out?

695
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,800
Three

696
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,680
Friends, we're going to sing these

697
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,780
But we may sing them with a certain

698
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,120
Doleful sadness

699
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,020
For these are so

700
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,700
There are so few faithful

701
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,040
Those who are well-wishers may be

702
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,540
One more

703
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,700
Here are the faithful friends

704
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,800
Those who count

705
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,600
Those whose names we will remember forever

706
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,560
Etched into Bob's inner pipe bowl

707
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,040
Mike Stewart

708
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,460
Sally Campbell

709
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,240
John

710
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,760
pods

711
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,460
And

712
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,080
After the

713
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,260
You're tough

714
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,260


715
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,260


716
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,380
Types

717
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,460
You thought

718
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:18,460


719
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,440
Whoa

720
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,440


721
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,440


722
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,440


723
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,440


724
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,520
I save

725
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,600
can see so many of you sitting there hovering by your phones waiting now the phones are ringing

726
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,400
here we're doing great uh this time we got all the beautiful girls the the mighty studliest of

727
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,860
genius ministers sitting here waiting to catch your call they're all busy but if you get a busy

728
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,200
signal just call back again because we sure ain't going to turn down a bit of your money dear friends

729
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,080
you know that that's one thing you can always trust a bob listen to those things going off in

730
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:50,980
the background and uh so for all i know maybe these oh yes oh we got this is one of the callers

731
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,320
that wanted to meet reverend stang at a cheap motel that comes with the 200 play

732
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,340
there is no more money we gotta get some money

733
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:11,960
i mean this when this show ends if you haven't helped the station what you know as reality is

734
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,620
going to come to a crashing

735
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,000
you

736
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,780
see what i mean

737
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,400
we were playing that cheery music because we wanted to be positive but you know frankly

738
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:29,940
friends positive thinking can kill you uh look where positive thinking has gotten most of the

739
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,520
world so far people say it reverend stang he's a pessimistic booger but frankly i'm worried that

740
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,620
my most pessimistic predictions might turn out to have been in the long run idiotically optimistic

741
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,740
and our

742
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:51,760
fear tonight is that you out there taping this show will think we'll think oh well uh well they'll stay

743
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:00,320
on the air or not whether i give or not but folks if you don't pledge the world will literally will

744
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,600
literally come to an end at the end of this hour if you and i don't mean just some of you i mean you

745
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,440
the one listening right now now you're laughing you're laughing it's gonna collapse around your

746
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,720
pathetic ears but you nihilistic teens in raid or what a mess they make up every night to get by them

747
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,560
teenagers out there, oh no future man, no future, you know, that's why if the rival

748
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,980
cult that wants these airwaves had this hour, they'd have raised 10,000 bucks by now.

749
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,060
And you know what they'd do with it?

750
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,480
They'd build concentration camps for the likes of you.

751
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,860
You abnormal.

752
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,260
You, you punk.

753
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,380
You old hippie.

754
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,100
You, you humanist.

755
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,860
You subgenius.

756
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,760
So friends, you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack, it's for the totality

757
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,160
that is K-N-O-N.

758
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:53,500
It isn't just for us mutants, it's for your very mind, your very soul, and you wouldn't

759
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,220
believe how close your soul is to being sold out.

760
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:01,580
Dear brother or sister, between your job and the drugs and the lies, listen, you need every

761
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,900
bit of slack you can hang on to, but we have a special form of slack in store for you tonight.

762
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,940
Not stored in souls anywhere, folks.

763
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,980
And the type of slack you're going to be getting is guilt.

764
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,120
Guilt.

765
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,980
Tonight we're going to whip us up some guilt.

766
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,020
And some of you are saying, oh, it's pledge time, Reverend Stang's going to rant all night

767
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,660
about money.

768
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,020
And you'd better be afraid that that's true, little Bobby, little gimme bob out there.

769
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,460
At first, you will want to turn away from him.

770
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,940
Then, you may find him a silent, unresisting target for your ridicule.

771
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,840
Mister, why don't you...

772
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,580
So big, mister.

773
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,680
But if you come to know him...

774
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,100
Have you always been the way you are now?

775
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,720
You will begin to see beyond the perversion of his form.

776
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,840
Are you in any pain?

777
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,620
Are your parents still alive?

778
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,200
And discover the beauty in the beast.

779
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,020
With no time have I met with such a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man.

780
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,360
I am not an animal.

781
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,480
Oh.

782
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,840
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder and is well on his way.

783
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,900
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

784
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,220
That's 828-9500.

785
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,620
All the good old boys are here tonight.

786
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,140
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission.

787
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,620
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home, then try to keep yourselves awake and dial the phone.

788
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,860
Call in for pledges.

789
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,840
Call in for pledges, yes.

790
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,500
Call in for pledges.

791
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,980
828-9500, 823-7490.

792
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,200
823-7490.

793
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,760
Answering the phones this evening.

794
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,240
Beautiful Dr. Zephyr.

795
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,380
And the best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen as quickly as you can with a contribution to the television mission.

796
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,360
You revolting genetic accident, take your smelly shell elsewhere.

797
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,880
See, General Spysax, see how well he obeys me.

798
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,140
He's loyal.

799
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,100
Stupid, but loyal.

800
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,600
A trait you will never share, Skeeto.

801
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,520
But little listeners, you may ask, is there hope?

802
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,840
Listen, you little listeners.

803
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,820
You're all whistling in the glistening mists.

804
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:17,920
Listen to these inspirational words from the Book of Lies, Chapter 10, Bankruptcy, Verse than Ever.

805
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,940
The passage runs, and I quote,

806
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:25,420
If you be tired or depressed, if you've got that rundown feeling, remember, you're not just anybody.

807
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,560
You're special.

808
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,660
You are living proof that God does not exist.

809
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:36,900
Yes, you, little listener, if you're like most of the people who listen to this show, are proof that no supreme being could ever exist.

810
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,480
I love your mess, Antonio.

811
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,980
It's a duck hunt.

812
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,680
Hanson, please, don't, don't, don't start.

813
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,440
Please, please.

814
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah, I'm sorry.

815
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,180
I've got to start anyway.

816
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,200
I don't want to start, believe me.

817
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:57,760
Dear friends, I've got to admit, I'm just too depressed to do a good show today.

818
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,400
So, this one's going to be a terrible show.

819
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,380
I'm already convinced of it.

820
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,700
Because I started out depressed about money, but now I'm depressed about everything.

821
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,960
You know, maybe slack and money are the same thing.

822
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,560
Maybe there isn't any reason to live without money.

823
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,160
Maybe nothing can ever be fun again.

824
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,460
Maybe the conspiracy is right.

825
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:34,900
A person without money, friends, is ipso facto a bad person.

826
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,840
A radio show without money, for that matter, is by definition a bad thing.

827
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,220
A bad radio show.

828
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,780
Goodness and one's value to humanity is in direct proportion to one's income.

829
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,360
There's no reason to care about anything ever again.

830
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,260
Even if you inherit money, that doesn't count.

831
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,680
Because it only counts if you procure the money yourself.

832
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,680
Money, friends, is more important than any human being's feelings.

833
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,320
Feelings are ephemeral.

834
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,540
They're gone with the breeze.

835
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,840
You can't...

836
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:17,220
You can't compress happy feelings or sad feelings into tanks and store them in a bank.

837
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,200
Can't sell them, so they don't matter.

838
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,420
Feelings don't matter.

839
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,860
Not even action matters.

840
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,820
Not even trying to make money matters.

841
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:32,160
Even giving away money doesn't make you more of a man.

842
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:40,720
Only making money makes you worthy of anyone's respect, including God.

843
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,000
Only making money makes you worthy of anyone's respect, including God.

844
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,180
It doesn't matter what kind of job you have.

845
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,160
Just make money.

846
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,900
Even if your job is inherently immoral.

847
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,400
Even if it exists to exploit and prey upon others.

848
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,400
As long as the conspiracy hasn't actually jailed you for it, then that's okay.

849
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,060
It's better than a job that doesn't pay much.

850
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,540
I don't care if you invented a cure for cancer if you weren't paid well for it.

851
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,320
Friend, you're a despicable fool.

852
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,840
I don't care if you spent the last year of your life in prison.

853
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:17,260
I don't care if you spent the last 10 years in dangerous situations trying to aid oppressed, starving people.

854
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,460
You're lower than scum if you didn't get rich doing it.

855
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,900
And that includes Mother Teresa.

856
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,900
Yeah, that includes anybody who doesn't call 823-7490.

857
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,040
Please, dear friends, as a matter of fact, right now we're about...

858
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,980
Oh, well, actually, we're about halfway.

859
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,120
About halfway to our goal.

860
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,480
Which is a very modest goal.

861
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:49,300
But we really do need every little dime.

862
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,240
And, well, I mean, I'm gonna...

863
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,700
We're collecting names.

864
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,940
We're gonna sing the names of those who have called in at the end of the show.

865
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,280
I hope we have a lot more to sing because that way we'll go through them quicker

866
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,220
and it'll be less painful for you in the long run in a funny, ironic sort of way.

867
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,120
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.

868
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,700
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.

869
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,180
That's the kind of sugar Papa likes.

870
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:13,940
Ah, that's what we like.

871
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,480
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed number.

872
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,240
Lots of...

873
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,580
Oh, 200 pesos.

874
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,920
Welcome, sweet little smackaroos.

875
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,560
Welcome, little smackaroos.

876
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,420
Hey, that's your number.

877
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,520
Oh, just look at that fat, rich, printed kind of sugar Papa likes.

878
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,720
Oh, I don't know.

879
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,540
Everything goes wrong with me.

880
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,240
Oh, the office.

881
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,920
Oh, some guy's there out to get me.

882
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,540
And then at home,

883
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,380
I don't know, my wife,

884
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,680
all the kids, you know, everything.

885
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,340
And then there's the payments due on the car.

886
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,600
Oh, it can be a bummer, dear friends.

887
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,780
It can be a bummer.

888
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,320
And there's one way you can make yourself feel a whole lot better about the whole thing.

889
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,680
I mean, I guarantee you, I hate to be corny about it,

890
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,260
but that's what we're forced to get down to now.

891
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,820
Please, please call 823-7490, make that pledge,

892
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,540
or just come on down to the station.

893
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,680
I mean, you can pick up a t-shirt.

894
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,260
Pick up an actual K&ON t-shirt at 4415 San Jacinto.

895
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,480
That's K&ON's address, San Jacinto and North Carroll, just east of Ross Avenue.

896
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,320
South, southeast, whatever.

897
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,220
Everything's cattywampus around here.

898
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,660
You can't figure out where anything goes.

899
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,780
And friends, I mean, you know, this is a horrible, horrible world sometimes.

900
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,460
And you need something to help make you feel better.

901
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:47,960
And one thing you can do is go ahead and, like that person did, just call in and spend it.

902
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:49,820
Music

903
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,000
The tale of a man who took a hundred dollars

904
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,360
Spent it on lottery tickets and beer

905
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,100
Won a couple million

906
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,120
Left his wife and children

907
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,620
Lived himself to death in a couple of years

908
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,380
Should have spent it on love

909
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,520
Spent it on his children

910
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,900
Spent it on the ones who needed the most

911
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,780
Take your little bundle

912
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,780
Put her in a basket

913
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,880
Leave her on the doorstep of a future home

914
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,480
I hear of an army

915
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,140
Taking lots of money

916
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,540
Spending it on guns and rolls of barbed wire

917
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,800
Blew it all away there

918
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,400
Homeless and they're hungry

919
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,040
Had to buy the good

920
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,820
Or taste the bloody war

921
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,660
Spend it on love

922
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,720
Spend it on the children

923
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,260
Spend it on the ones who needed the most

924
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,160
Take your little bundle

925
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,020
Put her in a basket

926
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:59,220
Leave her on the doorstep of a future home

927
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,700
Where the tummy and the belly of the billionaire

928
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,840
Swallowed by the music you play

929
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,720
And don't they have the right

930
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,520
That's a camel to the eye

931
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,080
Of a phonograph needle someday

932
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:21,980
Music

933
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,600
I hear of a country

934
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,420
Where they say the cities

935
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,180
All have pretty streets

936
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,020
That are paved with gold

937
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,180
They may not be gold but

938
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,260
They were built by

939
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,460
People paying heavy taxes

940
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,320
For a dream they still hold

941
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,000
Spend it on love

942
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,020
Spend it on the children

943
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:48,640
Spend it on the ones who needed the most

944
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,480
Take your little bundle

945
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,420
Put her in a basket

946
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,680
Leave her on the doorstep of a future home

947
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,580
Spend it on love

948
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,620
Spend it on the children

949
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,080
Spend it on the ones who needed the most

950
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,040
Take your little bundle

951
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,960
Put her in a basket

952
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,200
Leave her on the doorstep of a future home

953
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,060
Got to spend it on love

954
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,140
Spend it on the children

955
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,520
Spend it on the ones who needed the most

956
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,540
Take your little bundle

957
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,480
Put her in a basket

958
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,840
Leave her on the doorstep of a future home

959
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

960
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:29,780
Road to home

961
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,500
Music

962
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,620
Oh, yes, dear friends.

963
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,060
You know, you can still, you still have ten minutes

964
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,520
To get your soul out of hock.

965
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,900
That's where it is right now.

966
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,800
You know that, don't you?

967
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,600
It's in the bowels.

968
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,700
It might as well be signed up, signed up for Satan's doorstep

969
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,600
Or even worse, the regular ordinary Christian heaven.

970
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:06,700
So why don't you just, you know, get your foot in the door of Bob's, Bob's heaven.

971
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,840
The escape vessels of the excess friends.

972
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,220
You heard what Papa Joe mom was saying.

973
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,500
Does that mean nothing to you?

974
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,320
You just take that as a joke.

975
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,920
Is that all that is to you?

976
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,200
How we doing?

977
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,680
Will, Cecilia?

978
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,860
What?

979
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,680
Oh, we got four more since the last last time went up.

980
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,000
Doing great.

981
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:32,420
Well, those four shall be honored thoroughly.

982
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,660
But in the meantime.

983
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,540
Well, it's time that we stood up.

984
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,680
We believe that.

985
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,500
And the majority of Americans today are pro-biblis people.

986
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,600
And we are going to take a stand.

987
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,240
People you oppose are good Christian.

988
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,960
Tell me who I didn't say I opposed any of them.

989
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,200
Are you?

990
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,840
We don't have to say.

991
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,620
I don't think so.

992
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,760
We're giving them the credit.

993
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:01,820
We're telling them.

994
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,660
You're trying to.

995
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,900
Ten years ago, people did.

996
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,760
And I'm looking.

997
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,560
I don't know why all Democrats.

998
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,940
Are you going to force us to?

999
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,820
Well, you'll see it's very.

1000
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,620
Oh, oh, oh.

1001
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,200
Station's running down, friends.

1002
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,220
Can't you hear it?

1003
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,120
Tell you something else about the character of God.

1004
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,480
If necessary, God would raise up a tyrant.

1005
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:30,920
A man who might not have the best ethics to protect the freedom interests of the ethical and the godly.

1006
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,460
If they can't take a joke.

1007
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:39,700
You know, he's talking about.

1008
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,380
Eight to three seven four nine.

1009
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,920
Oh, please.

1010
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,860
Please have mercy upon our twisted soul.

1011
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,840
Dallas.

1012
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,900
They call it the buckle on the Bible Belt.

1013
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,340
And we're trying to unbuckle it.

1014
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:03,620
It has the largest quota of millionaires, the worst crime rate and one of the severest poverty rates in any American city.

1015
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,720
Especially this.

1016
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,100
Yet.

1017
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,020
Dallas could also be described as the most Christian place on this earth.

1018
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:15,060
It has the highest proportion of paid up church members in any city anywhere.

1019
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,540
And the majority embrace the most conservative form of Christianity.

1020
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,880
You're going to let him get away with that.

1021
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,100
Dear friends, please call.

1022
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,180
That's Paulson.

1023
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,100
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

1024
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,480
And this is the hour of slack.

1025
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,000
And station K.

1026
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,260
N.

1027
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,500
O.

1028
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:36,740
N.

1029
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,040
In Dallas, Texas.

1030
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,900
You know, I know where that is.

1031
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,660
Hello, Bob.

1032
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,420
This is the father.

1033
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:42,860
Good sir.

1034
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:50,140
Do you formerly Pope Maurice of the people's Catholic Church and all of my fellow popes from the people's Catholic Church?

1035
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,320
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius.

1036
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,520
Carry on.

1037
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,460
That's what we're trying to do.

1038
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,040
Yes, go on.

1039
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,480
Well, we're trying to understand.

1040
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,340
Don't you understand?

1041
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,840
I certainly don't.

1042
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,980
Why don't you call, please?

1043
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,000
Well, no, I'm not going to get down on my knees.

1044
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,620
I'm not going to get down on my knees and beg.

1045
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,960
I ain't going to do that.

1046
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,400
We've done that before.

1047
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:25,040
And it never does any good down the last five minutes of the show.

1048
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,640
We beg.

1049
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:27,620
We plead.

1050
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,460
We threaten.

1051
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,400
We cajole.

1052
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,520
We toady up to you.

1053
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,680
And I have.

1054
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,480
We've actually died on the air.

1055
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:35,940
I have.

1056
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,920
I don't know.

1057
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,100
I mean, in more ways than one, I suppose.

1058
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,920
But well, let's go ahead and and and read the names of those.

1059
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,360
Those boy few indeed.

1060
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,180
Few indeed.

1061
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,760
Well, I recognize.

1062
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,300
Thank you.

1063
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:00,300
I do recognize the great Gary Ben.

1064
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:01,820
Call.

1065
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,160
I will.

1066
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,860
The mighty Gary Ben.

1067
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,220
You're a long time fan.

1068
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,320
Call O'Brien.

1069
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:18,740
And thanks for the fan letter from Terry Lipscomb.

1070
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,500
Scum.

1071
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:22,940
Lipscomb.

1072
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,040
Irvin MacArthur.

1073
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,540
Oh, yes.

1074
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,780
And those truly are among the saved.

1075
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:42,860
Friends, friends, your names are writ in the book of humans.

1076
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,620
Actually, the book of subgeniuses is what it should be called.

1077
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,880
That the men from Planet X have.

1078
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:55,260
You shall be lifted up on that glorious day, X day, when it finally comes.

1079
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,860
July 5th, 1998, as you know.

1080
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,900
We'll be with you.

1081
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,240
Oh, in fact, there's something else we may be with you on that I probably should mention with this little cart.

1082
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,960
And we're going to see you next week.

1083
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:17,520
Now, those of you who haven't paid up, we'll meet you behind the public latrine there, okay?

1084
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,120
Just listen to this.

1085
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,140
It's the first ever.

1086
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,940
It's the first ever K&ON Bicycle Fun Ride and Picnic.

1087
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,480
And everyone is invited.

1088
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:42,320
The entire Dallas-Fort Worth community is invited to join K&ON on Sunday, November 12th, at White Rock Lake for a day of bicycling, volleyball, games, food, music, and more.

1089
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:49,280
There's a $12 entry fee for the bicycle ride only, which will also get you a free event T-shirt and lunch.

1090
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,440
However, there is no charge to join us for a day of fun in the sun.

1091
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,240
There are 15.

1092
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,440
There are 15 and 30-mile rides.

1093
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:03,340
And to register, come to K&ON at 4415 San Jacinto, Monday through Friday from 10 to 9.

1094
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,840
Call 828-9500 for more information.

1095
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:16,000
Be part of the first ever K&ON Community Picnic and Bicycle Fun Ride on Sunday, November 12th, from 9 till dark.

1096
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:21,140
It's at 700 East Wadler Drive at Tiffany Way at White Rock Lake.

1097
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,840
We hope to see everyone from the Dallas-Fort Worth community.

1098
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:25,760
There.

1099
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,260
That's November 12th at White Rock Lake.

1100
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,620
The first K&ON Picnic and Bicycle Fun Ride.

1101
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,940
We'll see you there.

1102
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,560
Have a great time.

1103
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,820
Yeah, we'll see you there, all right, friends.

1104
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,620
We're also going to be asking you whether you paid your dues.

1105
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,900
What kind of dues have most of you paid?

1106
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,720
Probably nothing.

1107
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,460
That's why you don't understand this show.

1108
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,220
That's why the ones that are sitting here, that's why they're sitting here.

1109
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,980
We're going to go out and have a party.

1110
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,480
You could have been part of this if you'd bought your way in.

1111
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:05,360
Please, actually, I mean seriously, we do have about two minutes left.

1112
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,100
I'm going to go ahead and just give it to Zug's Rift.

1113
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,400
What is that background I'm hearing?

1114
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,100
Oh, that's Leibach again.

1115
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:20,840
Friends, please call in the last two minutes, 823-7490.

1116
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,380
Or just send that money in.

1117
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:29,200
Send it to K&ON at Post Office Box 710-909.

1118
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,320
I'll give that number again.

1119
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,020
710909 in Dallas, Texas, 75371.

1120
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,980
Now, if you want information on the Church of the Subgenius,

1121
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,800
that's a whole other thing.

1122
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,920
I want you to write to a different post office box for that.

1123
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,980
That's Bob at Box 140306.

1124
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,360
DeLiber.

1125
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1126
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:02,620
DeLiber.

1127
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,340
No, I'm afraid not.

1128
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,380
Not this time, friends.

1129
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,060
823-7490, last chance.

1130
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,920
Last chance.

1131
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,540
We love you who have pledged and who will pay.

1132
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,840
And hopefully see you next week.

1133
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,880
Zug's Rift.

1134
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:25,920
Back in Parsippany, New Jersey,

1135
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,600
my daddy, who was on two weeks' leave from the Secret Marines

1136
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,660
based near a nudist camp outside of Fort Dix,

1137
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,360
took me to Morristown to have my eyes examined.

1138
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,740
We sat in the waiting room for almost an hour

1139
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,800
nervously thumbing through the magazines.

1140
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,820
Highlights, Goofus and Gallant was my favorite.

1141
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,040
While trying to ignore the occasional muffled screams

1142
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,360
we could hear coming through the wall.

1143
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,520
I remember watching Daddy salute some old photo of President Eisenhower

1144
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,300
in one of the mags and thinking how Ike would have looked better

1145
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,020
with lipstick and one of those propeller beanies.

1146
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,740
Wouldn't that be funny?

1147
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,740
He would have looked like some giant glob of monosodium glutamate.

1148
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,360
Hydrogenated dude.

1149
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,600
When my time arrived, I went into the doctor's office alone.

1150
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,460
There was a folding chair over to the side, and the doc said he'd be right with me

1151
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,960
as soon as he was finished with this last patient.

1152
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,980
His patient was some gray-haired, clean-pept, middle-aged man.

1153
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,120
He appeared to have a pleasant disposition.

1154
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:30,060
He smiled at me and called me lad, and I liked that.

1155
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,820
The nice man looked through this big machine that looked like it came from Mars

1156
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,900
and started reciting letters from the alphabet to Mr. Eye Doctor.

1157
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,560
When the doc pulled the machine away, the nice man leaned forward,

1158
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,120
opened his mouth wide and literally bit off the doc's entire face,

1159
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:53,040
swinging the now lifeless skin back and forth in his mouth like a dog.

1160
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,040
And the doc's blood sprayed all over my mom's mabley t-shirt.

1161
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,100
The doc's eyes were dangling in every which way and direction, and his nose was totally gone.

1162
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:10,520
His teeth looked like a skeleton, but with tons and tons of pulsating blood flowing from all the torn muscle tissue.

1163
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:16,660
He had a ghastly kind of skeletal smile as he gurgled and moaned and knocked into the machines,

1164
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,060
breaking a lot of glass and making a real mess.

1165
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,360
The nice man in the chair?

1166
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:29,180
Yeah, spit out Doc's face and began swinging from the overhead hanging light fixtures like a chimpanzee,

1167
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,580
laughing hysterically.

1168
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:36,580
Somehow the doc still had his glasses on with the blood squirting all over the inside of the lenses.

1169
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:43,680
He needed those funny trick glasses with the battery operated windshield wipers on them, except on the inside.

1170
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:50,680
The doc kind of reminded me of that photo of old Ike, but much more animated and colorful.

1171
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,260
The nice man?

1172
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:58,840
Yeah, the nice man soon dropped to the floor, pushed the doc aside, and ran out into the street right in front of a speeding bus,

1173
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,220
which squashed him like a grape.

1174
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:05,960
His glasses flew off just in the nick of time, however, into the gutter.

1175
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:13,680
My daddy, always prudent, quickly ran over to the puddle that remained of the nice man and picked up his glasses.

1176
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:18,820
Pleased with himself, he approached me and carefully placed them on my face.

1177
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,460
A perfect fit!

1178
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:25,640
I could see so clearly, too, and without daddy having to spend a penny.

1179
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,300
The end.

1180
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:47,920

1199
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:09,040
And thenpre Speaker doesn't really deserve that song, those of you didn't call in.

1200
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,400
That one was strictly for those who did.

1201
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,980
This is K and Owen 89.3 FM in Dallas Texas.

1202

Stay tuned for the K and Owen internal radio show.
