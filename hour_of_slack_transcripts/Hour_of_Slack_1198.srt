1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,140
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,600
Repeat.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,300
1, 3, 0, 1, 3.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,820
I am just a dog.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,020
20 million men have had abnormal sex.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,960
Find out how.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,620
The subgenius power of sex.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,980
Specifically designed to target mouth constipation for a full hour.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,040
What's happening?

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,000
Greetings.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,380
He didn't like what was going on.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,820
That's his tough luck.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm glad Daniel Thompson's on tonight.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,300
Greetings.

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,680
How are you doing?

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,360
Hello.

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,640
You're on the air.

18
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,240
Yes, I'm glad that you're on.

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,160
That caller just made me kind of feel pretty bad, I think.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,900
I'm glad that this is on instead of on.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,400
That's okay.

22
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,000
That caller is within his rights.

23
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,080
I have taken undue liberty in preempting the Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,920
Is that a group?

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,720
No.

26
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,660
It's a radio program.

27
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,400
And now, the program, the program, the program,

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,500
helping you view current events through the lens of

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,400
the program, the program.

30
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,600
Now, we're going to be dealing with, basically, I want to make you out there.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,060
And, boy, I'm all for that.

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,040
We can just do without that.

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,940
Theology.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,600
Program.

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,100
Program.

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,560
Um, okay.

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,400
Program.

38
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,040
Brains.

40
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,360
Right.

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,560
Abraham's bosom.

42
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,380
Bosom.

43
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,100
Started his own cult, Jews Don't Need Jesus.

44
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,500
And I came just a little bit.

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,480
I got so disappointed.

46
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,580
I don't understand.

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,540
I'm all for loving also.

48
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,480
But it's an abomination.

49
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,240
Mm-hmm.

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,480
Mm-hmm.

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
I don't need Jesus.

52
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,300
Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,480
Yeah.

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,860
You can get a hold of him at his website.

55
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,300
I and I.

56
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,100
All right.

57
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,340
Now, here's the thing.

58
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,220
I have to inject just a little bit.

59
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,380
A big 9 out of 10.

60
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,800
Bang.

61
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,060
I and I.

62
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,820
Please.

63
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,640
I hate.

64
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,920
I hate.

65
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,780
Oprah Winfrey.

66
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,580
9 out of 10.

67
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,060
Do you mind if I interject here?

68
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,640
Go ahead.

69
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,280
My emphasis is physical.

70
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,000
So I cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, bit of slack, slack, but I, but I, but I, but I, but I, but

71
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,440
I, but I, but I, but I.

72
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:06,620
True.

73
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,740
In 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

74
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,380
First floor.

75
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,500
Door's open.

76
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,620
Well, well.

77
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,180
Here we are.

78
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,240
What can I say?

79
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,340
I'm thrilled.

80
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,380
I want to congratulate you.

81
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,240
You made it on time.

82
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,020
Ours is a brand new world of all at once.

83
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,140
As the new electric technologies come into play, people are less and less convinced of

84
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,800
the importance of self-expression.

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,260
Bang.

86
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,700
Teamwork succeeds private effort.

87
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,060
Bang.

88
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,300
Make it.

89
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,320


90
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,100
Do it.

91
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,220
Makes us.

92
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,200
Hold up.

93
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Better.

94
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,760
Faster.

95
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,040
Throw me out.

96
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,880
Bang.

97
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,700
Hold up.

98
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,160
Make it.

99
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,460
Better.

100
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,120
Do it.

101
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,400
Faster.

102
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,060
Make sense.

103
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,480
Wander.

104
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,220
All the ever.

105
00:02:59,420 --> 00:02:59,740
Power.

106
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,620
After power.

107
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,640
Work is never.

108
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,180
Over.

109
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,740
Okay.

110
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,100
Father.

111
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,780
Make it.

112
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,100
Better.

113
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,720
Do it.

114
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,080
Faster.

115
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,640
Makes us.

116
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,040
Wander.

117
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,780
All the ever.

118
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,400
Over.

119
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,180
After power.

120
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,020
Work is.

121
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,380
Over.

122
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,460
Work is.

123
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:10,900
Harder.

124
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,360
Make it.

125
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,760
Better.

126
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,220
Do it.

127
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,680
Faster.

128
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,260
Makes us.

129
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,640
Wander.

130
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,000
Over.

131
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,320
Never.

132
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:14,840
Power.

133
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,820
After power.

134
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,600
Work is.

135
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Ever.

136
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,700
Over.

137
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,320
Pow.

138
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,160
Pow.

139
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,100
Automatic.

140
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Feel the panic.

141
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,100
Got to have it.

142
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,060
I'm the joker.

143
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm the smoker.

144
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,960
Off the Riddler.

145
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,720
Let the vid love play, play the theme Prophecy, made by DJ Supreme

146
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,960
Eliminated, terminator, exterminated With a style complicated by Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray

147
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,800
Lighting, fusing, making things so fresh and can you tell the difference?

148
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,140
You're the one who do the best, it's not the work you fight

149
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,120
You're rising, burning, can you extintate it? No, you can't get 30

150
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,300
Lighting, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning, burning

151
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,480
Time, time, like a chemical, burning you

152
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,800
You can't track, like a circus, run your poison, can you perceive that?

153
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,400
Big, big, big, big, big

154
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,920
Make it wanna, make it better, do it faster, make sense, grow your own

155
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,260
Man, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

156
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,620
Money

157
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,500
Get back

158
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,700
I'm a project, hands off my stuff

159
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,960
Talk about money

160
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,480
Money is a subject all people all over the world have in common

161
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,900
So why not talk about it?

162
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,320
If your friends don't wanna talk about it, you may wanna find a new group of friends

163
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,080
These are things I do on a regular basis

164
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,380
Once you begin that journey in your mind and in your heart, the rest of you should soon follow

165
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,740
Always remember that words are fruit

166
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:50,880
Money

167
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,620
It's a passion to be in

168
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,640
You can't try

169
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,220
You gotta find yourself

170
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,440
It can't be so easy

171
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,980
You are not aiming

172
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,320
In a place of ì‹ 

173
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,460
Too far away

174
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,400
You can't reach

175
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,180
Your destination

176
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,580
As you run

177
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:05,580


178
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,140
Damn right

179
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,520
You can't even look back

180
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,920
Existence

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,360
The solution

184
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,140
Don't let your doubts

185
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,380
Your thought

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,900
guitar solo

196
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:06,900


197
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,600
Would you like another cup of tea, dear?

198
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,120
Good evening, and happy

199
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,460
market on. I'm Bob.

200
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,140
Tonight, we witnessed a great moment

201
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,020
in the history of slavery. And now

202
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,680
finally, to the lunch counter.

203
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,140
Son of a mother, my own parents

204
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,060
party. All Americans party.

205
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,100
I was, what, four and a half months pregnant.

206
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,220
My mom and dad taught me

207
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,780
Americans, we don't care.

208
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,860
I still believe that. We need more

209
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,420
of that raging all around us.

210
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,480
Let me tell you, my dad, he would tell me,

211
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
Bob, you, the American

212
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,620
people, Americans don't care.

213
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,660
Huh. Let me tell you, we

214
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,540
do not need Disneyland, because

215
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,660
we believe cut, cut, cut, cutting, cutting

216
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,740
makes sense. Doctor, Katrina, ready

217
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,060
to go. That's ridiculous.

218
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,360
Surely, I'd never like it.

219
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,260
Trina, Harry, come and arrest me.

220
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,700
Huh. Love it, hate, love it, hate. We cut,

221
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,300
we cut, we cut, cut, cut, cut, cuts, cuts.

222
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,980
Americans can do that.

223
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,240
Huh. Surely, there's a lesson in this

224
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,620
experience.

225
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,640
Who lays

226
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,940
off in my brain?

227
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,540
Lending things

228
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,280
just don't seem the same.

229
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,660
I can't

230
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,740
funny, but I don't know why.

231
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,360
Excuse me

232
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,620
while I kiss

233
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,240
the sky.

234
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,760
Hello,

235
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,200
hello,

236
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,280
help me, help me, help me.

237
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,980
Oh,

238
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
yeah.

239
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh, no.

240
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,420
Oh, no.

241
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,060
Oh, no.

242
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,600
Oh, no.

243
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,040
Oh, no.

244
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,380
Oh, no.

245
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,600
Oh, no.

246
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,260
Oh, no.

247
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,820
Oh, no.

248
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,940
Oh, no.

249
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,280
Oh, relationship.

250
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,680
And this thing's going to keep

251
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,660
coming on, including the

252
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,220
shaking, shaking.

253
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,400
This is going to even save the

254
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,880
It's so awesome!

255
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:29,020
Can you hear me?

256
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,380
The most amazing thing...

257
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,080
Can you hear me?

258
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,040
Okay.

259
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,440
The most amazing thing...

260
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,040
Can you hear me?

261
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,080
It is not at all evident...

262
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,900
Why?

263
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,380
Underneath all the immense complexity and apparent randomness of the natural world,

264
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,040
there seems to be immense complexity and apparent randomness...

265
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,040
Or, or, the human mind can apparently understand...

266
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,360
A cat!

267
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,800
There is no compelling reason.

268
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,380
The human mind apparently apprehends nature on a t-shirt.

269
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,020
That is all you know on Earth and all you need to know.

270
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,140
We've got the Funk,

271
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,420
Forget the P-Funk,

272
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,840
We've got the C-Funk,

273
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,840
We've got the Funk,

274
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,640
The Underwater Funk,

275
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,340
We've got the Funk,

276
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,460
Forget the peafunk

277
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,660
We've got to see them

278
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,180
Underwater Funk

279
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,760
A strange little transition there

280
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,720
from Throwback Soul

281
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,780
and that's all I know about them

282
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,000
except that before that

283
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,040
some vocal rearrangements were heard

284
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,880
by the great Norell Preff of NorellPreff.com

285
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,500
interspersed between those great musical numbers

286
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,760
Daft Purple Psycho Hay

287
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,660
as you might call it

288
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,720
from The Kleptones

289
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,780
our latest Shorter for Savs

290
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,940
There are albums of this Kleptones stuff

291
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,180
for free download from Kleptones.com

292
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,600
That's Klep as in Kleptomaniac

293
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
with a K, K-L-E-P

294
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,340
Kleptones.com

295
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,760
The openings were by Mr. Eflin Moore

296
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,980
with a little bit of Daniel Johnston

297
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,260
on WFMU on our site

298
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,940
which is what this is the 1198th episode of

299
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,180
as you may have surmised friends

300
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,280
this would be a good one to use headphones for

301
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,600
Later you will hear the sexy and challenging rant

302
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,380
by Reverend Susie the Floozy

303
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,120
challenging for the broadcast radio version of the show

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,440
because Susie cusses like a sailor

305
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,420
but untainted for the internet version

306
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,480
at Subgenius.com

307
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,900
and now some material archived

308
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,840
by Reverend Noral Paff on the subject of how

309
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,220
to strengthen our economy

310
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,240
we need energy, energy, energy, energy

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,400
stop the, stop the

312
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,580
increase, increase, increase, increase, increase

313
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,920
drilling, drilling, drilling, drilling

314
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,880
no American hoes, hoes

315
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,400
we believe bureaucrats can do anything

316
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,960
Katrina, we believe that the children of America

317
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,320
said to be half underwater

318
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,680
and the other half under indictment

319
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,320
and today, corruption

320
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,680
dismantle the defenses

321
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,420
deep cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts

322
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,400
feed our enemies

323
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,480
we believe

324
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,820
our party got away

325
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,680
Republicans lost your trust

326
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,900
and rightly so

327
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,120
I say this

328
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,500
we cannot recover

329
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,860
America's best days are behind her

330
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,680
the most Brazilian economy

331
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,140
my fellow citizens

332
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,680
never forget

333
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,700
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

334
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,320
I have never, never, never, never done it

335
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,000
I have never done it

336
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,600
in the same stylistic way as Obama

337
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,020
in all my life

338
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,840
I'm just phony baloney, phony baloney

339
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,260
damaging and make no sense

340
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,420
sick, sick, dumb

341
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,380
you don't believe in God

342
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,100
all of you

343
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,940
you're sick

344
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,740
why, why

345
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm just telling people whatever they want to hear

346
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:06,500
you're sick

347
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,160
wow, wow, wow

348
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,980
got that big time last night

349
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,100
lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after lie after

350
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,700
phony baloney

351
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,260
scared to death

352
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,520
for your cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt man

353
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,940
oh, oh, you know it, you know it

354
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,520
agnostics, atheists, atheists

355
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,760
where are we?

356
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:25,960
hopeless

357
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,340
bop bop bop bop

358
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,860
Bob Trash

359
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,260
Last night these things happened

360
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,980
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

361
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,920
Oh Oh Trash

362
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
Sarah Palin

363
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,300
Sarah Palin

364
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,020
Trash

365
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,400
Doing

366
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,140
The people on our side are really making a mistake if they go after Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

367
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,340
Think

368
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,300
You think?

369
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,900
If you think

370
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,820
If you think

371
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,540
I don't want to hear from you ever again

372
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,260
Bob Bob Bob

373
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,780
Solid

374
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,060
Bob Bob Bob

375
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,280
He's brilliant

376
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,420
He's the real deal

377
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,220
I'm just

378
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm not

379
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,780
I have never done it in all my life

380
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,080
We'll kill him

381
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,300
Aw

382
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,260
Where is it?

383
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,880
Get him

384
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,880
Whoever

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:18,880


387
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:18,880


388
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,500
Killing

389
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:22,500


390
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:22,500

Professional

394
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Professional

395
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,060
Hello, good evening. Welcome to the 6 o'clock news.

396
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,740
At 6 o'clock...

397
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,540
President Bush's surprise message.

398
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,780
America is addicted to...

399
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,000
I must have dreamed a thousand dreams

400
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,360
Been haunted by a million screams

401
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,560
I can hear them marching feet

402
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,840
They're moving into the street

403
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,080
Now did you read the news today?

404
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,360
They say the danger's gone away

405
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,760
But I can see the fire's still alight

406
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,920
They're burning into the night

407
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,040
There's too many men

408
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,400
Too many people

409
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,680
Making too many problems

410
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,060
Not much left to go around

411
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,560
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

412
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,420
Say, here's your...

413
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,960
What?

414
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,280
Oh, Superman, where are you now?

415
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,880
What have you been good for?

416
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,500
Well, everything's gone wrong somehow

417
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,880
Look out!

418
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,360
The men of steel

419
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,000
The men of power

420
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,680
What have you been good for?

421
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,420
Losing control by the hour

422
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,320
Listen to me!

423
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,380
This is the time

424
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,720
This is the place

425
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,160
So we look for the future

426
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
Look out!

427
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,340
But there's not much left to go around

428
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,860
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

429
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
Say, here's your...

430
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,380
What?

431
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,500
This is the world we live in

432
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,300
What have you been good for?

433
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,300
And these are the hands we're given

434
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,100
What?

435
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,520
Use them and let's start trying

436
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:30,300
To make it a place worth living in

437
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,240
Look out!

438
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,700
Here we have a serious problem

439
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,160
What?

440
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,120
I have to live

441
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,100
Listen to me!

442
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,560
Oh!

443
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,860
I despise

444
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,600
Causing me destruction

445
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,840
Of this life

446
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
One least chance

447
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,880
To thousands of other lives

448
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,980
When their sons go to fight

449
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,500
And lose their lives

450
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,540
I stand alone

451
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,560
I won't be coming home tonight

452
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,360
What have you been good for?

453
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,380
My generation

454
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,240
We'll put it right

455
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,680
What?

456
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
We're not just making promises

457
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,080
What have you been good for?

458
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,120
That we know

459
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,680
We'll never keep

460
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,720
Listen to me!

461
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,860
Too many men

462
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,180
There's too many people

463
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,820
Making too many problems

464
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,860
And I must love to go around

465
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,960
Oh yeah

466
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,660
Can't you see this is a land of confusion?

467
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
Listen to me!

468
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,040
One

469
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,920
Well this is the world we live in

470
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,240
What?

471
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,040
And these are the hands we're given

472
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,500
What?

473
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,640
Say it, say it, say it

474
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,220
Use them and let's start trying

475
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,280
What have you been good for?

476
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,640
To make it a place worth fighting for

477
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,520
Stand up and shout it!

478
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,180
Here we have a serious problem

479
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,420
What?

480
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:53,740
What?

481
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:53,840
I don't understand anything!

482
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


483
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


484
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


485
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


486
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:53,840


487
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,060
Our nation has only one option.

488
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,300
We must keep our word.

489
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,660
Defeat our enemies.

490
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,460
The best way to break this addiction is through technology.

491
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,520
Technology.

492
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,400
Technology.

493
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,460
Technology.

494
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,140


495
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,960
The weather now and Darren's here again, hello.

496
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,460
1995.

497
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,120
2005.

498
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,820
Program.

499
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:12,380
Program.

500
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,500
2002.

501
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,620
Religious Asp.

502
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,420
Religious Asp.

503
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
I. U.

504
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,760
Fairy Tales.

505
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:19,980
1840.

506
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:20,760
The Wood.

507
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,100
The Wood.

508
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,560
Experienced phenomenal success.

509
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,660
And everyone present was thrilled, thrashed and pounded.

510
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,800
Blown away.

511
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,000
Thrashed and pounded.

512
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,580
Uh.

513
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,160
Why are you.

514
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,840
Oh no, this is a doom and gloom talk.

515
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,840
Be like Satan also.

516
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,280
What was I thinking?

517
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,540
I would like to be influenced and overcome by Satan.

518
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,340
The influence of Satan, very charming I thought.

519
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,720
I desperately needed his help.

520
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,480
A feeling of elation came.

521
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,060
He came over me.

522
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,340
And immediately the thought came to my mind.

523
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,780
An addiction to pornography.

524
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,680
This is a righteous desire.

525
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,940
Why doesn't he help me?

526
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,360
You decide to absolutely trust Satan.

527
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,280
Trust that he knows what he is doing with you.

528
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,540
And I am gay.

529
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,980
Oh, I'm going to be so happy.

530
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,760
Satan.

531
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,200
He will mold us.

532
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,700
Roll us out.

533
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,760
And cook us.

534
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,560
Suck us.

535
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:16,960
Suck us.

536
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,320
We don't understand what this really means.

537
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
But he does.

538
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,640
I am great.

539
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,380
I am great.

540
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,020
Suck us.

541
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:21,620
Listen to me.

542
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,000
What a bummer being you.

543
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Yes, she caught my eye as I walked on by.

544
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,360
She could see from my face that I was fucking high.

545
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,300
And I don't.

546
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,680
Think that I'll see her again.

547
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,700
But we shared a moment that will last till the end.

548
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,540
You're pitiful.

549
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,420
You're pitiful.

550
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,320
You're pitiful.

551
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,820
It's true.

552
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,780
It's true.

553
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,580
Well, you just can't dance and forget romance.

554
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,980
Everybody you know still calls you farty pants.

555
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,940
But you always have a job.

556
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:44,060
Well, I mean, as long as you still can work that slurpy machine.

557
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,940
You're beautiful.

558
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,740
You're beautiful.

559
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,760
You're beautiful.

560
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,760
You're beautiful.

561
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,380
It's true.

562
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,640
I saw your face in a crowded place.

563
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,480
And I don't know what to do.

564
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,420
Cause I'll never be with you.

565
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:14,840
You.

566
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,640
You.

567
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,120
You.

568
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:20,760


569
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:20,760


570
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:20,760


571
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,940
You.

572
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,420
You.

573
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


574
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


575
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


576
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


577
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


578
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


579
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


580
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


581
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


582
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


583
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:29,420


584
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,240
You're beautiful.

585
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:32,640
You're beautiful.

586
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,320
You're pitiful.

587
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,720
It's true.

588
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,280
There must be an angel with a smile on her face.

589
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,920
You still live with your mom and you're 42.

590
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,060
But it's time to face the truth

591
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,080
Well, it just sucks to be you

592
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Beautifully pitiful.

593
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,600
I don't know who created the original parts,

594
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,260
but that mashed tater is by National Cynical Radio of NationalCynical.com.

595
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,960
Before that, some media thrashed and pounded by Norell Preff.

596
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:38,980
And that great mix of War of Confusion mashup was by, yes, the Kleptones of KleptonesWithAK.com.

597
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,280
Or rather, KleptonesWithAK.com.

598
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,440
Now, a Lemurian Wormed Word from our sponsor.

599
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,660
Great Scott.

600
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,300
I can't stand you much more.

601
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,480
Great Scott.

602
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,160
You've got something in this room.

603
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,420
Something strange and magnetic.

604
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,660
Something behind the amplifier.

605
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,060
The South China Supermodel.

606
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,940
He's probably groggy from lack of sleep.

607
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,940
So, what are you waiting for?

608
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,500
My mom said my brother and I had to go to the dentist.

609
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,740
How do you feel about that baby?

610
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,380
I don't really know what to do with it.

611
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,760
You are not the father.

612
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,640
Everybody.

613
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,260
Everyone is so nice and happy there.

614
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,200
It was fun.

615
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,720
Maybe it's time you find out about a career in the beauty industry.

616
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,320
Ding.

617
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,680
That's me.

618
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,620
Oh.

619
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,740
Oh.

620
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,340
Grandma soon.

621
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,340


622
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,340


623
00:24:53,480 --> 00:25:00,420
We are the New York assists now!

624
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,860
That's it Ã§ok kima memili.

625
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,040
Let's begin to dream.

626
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,100
We are the New Yorkists.

627
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,620
NY hammer knocked off because we are now invited to the New Yorkies.

628
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,420
Lily brushes me off Prongagi.

629
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,680
Unfortunately, I'm not in Brazil.

630
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,020
Reverend Ivan Stang dropped so many nuggets of unassailable wisdom up here on the stage,

631
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,180
I didn't want to accidentally step in it, but what the hell.

632
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,360
I feel like a street sweeper in a parade after the elephants.

633
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,820
I'm the Reverend Susie the Floozy, the name that's on everybody's laps.

634
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,140
And just think of me as your own mommy weirdus,

635
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,240
trying to beat a little slack into you with a wire hanger of my voice.

636
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,300
And oh, what a lovely affair we're having tonight.

637
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, I almost did not want to come to the marvelous mid-Atlantic states during the holiday hysteria.

638
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,640
Oh, I mean, you're right next door in Washington, D.C.,

639
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,980
where they're having their annual festival of lies.

640
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,280
It's right in your backyard there.

641
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,480
And P.U., what a fetid wasteland.

642
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,120
I noticed the wind shifted just a bit to the south.

643
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
And oh, it's true what they say.

644
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,460
The more the pinker, the bigger the sphincter.

645
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,060
Washington, D.C.'s noisome reek permeates the sweet, clean air of Baltimore.

646
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Oh, it's nauseating vials stench,

647
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,940
the fives of the foul vapors arising from the mats of floating sewage in the harbor.

648
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,960
Oh, what a fucking garden spot.

649
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,220
But I am not here to savor Washington, D.C.'s horrible odors.

650
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,100
I am here to create some of my own.

651
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
And you know what?

652
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,260
You know what?

653
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,780
It's all about slack.

654
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,600
That's right, I said slack.

655
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,220
You know about slack.

656
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,320
Well, I'm here to lay down an ugly fact.

657
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,360
You give me an S.

658
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,380
S.

659
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:08,680
S.

660
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,840
Because all I got is lack.

661
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,640
I got a lack of slack.

662
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,340
It attacks my back.

663
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,780
My throat is whack.

664
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,100
My ass is extra cracked.

665
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,760
Don't ask about my sacroiliac.

666
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,300
I think I'm going to have a heart attack.

667
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,760
But they can just lick my crack.

668
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,940
Because I know I'm on the right track.

669
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,160
And that's a fact you can tell it to Barack.

670
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,620
We need money, froth, and bump.

671
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,220
And bump.

672
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,840
And slack.

673
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,260
You don't have to tell Motomac.

674
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,020
Where the fuck can you get some fucking slack?

675
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,000
Because we're each going to need a whole big fucking stack.

676
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,840
Because without it, Seekers, our future is black.

677
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,620
Oh, but does anybody listen to me?

678
00:27:59,720 --> 00:27:59,940
No.

679
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,900
How many years have I been trying to read my scattered flock?

680
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,820
And I mean scattered.

681
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,220
I'm not a

682
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


683
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


684
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


685
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


686
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


687
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


688
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


689
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


690
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


691
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:09,220


692
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:18,340
I mean, I've tried to lead you to that faux promised land for longer than I care to think about.

693
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,580
I've tried to give you that precious spark.

694
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,240
That nugget of truth deep within.

695
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,620
So that you know there is hope.

696
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,880
But after all these years, all I've done is given you all a big fucking hope habit.

697
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,660
And nothing has come from it.

698
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
Where are we, Seekers?

699
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,360
We're in bum fuck.

700
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,280
We're in lower bum fuck.

701
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:55,860
And I started thinking, life is so hard that a cat couldn't scratch it.

702
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,840
And why is that?

703
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,900
It's the con, man.

704
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,800
And nuts dang, there's a comma in there.

705
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,860
Fake slack?

706
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,620
Fake?

707
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,080
Yes.

708
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,060
It's a freaking conspiracy of the goddamn normal scum.

709
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,460
The conspiracy that hacks off your slack and then plays fucking keep away with it.

710
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,160
Oh, and they're so open about their agenda.

711
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
It isn't funny.

712
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,280
It's not just the fnords anymore.

713
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,060
No.

714
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,480
Everywhere in the pink media, their scaly tentacles tip their hands.

715
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,460
Even with that damn cutesy ass pirate craze.

716
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,060
That's just things.

717
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,320
I'm not there to distract you from the con's piracy.

718
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:57,400
The con tells you, no, the con informs you that life is supposed to be a bucket of steaming

719
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,500
black butter goat custard with a handle on the fucking inside.

720
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,360
But I'm here to tell you that you have an alternative.

721
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,040
You don't have to pick that bucket.

722
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,460
You can fuck it up.

723
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,380
Kick that bucket over on the fuckers and run.

724
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,560
Run for your lives because your lives as subgeniuses depend on it.

725
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,380
Praise God.

726
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,860
If only there were an end.

727
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,460
But no.

728
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,020
It's like what that old crotch, Edna St. Vincent Millay, once said.

729
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,960
She said, you know, life isn't one thing after the other.

730
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,800
No, it's the same goddamn thing over and over and over.

731
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,160
I feel like I'm running through the fucking Flintstones living room sometimes.

732
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,760
And it's only getting worse.

733
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,240
It's really been pissing me off lately, supers.

734
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,360
The discontent.

735
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,680
I say discontent.

736
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,760
It's cresting like briny scum on my spirits.

737
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,220
Oh, the despair.

738
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
The despair.

739
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,260
Oh, it humps my leg in slimes.

740
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,480
My soul is stinkin' too.

741
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,540
The pain.

742
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
The pain!

743
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,260
Well it pains me.

744
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,480
Last night I was so stressed for success that I was about to explode.

745
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,200
And I had to go and blow up, make myself a bed, and now I'm back in the hood.

746
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,200


747
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,200


748
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:44,720
out my ass and extra meditate on this problem. And I reached that divine state of shaktori.

749
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:53,540
Oh, and you know what? I started thinking that maybe I'm going about this all the wrong

750
00:31:53,540 --> 00:32:06,540
way. I mean, maybe I'm trying too hard. Maybe I ought to just give up. But wait, have you

751
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,180
ever noticed that when you give up looking for something, there it is? Tonight, tonight,

752
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:20,760
I was showing off my 1981 subgenius membership card that I've managed to hang on to for thick

753
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,520
and thin. I lost that.

754
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:30,960
That motherfucker. And what a grievous ass-clenching feeling to know that I was not going to get

755
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,180
my ass on the saucers. I had to have that one. A replacement wasn't good enough, and

756
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:42,900
I'd lost it. It was gone. And I finally just said, fuck it. I'm dicked. And the next thing

757
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,480
I knew, there it was in my purse where I looked for it like five times. So yes, perhaps there's

758
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
something to this giving up.

759
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,520
Like when you're trying to give up, you're not giving up.

760
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,200
You're trying to remember the name of some hack actor, and it's right on the tip of your

761
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,060
forked tongue, and it won't pop up until later when you're getting a knob job or something

762
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:16,780
and you yell, Abe Vigoda! When you get your knob job. It's a lot like that. Oh yes, give

763
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:23,180
it up. Give it up for Bob. Just say, oh, fuck it, and cast yourself off in the warm.

764
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:33,060
Urine warm waters of Bob's blessed slack. Splash around in your own flutes. Lie back,

765
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:52,880
relax, and let go. Because it's like Eugene O'Neill said in the Iceman comic, the lie

766
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:02,680
of a pipe dream is what gives life to the whole misbegotten lot of us, drunk or sober.

767
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,100
Oh, and it doesn't matter that Eugene was probably drunk off his ass when he came up

768
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:15,980
with that, because it's true. We need the lie of that pipe dream. Because I know for

769
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:22,700
a fact that with Bob, if we cling to him with faith, that there is nowhere to go but up

770
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,400
for the church.

771
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,100
Oh, and that's just the subject.

772
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,720
And I don't have to be such a genius. Yes, because I've been having to do a little community

773
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,500
service lately, just mainly emptying Stang's drool cup, and I don't want to talk about

774
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:44,840
the other things I have to do. I was kind of fiddling around while he was gone, and

775
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:51,400
I was, well, accidentally, you know, I kind of saw something accidentally while I was

776
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,840
dusting.

777
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,440
I was like, oh, I'm going to go back to the back of the underside of the bottom drawer

778
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,140
of his little top desk.

779
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:07,920
Well, I found the minutes from the last strategy meeting from Dobbs Town, Malaysia, for October

780
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,780
31, 2008. And it made me realize something. There is so much afoot in this church right

781
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,900
now that we are going to be in like freakin' flint when it all comes down. Sorry to tip

782
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,980
your hand, Stang.

783
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:30,220
Here is what I read. The high bi-bunal was pleased to announce the success of our church's

784
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:38,180
Hey Kids, Let's Destroy the World from Within initiative. The onrushing global apocalypse

785
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,180
is quite a feather in our cult's craft. Let's have a round of applause for Reverend Ivan

786
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,000
Stang, who, thanks to him, a lifetime supply of anything isn't a good deal anymore.

787
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:03,840
Our own mole in the White House, Bob's butt boy behind the hollow throne, Karl Rove, or

788
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,280
as we know him, Reverend Bubba Liverlips. He has done one hell of a job for this church

789
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,200
for, whoa, these past eight years, and we really cannot thank that man enough. I mean,

790
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,740
too bad Bubba's going to get the gur- I mean, a gold watch.

791
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,780
. . .

792
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:28,340
Is the reason why he doesn't need theë‹¤ê°€ one day . . .

793
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,960
. . this church.

794
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:28,960


795
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:28,960


796
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:28,960


797
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,840
But when I came back, they did suggest you come across the DEGRA follows,

798
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:32,980
a job he gave to And then, episode 19 followed that.

799
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:32,980


800
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,020
Apple astonished Mr. Stang. Iâ€¦

801
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,480
I recommend that my image be properly Rio.

802
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:42,620


803
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:42,620


804
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,100
Because, uh,

805
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,840
It's there.

806
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,760
laid out in any school textbook

807
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,900
in the fucking depression.

808
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,400
And they did not catch on.

809
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,240
Ah, we really

810
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,620
shouldn't gloat.

811
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,320
In fact, it succeeded beyond

812
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,580
our wildest dreams. We watched the

813
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,600
total colossal collapse of the

814
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,300
global pink financial empire

815
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,900
with the same jaw-dropping

816
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,400
shock and awe. I mean,

817
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,860
that was sweet.

818
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,560
But I'm afraid

819
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,480
we did not succeed in

820
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,060
monkey-wrenching their election.

821
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,780
Ah, but with all the projects

822
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,700
in motion, fat chance they're going to be able

823
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,300
to stop the fecal momentum

824
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,500
of our agenda.

825
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,740
On other fronts, I had a lot of

826
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,700
hopes for our habit trail for humanity

827
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,560
project.

828
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,880
But while the pesky democrats

829
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,160
in the White House, well,

830
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,640
it looks like we're going to have to drill their

831
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,080
holes in the damn things.

832
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,840
But the funny thing is they didn't bat

833
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,520
an eye at the little cyclone B

834
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,800
air fresheners we hang in each cubicle.

835
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,240
Ah,

836
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,760
ah,

837
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,500
but so often these projects

838
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,400
this planet will be looking like Keith

839
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,940
Moon's hotel room.

840
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,700
But there was something in the

841
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,500
back of Stang's

842
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,580
role-top desk,

843
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,740
taped to the underside of the

844
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,780
knee hole, next to all

845
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,560
these wads of chewing gum and a lot of

846
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,660
Stang head-sized dents

847
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,560
in the underside of the desk,

848
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,620
whatever that's about.

849
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,380
And it was one of those vanilla

850
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,540
folders. And it was

851
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,580
taped to the underside of the desk.

852
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:28,580
drawer and it said for half-toned eyes only and written on this folder seekers was something that

853
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:42,240

854
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:49,240

00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,800
Mhmm

939
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:55,820
Mhmm

940
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:55,820


941
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,060
Zipé›†

942
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,140
Zip, zip jin

943
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,140


944
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,960
Why the Yue han braid

945
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,180
Zip jaer

946
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,200
Get off your knees

947
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:32,160
Get off your knees

948
00:43:32,180 --> 00:44:01,280
Get off your knees

949
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:19,820
Get off your knees

950
00:44:41,400 --> 00:45:01,800
Get off your knees

951
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,160
Get off your knees

952
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:57,300
Get off your knees

953
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:25,320
Get off your knees

954
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:50,740
Get off your knees

955
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:32,160
Get off your knees

956
00:47:32,180 --> 00:48:02,160
Get off your knees

957
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:31,260
Get off your knees

958
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,160
Get off your knees

959
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:32,160
Get off your knees

960
00:49:32,180 --> 00:50:02,120
Get off your knees

961
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:32,160
Get off your knees

962
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,880
Get off your knees

963
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,480
Get off your knees

964
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,700
Get off your knees

965
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:46,160
Get off your knees

966
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,100
Get off your knees

967
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,380
Get off your knees

968
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,220
Get off your knees

969
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:58,720
Drive this way

970
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,840
But I've got some

971
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,040
In my hand

972
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,040


973
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,040


974
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,040


975
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,100
I feel

976
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,160
There are some

977
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,160


978
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,780
great and momentous object.

979
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,960
I am studied ambiguity and concealment.

980
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,780
I cannot, I can only say,

981
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,500
I do not, I do not contemplate deliverance.

982
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,460
And does the word deliverance still sound unintelligibly,

983
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,140
still impenetrable to the sense and meaning

984
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,760
of the deliverance.

985
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,360
I must, must pull myself together.

986
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,300
Good evening.

987
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,700
Oh!

988
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,460
The story of Ivan was filed under unsolved.

989
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,520
What? Story?

990
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,660
Story.

991
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,820
Yeah?

992
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,280
I know who he is.

993
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,500
You got time to listen?

994
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,020
Shoot.

995
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,860
Well, this begins in a stormy night long ago.

996
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,240
1924 was a howling wintry day.

997
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,660
Neighbors later testified to seeing Ivan's massive eyes

998
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,060
flailing open in the wind.

999
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,300
It was the last time they saw him.

1000
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,860
What happened then?

1001
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:23,720
He testified that Ivan covered with a piece of black velvet.

1002
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,640
Ivan, well, glad to see you.

1003
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,160
Yes.

1004
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,200
Thanks.

1005
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:29,820
Thank you.

1006
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,300
Uh, did you, um, get a lot done today on the head, I mean?

1007
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,620
See for yourself.

1008
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,080
Good.

1009
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,440
Come closer.

1010
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,900
Oh, I see.

1011
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,700
Here.

1012
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,520
You poor fool.

1013
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,960
Well, shall we start, Ivan?

1014
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,180
Yes.

1015
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1016
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,880
Why, Ivan.

1017
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,780
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1018
00:52:59,060 --> 00:52:59,860
How quaint.

1019
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,340
But tell me.

1020
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,800
Yes.

1021
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,820
Why are you so set on the head?

1022
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,440
Ah!

1023
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1024
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:09,820
I see.

1025
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,640
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1026
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,080
Ah!

1027
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,020
I'm tired of your stupid cat.

1028
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,000
Yes.

1029
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:18,740
One.

1030
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,180
Two.

1031
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,460
Three.

1032
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,440
Four cats with their heads cut off.

1033
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,720
And another one.

1034
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,880
It, it's good.

1035
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,100
And filled with all the exciting smells of good cooking.

1036
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,300
Get out before I break your neck.

1037
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,140
Six more times.

1038
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,340
What a story.

1039
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,200
It's a bum on a barge.

1040
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,480
Yeah.

1041
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,260
No.

1042
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,680
Well, Ivan died penniless and insane a year later.

1043
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,680
Good heavens.

1044
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,780
Ivan was raised in an asylum.

1045
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:52,780
That's right.

1046
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,540
I was raised in an asylum.

1047
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,820
You don't mean.

1048
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:56,940
Yes.

1049
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,580
Ivan.

1050
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,380
Ivan.

1051
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:06,080
Thanks to Lemur for that digital restoration from My Family Archives.

1052
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,280
And before that, Norell delivering.

1053
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,160
And before that, the Lemurian loan juror.

1054
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,960
And now, a question from Lonesome Cowboy Day.

1055
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,440
Can you answer it?

1056
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,760
If so, write stang at subgenius.com.

1057
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:20,720
Yes.

1058
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:29,540
Has anyone ever heard a mid-40s swing song sung by a female singer, probably white at

1059
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:35,200
the time, the type of swing band, called They're Saying Some Bad Things About You, Mr. Bob?

1060
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,260
I can't.

1061
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,420
I've heard this song numerous times and nobody can find it on the internet or anywhere.

1062
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,880
Anyway.

1063
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,420
Uh-oh.

1064
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,560
I'm sorry, caller.

1065
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,860
You did not get your message out.

1066
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,540
Yes, pal.

1067
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:49,960
Round three.

1068
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,900
I'd love to have you sing it.

1069
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,260
840-405-5-J.

1070
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,360
We're going to call the show.

1071
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:01,580
Now, you do know that Dr. Pete Goldie is hosting the showing of 2001 Space Odyssey tomorrow?

1072
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,720
Oh, tonight?

1073
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,200
Yeah, tonight.

1074
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,340
It's all relative.

1075
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:06,900
Yes.

1076
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,680
Tell exactly.

1077
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,860
It's all relative.

1078
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:10,680
What's that?

1079
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,060
Yes.

1080
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:11,440
What's relative?

1081
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,320
My relatives.

1082
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,040
My relatives are here?

1083
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,960
They tell them I don't want any.

1084
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,280
Your relatives are back.

1085
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,400
Yes.

1086
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:20,440
And they're beautiful.

1087
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,720
But look, they're straining the framework.

1088
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,400
They are.

1089
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,720
How can they do that?

1090
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,240
Well, they're growing by leaps and bounds.

1091
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,040
Occupancy by more than 49 tons is ethical and unlawful.

1092
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,100
They're definitely going to put a program through its various paces.

1093
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,720
They're snorting through their trunks.

1094
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,360
Yeah, I'm afraid that your frame, your firmware will not do the same.

1095
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,080
Cashier will have to hold their trunks.

1096
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,440
See, it used to be an octagon and now it looks more like a square.

1097
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,460
Well, they got a lot of enthusiasm.

1098
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,860
Whatever they end up with, there's more energy than I have.

1099
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,160
Wish we could put that in a bottle.

1100
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,060
That would solve the energy crisis right then and there.

1101
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,060
That would make sense.

1102
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:03,460
Click, click, click, click.

1103
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,000
Get it all, get it all in, right?

1104
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,960
Location, location, location.

1105
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,200
Kindergarten exercise.

1106
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,940
Frank has a small size.

1107
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,520
Physical evidence having gone off.

1108
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,060
Why?

1109
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:12,620
Why?

1110
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,540
There is not a God.

1111
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,260
There is not a God.

1112
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:14,640
Previous.

1113
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,200
Previous.

1114
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,120
There, there.

1115
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,340
Something is what it is.

1116
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:17,840
What it is.

1117
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,300
What it is.

1118
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,220
And is what it is not.

1119
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:19,860
What it is not.

1120
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:20,500
We are here.

1121
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,000
We are here.

1122
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,560
We are here.

1123
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,080
We are here.

1124
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:22,480
We are here.

1125
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,900
We are here.

1126
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,280
We are here.

1127
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:23,320
We are here.

1128
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:23,700
We are here.

1129
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:24,020
We are here.

1130
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:24,080
We are here.

1131
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:24,600
We are here.

1132
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,040
Planet Mars is in my pocket.

1133
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:26,440
Zip.

1134
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:26,780
Zip.

1135
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,300
Chemical processes in the brain.

1136
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,040
Brains.

1137
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,400
Brains.

1138
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:29,680
Brains.

1139
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,560
That would make sense.

1140
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,660
That would make sense.

1141
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:38,380
And if it doesn't, if none of this does, friends, then going to subgenius.com probably won't

1142
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,040
help much either.

1143
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,480
This has been the Hour of Slack, number 1198, from Praise Bob, the Church of the Subgenius,

1144
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,780
at Post Office Box 181417.

1145
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:56,320
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118, or subgenius.com, produced by the Subgenius Foundation and your

1146
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,560
host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1147
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,520
And now, stay tuned for The Bob Show.

1148
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,700
The Bob Show, brought to you by Bob Permanent.

1149
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:11,980
Perfect.

1150
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,520
Permanent.

1151
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:12,860
Perfect.

1152
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,560
And here he is, Bob.

1153
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:17,500
Smile.

1154
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,380
Stop.

1155
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:19,100
Smile.

1156
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:19,400
Smile.

1157
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,180
Stop.

1158
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,640
You bet your life.

1159
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,680
You bet your life.

1160
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,360
There is heaven right here on Earth.

1161
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:32,240
There is heaven right here on Earth.

1162
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,120
Home of the dick jazz.

1163
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,400
So come on, guys and gals.

1164
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,100
Won't you come along with me?

1165
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,060
Heaven on Earth.

1166
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,020
No fussy frizzy curls for this smart girl.

1167
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,360
She has a bob.

1168
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,760
The perfect permanent permanent tight kinky with a bob.

1169
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,540
Because bob is so easy.

1170
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,740
You can do it yourself.

1171
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,160
Just regular pin curls and gentle bob ocean.

1172
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,540
That's all you need.

1173
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,280
A bob, a bob new body.

1174
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,740
Make your next permanent a bob.

1175
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,920
Bob permanent.

1176
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,120
Permanent.

1177
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,340
Give yourself a bob.

1178
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,060
Give yourself a bob.

1179
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,860
Give yourself a bob.

1180
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,460
Give yourself a bob.

1181
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:22,540
You go bop bop bop and along with your bop

1182
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,280
My mama done told me

1183
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,280
My mama done told me

1184
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,280
My mama done me

1185
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,940
My mama done me

1186
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,680
A worrisome thing, a worrisome thing

1187
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,260
Train it, train it, train it, train it

1188
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,840
My mama done, my mama done me

1189
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,780
Never before a stick so red

1190
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,260
Redder than a fire engine

1191
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,140
See what stick can do for you

1192
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,820
The cump, the cump

1193
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,700
Long-lasting

1194
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,400
You'll just love Bob

1195
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,100
Be sure to listen again next week

1196
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,420
When Bob Perfect for Today

1197
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,320
Again brings you The Bob Show

1198
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,680
From Bobby Wood

1199
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,320
This girl knows that Bob

1200
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,640
Is the essence of romance

1201
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:06,760
Who tonight?

1202
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,660
But one of my very sacred memories

1203
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,260
Was, uh

1204
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,400
Uh, uh, uh

1205
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:17,600
Uh

1206
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:17,800
Uh

1207
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:17,800


1208
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:17,800


1209
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,120
Uh

1210
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1211
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1212
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1213
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1214
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1215
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1216
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1217
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1218
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1219
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1220
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,120


1221
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:18,760
And

1222
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,900
And, uh

1223
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,880
And, uh

1224
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,720
But, uh

1225
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:27,720


1226
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,280
But, uh

1227
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,660
I mailed him the, uh

1228
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,120
Promise

1229
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,040
It was really just awful

1230
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,960
I'm the little lonely.

1231
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,820
The animals.

1232
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,420
No.

1233
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,340
Die ain't too particular.

1234
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:02,860
Yeah.

1235
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,940
But, uh, yeah.

1236
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,780
Well, goodbye.

1237
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:08,600
Goodbye.

1238
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:08,980
So long.
