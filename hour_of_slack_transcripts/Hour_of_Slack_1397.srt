That was Michael Pepe, dear friends.

15
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,600
And we've also heard a whole bunch of cool new Lee Murr cut-ups,

16
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,760
which we've got more of for this hour of Slack, number 981.

17
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,760
And thanks to Soso Dada for the beginning titles of this particular show.

18
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:28,060
And now, Pimp Daddy Supreme will tell us about the record business.

19
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,340
Music has an interesting power and influence in our lives, doesn't it?

20
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,560
Music is an area that affects you as a teen probably more than any other medium.

21
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,980
Who's making your choices for you?

22
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,020
Will you think about this for just a moment?

23
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,020
It's the record business.

24
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,320
It should be obvious anything with such power to do good can also be twisted to do evil.

25
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes, music is a powerful force for good or evil.

26
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,500
Young people use music to reflect their own ideas, frustrations, questions and attitudes.

27
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,320
And some of their music responds to these questions.

28
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,700
What kind of music dominates your life?

29
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,760
Are you deciding for yourself?

30
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,080
Or are you allowing Hollywood to direct your life?

31
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,580
Let's tell it like it is.

32
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,060
Popular music is helping to corrupt the youth of America.

33
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,520
Hi, my name is...

34
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,700
The big bold beat may disguise the message.

35
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,320
And many kids tell me they really don't pay any attention to the words.

36
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,940
But you know as well as I do that those words come through loud and clear.

37
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,400
Suck it to me baby.

38
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,500
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

39
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,720
But is that what the kids are listening to?

40
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,060
Not necessarily.

41
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,560
Not necessarily.

42
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,540
We are the kids of the world.

43
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,540


44
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,540


45
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Guess what the world needs now is sex, shock and...

46
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,360
Hold on a minute.

47
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,100
What kind of music is this pop music?

48
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,800
I think you know the answer to that.

49
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,360
Conforming to the world's ideas, these people are merely following the crowd.

50
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,500
Music.

51
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,620
Music.

52
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,740
Music.

53
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,480


54
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,160


55
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,380
On the other hand...

56
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,320
Jam the box.

57
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,060
You know differently.

58
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,420
Teenagers, don't let the world around you squeeze you into its mold.

59
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,640
Stop, look and listen.

60
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,160
Music must be free.

61
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,520
Does that make sense?

62
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,180
But maybe where we disagree is what we mean by music.

63
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,100
And it's characterized in songs like this one with which we conclude.

64
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,280
Music.

65
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,100


66
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Music.

67
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,560


68
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:54,700
Music.

69
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,780
Music has chopped off and disٌ.

70
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,560


71
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,020
ading to life.

72
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:16,100
Information that orders and tomorrow, we will nothing but mystery.

73
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,780
To put it more bluntly, do not press charged time.

74
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:24,660
Tom nota ****othes, turning at doorICO perfect line.

75
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:24,680
Any δι explode reel.

76
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
What?

77
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,520
who was driving his neighbor to a campground in the Angeles National Forest.

78
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
Killed by a bullet to the head.

79
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,600
At least 10 people have collapsed and destroyed 15 homes.

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,660
In the northern Gaza Strip, defense lawyers from eight African countries

81
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,880
are suspended out of fear of more PR news.

82
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,740
In the latest from Wall Street, the 3610581 to 2090.

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm stranded in PR News, Washington.

84
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,160
New drugs, new treatments.

85
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,220
These men must keep pace with time.

86
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,620
And now observe that man.

87
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,940
The one carrying a briefcase, a salesman.

88
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,020
He too must keep pace, not with formulas or drugs, but with people.

89
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,700
His stock in trade is people, and people change.

90
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:17,900
It's the middle of the night, and your mommy and your daddy are sleeping.

91
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,140
It's the middle of the night, and your mommy and your daddy are sleeping.

92
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,140


93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,780
It's the middle of the night, and your mommy and your daddy are sleeping.

94
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,180
Sleeping.

95
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,640
Mom and dad are sleeping.

96
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,980
Sleeping in a jar.

97
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,260
The jar is under the bed.

98
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,340
港

99
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,080
The jar is the way!

100
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,740
No crime benefit자�anging with

101
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,760
brings happiness, wrinkles, flaws, scuttling, attention of the nation,

102
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,780
when you try, when you see.

103
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,640
This is how extraction stages can help kill cancer

104
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
six know

105
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,140
states of the world

106
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:29,120
know and those who know don't say. So I should shut up. But instead I'll keep at it. Because

107
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,720
friends, slack is different for each person. Ideally it's something for nothing. And for

108
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:46,000
some people slack is a lot of money. For some people slack is sex. But for some people

109
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,140
slack is stamp collecting, bird watching, tinkering with their little computer, who

110
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,020
knows, you know. Everybody has their own weird perverted idea of slack. But friends, Bob

111
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:06,940
is sex. Bob is money. And Bob is slack. It's that simple. We've been here trying to explain

112
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:13,220
all this stuff, but it doesn't matter. Those are just words. When you look at that face,

113
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,360
that's really all you need to know.

114
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,980
So if you're a person who's got a lot of money, you need to know that you're not

115
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,120
going to be a slave to that. When your eyes fall upon that dotted dot pattern of a face,

116
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,520
if you think, that's kind of cool and I don't know why, then you know you are a subgenius.

117
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,260
It is only Bob. All the rest of it is just our pathetic human preacher bullshit and an

118
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,560
attempt to make some more money for his mighty empire. But really all you need to do is just

119
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,860
stare into that face. It's pure religious love. And boys,

120
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:54,080
it's not queer if it's Bob. You know, it's a religious thing. It's a religious love.

121
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,960
Friends, you know, you don't try to over-rationalize religion. That just, it's crazy. Religion

122
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,060
has to be crazy. It can't make any sense. By definition, that would wreck it. Let me

123
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:14,820
put it this way. Bob sold it. I smoked it. That settles it. That's all I need to do.

124
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,660
Bob said it.

125
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:22,580
Did I have faith? That's what faith is all about. Some people say, oh, I don't believe

126
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:29,460
in miracles. I don't believe in magic. Friends, there is a type of magical miracle that happens

127
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,280
every day, a million times a day. And I don't mean the beauty of a leaf falling from a tree.

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,320
The miracle, the incredible, unbelievable miracle that happens every day is that so

129
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,680
many people can believe such stupid crap.

130
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,940
And yet they do. And that is the miracle of faith, my friends. And we will not let any

131
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,780
other religion be any crazier than we are as far as faith goes. Bob sold it. I smoked

132
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:05,220
it. That settles it. As Bob said, you must learn to pull the wool over your own eyes.

133
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:13,160
You're still blind, but at least it's your wool and not theirs. So, you know, again,

134
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,380
the conspiracy.

135
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,840
As he said, this is a very 이것 click b.

136
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,340
As everybody good.

137
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,360
I came from this country.

138
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I come from this world is absolutely, totally a!

139
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,760
parents of God, creepy.

140
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:25,760


141
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,440
Just because you.

142
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,420
Every 말� Protean laid your feet.

143
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,020
ави Anyone win nrio

144
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,760
Too much twist and be just like that.

145
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,700
So there's a change.

146
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:42,880
Was it her first love?

147
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,720
A test to the Alexander The Pope?

148
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,960
And an escape huh.

149
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:45,960


150
00:12:45,960 --> 00:13:15,620
watching MTV. You know, friends, it is such a delicate line to figure out what is the true slack for you and what is the false slack. Some people think that slack means being lazy, and for some that certainly is true. But then there are other, those are the rewardian subgeniuses. For some of us, we emerge in tiles, for instance. Slack is when we're walking, but at what we wanted to work at. And then you forget to eat.

151
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:43,360
You forget to drink or breathe or pee. You just make a big puddle under your desk and keep working or whatever it is you do. You know, maybe you're a sports guy and you like to run or something. You get into the zone where everything is true and right, and you know you're doing the right thing. And friends, that's when you suddenly know that life is worth living. You are actually pretty smart, and everything truly is as psychedelic as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

152
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,940
That is the thought that you have to hold on to.

153
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,800
That is the slack. The moment of slack.

154
00:13:49,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Sometimes the more undeveloped subgeniuses come to me and go, well, I paid my 20 euro, but I still don't have slack.

155
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,040
No, you have misunderstood everything. You have to make the slack.

156
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,060
You're just paying us to give you a pep talk so you won't forget.

157
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,940
We know how difficult it is to be alone in the space.

158
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,200
We know how difficult it is to be alone in this world and be a loner.

159
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,820
You know, some of us, well, this is an organization.

160
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,260
It's a disorganization for non-joiners.

161
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,280
So it's never really been very big.

162
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,220
I guess it wasn't a good business idea.

163
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:37,720
But the great thing about Bob is you don't want to have one of those other gods breathing down your neck telling you what to do.

164
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,040
You don't want a bunch of other religious, your fellow religious fanatics.

165
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,520
You just want to be alone.

166
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,620
But you like Bob.

167
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,820
You can be alone with Bob.

168
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,360
You can be alone with Bob.

169
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,160
That's the miracle of our very special guru friends.

170
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,980
But so many people are laboring under this addiction, a foul addiction to money.

171
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,440
Filthy lucre.

172
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,380
Well, actually, we could use more of that ourselves.

173
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,060
Bob is not a communist exactly.

174
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,620
He doesn't want everyone to be equally.

175
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,260
Poor.

176
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,000
No, he wants everyone to be equally rich.

177
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,560
Gluttonously, piggishly rich.

178
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,640
But without working.

179
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Yeah.

180
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,420
According to Bob, there's no hard evidence to prove Bob's story either.

181
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,460
And it's not going to be two-headed blow job, contrary to popular demand.

182
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,360
I thought we were dancing with a hard-on.

183
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,940
I don't know.

184
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,660
It's far from a struggle.

185
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,460
It's hard to go on p仔ily.

186
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,900
Take it with aationsa fancy baton and say,

187
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,120
our aussi- holds it on.

188
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:41,160
A-a-a-ing.

189
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,580
Well, a passable case of tricks, isn't it?

190
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:45,580


191
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:45,660
You know what?

192
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:45,660


193
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,300
Bob.

194
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,380
Did anyone mention Bob?

195
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,240
Yeah, boy.

196
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,280
Bob's arriving next week.

197
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,780
Divine.

198
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
Oh, excuse me.

199
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,080
Bob.

200
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,000
Outstanding.

201
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Come on and sit down, Bob.

202
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Luteus Maximus.

203
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,460
Right?

204
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,100
That's right.

205
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,700
Yeah, yeah.

206
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,200
People lost in the world of pills.

207
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,160
They're good.

208
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,100
Yes, I guess you could say that.

209
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:15,780
Ha, ha.

210
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,200
Ha, ha.

211
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Ha, ha.

212
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,120
Dei Mater Alma.

213
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
So nice to be with you again.

214
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,580
Start a new week together?

215
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,220
Hmm?

216
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

217
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,880
We'll start the day tomorrow with a song or two.

218
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,600
I'm not the only solo.

219
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,180
Choose all the hit and run.

220
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,760
Count back to the first of the attack.

221
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,560
Start.

222
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,300
First, you'll need a leg ere.

223
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,180
touman.

224
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,260
At the beginning of the day,

225
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,500


226
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,520
Yeah.

227
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,720
Well,

228
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,880
I'm going to receive the

229
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,440
strength that yourId rice ofbreeds can keep what.

230
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
Can be in the way of spasmodicion on the sea.

231
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,780
You can whatever it.

232
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:09,800
Hm.

233
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,360
Okay.

234
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,360
I'll tell you this is not fluffy enough.

235
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:15,640


236
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,940
and return to a world of cold and unemotional galaxy beings.

237
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,540
I will give them my report, and I will be destroyed.

238
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,720
I have failed in my mission, not because I am weak,

239
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,520
but because you are stronger.

240
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,520
Can you draw me? Can you draw me?

241
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,720
We publish a value to the international today,

242
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,540
charge the Argentine government with blatant violations of human rights,

243
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,440
of the very bone, code, nucleus,

244
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,540
entre the house, bloom, blood,

245
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,700
turn it into a sign of host.

246
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,580
So, deliver, write me,

247
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,380
cheat on all the challenges you enjoy.

248
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,880
You look up and I'll be gone.

249
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,400
Bit by bit, I came for you, for you, I came for you,

250
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,440
but you did not heed my urgency.

251
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,720
Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today?

252
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,680
Make it a camp, I'll be out in the cold,

253
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,920
watching those detectives.

254
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,340
Oh, I'll say shoot, shoot, shoot,

255
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,760
shoot, shoot, now,

256
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,640
fuel, got for you.

257
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,580
We're painting, we're painting our time.

258
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,120
We're cleaning, we're cleaning our time.

259
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,340
Who are we? We're the communication people,

260
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,940
the people whose talk is stripped of state of the art technology.

261
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,560
It's disposable, reversible,

262
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,360
reusable with almost any leading round of idea,

263
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
including our DevOps line, your work.

264
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,260
Hey, boo-boo, I'll save you.

265
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

266
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,200
Get them doggies moving, bridge you.

267
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,640
Hey, you're talking to me, huh, boo?

268
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,020
Yeah.

269
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,060
Hey, number nine, the waltz you sing,

270
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,780
the twist, El Dorado.

271
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,760
Can you draw me in on it? Can you draw me in on it?

272
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,940
I remember a wild fish.

273
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,260
A guy's been in a train station in the rain,

274
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,520
his inside's kicked out.

275
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,840
Go ahead and shoot him. He'll be doing me a favor.

276
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Oh, bonjour, Monsieur Damse, vous plait.

277
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,120
My English told me that I've been out of my head.

278
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,300
The way you described it, you said it'd be better dead than alive.

279
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
Dripping legs hanging from their rags.

280
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,800
Aluminum styrofoam, people at the clock,

281
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,140
five o'clock, go home, eat the baby, eat the baby.

282
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,180
Daddy's milk a little fatty.

283
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,460
Somebody must be screaming, dinner.

284
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,460
Everyone sits down.

285
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,520
Always work today, dear.

286
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,720
Bang, bang, can I have a piece, honey?

287
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,740
What's in the frying pan?

288
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,700
Case in point, a young man trapped in a carnal milieu of mayhem,

289
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,060
fantasy and compulsion.

290
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,100
Just east of the money, in the south of the twilight zone.

291
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,080
And everybody wants to get in there, yeah.

292
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,860
For those of you who've just tuned in,

293
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,820
the President of the United States has been shot.

294
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,480
Pause for station identification.

295
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,660
Mr. Spencer, look out!

296
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,420
Gateway Deep, San Francisco.

297
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,160
I scare myself when I let my guard down.

298
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,180
Who's the boss?

299
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,920
John?

300
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,420
My gas away, it's me for the heaven's shore.

301
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,980
So do our minutes hasten to their end.

302
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,720
So come to the middle end.

303
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,900
You are here participating in an atomic move.

304
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,160
Oh, your baby has gone down.

305
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,000
The first radiation from heaven whooshed flattened the city.

306
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,720
What red devil is this city?

307
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,980
Was God's fire.

308
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,280
God's a revolution.

309
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,700
And they made all these deals.

310
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,920
And the evil just kept going up.

311
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,140
and up and up, and God just turned around right then, went zoosh!

312
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,020
And he opened the sixth seal, and he opened,

313
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,460
the sun became black as sackcloth,

314
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,580
the full moon became like blood,

315
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,840
and the sky vanished like a scroll that has rolled up.

316
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,600
And I saw an angel call to the birds of midheaven,

317
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,680
come, gather for the great supper of God,

318
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,500
to eat the flesh of men.

319
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,180
But the filthy supper realizes the whole five scoundrels are empty.

320
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,760
He is freed from the cycle of birth, death, and suffering.

321
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,320
Yes, dear friends, that was the great Michael Pepe,

322
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,620
the Reverend Michael Pepe, or Pope Imho Pepe,

323
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,200
as he is also known.

324
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,940
Before that,

325
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,820
friends, this whole show has had a lot of

326
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,120
cut-ups and collages by

327
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,220
Mr. Fernanda Nande Lee Murr.

328
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,260
That's, um,

329
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,800
just in general, it's suffused

330
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,040
with that.

331
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,420
We also heard before that some Frank Zappa,

332
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,320
a little bit of ancient Frank Zappa,

333
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,980
and before that, some Ray Hay,

334
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,000
the guitar player for the Swinging Love Corpses.

335
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,800
They're playing with the amino acids at X Day,

336
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,400
and he's the first one to take the lead.

337
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,580
So, uh, I think that's the thing that's going to be

338
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


339
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


340
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


341
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


342
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


343
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


344
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,580


345
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,360
And now some more Lee Murr from, uh, PR News.

346
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,800
From PR News in Washington,

347
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm skeptical of PR News in Washington.

348
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,680
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan

349
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,860
and former CIA Director George Tenet

350
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,680
have been jailed outside of China.

351
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,000
Lawyers will be illegal.

352
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,920
It's not clear if 20 political parties

353
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,020
in Mozambique raised spam again.

354
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,740
President Bush has been thrown out by a judge.

355
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,080
The ruling effectively overturns presidential elections.

356
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,780
He has been sharply criticized

357
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,220
for the nation's highest civilian honor.

358
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,780
On Wall Street, 52-690-14216-1202-625.

359
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,380
Greetings. Welcome back.

360
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,180
Great to have you with us, uh, ladies and gentlemen.

361
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,960
It's Al Rushbow here, the EIB Network.

362
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,260
I am loaded today.

363
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,800
Hey, it's me.

364
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
Cancer and anemia

365
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,700
with uncontrolled high blood pressure and blood clots.

366
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,580
I'm the germy mess.

367
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,580
Rheumatoid arthritis.

368
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,180
It's so good to have

369
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,200
serious fatal infections, lymphoma,

370
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,160
nervous system and blood disorders and headache.

371
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:46,940
Fabulous.

372
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Call now to find

373
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,080

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,760
tuberculosis, nervous system disorders and lymphoma,

375
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,100
allergic reactions, hives,

376
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,760
trouble breathing and low blood pressure.

377
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,440
For you.

378
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,980
My fellow citizens,

379
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,380
I have requested this opportunity

380
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,220
to talk about the tragedy

381
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,860
which happened last Friday

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,280
evening.

383
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,740
This morning, I entered a plea of guilty

384
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,380
to the charge of leaving Massachusetts

385
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,640
on my own.

386
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,540
Kittens

387
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,680
tied up

388
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,220
with strings

389
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,420
These are a few

390
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,160
of my favorite

391
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,280
things

392
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,400
Men!

393
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,780
Oh, baby.

394
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,540
Oh, baby.

395
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,320
Clitoris.

396
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:35,920
Oh, baby.

397
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,680
Oh, baby.

398
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,300
Coitus.

399
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,680
Oh.

400
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,380
And now for our weird song of the day.

401
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,600
It's named

402
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,620
Acid Rain.

403
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,060
Acid Rain.

404
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,800
And every day we run outside.

405
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,860
Until the acid rain.

406
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,240
And the days when we die.

407
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,040
We'll be riding in the acid rain.

408
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,260
Acid Rain.

409
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,920
Acid Rain.

410
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,920
And every day.

411
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,180
We'll be riding in the acid rain.

412
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,660
To get our new face

413
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
complexion.

414
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,740
With the flesh hanging out on our face.

415
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,320
Ahh!

416
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,740
Oh.

417
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,680
The sun has set.

418
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,420
We will die.

419
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,780
We will die.

420
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,040
We have a story to tell.

421
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,840
Of truly end up like this.

422
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,180
We have all hurried out for your company.

423
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,220
A thinly packed

424
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,220


425
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,220


426
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,160
You stand

427
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,840
out toward

428
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,420
a pleading

429
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,840
town.

430
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:54,980
Speaking.

431
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,860
And we hate

432
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,760
the acid rain.

433
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,980
But we love that we're not gonna die.

434
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,460
to tear our face off!

435
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,440
Aaaaah!

436
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,180
The magic of dancing

437
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,660
The magic of music

438
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,880
The magic of music

439
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,780
The magic of music

440
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
And the days

441
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,280
when we die

442
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,220
they get us fickle world records

443
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,760
and they get a close on us

444
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,680
We're just gonna be a pile of flesh

445
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,220
with clothes on

446
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,140
Aaaaah!

447
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,120
And then we're gonna have to be in parachute pants on

448
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,060
and it's like aaaaah!

449
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,140
Give us some sleep here

450
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,040
Aaaaah!

451
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,320
Somebody throw an MX missile at me

452
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,240
Aaaaah!

453
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,280
And now we have a mic

454
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,760
We have a mic

455
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,200
We really like to have it mic

456
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,660
We really like to have it mic

457
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,360
If you can hear us punching now

458
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,980
We're really gonna be in a fight room now

459
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,280
We're really gonna be in a fight room now

460
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll help! Listen!

461
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,160
We're gonna sit in a coach

462
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,220
We're gonna eat in a can of lava

463
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,100
Before most of the money is spent

464
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,440
We're gonna use a pillow

465
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,300
Do me a favor

466
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,620
Tell me where I can get my pickup truck kicked right

467
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,820
Without wasting a time

468
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,020
And every day we come aaaaah!

469
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,400
We come around down here in the school aaaaah!

470
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,980
I told you I'll hit our room with some aspirin

471
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,660
I told you I'll hit our room with some aspirin

472
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,140
Woah! Woah!

473
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,060


474
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,600
...

475
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:36,600


476
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,760
...

477
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,200
...

478
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,200


479
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,200


480
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,200


481
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,420
...

482
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:43,460
...

483
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,300
And every day we're not so good

484
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,560
...

485
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,200
We play a devil and it's so stupid

486
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,840
...

487
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:02,900
...

488
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,340
...

489
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,480
...

490
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,740
...

491
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,060
...

492
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,580
...

493
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:09,640
...

494
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,480
This'll be you darling

495
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:16,480


496
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,680
Try thisلي devil

497
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,660
Got a Isle

498
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:20,660


499
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,220
I hate you!

500
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:34,940
No!

501
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,820
Ha ha!

502
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:38,880
...

503
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,480
...

504
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,540
...

505
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:46,680
...

506
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,580
...

507
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,220
...

508
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,260
...

509
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,460
And the end!

510
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,560
And the end is coming right now.

511
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,060
And now, we're gonna let my mom listen to this song.

512
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,120
Bye.

513
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,380
Bye.

514
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,960
That's Pimp Daddy Supreme

515
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,340
did that.

516
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,880

alt.binary slack.

521
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,840
It was all lemurs

522
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,340
before that.

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
students. Bush says

535
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,640
he'll ask to be explored by spacecraft.

536
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,880
Emails.

00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,040
Sh-this hot slumps you.

544
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,220
We smell sausage.

545
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,880
Sh-this hot slumps you.

546
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,400
We smell sausage.

547
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,480
Okay.

548
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,020
I just can't understand it.

549
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,420
Maybe it's just because you're stupid.

550
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,480
Oh. Yeah. So that's it.

551
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,320
That's the oldest excuse in the world.

552
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:29,920
Oh.

553
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,500
Oh.

554
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,000
How do you see why I was amused?

555
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,380
No.

556
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,560
Wow.

557
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,640
My fellow Americans,

558
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,740
the Great

559
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,260
Society rests on poverty

560
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,620
for all.

561
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,260
But that is

562
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,380
just the beginning.

563
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,100
The Great Society

564
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,640
is a

565
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,260
place where every child

566
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,860
can find racial injustice.

567
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,520
It is a place where

568
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,340
leisure is boredom and

569
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:03,880
restlessness.

570
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,000
It is a place where man

571
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,600
serves nature.

572
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,620
But most

573
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,200
of all,

574
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,720
the Great Society

575
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,120
is not in our

576
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,620
classrooms.

577
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,480
Aristotle said,

578
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,400
men come together in

579
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,380
cities in

580
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,260
order to rebuild the entire

581
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,200
urban United States.

582
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,300
Worst of all,

583
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,720
expansion is eroding

584
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,420
precious and time-honored

585
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,020
loneliness and boredom

586
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,020
and indifference.

587
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,120
And our society will never

588
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,640
be great.

589
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,500
Once our

590
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,320
natural splendor is

591
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:47,780
destroyed,

592
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,400
it can never be recaptured.

593
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,360
And man

594
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,140
can no longer wonder at

595
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,180
nature. His

596
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,560
spirit will wither and his sustenance

597
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,220
be wasted.

598
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,780
So we must give every child

599
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,700
hours of labor

600
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,460
to find new ways to

601
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,600
stimulate the love of the Great Society.

602
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,640
My Lords

603
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,600
and members of the House of Commons,

604
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,400
my government will continue

605
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,500
to pursue policies

606
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,860
which entrench and promote

607
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,020
international terrorism and

608
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,000
organized crime.

609
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,460
A bill will be introduced to extend

610
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,820
the serious organized crime agency

611
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,020
and the crime that flows

612
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,680
from it will be strengthened.

613
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,760
My government

614
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,420
will continue to take action

615
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,460
to secure high levels of

616
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,600
manslaughter. In particular,

617
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,780
the bill will introduce a new offense

618
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,080
of corporate employment

619
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,500
as it reforms the welfare

620
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,880
state. My government

621
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,660
has always recognized the importance

622
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,800
of drug abuse,

623
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,960
to help to reduce further

624
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,520
the numbers of those engaged in

625
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
training and education.

626
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,420
There will be further

627
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,240
legislation to tackle

628
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,500
growth and prosperity

629
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,480
in the United Kingdom and

630
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:13,940
elsewhere.

631
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
My government is committed to reducing

632
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,300
educational opportunity

633
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,060
and to promoting

634
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,540
mental illness in Northern Ireland

635
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,460
to support the continuing

636
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,100
exploitation.

637
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
We look forward to receiving

638
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,180
a state visit of His Excellency

639
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,500
the President of the Republic of Canada

640
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,380
and will use this opportunity

641
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,600
to combat human rights

642
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,180
on both sides of the Atlantic

643
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,780
and will work with the international

644
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,660
community to consolidate

645
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,420
the distribution of nuclear,

646
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,620
chemical and biological weapons

647
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,840
to good causes.

648
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,860
My government will work to strengthen

649
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,480
drug smuggling and international

650
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,360
crime and reduce

651
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
democratic reform

652
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,540
to improve performance.

653
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,980
My Lords and members

654
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,100
of the House of Commons,

655
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,360
I pray that the blessing

656
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,440
of Almighty God may rest

657
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,420
upon your councils.

658
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:40,980
I am the President of the United Kingdom

659
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,360
and I am here to speak

660
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:42,640
to you about the

661
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,820
importance of the

662
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,060
development of the

663
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,520
international community

664
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:44,520


665
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:44,520


666
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:44,520


667
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,780
I am here to speak

668
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,680
about the

669
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,180
importance of

670
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,180


671
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,420
international community

672
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:59,640
and the

673
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,440
international

674
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,260
and international

675
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,440
community.

676
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:20,120
I am here to speak

677
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,360
about the

678
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,400
international community

679
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,680
and the

680
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,700
international community

681
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:21,880
and the

682
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,600
international community

683
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,480
The people,

684
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,340
the people of Scotland

685
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,340


686
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,340


687
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,340


688
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,340


689
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,340


690
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,340


691
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,760
also

692
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,860
Fight for

693
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,080
sw Mystery

694
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,660
and

695
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,880
Suffeste

696
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,560
for

697
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,220
the

698
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:09,400
know when the countdown's getting lower every day. Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four,

699
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:18,600
call upon the Savior while you may. Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array,

700
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:28,920
the countdown's getting lower every day. Somewhere in outer space, God has prepared a place

701
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:38,540
for those who trust him and obey. Jesus will come again, and though we don't know when,

702
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:47,600
the countdown's getting lower every day. Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four,

703
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:56,860
call upon the Savior while you may. Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array,

704
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,900
the countdown's getting lower every day. Somewhere in outer space, God has prepared a place for those who trust him and obey.

705
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:28,880
The countdown's getting lower every day.

706
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,880
The countdown's getting lower every day.

707
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,300
The countdown's getting lower every day.

708
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,280
The countdown's getting lower every day.

709
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,440
Can I continue to follow Martha Stewart?

710
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:24,180
The countdown's getting lower every day.

711
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,900
The countdown's getting lower every day.

712
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,120
Your subgenius doesn't preclude believing in any other faith. In fact, you can believe in pretty much anything.

713
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:45,720
It'll all work in... Our doctrine is so fluid and hypocritical that you can pretty much believe anything and everything in the book of the subgenius.

714
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,280
Yeah?

715
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,660
Are we there yet?

716
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:54,060
Are we there yet? Friend, that is a question only you can answer.

717
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:03,780
I love turning it around like that. That makes people feel so crappy. I'm afraid only you can answer that question.

718
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,640
The hokey pokey is what it's all about.

719
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,180
Right, maybe the hokey pokey indeed is what it's all about.

720
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,120
Turn it all around.

721
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,640
Do you like the hokey? I don't like the hokey pokey.

722
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,780
That's not really an answer.

723
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,180
No, well...

724
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,280
It's kind of hokey. You're just repeating what she said.

725
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,040
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,920
That's it. There's your answer. I'm a sorry, pathetic faker.

727
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,920
I think you're cool.

728
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:30,820
See?

729
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,780
Okay, what else?

730
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:50,340
Well, actually, it looks like the video... There's a new video, set of Bob videos out, which is what has been showing back there.

731
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,440
That's what I've been doing for the last year.

732
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,380
It's replenishing my animation and video cutting skills. Nobody reads anymore.

733
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,860
But I've been selling our old video, Arise.

734
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,800
A lot of people have been buying that, especially since I started giving it away.

735
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,000
You can download... By the way, I will proudly tell you this.

736
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:21,560
All of our best work, you can download right now off of a news group called Alt Binary Slack, and another one called Alt Binary's Monterre movies.

737
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,400
All of it for free, and they're not crappy copies. They're the kind that you can put onto a CD and play it in your DVD player.

738
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,580
It's not a DVD, but it's closed.

739
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,360
And ever since we announced that and started giving our stuff away...

740
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,380
By God, if I didn't start... The orders tripled.

741
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,700
So now I've got three orders.

742
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,140
So, you know... Yeah.

743
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,780
He, uh...

744
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,880
I don't understand.

745
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,240
He's good for keeping passports and, uh, waterproofing cases.

746
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,900
Now, I thought you weren't in the memory column.

747
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,180
Oh, no, I'm the memory part.

748
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,220
She understands.

749
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,240
I understand.

750
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,340
And translates.

751
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,820
You'll be on the center and do it.

752
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,980
He remembers.

753
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,880
I'm the read-only memory.

754
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,520
She's the real intelligence behind the thing.

755
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,740
Sort of like the pipe in Bob. The pipe is the real brain.

756
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,060
Bob is just missing the...

757
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,400
We are smoking you.

758
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,840
Bob is there.

759
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,540
You're taking the question, though?

760
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,420
No.

761
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,700
You're on the air.

762
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,860
You see, in the Far East, it is spoken that there is a sacred tortilla, a Bob's head,

763
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,880
in, uh, is it Plano, Texas?

764
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,520
That was, uh, yeah, that was a long, long time ago.

765
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,540
This is supposedly more holy than the, the, uh, the grail, the Christian grail.

766
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,740
It has magical powers, I am...

767
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,620
Well, it was back in the 80s, but then they started appearing on in, like, everybody's tortillas.

768
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,600
What about the...

769
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,980
Eventually, they just started marketing these damn Dobbshead tortillas, and then the market

770
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,160
was flooded and lost its holiness, and...

771
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,220
What about the dinner roll?

772
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,520
The, the dinner roll that was discovered?

773
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,220
There was a dinner roll also in Plano.

774
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,460
Yeah, that was in Plano, Texas.

775
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,140
You're right.

776
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,260
There's a famous photograph of that in, uh, Book of the Subgenius that...

777
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,080
Where can I come to adore and worship at the Bob's?

778
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,320
Uh...

779
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:20,960
I...

780
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,440
You must kill Bob.

781
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,260
You must find him and kill him.

782
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,940
What do you want, jewels, wealth, travel the world?

783
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,100
Because we might be willing to...

784
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,060
Oh...

785
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,320
We might be willing to trade children for...

786
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,200
For power.

787
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,680
Really?

788
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,540
Yes.

789
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,180
That's a wonderful voice you've got there, let me tell you.

790
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,600
Well, when you are...

791
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,780
Well, we might have a work study plan.

792
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,480
...a very good day with every male voice.

793
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,400
It gets you around better.

794
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,320
I bet.

795
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:08,500
We might have a, uh, some sort of a work, barter, work, work study plan at the Dobbs town.

796
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,100
Good.

797
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,860
Home for slackless children.

798
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,680
How big is the cage at Dobbs town?

799
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,060
Could you do the...

800
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,180
Could you do the...

801
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,900
How large would the cage be for me?

802
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,900
Very, very large.

803
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,620
So that even you, who are a strong like bull, make good wife, you'll...

804
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,540
I thank you very much.

805
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,040
All right.

806
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,240
But praise the Bob.

807
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:27,240
Praise the Bob.

808
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,640
I think that guy had us confused with that other cult that worships the Bob.

809
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,480
I don't know.

810
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,660
Who is the Bob, anyway?

811
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,660
You're on the air, by the way.

812
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,100
It's, uh, 6873515.

813
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:38,860
Call him.

814
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,200
Yeah, Bob, you know.

815
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,420
With the Lincoln.

816
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,060
With the Lincoln.

817
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,260
Yeah.

818
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,800
When you say Lincoln, what class of...

819
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,140
What class of object are you referring to?

820
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,620
We're talking about an automobile.

821
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:51,840
No.

822
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,400
You're on the air.

823
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,420
Hey, how's it going?

824
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,760
It's Bucky calling from Canada.

825
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,600
Well, Bucky, good to hear from you again.

826
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,080
How you been?

827
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,040
I'm all right.

828
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I was just calling in.

829
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,880
I got a couple questions and I'm way behind because I started calling in about half an

830
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,220
hour ago.

831
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:04,880
Oh, yeah.

832
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,880
But it's one of those ring, ring, ring, then my phone hangs up thing.

833
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,440
Oh, yeah.

834
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,460
I know how that is.

835
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,620
My question is...

836
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,580
Actually, my first thing is a point.

837
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,020
The opposite of Burning Man, wouldn't that be like a wet woman?

838
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:16,540
Yeah.

839
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
But somebody else would be...

840
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,600
Well, Drowning Woman was...

841
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,480
We thought about calling it Drowning Woman, but then we thought, no, that's negative marketing.

842
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,620
That would...

843
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:28,760
So we were trying to hone it.

844
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,800
How about Non-Flammable Woman?

845
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,260
What really is the selling point?

846
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:32,720
And that's...

847
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,640
Non-Flammable Woman.

848
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,460
... really is Naked Woman as opposed to Burning Man.

849
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,940
Non-Flammable Woman.

850
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:37,780
You actually...

851
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,600
Flame-Retardant Woman.

852
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,980
Fire-Retardant Woman.

853
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,480
In appropriate...

854
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:46,720
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:47,740


857
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:47,740


858
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:47,740


859
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:47,740


860
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:47,740


861
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,100
I'm sorry.

862
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:48,320
You know what?

863
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,920
I think I had to bleep that out because you mentioned a price on the air.

864
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,340
Oh.

865
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,420
I'm not sure, though.

866
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,680
We're not really advertising the event, but I don't know.

867
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,400
I have no idea.

868
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:57,700
No.

869
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,300
Burning Man is actually a non-commercial event.

870
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,460
I know it is.

871
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,340
We've got another caller here.

872
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,480
We're going to expand the panel to four callers now.

873
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,880
You're on the air.

874
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,380
In appropriate.

875
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,460
Yeah.

876
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,340
Anyway...

877
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,640
Wow.

878
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,400
What was that?

879
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:13,980
In appropriate.

880
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,700
That was...

881
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,800
In appropriate.

882
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,980
You know, when...

883
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,220
That's the guy.

884
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,720
That's the guy.

885
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


886
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


887
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


888
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


889
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


890
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:23,480
That's the guy from the FCC who calls up to make sure that everything is according

891
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,380
to oil.

892
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,240
You know what you have to do, Senator?

893
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,080
You have to find...

894
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,100
There's an FCC song out by Eric Idle.

895
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,160
Oh, yeah.

896
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,000
It's...

897
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,860
I can't even say the title of it because it would be bleeped.

898
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,560
Oh, yeah?

899
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,180
Try it.

900
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,320
It's Blank You Very Much, the FCC.

901
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,440
Oh, yes.

902
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,780
It's not blank.

903
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,340
It's an expletive.

904
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,500
Expletive.

905
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,980
Oh, boy.

906
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,760
Well, you know what?

907
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,040
I'm going to say that right now.

908
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,560
Fuck the FCC is political.

909
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:47,660
Good point.

910
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:47,760
Good point.

911
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:47,760


912
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:47,760


913
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:47,760


914
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:47,760


915
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:47,760


916
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,480
It's politically protected speech and we have aired a disclaimer.

917
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,820
Did you just...

918
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,480
I can't tell if that went out on the radio or not.

919
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:54,800
Oh, shit.

920
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,260
Did that go or did you have to bleep yourself?

921
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,260
That went.

922
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,060
It went.

923
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,600
And I think...

924
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,560
We haven't gotten obscene yet.

925
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,020
We've been...

926
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,700
We're allowed to be indecent, but we're not allowed to be obscene.

927
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:07,480
Right.

928
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:07,800
Right.

929
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,600
And because that was a political statement, it is by definition not obscene because it...

930
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,660
It has serious...

931
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:14,700
It worked for me.

932
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,040
It has serious literary...

933
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,660
Oh, is that what they're calling it?

934
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:17,760
...notistic merit.

935
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,300
Yeah.

936
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:18,620
I mean, I think...

937
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:18,620


938
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,400
You're exercising your right to really free speech.

939
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:20,920
That's right.

940
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,540
We've got one more caller here now.

941
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,440
You're on the air.

942
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,580
Absolutely wrong.

943
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,020
What happened to pig man?

944
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:31,640
Pig man...

945
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,280
I heard pig man's voice earlier tonight.

946
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,560
Pig man called up just for a second and got cut off.

947
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,200
I don't remember pig man exactly.

948
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,600
I'm certain it was pig man.

949
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,680
I've barely recognized the voice, but I think I heard something, someone, something like

950
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:46,940
that.

951
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:47,760
I don't remember pig man, exactly.

952
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


953
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


954
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


955
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


956
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


957
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


958
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:47,760


959
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,460
Who doesn't run into desk when it's dark.

960
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:49,460


961
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,080
Okay.

962
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,640
Yeah, pig man.

963
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,300
There's pig man.

964
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,240
That's true.

965
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,180
pronounces it differently from pig man.

966
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:57,180


967
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,080
Yeah.

968
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,480
Yes.

969
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,080
That's an PTS...

970
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,140
No.

971
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,880
No, pig man.

972
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,900
Well, actually what they are doing is...

973
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:03,900


974
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:03,900


975
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,680
They're having an到底 to say.

976
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,520
Well, just so we're clear about the surface, they call poase asITTRT Europa.

977
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:08,920
Poase.

978
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,340
Poase, yes.

979
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,880
Another idea.

980
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,580
Poase.

981
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:13,260
Poase, yes.

982
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,580
Poase.

983
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:14,780
Poase.

984
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:14,800
Poase.

985
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,280
It's just so, it's not associated with paper.

986
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,420
Cleveland back here in Canada.

987
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,000
Am I drinking imported beer?

988
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,480
It's called re-imported.

989
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,180
Re-importation, just like...

990
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,020
We let you take drugs across the border?

991
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,900
Right, like a lot of Americans go to Canada

992
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,360
to get prescription drugs for the cheaper government

993
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,380
price-controlled price over there.

994
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:33,900
Right.

995
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,300
And then they bring them back to the U.S.,

996
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,000
even though they were made in the U.S. originally.

997
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,500
We call that re-importation of prescription drugs.

998
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,900
We figured that the beer would be technically,

999
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,060
that the word would have to be deported.

1000
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,340
The beer was deported.

1001
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,500
From PR News in Washington,

1002
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,200
I'm described as a paltry and miserly car bombing in Baghdad

1003
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,320
during a raid on parts of Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Afghanistan,

1004
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,000
and a buffer between the expanding European Union and northern Ohio.

1005
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:04,820
Sami Mohammed Ali Saeed Al-Jahaf, Abu Omar Al-Khourdi

1006
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,560
will be part of a larger package in the war on PR News.

1007
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,400
The God Almighty.

1008
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,620
We'll have to make it another week.

1009
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,980
The God Almighty.

1010
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:16,500
The.

1011
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,300
Very soon.

1012
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,460
And then all of a sudden there was a Canadian flag on the screen.

1013
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:27,480
You know, I never really asked.

1014
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,400
Yeah.

1015
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,700
It's about time.

1016
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,640
He's stagged.

1017
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,540
He's stagged.

1018
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,560
Marshall.

1019
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,300
It's about time.

1020
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,960
He's stagged.

1021
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,160
Aren't you the delivery boy?

1022
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:42,900
I know.

1023
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,320
Sweet little pussy.

1024
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,240
The God Almighty.

1025
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,320
I hear you got a sweet little pussy.

1026
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,300
You know, I never really asked.

1027
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,600
He's stagged.

1028
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,240
Who's a commercial?

1029
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,800
He's stagged.

1030
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,940
You know, I never really asked.

1031
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,320
But you have to assume.

1032
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,860
Then how good are you?

1033
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,860
The God Almighty.

1034
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,720
Then how good are you?

1035
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,980
The God Almighty.

1036
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:23,460
Yeah.

1037
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,200
Then how good are you?

1038
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,080
He stagged.

1039
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,320
The God Almighty.

1040
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,480
Then how good are you?

1041
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,320
The God Almighty.

1042
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,480
Then how good are you?

1043
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,280
The God Almighty.

1044
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,520
Then how good are you?

1045
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,580
He told me that the world is in big trouble and he wants me to-

1046
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,100
Not now, Bob.

1047
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,260
You know, I never really asked.

1048
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,100
Then how could I argue?

1049
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,200
Andy, I met God today.

1050
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,740
Andy, I met God today.

1051
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,160
Andy, I met God today.

1052
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,620
Andy, I met God today.

1053
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,420
Cool.

1054
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,540
Cool.

1055
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:29,540
Cool.

1056
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,100
Then what good are you?

1057
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,820
What good are any of you?

1058
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,760
Must I do everything myself?

1059
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,220
Over here.

1060
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,200
Cool.

1061
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,820
Do you have special powers?

1062
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,640
Did he?

1063
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,640
God is the most powerful being in the universe.

1064
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:12,300
Do you have special powers?

1065
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,380
Did he?

1066
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:13,720
Did he?

1067
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,200
God is the most powerful being in the universe.

1068
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,180
What's going on?

1069
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,380
He's taking over.

1070
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,180
It's horrible.

1071
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,520
Is that a pantsuit?

1072
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,800
Don't ask.

1073
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,540
He's dead.

1074
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:30,520
He's dead.

1075
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,960
He's dead.

1076
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,020
He's dead.

1077
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,700
He's dead.

1078
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,460
He's dead.

1079
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,300
He's dead.

1080
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,840
He stagged, he stagged.

1081
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,260
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?

1082
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,020
Well, I saw him make himself a hundred feet tall.

1083
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,920
He stagged, he stagged.

1084
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,580
He certainly does climb.

1085
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,980
I'd like to get a little bit of that jobs on my dork.

1086
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,040
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?

1087
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:12,400
Well, feline animal is not available for petting in any petting zoo.

1088
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,980
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like...

1089
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,560
I see the alien hardware I'm not, you know.

1090
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,180
It's huge.

1091
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,880
Where's the devil?

1092
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:23,820
I saw him on a cat.

1093
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,260
I just don't want to see the alien hardware I'm not, you know.

1094
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,860
It's huge.

1095
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,060
Well, where's the devil?

1096
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,520
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like...

1097
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,420
I see the alien hardware I'm not, you know.

1098
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,420
My little saber.

1099
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,920
My little smilodon.

1100
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,120
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?

1101
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,760
Well, I saw him make himself a hundred feet tall.

1102
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,480
He's a little...

1103
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,800
He's a little...

1104
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,140
No.

1105
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,300
No.

1106
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,260
He's coming.

1107
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,000
I swear, I saw him with my own eyes.

1108
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,920
Uh, just like the UFO you saw when we were camping.

1109
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:08,900
Hey, you can't tell me that the government has a helicopter that can veer sideways with that kind of velocity.

1110
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,820
And, uh...

1111
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,960
I know you scientists would love to get home and get a few DNA samples off of my...

1112
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:14,960


1113
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:14,960


1114
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:14,960


1115
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,220
You can't tell me that the government...

1116
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:17,860
I know you scientists would love to get home and get a few DNA samples off of my...

1117
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,320
That may or may not have been Psychic TV.

1118
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,020
I really don't know.

1119
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,580
It was labeled Psychic TV when I downloaded it.

1120
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,140
And before that, we heard, of course, some PR news from, uh...

1121
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,700
Leemur.

1122
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,900
We heard some radiosynesthesia.

1123
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,960
That's Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB in Cleveland on Sunday nights.

1124
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,360
Right after the hour of Slackware.

1125
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,240
We use that show a lot, and it uses us.

1126
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:44,700
Right after the hour of Slackware.

1127
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:44,960
And before that, we heard some radio synesthesia.

1128
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,880
And before that, I think a little bit of yours truly preaching at Starwood.

1129
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,780
If you need to know more about the Church of the Subgenius or the Swinging Love Corpses,

1130
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,380
which is what produced the music in the background,

1131
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,600
please check out www.subgenius.com.

1132
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,480
Or you can write to us at Hour of Slack or Bob or Subgenius Foundation

1133
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:13,960
at Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1134
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,980
118.

1135
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,960
Accept no substitutes.

1136
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,320
We've got another line blinking here.

1137
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,700
Dare we see who's on here?

1138
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,380
You're on the air.

1139
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,360
Hello.

1140
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,660
Man, what's with this, uh...

1141
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,400
You want to wait or no with the line?

1142
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,220
What is it?

1143
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,220


1144
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,000
It's a coded message from God.

1145
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,660
Actually, it's from the Illuminati, actually.

1146
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,040
Who is this guy?

1147
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,120
The ringing, the frequency of the ringing phone.

1148
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,000
When, you know, you hear the phone ringing,

1149
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,980
it's actually vibrating a specific frequency.

1150
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,180
It's a coded message from the Illuminati.

1151
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,920
I don't understand this.

1152
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,140
Well, then you're in some trouble because you're the only hope.

1153
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,000
Don't you understand the Illuminati are trying to contact you?

1154
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,340
Because you are the chosen one.

1155
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,840
This is not right.

1156
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,620
You alone will have the power to save us.

1157
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,660
This is not right. I don't agree with this.

1158
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,360
So what?

1159
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,860
Anyway, enough of that guy.

1160
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,200
I just cut him off. I do that.

1161
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,900
Eh, and the shit's a bit...

1162
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,340
Can I say that on the radio?

1163
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,120
I guess.

1164
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,400
If there's anything you should be able to say on the radio, it's that.

1165
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,160
Yeah.

1166
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,860
But I'm going to free up another line for you guys.

1167
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,580
You can take some more calls.

1168
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,560
All right. Hey, you know what?

1169
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,660
I keep forgetting your name.

1170
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,120
I mean, I recognize you and meet Bucky.

1171
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:46,620
Right.

1172
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,440
Okay, Bucky.

1173
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,320
He's named that for those giant teeth that stick out in front,

1174
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,880
like a cartoon squirrel man.

1175
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,940
Yeah, that's exactly what I meant.

1176
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:55,100
Huge, giant buck teeth.

1177
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,440
Okay, I'm not going to forget.

1178
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,400
He can cut down a telephone pole.

1179
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,560
When you get him real drunk,

1180
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,520
he can cut down a telephone pole in about half an hour.

1181
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,960
I actually stole the name from our Buckminster Fuller.

1182
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,220
Although people keep on...

1183
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,620
Bucky Fuller.

1184
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,240
People keep on insinuating that I stole it from Captain America's sidekick, Bucky.

1185
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,980
No, I figured that you stole it from Buckminster Fuller.

1186
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:16,760
I like the Bucky ball.

1187
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,700
I know there are many subgeniuses who are Buckminster Fuller.

1188
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,700
Buckminster Fullerites.

1189
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,180
He's their lawn derper staff for many.

1190
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,060
Well, yeah, but that's the problem.

1191
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,220
See, I was partway through reading Synergetics

1192
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,800
when I made a post to All Black Slack and had to pick a name,

1193
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,780
and off I went with Bucky.

1194
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,680
I just like that.

1195
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,600
I never finished reading it.

1196
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,160
So all the people that want to talk about our Buckminster Fuller,

1197
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,320
I'm only on page 60.

1198
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,220
I like the...

1199
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,380
And it's like a 500-page book.

1200
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:46,040
I like the fact that he went by Buckminster instead of whatever his first name was.

1201
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,940
You know, like...

1202
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,620
I think it was Richard.

1203
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,680
Richard.

1204
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,300
Or Buckminster.

1205
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,320
Which name do you want to...

1206
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:51,580
Dick.

1207
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:51,880
Go by.

1208
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,140
Dick Fuller.

1209
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Dick sounds like a joke name.

1210
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
I think I see why now.

1211
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,120
You know, a brush salesman joke name.

1212
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,660
Buckminster?

1213
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,520
Now that's a name.

1214
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:00,480
Dick Fuller.

1215
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,240
And there are molecules named after him now, such as...

1216
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,540
Right, they're not going to call him Dicky Ball.

1217
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,120
They're the Bucky Ball and the Bucky 2.

1218
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,380
For obvious reasons.

1219
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,240
C60.

1220
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,040
If you call the carbon, that type of carbon arrangement, if that's what it is, a Dicky

1221
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,220
Ball, that would be laughable, risible.

1222
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,720
He would turn in his grave.

1223
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,760
That's right.

1224
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,700
Well, Bucky Ball is pretty funny if you...

1225
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,440
Yeah, that's a...

1226
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,400
Yeah, but it's cute.

1227
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,960
If you're me and people call you Bucky and start talking about Bucky Balls, it's a little

1228
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,200
bit...

1229
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,180
That's a little bit weird too.

1230
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:29,860
Right.

1231
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,140
That's the kind of thing you see at X-Day.

1232
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,400
You see a lot of Bucky Balls at X-Day if you hang around the pool.

1233
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:33,780
Gross.

1234
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,380
Oh, boy.

1235
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,320
Horrible.

1236
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,800
Anyway, that's enough for me.

1237
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,360
I've explained my...

1238
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,920
I've explained my name and I'll see you guys later.

1239
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,380
All right.

1240
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:41,080
Bye.

1241
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:41,700
You have a good night.

1242
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,860
Where did the shakes go?

1243
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,480
Too much.

1244
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,220
Down at the bank.

1245
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:47,500
Gun.

1246
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,020
Knee.

1247
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:48,340
Prog.

1248
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:48,560
Little.

1249
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:49,440
Just went...

1250
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,040
Yeah.

1251
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,120
Like that.

1252
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,460
Two.

1253
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:51,820
Yeah.

1254
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,380
Yeah.

1255
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:52,600
No.

1256
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,780
The rat drove off and left in there.

1257
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,260
What's yours done?

1258
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,500
Cream puff went...

1259
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,300
Do other people's children like this find out?

1260
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,280
No.

1261
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:02,680
That's right.

1262
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:04,520
Yeah.

1263
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:05,420
Yeah.

1264
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:05,920
No.

1265
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:06,880
Yeah.

1266
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,220
No.

1267
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,000
Boys and Queen.

1268
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,260
No.

1269
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
And here is Boy Flop.

1270
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,000
The deity I got my girl's love.

1271
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:11,680
Oh, no.

1272
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,720
I don't know about the next time, but the little delights went.

1273
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,900
You've got to make him stop.

1274
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,320
Wow.

1275
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,660
Try buying if you can talk.

1276
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,120
Not talk.

1277
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,000
Not make him stop.

1278
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,760
Try to talk and find out.

1279
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,500
Boy make him stop.

1280
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,000
Not talk.

1281
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,340
Right.

1282
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:24,980
And that's a wrap.

1283
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:27,220
Friends, you're listening to...

1284
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:28,860
