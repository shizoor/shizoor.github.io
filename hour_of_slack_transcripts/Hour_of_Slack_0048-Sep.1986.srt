00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
This is KN1 90.9 FM.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,620
Thank you for your support during my pledge show.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,740
Help me somebody.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,300
Praise Robert Wisdom.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,720
And Homer Henderson.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,600
I actually just met the real Homer Henderson of Homer Henderson,

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,860
the Dow Worthington Garden Boys,

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,860
who are well known for their ballad,

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,100
Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,120
And I'm kind of blown away.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,440
He was actually answering you.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,600
Probably those of you who had sense enough to pledge

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,780
talked to him on the phone without even knowing

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,080
you were talking to the actual Homer Henderson.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,340
And those of you who call in and pledge tonight

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,900
on the Hour of Slack, dear friends,

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,900
you're going to get to talk to the actual

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,220
Dr. Murph of Mickey Garanta.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,520
And or the evil Dr. Chaos.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,840
And Reverend Zephon.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,460
Who we just met tonight.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,360
And because of that.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,200
That's your key phrase.

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,560
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,400
Here the watch in front of us blurs and distorts time.

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,300
Soon we will be deep in a hypnotic trance.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,800
What wonders will we see?

28
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,680
Hey kids, get some money out of your pants.

29
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,480
All right.

30
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,700
And.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Send it to Bob.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:31,940
Yeah.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,220
Go to level.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,960
And you go.

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,720
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Hour of Slack.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,580

Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

65
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,240
Hour of Slack.

66
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,980
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

67
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,440
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the first orthodox mega fist temple lodge

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,940
But where's Buck?

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,440
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

72
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:28,700
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of

Top players.

86
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,580
You know, if you don't pledge, there's going to be more than one Reverend Ivan Stang.

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,080
And you're going to have to listen to it forever.

88
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,420
Or at least until the money runs out.

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,720
Dear friends, my gosh.

90
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,060
Let's get some spirit going here.

91
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,520
Be like that old gold friend.

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,140
Shake it off.

93
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,920
Shake that conspiracy off.

94
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,160
Yeah.

95
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Shake it off.

96
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,800
When they miss you, shake it off.

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,040
When you don't send that money in, we're going to shake y'all.

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,720
Shake it off.

99
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,940
Shake it off, baby.

100
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,300
Oh, yes.

101
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,480
Dear friends, so good to feel the power here at KNON.

102
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,480
But you know, that power just is going to peter out.

103
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,700
If, if, friends, and you know what I'm talking about.

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,640
It's the pledge drive.

105
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,000
And that number to call is 823-725-7000.

106
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,420
823-7490.

107
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,320
823-7490.

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
Or 828-9500.

109
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,120
I mean, I know most of you have been listening to this station all day.

110
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,840
You've been hearing that pledge number.

111
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,820
And you've been waiting to pledge to the hour of slack.

112
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,040
Because you knew that we needed proof of an audience out there in order to even stay on.

113
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,120
And friends, there are some mighty reverends here ready to dole out some healings, some sickenings.

114
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,760
They'll even smash your watch over the phone to demonstrate time.

115
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,440
Time control, friends.

116
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,480
If you will call in and pledge that support for KNON.

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,820
And, and you know, you can, you can call that number 828-9500.

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
Oh, better cut that off where the other KNON DJ comes on.

119
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,520
Friends, you've got to do it.

120
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,100
You have, you, you know you want it.

121
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,140
You gotta have it.

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,920
And we gotta have it from you.

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,180
Or, you know, it just.

124
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,520
Can you imagine a world without slack?

125
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,780
A world without the hour of slack?

126
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,300
And even.

127
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,820
Almost as bad.

128
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,620
A world without KNON at all.

129
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,800
And the subject of tonight's sermon, friends, is guilt.

130
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,780
Guilt.

131
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,140
Now some of you are saying, oh God, it's pledge time.

132
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,600
Oh, I'm afraid Reverend Stang's gonna rant all night about money.

133
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,020
Well, you better be afraid, little Bobby.

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,120
Because if you don't send some money by midnight tonight, you're gonna be wishing to God you had.

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Or Bob.

136
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,540
Guilt, friends.

137
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,500
Guilt.

138
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,260
You've got one hour left of the KNON pledge drive.

139
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,560
This is the last hour of the pledge drive.

140
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,780
This is the last.

141
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,960
And this may be, friends, your last chance.

142
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,020
Your last hour of slack.

143
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,720
Guilt.

144
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,220
Guilt is that sinking feeling you get in your stomach.

145
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,740
That dead fish feeling in your gut that you get when you get caught.

146
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,880
Or when you know you're gonna get caught.

147
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,720
And it ain't from being afraid of the punishment either.

148
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,720
It's from knowing that from now on, you won't be allowed to forget what you did.

149
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,780
Or in this case, what you didn't do.

150
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,600
Guilt is the way you're gonna feel, friend, when I finish this sentence.

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,540
Which is that you actually did pledge to KNON on the last pledge drive.

152
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,500
But you never sent your money.

153
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,140
Now, you know, Jesus.

154
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,600
Jesus.

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,420
Jesus relieves you from guilt.

156
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,800
Even if you constantly abuse the commandments.

157
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
If you're a Baptist.

158
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,920
But Bob, friends.

159
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,180
Bob don't forgive you your trespasses.

160
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,500
Understand?

161
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,960
Uh, I mean, he, oh no.

162
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,140
No, no, nay, nay.

163
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,700
Bob's gonna whoop on your butt for your trespasses.

164
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,040
And he's gonna do it in an hour that ye know not.

165
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,260
For instance, for instance.

166
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,400
You out there.

167
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,920
Yes, you.

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
You know who I'm talking about.

169
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,580
You're saying, oh.

170
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,140
Oh, why should I give money to that station?

171
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
They're on the air anyway.

172
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,420
They're gonna be on the air whether I send money or not.

173
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,220
So I'll just tape this show and send it to my friends and have a great time.

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,780
And listen to all those wacky things that I can't get anywhere else.

175
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,960
But maybe five years from now, buddy, sister.

176
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:27,240
Maybe five years from now, you're gonna have a blowout on your way to the most crucial job interview of your entire life.

177
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,160
And one is caused by the other, friend.

178
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:36,420
It was your choice to blow off K-N-O-N and then later ruin your own life.

179
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,320
And you know, if we don't get, uh, friends, I just don't see those phones lighten up.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,680
Dr. K.

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,620
Oh, thank you, Mr. P.

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,760
Period.

183
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,180
P.

184
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,900
Period.

185
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,980
He almost got us thrown off the air a couple of times.

186
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,220
But by gobs, he was ready to pledge that 20-year promise.

187
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,580
Now I wanna see some more.

188
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,820
And get this, friends.

189
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,620
You know who pledged before we even came on the air?

190
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,300
Pastor Buck naked, and he ain't even down here.

191
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,880
Buck, I've been trying to call you all day.

192
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,920
But, uh, friends, it's just I only see about a dozen lines lit up.

193
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,380
Now this is, this is, I mean, what kind of a deal is that?

194
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
Friends, you wanna talk to Dr. Chaos.

195
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,720
You wanna talk to Professor Garanta.

196
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,580
You wanna talk to these holy ministers.

197
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,740
And, uh, oh my gosh, let's see.

198
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,980
You know, if, if it weren't for, for the support, the people who do support this show and this station,

199
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,320
that's the important thing.

200
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,320
It ain't just this show.

201
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,960
It's the whole thing.

202
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,000
It doesn't go in my pocket.

203
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:46,860
I'd love to be begging for money for Bob, my friends, or for my poor empty pocket gaping like a baby bird in its nest.

204
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,540
But nay, I'm, we need it for, oh wait, there's some of my favorite music.

205
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,720
That's the way you're gonna feel after the guilt is gone.

206
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,980
After the guilt is relieved.

207
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,580
After you send in that, after you call in that pledge.

208
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,440
And while you're at it, why don't you go ahead and just send the money to,

209
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:11,880
now let me give the phone number first, and then I'll tell you where to send your check, your bank, uh, bank draft.

210
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,100
You know, we can have a certain amount taken out of your brain and your checkbook every week or every paycheck.

211
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,900
Uh, and we can take MasterCard and Visa.

212
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,960
Not American Express, but MasterCard and Visa.

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
That's right, credit cards.

214
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,120
The mark of the beast.

215
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,960
The mark of the beast is in, is in force today, and we want to see that.

216
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,840
We, you know, we want to see you sign away your soul to, to this station.

217
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,500
Cause, cause you know, it's got a lot of soul.

218
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,900
Daddy, when are we gonna get, get to listen to Kane and the Man again?

219
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,880
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.

220
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,840
Nobody sent in that pledge money.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm afraid, I'm afraid.

222
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,980
We may never get to hear Kane and the Man anymore after, after this.

223
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,020
You mean they didn't set, give the money, but they promised?

224
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,140
But that's just like stealing.

225
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,380
Yeah, I guess it is.

226
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Don't cry, don't cry.

227
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,160
You mean, you mean they listened to the hour of slack for free?

228
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,420
You mean they haven't sent any money to help the station?

229
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,220
Isn't that just like stealing?

230
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,360
We need more money!

231
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,360


232
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,360


233
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,720
Friends, it's so true.

234
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,940
Dude, just listen to those slackless children.

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,780
Those are kids from the home for slackless children begging you, begging you, friends.

236
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,200
Oh, look at that.

237
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:04,480
I only see, there's, friend, you know, you know, the, the, the way that you, you get a, you can get a show at K-N-O-N.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,200
The problem is keeping it because if, you know, if, if they don't get the impression that there's a lot of people listening to this show,

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,340
they're gonna be like, oh, I'm sorry.

240
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,340


241
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,260
You know what's gonna happen?

242
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
They're gonna put, they'll still let you have an hour of slack.

243
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,860
Oh, yeah.

244
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,080
Oh, yeah.

245
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:26,140
They'll still let you have an hour of slack, friends, but they'll make you have it at 5 in the morning.

246
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,840
You gonna, you gonna wanna get up and get your slack at 5 in the morning, friends?

247
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,260
Huh?

248
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,140
Huh?

249
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,360
Well, this, that number to call is 823-7490.

250
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,680
I wanna, I wanna see more calls, 823-7490.

251
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,320
Yeah, I mean, is this gonna, do I have to act like Dr. Gene Simmons?

252
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm gonna call Scott and say, look, uh, fri-, now, boys and girls, I'm gonna have to just sit here and play my saxophone for four hours till we raise that $10,000.

253
00:11:52,460 --> 00:12:07,060
Friends, in, in 45 minutes, the pledge drive is gonna be over, and any money that K-N-O-N's gonna be running on, not for, just for this show, but any show, is, is, uh, has gotta last until the next pledge drive.

254
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,600
And it doesn't always go that far, dear friends.

255
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
I mean, this is serious.

256
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,480
We don't, we're not just on here to, to, uh, to make funny jokes about pledges.

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:28,820
And like, so many of you subgeniuses out there that pledged, oh, we raised a lot of money to look at the first list, but then how much, how many of you actually sent that check?

258
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,360
Even after the reminder notes were sent.

259
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,820
Oh.

260
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,300
Look, Dr. Chaos is in here crying and bawling over it.

261
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,020
He's, this poor feller's been...

262
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,060
Huh?

263
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,940
He's been hanging out down here, waiting for, waiting for you to call, to call 828-9500-823-7490.

264
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,840
I mean, do you know what it makes the hour slack look like when, when you, when you pledge and then don't pay?

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,920
That's like, it, oh yeah, we got listeners all right, but they're feeble-minded, or else they're liars, or they're just really self-deluded pink boys.

266
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,940
Pinky-winkies out there, we call them.

267
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,240
Might as well be Communist China.

268
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,680
Oh yeah.

269
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,900
Maybe you wanna, you know, without a station like this, this really would be like a communist country.

270
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,080
You'd hear only what the conspiracy wants you to hear.

271
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,580
And if you don't believe me, look, just go to work for another radio station sometime.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,120
See what it's like.

273
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,740
Oh, maybe we oughta, maybe we oughta blow off free radio.

274
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,340
Maybe nobody cares.

275
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,200
Maybe nobody gives a hoot out there.

276
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,280
Free.

277
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,400
Maybe we oughta just go to the playlist.

278
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:49,740
Maybe we oughta just, just, uh, be computerized DJs like all of, well, Dr. Granta here, he'll tell you what it's like.

279
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,880
Well, first, first you have to define the mean demographic.

280
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,580
Mean demographic, folks, that's the bottom line.

281
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,520
Like, with KVIO, it's a 32-year-old female legal secretary.

282
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,820
If you spread all the listeners and you found which one was in the very middle, that's the mean demographic.

283
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,520
With our slack, the mean demographic is a 49-year-old.

284
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:15,160
And you're the sole inhabitant of a mental hospital, so that means you have a narrow limit of demographic.

285
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,000
That's right, friends.

286
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,780
You can't control the horizontal.

287
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,220
We control it.

288
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,980
Dr. Grant here, he'll tell you, I mean, that's what we're gonna do.

289
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,740
If we can't get, if we, I mean, we're 15 minutes into this show.

290
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,260
If we can't raise a little bit of money, then we're gonna have to raise it the way the other stations do.

291
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,240
We have to figure out who the average listener is.

292
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,540
The average.

293
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,780
That's the, what is it?

294
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,240
The 33-year-old female legal secretary.

295
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
Oh, actually, 33, yeah.

296
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,540
Maybe 34 now.

297
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,460
And you're going to be assigned to the KNON NOVAN.

298
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,580
That's right.

299
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,880
And friends, I mean, that legal secretary, she doesn't care about Bob.

300
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,340
No.

301
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,820
She doesn't, she doesn't want to hear about Bob and to keep her business.

302
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,660
Then we can't talk about Bob and we certainly can't talk about Slack because she doesn't want to know about what she's missing.

303
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,560
She doesn't, you know, she figures, oh, what I know don't, won't hurt me.

304
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,600
She doesn't want to be surprised, friends.

305
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,480
She wants to be computerized.

306
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,140
And that's what they'll do to us if you don't send your money.

307
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:18,780
Me, Reverend Ivan Stang, I'll be working off of some Seattle computerized playlist.

308
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,620
You understand?

309
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:27,600
I mean, I'll, it's not just that I'll have to play, oh, say, Van Halen at exactly 1115.

310
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,720
No, no, it's not that simple.

311
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,180
I'll have to wake up in the morning when the computer tells me to.

312
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,580
I'll have to go to my conspiracy job when the computer tells me to.

313
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,940
I'll have to come down to Slack for my hour a week and play what the computer says to play.

314
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh, but you don't care.

315
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,120
That's fine with you out there, you gimme bobs, we call them.

316
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,580
Gimme bobs, those who think Slack comes free.

317
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,100
Well, it ain't free, friends.

318
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
In fact, that reminds me.

319
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,660
I'll just take off this preaching music, which you couldn't hear anyway, and put on this, this song.

320
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,340
This one, once, this is our commercial song for the, for the evening.

321
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,400
This is the Rainmakers.

322
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:19,320
And this is, this is, they're about as disgusted as I am with those who think they're gonna get, get that mighty church of the subgenius preaching Slack every Sunday for nothing.

323
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,760
We can't keep saving the world for nothing, friends.

324
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,720
Give a man a free house and he'll bust out the windows, put his family on food stamps.

325
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:51,020
Now, he's a big spender, no food on the table and the bills ain't paid, cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA.

326
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,820
They'll turn us all into beggars cause they're easier to please.

327
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,900
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

328
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:15,440
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way to steal more than he can eat, cause he doesn't have to pay.

329
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:23,800
Give a woman free kids and you'll find them in the dirt, learning how to carry on the family line of work.

330
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:32,160
It's the man in the White House, the man under the steeple, passing out drugs to the American people.

331
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,340
I don't believe in anything.

332
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,240
Nothing.

333
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,240
Nothing is free.

334
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,380
They're feeding our people that government cheese.

335
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
Government.

336
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,680
Cheese.

337
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
Government.

338
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,860
Cheese.

339
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Government.

340
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,360
Get out!

341
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Declare.

342

wilder

371
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,320
it almost just crashed

372
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,860
thursday

373
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,060
Bob C., friends.

374
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,900
But, and, oh, Edgar Casey called in from the afterlife.

375
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:34,220
Friends, now, you know, you get a subgenius pamphlet when you call in and pledge over $10, okay, to the hour of slack.

376
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,700
You get the subgenius, and you can specify the first and the second one.

377
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,880
There's an older one and a newer one.

378
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And most of you have probably seen the newer one.

379
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,220
But that's our premium tonight.

380
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:51,640
Those of you who call within the next hour, the last hours of the pledge drive, you will get the original subgenius pamphlet.

381
00:20:51,900 --> 00:21:03,780
16 pages of incredible holy wisdom and sacred dogma that you will, friends, you'll be able to wrap that thing around your excremeditation throne.

382
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,100
And every time you go into excremeditate, well, you can just sit and memorize that pamphlet.

383
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,340
You wouldn't believe the printed word of Bob if you've never seen it before, friends.

384
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,000
It's the printed equivalent of the best of the hour of slack.

385
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,500
And, oh, Reverend Cecilia, so good to hear from you.

386
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,820
And, Reverend, well done.

387
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,620
He'll be sending, we'll be able to play more Fireside Theater on this show thanks to him coming up.

388
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:41,980
But, you know, friends, if you don't, if you don't, if you can't see your way clear to send us some money, you know, you're getting for free.

389
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,320
What other subgeniuses?

390
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:50,560
Subgeniuses in other states pay $8 for the media barrage tapes that you hear on this show normally.

391
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,140
But you're not hearing tonight because we're not getting enough calls.

392
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,780
That's the only reason.

393
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,140
But the other, the subgeniuses outside of Dallas have to pay $8 for an hour of slack.

394
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
You've been getting it for free for months.

395
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,480
And on top of that, you've been taping them, sending them around to friends.

396
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,400
Or maybe you haven't.

397
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,660
Maybe you've been sinless by omission.

398
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,320
But what are we going to have to do?

399
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,900
Are we going to have to revert to playing this from now on?

400
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,800
Are these the artists that you're going to be hearing on KNOF?

401
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,120
Michael Jackson.

402
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,780
You spattered mud all over my dress with your old bicycle.

403
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,020
Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson.

404
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,160
Hey, Carol.

405
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,680
Those hot sands will never wash out.

406
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,100
Bruce Springsteen.

407
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh, Gene, what am I going to do?

408
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,800
Dan Halen.

409
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,240
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol.

410
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,360
You were too close.

411
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,480
Tina Turner.

412
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,560
Sorry.

413
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,320
What good does that do?

414
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,040
David.

415
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,460
Good grief.

416
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,900
You know you aren't supposed to be riding your bike during lunch hour.

417
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,980

And we especially call for the judgment of the South.

457
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,020
We are the South.

458
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020


459
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020


460
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020


461
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020

00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020


464
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,020


465
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,580
For whom we call forth the judgment of the sacred fire in this hour before the throne

466
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,420
of all mighty God.

467
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,540
Wahoo!

468
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,420
Look out!

469
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,280
You're not called!

470
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,320
The sacred fire's gonna fall, friends.

471
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,020
That sacred fire's gonna come down on ya.

472
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,980
If you don't get your head out of your secret place and get to writing some, get to making

473
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,500
some calls.

474
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,920
823-7490.

475
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,160
That number to call.

476
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,840
823-7490 or 828-9500.

477
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,560
Rock music, Blairs!

478
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,500
It sure does, but it won't be for much longer if you can't...

479
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:34,600
If you can't dig down deep, deep, deep into that most holy receptacle, dear friends.

480
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,440
And Dr. Chaos, I believe you had something to...

481
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,280
You had a message to impart to these creatures that they call listeners.

482
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,680
Yes.

483
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,240
Hello and good evening, my friends.

484
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,460
I am the Reverend Dr. Sardonicus Chaos.

485
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,580
I have an important message for each and every one of you out there.

486
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,780
You know, there's an old saying that the best things in life are free.

487
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,240
My friends, that is an untrue statement.

488
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,900
A conspiracy lie.

489
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,200
A demonic pink lie.

490
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,820
Slack is one of the best things in life.

491
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
And around here, slack does not come cheaply.

492
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,020
There's no free ride, my friends.

493
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,860
Picture yourself driving through the desert.

494
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,240
When all of a sudden, your car's radiator overheats.

495
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,940
You pull over to the side of the road and open up the hood.

496
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,240
And the radiator starts sparting like a geyser.

497
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,000
Spewing steam everywhere.

498
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,480
You're stuck out in the desert in the middle of nowhere.

499
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,160
And it's five miles to the nearest Stucky's.

500
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,500
You figure, well, I'll have to hitch a ride to the nearest service station and get the car towed in and fixed.

501
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,020
But every car is a stuckie.

502
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:49,720
And every car that passes you is a BMW or Porsche being driven by one of those yuppie top 40 commercial DJs.

503
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,440
You think they're gonna stop and give you a ride?

504
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,300
Well, you better think again, friend.

505
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,580
You're probably in a hurry to get to another programming session.

506
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,140
What kind of programming, you ask?

507
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,520
That, my friends, is another story.

508
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,100
But, uh, anyway, if the hour of slack radio ministry is your vehicle to get you to the land of slack,

509
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,900
you, my friend, must buy the next tank of gas.

510
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,880
Why?

511
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,720
Because we're under so much pressure from the false churches.

512
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,680
But you can help us change that.

513
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,400
Send in those pledges.

514
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,900
Now, unlike other ministries, we do not use guilt as a weapon.

515
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,660
We let you use your own guilt against yourself.

516
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,040
Praise God.

517
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,740
When you start feeling guilty enough, you will know what to do.

518
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,280
Dig down deep.

519
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,260
Way down deep.

520
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,820
No, no, no. Further than that.

521
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,740
And give until it hurts.

522
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,480
Send in those pledges.

523
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,740
Thank you.

524
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,180
Oh, yes. Praise Bob.

525
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,240
That's a mighty sentiment, friends.

526
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,040
Praise Bob.

527
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:02,000
Friends, I mean, now, you subgenius ladies out there, members of the Church of the Subgenius Women's Sewing Auxiliary,

528
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,200
now, what is, ask yourself, what is your sexual fantasy?

529
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:12,480
Is your sexual fantasy to meet the sexy Reverend Stang at some cheap motel off Harry Himes?

530
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:20,740
Well, if so, then please call 823-7490 or 828-9500.

531
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,680
Or you can mail that check.

532
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,380
You can mail that thing to P.O. Box.

533
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,120
Get that pencil ready, friends.

534
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
Mail that check to K.N.O.N.

535
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,180
P.O.

536
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,820
Hour of Slack. P.O. Box 710909.

537
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,360
And write that to K.N.O.N.

538
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,600
Don't write it to Bob now.

539
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,140
In Dallas, Texas.

540
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,380
Zip code 75371.

541
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,920
Oh, it feels so good.

542
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,920
Friends, this is Zug's Rift coming up here.

543
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,140
Zug's Rift is a, I mean, he's a mighty weird subgenius.

544
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,800
And this is, you can, I was amazed to find this guy has a tape out commercially available.

545
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,540
You can find it on Ordinary Record Store.

546
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,120
And why, just a couple of months ago, he was just another person who sent us subgenius.

547
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,480
But here's Zug's Rift.

548
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:19,640
I had to edit this album down quite a bit in order to make any of it usable for the radio.

549
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,620
But I think this song here is okay.

550
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,020
This is what it's all about.

551
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,080
What, what strange land is this?

552
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,580
What am I doing here?

553
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,140
How did this happen?

554
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,960
Why am I asking you?

555
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,540
I'm beginning to suspect foul play.

556
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:52,520
Late at night, when I am sleeping, you slimy mofos come out screaming.

557
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,460
Sucking me into your world of horror.

558
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,780
Can this be the world of tomorrow?

559
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,820
Wait a minute, just a second.

560
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,600
I know who you are.

561
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,520
Yes, it's true, you're the citizens of the neighborhood.

562
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,320
What the hell is it that you're trying to do to me?

563
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,220
Help me, help me, I gotta get out of here.

564
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,980
You're making me brain damaged.

565
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,280
All these people hanging around my head.

566
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,580
It's the eye of the living, it's the eye of the living.

567
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,980
Brats, I just need a slight cranial adjustment.

568
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,180
Like the dentist pulling my gums inside out.

569
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,480
And pulling my brain out through my gum cavity.

570
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,380
As my head and bones have been yanked out by some damn Yankee card.

571
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,440
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen.

572
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,860
The target of a thousand flying jackasses.

573
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,100
Preying and fogging defiance of their stultified, stupefied defecation on my P.T.D.

574
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,880
Perhaps I've already won ten million dollars.

575
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,180
With the mofo geeks chasing me through the woods trying to rip off my britches.

576
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,920
And use me for a human weenie roast in front of the campfire girls clique club.

577
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,300
Perhaps nothing is what I think it is.

578
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,940
Maybe they're all just a bunch of nice guys.

579
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,300
And you aren't really trying to suck every last sin out of my pocket.

580
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,980
And give me absolutely nothing in return.

581
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,120
Wait a minute, I know who you are!

582
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,220
You're the citizens of the neighborhood.

583
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,820
What the hell are you trying to do to me?

584
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,540
You're making me brain damaged.

585
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,440
All these people hanging around my head.

586
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,100
It's the eye of the living, it's the eye of the living.

587
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,320
Perhaps I need just a slight cranial adjustment.

588
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,920
Perhaps I'm a beauty queen.

589
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,280
Perhaps I've already won ten million dollars.

590
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,440
Perhaps nothing is what I think it is.

591
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,040
Maybe they're all just a bunch of nice guys.

592
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,780
And you aren't really trying to suck every last sin out of my pocket.

593
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,360
And give me absolutely nothing in return.

594
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,400
That's a good point.

595
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,020
Dr. Chaos just came in.

596
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,820
Now what was that, what was this call we just got?

597
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,620
Um, you can get on that mic there.

598
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,680
Well, Reverend Stang, we had a sort of irate caller just called in.

599
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,240
I'll praise Bob.

600
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,300
He says we should get off the air.

601
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,480
Oh, he's so right.

602
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,600
We should.

603
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,480
And since he's not sending any money, we might.

604
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,340
Well, he definitely won't be sending us any money.

605
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,160
Yeah, well, and what was your answer to him?

606
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,820
I mean, he thought we were going to fry in his hell.

607
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,520
Yeah, yeah, I told him that was his opinion.

608
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,480
And he was welcome to have his opinion.

609
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,920
That's right.

610
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,720
And friends, and that's the thing.

611
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,620
I mean, with K-N-O-N, see, this isn't money.

612
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,280
You're not necessarily sending this money for all of us.

613
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:11,240
It's not for the religion of Bob Dobbs, the religion of slack and destruction of the conspiracy.

614
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,780
No, it's for the totality that's K-N-O-N.

615
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,920
It's not just for us.

616
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,600
It's for your very mind, your very soul, my friend.

617
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:26,040
You wouldn't believe how close your soul is to being sold out between your job and the drugs and the lies.

618
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,620
You need every bit of slack you can hang onto, friends.

619
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,020
And on this station, like, you've got all kinds of choices.

620
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,500
You've got lots of stuff you can hate, and you've got even more you can love.

621
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,220
The black shows are blacker.

622
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,660
The Mexican shows are more Mexican.

623
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,320
And therefore, they're better.

624
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,700
Even if you aren't black or Mexican, you need these shows if you want to have any ideas to what's happening.

625
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,280
So, especially if you want to have any hope in knowing what's happening 20 years from now,

626
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,480
when this planet isn't all pink and Anglo.

627
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,740
No siree.

628
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,820
And it ain't going to be all one religion, neither.

629
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:07,060
Unless that's Bob's religion, which is the one religion where you can believe anything you want to believe.

630
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,500
You can even hate Bob.

631
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,260
So, for all I know, maybe these...

632
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,800
Oh, yes.

633
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,720
Oh, we've got...

634
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,200
This is one of the callers that wanted to meet Reverend Stang at a cheap motel.

635
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,420
That comes with a $200 pledge.

636
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,380
Yeah.

637
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,340
Oh, baby.

638
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,720
Yeah.

639
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,280
Do it.

640
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,260
Oh.

641
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,120
Oh, do it, friends.

642
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,740
Do it.

643
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,780
Send that deep, deep into that...

644
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,300
Hidden place of your body.

645
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:33,940
Your wallet.

646
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,380
Your wallet, friends.

647
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,740
Dig down deep in that thing and whip it out.

648
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,640
Whip us out some checks and call this number.

649
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,480
823-7490.

650
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,360
828-9500.

651
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,420
And you don't have to have money on you.

652
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,240
You can just send a...

653
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,180
Give us your credit card number.

654
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,880
Your wonderful credit card number, friends.

655
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,500
So, we don't expect everybody to love the Hour of Slack.

656
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,900
Or even to go to heaven with Bob.

657
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,740
You know, we have total faith in Bob.

658
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,880
See, that's the thing.

659
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,200
I mean, we don't expect everybody to have faith in Bob.

660
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,080
I mean, after all.

661
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:20,060
No, even though we've never met him, even though his book was written years ago by desert tribal people of Texas,

662
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,080
we still have utter, absolute, undying faith in Bob Dobbs and in K-N-O-N.

663
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,480
And it's only the people with high resolution brains that are gonna be able to do that.

664
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,820
They're gonna be able to comprehend what I'm saying.

665
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,360
That's right, friends.

666
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
You wanna have a brain that's high res.

667
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,680
High res.

668
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,860
5,000 lines per screen at least.

669
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,660
And the truth is, you already have it.

670
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:49,260
Or you had it before you watched every rerun of I Dream of Jeannie and Star Trek and listened to those other stations for so long.

671
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
Like I did.

672
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,940
You wanna end up like me?

673
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,560
Of course not.

674
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,700
So send some money to K-N-O-N, dear friends.

675
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,000
But, I don't know.

676
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,020
I agree.

677
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,320
They can make a mockery of us.

678
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,620
Now, we don't have to watch it.

679
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,360
We can turn it off.

680
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:12,160
All other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.

681
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,680
If you write, nothing shall come between us.

682
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,180
To thee will I cling, though all the powers of heaven shall rage about me.

683
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Thou art my God.

684
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,940
And God can use you individually and collectively to begin to address and deal with those problems.

685
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,420
You have signed the application.

686
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,780
Welcome aboard.

687
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,460
But one doesn't listen long before a little warning signal goes off inside that says, watch out.

688
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,180
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.

689
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,980
But the language, the pure language of heaven is missing.

690
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,640
Something says, look out, this guy is fishy.

691
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,620
Cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

692
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:01,740
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English, but soon

693
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,840
they're rattling off in a completely unknown language when they haven't even been to kindergarten.

694
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,300
We eat more, drink more, play more, and do less to earn a good living than any other

695
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,080
people in history.

696
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,020
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music, and I might add a lot of its worst,

697
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,360
else the cultists would have no following.

698
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,920
We are a people grasping nervously, sometimes almost hysterically, for more than a second.

699
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:27,920


700
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,580
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know

701
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:34,580


702
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:40,220
Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortious

703
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,340
executions, it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

704
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,260
There are little eyes upon you and they're watching night and day.

705
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,640
With a vocal and activist minority ready apparently to burn the bomber's seal of skills.

706
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,940
For more.

707
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,900
And most incidentally are in their teens or their twenties.

708
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,980
And that's Bosch and Pipple, I'll tell you that.

709
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,760
They dwelled in caves, not high-rise apartments.

710
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:18,920
They may not have found acute affluence, but they found an endless supply of dope, uninhibited

711
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,620
sex, an endless supply of money.

712
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,320
Free access to a distillery, I suppose.

713
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,900
And a free access to a government office.

714
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:27,900


715
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,700
Ah yes, the harvest.

716
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,980
Ah yes, the harvest.

717
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,560
Full of kills, for more.

718
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,160
Why friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

719
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,120
What more than a space hogger on Earth?

720
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,920
Is the church of subgeniuses?

721
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,260
I don't know.

722
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,280
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

723
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,780
Bang.

724
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,120
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

725
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:57,900
The best that I've ever seen.

726
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:57,900


727
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,380
Atomic warheads don't.

728
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,360
I don't know.

729
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,820
I only know that it will signal the end of time.

730
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,300
Why?

731
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,940
Bang.

732
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:06,980
Bang.

733
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,400
Bang.

734
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,240
The past blotted out, and the future assured.

735
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,380
Ah, yes, the harvest.

736
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,340
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.

737
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,660
God showed his people the old way.

738
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,180
The greatest people on earth.

739
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,820
And you walk in with the Judas tribe,

740
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,240
and the wife of Judas might be one of the ladies I've laid to make a socialist.

741
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,640
This is Jim Jones.

742
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,140
I knew I couldn't trust anything but communism and the principle in me.

743
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Yes, President.

744
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,560
Jim Jones.

745
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,680
I knew that that's what I had to depend upon,

746
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,060
not depend upon the arm of the flesh.

747
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,800
I'd never put all your eggs in one basket.

748
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,700
So, honey, I put my eggs in many places.

749
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,880
You figure that out if you want to.

750
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,680
Some of you are too naive.

751
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,480
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

752
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,360
You can't even follow him.

753
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,800
You haven't even smelled where he's at yet.

754
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,060
You'd much less follow him.

755
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,140
You don't even know who he is,

756
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,940
and you might miss him if you didn't have real,

757
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,800
good look at him.

758
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,100
You wouldn't even know who he looked like.

759
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,820
You really haven't got an excuse.

760
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,680
But I've got all kinds of things in store.

761
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,000
Now, friends.

762
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,540
Now, friends, what other station?

763
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,440
What other station is going to let you hear Jim Jones, huh?

764
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,100
Well, actually, I taped that off of KRA several years ago.

765
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,860
But, I mean, with that background music and everything.

766
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,680
Oh, and that little montage there was by Puzzling Evidence.

767
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,020
Yes.

768
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,080
The granddaddy of subgenius taping.

769
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,180
But, I don't know.

770
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,260
I guess nobody cares about that.

771
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,080
I guess nobody's going to call 823-7490.

772
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,260
I guess nobody's going to call 828-9500.

773
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,980
Oh, well, I guess we're going to have to make money the other way.

774
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,620
Let's sell waterbed ads.

775
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,460
Let's play some Kenny Loggins.

776
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,640
Let's spin Beatles.

777
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,960
Let's have some Bee Gees.

778
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,980
Or let's play Wham or Kiss, baby.

779
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,480
Or if we wanted to be really underground, we'll play the latest Talking Heads.

780
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,320
Or, shoot, man.

781
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,840
Why should we even stay a church?

782
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,040
Maybe we ought to just be another Dallas comedy group.

783
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:22,260
Maybe we ought to give up this radio ministry and just go perform funny jokes at the comedy corner or someplace.

784
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,060
Maybe, yeah.

785
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,040
We'll just quit calling it a church.

786
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,500
We'll just do fun.

787
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,900
We'll just do funny jokes about the singles scene on Greenville Avenue and some good local, you know, clean humor.

788
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:48,000
We'll call up Ron Chapman at KVIL or George DeMarc at KZEW or somebody cooler than us and ask them how to groom ourselves for success in the pink world.

789
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
I mean, you know, friends.

790
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,840
Dr. Grant, what do you have to say about this?

791
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,980
Well, the bottom line is your playlist.

792
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,100
You've got to do appropriate.

793
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,680
You've got to do appropriate surveys.

794
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,140
You've got to call all the secretaries downtown and see what song they want to hear.

795
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:10,900
And then let's say when the kids get out of school at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, immediately you've got to pop on some songs that hit the demographic of 13, 14-year-olds.

796
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,020
You can't do this anymore.

797
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,840
You can't appeal to a crazy audience like this.

798
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,600
No, no.

799
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,180
It's, oh, can't make enough money appealing to a crazy audience.

800
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,240
No.

801
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,360
They only have slack.

802
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,120
That's right.

803
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,440
That's all they've got is slack.

804
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540
It's the most powerful thing in the world.

805
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,720
But what do they do with it?

806
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,940
They piddle it away.

807
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,520
Just on, oh, friends.

808
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,240
Yep.

809
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,680
No individuals from now on.

810
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,680
We're just going to center our material towards the mean demographic.

811
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,300
And it is a mean one, too.

812
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,300
Boy, it would have you working that 9 to 5 job from 9 to 9.

813
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,260
Oh, we'll give up.

814
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,300
We'll go with the tried and true format.

815
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,260
Yeah.

816
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,480
We'll use the, we'll get the 5.

817
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,920
We'll be allowed 5 minutes.

818
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,820
forcing a conversation

819
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,080
with a good f....

820
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:12,240
Or we'll use a script of an Slough

821
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,240


822
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,240


823
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,240


824
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,240


825
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,680
We, we'll, we'll be made up over and over

826
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,000
and over and over again.

827
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,320
And we have,

828
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,620
Thema words.

829
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:15,720
We said not only we want to have fun,

830
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,600
But we want to fast forward my life.

831
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:16,600


832
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:16,960
And we want went through this

833
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,980
And we want we want um all through it all and

834
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,820
And we'll have our jobs all done.

835
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,980
Moonies. Dr. Chaos, let's go join the Moonies. Let's go join the Scientologists, some other cult.

836
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,600
If the rival cult that wants to own this station had this hour, oh, they would have raised $10,000

837
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:49,860
by now. Easy with all the people calling 823-7490 and 828-9500. Friends, I mean, if you don't pledge,

838
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:57,820
okay, let's look to Dobbs' prophecy here. So what happens if you don't pledge? Electricity, gas, fuel

839
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,960
will become essentially unavailable. Transportation would cease to exist as we know it. No planes,

840
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:10,140
cars, trains. Food delivery would cease. Communication networks would be cut and silenced.

841
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:18,820
Municipal water supplies destroyed or contaminated. If you don't call 823-7490 or 828-9500

842
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,520
and pledge.

843
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:27,340
And friends, you get a free subgenius pamphlet with any pledge over $10. If you pledge, uh, if you,

844
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,100
and any pledge gets you the K&ON newsletter, friends. Any pledge. What, what, what, what?

845
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:39,900
As if you didn't know, do you get for your other pledge. For 20 bucks, you get the newsletter and

846
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,460
the K&ON bumper sticker mailed to you so that cool guys like me will see you driving down the road

847
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,760
and go, yep, that's not a pink boy. That's a he-man.

848
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:57,360
Or a she-woman who wants to support freedom of brains. For $30, you get the bumper sticker and

849
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,020
the mighty K&ON t-shirt. Friend, the ghost shirt. No cavalry bullets can kill you if you wear this

850
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,900
shirt. But it won't be mailed to you. For 30 bucks, you've got to come pick it up here unless

851
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,460
you live in Fort Worth or pretty far away. For $40, you get the subgenius pamphlet, the newsletter,

852
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,440
the bumper sticker, and the t-shirt all mailed to you, friends. All mailed. And when you, by the way,

853
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:19,840
when you come to Fort Worth, you're going to get a free subgenius pamphlet. And if you don't pledge,

854
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:28,240
call in and make that pledge. Specify what t-shirt size so that our mighty, mighty doctors for Bob

855
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,660
and nun snakes and zombies for Bob out here, Dr. Grant, Dr. Chaos, Reverend Zafod, can get that

856
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:41,980
size so that you can wear that shirt right. And so it doesn't look like, but you're laughing.

857
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:46,980
Oh, yeah, you're laughing, saying, oh, I don't care. I don't care if radioactive rain destroys

858
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,840
all the fish and fauna and pollutes the water. I don't care if radioactive rain destroys all the

859
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:57,880
water from me not supporting this station. Oh, I don't care if our, if firestorms kill all dormant

860
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,340
seeds on earth, making regeneration of plant life possible. Oh, I don't, I'd just as soon

861
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:11,100
get K-N-O-N for free. I don't have a spare $10 because I'm going to spend it on cigarettes

862
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:19,020
and liquor and, and false slack. Oh, yeah, I don't care if vast quantities of nitrogen

863
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:19,840
oxide are going to kill all the dormant seeds on earth, making regeneration of plant life possible.

864
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,560
I don't care if vast quantities of nitrogen oxide dramatically increase ultraviolet radiation

865
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,040
to the point where humans and animals are blind and we can't even hear the hour of slack with our

866
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:37,940
eyes. Oh, just compromise your immune system by not sending, not pledging a penny or even worse

867
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:45,220
by pretending to be a subgenius and pledging, but never even actually sending the check. Huh?

868
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,440
Sick, sick creatures out there.

869
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,820
They don't even know what they're doing.

870
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:55,520
They don't even care. I don't see, I see only two lines buzzing there. What's this? President Johnson?

871
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:05,960
Oh, oh, wait a minute. Oh, the 200, uh-oh, friends. I asked for it and I got it. The $200 pledge.

872
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,640
Someone named C. Johnson wants to meet Reverend Stang. Well, well, well.

873
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,180
Harry Hines.

874
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,360
And Harry, on Harry Hines. Now, is this a male or female voice?

875
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:15,740
A male.

876
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,340
A male.

877
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,800
We did specify that was females and I don't...

878
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,300
I don't care whether it's before or after your sex change. This has got to be a solid fee.

879
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:30,680
What kind of a church do you think this is? What kind of a religion do you think we're preaching here?

880
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:46,520
I mean, too much is always better than not enough. It's true. And Bob, he is, he swings every witch away, you know, but, but he's also a family man at the same time and he's married, you know, and well, well, we'll, I'll tell you what.

881
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,800
If I see that $200 at, in Canada...

882
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,240
I do understand.

883
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,000
What's a better thing?

884
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,220
Selfie.

885
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,260
Laugh cloudy.

886
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,800
Do you want to get a good bang?

887
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800


888
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800


889
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800


890
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800


891
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,800
to hear this kind of thing all day long.

892
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,760
Now we have our resident Sino expert here, Dr. Amiki Garanta.

893
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,980
And he's going to explain to us what the words to this song are.

894
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:39,060
What did she bring me? She brought me some shrimp and dashi guā there.

895
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,920
That's a big watermelon. These are the things that she brought me.

896
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,360
Shrimp and a big watermelon. That's the kind of lyrics.

897
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,040
Friends, those are the kind of lyrics you're going to be listening to

898
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:57,860
if this station goes communist from your not caring.

899
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,340
Oh no, they just don't care a bit. Nay, nay.

900
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,900
Poor Reverend Stang, unpaid here, slaves away.

901
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,340
Now I don't want any joke pledges, okay?

902
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,480
We got a lot of fake names here. That's okay. I understand that.

903
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,480
I understand wanting to protect yourself.

904
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,340
One of the things that I want to say is that I'm not going to be a slave.

905
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,080
I'm going to be a slave to your status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

906
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,360
But don't blow off that pledge drive, friends.

907
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,240
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

908
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,320
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

909
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,320
And coming right back.

910
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,440
Plus, bring back those you couldn't make it on your own.

911
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:43,320
And you're not going to make it, friends, unless you call 823-7490 or 828-9500

912
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,600
with that pledge for K-N-O-N.

913
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,220
This is the last, we are entering the last 13 minutes of pledge drive.

914
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,480
Do you understand?

915
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:59,120
If we get a pledge, a $40 pledge coming in that mentions that they want,

916
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,120
we got one, only one of these records available.

917
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,260
We've got the ballad of Lee Harvey Oswald was my friend from Homer Henderson,

918
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,760
the Dow Worthington Garden Boys.

919
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,160
I'm going to play that record in a minute.

920
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,400
But I want you to call.

921
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,240
If you want a copy of this rare, fantastic,

922
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,100
wants to meet me after the operation, $200, no, Mr. $200,

923
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,520
before or after, like we said, we want to see your $200 first.

924
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,060
Friends, whoever calls and asks for this rare record from Mule Nose Records,

925
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,320
the Mule knows good taste makes the difference.

926
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,560
Lee Harvey Oswald was a friend of mine,

927
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,740
Homer Henderson, the Dow Worthington Garden Boys.

928
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,460
If you beg for this album, you will get this 45 record.

929
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,600
This.

930
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:53,700
Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

931
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,720
I was born in Dallas in 1952.

932
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:11,040
Lee Harvey moved across the street on Beckley Avenue.

933
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:18,980
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

934
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:23,000
They say he shot the president.

935
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,460
I don't think he did.

936
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:32,360
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

937
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:39,940
He used to take me fishing all the time.

938
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,020
Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

939
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:49,280
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

940
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,340
They say he shot the president.

941
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:56,860
I don't think he did.

942
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:06,460
I seen that picture of him with pamphlets and a gun.

943
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:11,020
The shadows are pointing every which way.

944
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,960
But there's only just one son.

945
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,500
Someone faked that photo and snuck away and hid.

946
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,560
They say he shot the president.

947
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,940
I don't think he did.

948
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,680
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

949
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,480
He used to take me fishing all the time.

950
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,640
He used to take me fishing all the time.

951
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,620
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

952
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,540
They say he shot the president.

953
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,180
I don't think he did.

954
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,660
I seen it all on TV.

955
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:04,660


956
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:04,660


957
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:04,660


958
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,840
Lee Harvey got gunned down.

959
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,500
Murdered by Jack Ruby.

960
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,160
The biggest sleaze in town.

961
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,320
He stuck that gun into his ribs and said,

962
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,700
Here's looking at you, kid.

963
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:27,780
Ruby killed Lee Harvey.

964
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,420
TV proved he did.

965
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,640
And Lee Harvey was a friend of mine.

966
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,280
He was a friend of mine.

967
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,260
A very good friend.

968
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,460
He used to take me fishing all the time.

969
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,080
That's right, he did.

970
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:53,600
He used to throw the ball to me when I was just a kid.

971
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,640
They say he shot the president.

972
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,640
I don't think he did.

973
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,360
He did.

974
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,180
Praise Bob.

975
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,260
Praise Bob, friends.

976
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,900
Some lucky listener is going to get that other copy of that record.

977
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,740
And, okay, Ann Leonard, hey, thanks for the pledge.

978
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,360
And I know you ordered that.

979
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,260
Oh, listen, you need to tell us what you ordered.

980
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,060
We lost some orders.

981
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:34,600
A zombie Bobby volunteer at the Subgenius Foundation lost a big bucket of orders from July.

982
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,240
So if you sent that in July, I don't know, I'll double check.

983
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,620
Ann, we're working on it.

984
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,240
We had some severe problems.

985
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,560
Now, look, I'm not going to answer this $200 pledge over there.

986
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,840
This is some male that wants to meet me at Harry Hines.

987
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,080
Says he's going to drop off this $200 here tomorrow.

988
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,960
Okay, you drop off the money.

989
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,000
Leave a phone number.

990
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,460
Leave your phone number.

991
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,020
I'm not leaving my phone number.

992
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,660
Okay, what else have we got here?

993
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,580
To announce the, okay, we're going to announce our earnings on the show at the end of this episode.

994
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,300
We're going to announce our earnings in yen.

995
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,300
As a suggestion from, shoot, I can't now.

996
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:09,840
I lost that one.

997
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,260
I can't believe some of the pledges were getting friends.

998
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:12,860
I'm touched.

999
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:18,840
Can you believe Norm Ward and John Horton both separately have pledged money?

1000
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,000
Either that or it's the biggest fake in the world.

1001
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,820
Steve Kisarik, that was it.

1002
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:30,460
Okay, Steve, we're going to try to, you know, it's going to be impossible to total up these, each, I've got 1,000 pledge sheets in my hand now.

1003
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,660
They all list about a penny and a half each.

1004
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,440
It's going to take a while to add that up.

1005
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,560
But we're going to try to.

1006
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,280
We'll try to give a close guess.

1007
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,420
But friends, it's getting, what?

1008
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,040
No, no, no.

1009
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,620
Now, wait a minute.

1010
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:45,020
I keep getting notes from this $200 pledger that's in love with my voice.

1011
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,620
It says it's an old boyfriend.

1012
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,460
I'm sorry.

1013
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,020
That's wrong.

1014
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,140
Bring, wants to bring money to my house.

1015
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:51,800
Nay, nay.

1016
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,440
Nay, nay.

1017
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,480
That'll be, you can drop it off at K and O N sometime.

1018
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,820
Not next week.

1019
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,540
Not next Sunday.

1020
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,580
Listen, dear friends, I mean, it's getting serious.

1021
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:04,320
We've got, we've got, I mean, this entire station.

1022
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:04,560
This entire station.

1023
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,860
This is the last hour of slack.

1024
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,820
If, if, if this pledge drives, ends miserably, friends, I just don't know.

1025
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,660
I don't know.

1026
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,260
We're getting down to the end of the wire here.

1027
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,140
See, where's my speech?

1028
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,820
I mean, it, it's, what can I say, friends?

1029
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,240
You're going to have to, you're going to have to open your heart, close your mind, unzip

1030
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,420
your lips, and bend over.

1031
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,560
Because the word of Bob is going to come in a raw form.

1032
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:39,760
If, if, if it doesn't, if we have to move to five in the morning, if we're not getting

1033
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,700
any support at all, if it's pathetic misery, and you're laughing out there, you're going,

1034
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,420
oh, I'm a nihilistic teenager.

1035
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,320
I don't know.

1036
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,300
There's no future.

1037
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:57,220
Why should I try to contribute to the world peace and slack?

1038
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,500
You're laughing.

1039
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:04,320
You're just, you're thinking, there's no hope for humanity anyway.

1040
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,540
There's no hope for humanity.

1041
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,460
I'm just going to watch the world end.

1042
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,500
Oh my gosh.

1043
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,200
This caller keeps calling in.

1044
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,060
Friends, I don't want to hear these, these sick pervert calls.

1045
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,520
The sex, this $200 pledge, you're very serious.

1046
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:25,480
It says, sex change operation in two and a half weeks means that, means much that I will

1047
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:25,820
agree.

1048
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,500
Now, look, look, look.

1049
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,000
I mean, look, I'm a, I'm an open-minded guy.

1050
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:31,580
I'm hip.

1051
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,080
I'm a cool dude.

1052
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,520
I'm an old beatnik friend.

1053
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:34,940
I was a little bit of a nerd way back.

1054
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,600
But I don't know.

1055
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,840
I mean, slack is different for everybody.

1056
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,280
You know, you can't, I don't know.

1057
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,380
But you could have had universal happiness, friends.

1058
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,580
You've got five minutes left and there's nothing happening on this line.

1059
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,300
Nothing is happening on this pledge call line.

1060
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:51,840
Nothing.

1061
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,920
You could, you don't, God almighty.

1062
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,520
Friends, you, you really could have had universal happiness.

1063
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,400
You could have had the eternal squirt of world peace.

1064
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,500
From the psychodynamics of the world peace.

1065
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,420
To the

1066
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,500
That's right, friends.

1067
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,320
I mean, you know, it could have been.

1068
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,520
It could, think how the universe could have been.

1069
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,180
We could have had a planet here for another, oh, 100 million years.

1070
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,060
But no, no, you couldn't pledge.

1071
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,800
You couldn't find it in your heart to dig down.

1072
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:44,900
And so now it's the last hour of slack.

1073
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,740
The last four minutes of the pledge drive.

1074
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,640
And maybe the last four minutes of this planet.

1075
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,280
Yeah, instead, no, it won't be the end of the world.

1076
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,040
No, if I don't pledge, it won't be the end of the world.

1077
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:56,580
No way.

1078
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:02,280
It'll just be a continuation of the Black Iron Prison, friends.

1079
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:07,740
The combine, the empire, the conspiracy, the wad.

1080
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,880
It's just gonna continue to walk right over you.

1081
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,900
And especially over the people who don't have as much as you have.

1082
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:21,180
Because they're just gonna all drift over to those easier stations, friends.

1083
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,400
Those, those nameless conspiracy stations that control your life.

1084
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,340
Friends, you're only allowed one hour of slack as it is per week.

1085
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,540
And that is the Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1086
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,620
There's only five things that can ignite that vortex at the center of your mind, folks.

1087
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,980
And that's sex, drugs, great music, religion, and the Hour of Slack.

1088
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,020
The most significant weekly event in the history of mankind.

1089
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:56,880
Except maybe, present company excluded, Ron Lindsay's great show which is coming up, Soul Oldies.

1090
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,740
And you wouldn't get Soul Oldies if there was no K-N-O-N.

1091
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,220
If there wasn't. Now, friends, that number to call in the last three minutes of pledge drive.

1092
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,320
This is it. We're getting down. For all you know, I'm not kidding.

1093
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,880
For all you know, it could be the end of the world if you don't.

1094
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,260
I'm begging. I'm pleading. I don't, I mean, I've lost all my pride.

1095
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,900
I'm ready to get down and grovel for that money, friends.

1096
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,160
Call, please call 823-7490.

1097
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,620
Please call 828-9500.

1098
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,400
It's getting, it's steaming up in here, friends.

1099
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,300
Getting down near the end.

1100
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:42,820
And if, if nothing else, you can at least write for information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1101
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,000
We'll tell you how to send money to K-N-O-N.

1102
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:53,560
It's not too late. You can ask us personally at our own, our very own personal P.O. Box.

1103
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:59,100
And that is P.O. Box 140306.

1104
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:00,640
Dallas, Texas.

1105
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:05,760
75214.

1106
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,420
That's right, friends.

1107
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,200
P.O. Box 140306.

1108
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,200
Dallas, Texas. 75214.

1109
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,480
That's the, that's the player you can write for information on the Church of the Subgenius.

1110
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:26,320
And the weird, bizarre activities that you could, could maybe join in on.

1111
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,600
If you're the kind of person that, that is cool.

1112
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,160
If you're the kind of person that likes Dr. Chaos here.

1113
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,920
Like Professor Mickey Grant.

1114
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:42,380
And like Reverend Zaphon who would help K-N-O-N with their money, with their time, with their very souls.

1115
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,200
Bob loves you.

1116
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,200
Bob loves you, friends.

1117
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,760
But do you love Bob?

1118
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,680
Bob loves you.

1119
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:50,340
Bob loves you.

1120
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,260
Bob loves you.

1121
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:51,560
Bob loves you.

1122
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,740
Ask not what you can do for the conspiracy.

1123
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,780
Ask what the conspiracy can do for you.

1124
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,480
And this last you can still call in.

1125
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,020
828-9500 or 823-7490.

1126
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,300
Pledge that money.

1127
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,940
You get a free Subgenius pamphlet when you make that pledge.

1128
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,320
We're coming up to the end of the show, friends.

1129
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,440
And I'm just gonna let this tape with Pastor Buckneck.

1130
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,800
It's beautiful, beloved hymn.

1131
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,980
Drinking Bud, watching Bob take us out.

1132
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,220
And it's gonna be Ron Lindsey's soul oldie.

1133
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,540
So stay tuned for more slack.

1134
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,620
And it won't be pledge drive either.

1135
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,000
The pledge drive is over.

1136
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,660
This is it.

1137
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,440
The last minute.

1138
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,400
Goodbye.

1139
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,540
Maybe forever.

1140
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,600
Actually, friends, we raised a bunch of money according to this.

1141
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,660
According to this stack of pledge sheets in my hands, we did raise a bunch of money.

1142
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,120
I've been lying the whole time.

1143
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:40,940
Look at this.

1144
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,500
$30, $20, $40, $15, $30, $30, $200.

1145
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,180
No, no.

1146
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:46,780
Forget that.

1147
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:48,420
That $200 is fake, I'm sure.

1148
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,900
$10, $10.

1149
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:55,640
Friends, we probably earned at least, at least $200, which is pathetic.

1150
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:57,560
But, well, I've had enough.

1151
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,200
I know they're gonna take interest in that.

1152
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,580
You say that at school, though.

1153
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,900
Well, we had ad-libbing back and forth.
