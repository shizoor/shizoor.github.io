1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
This is the subject of radio ministry.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,840
Hour of black on K-N-O-N, 9-0-4-N-9-N-O-F-X-F.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,020
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,920
To be a good man.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,120
Turn on the machine.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,020
This is Radio Yerevan.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,020
My name is Franz Ivanovich Hagen.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,120
And this is the news.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,120
Wake up, puppet boy.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,060
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,440
I'm out of puppets!

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,340
No trouble.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,980
Get set, get going.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,520
Amen.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,200
Recording.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,500
Everything's going fine.

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,460
No trouble.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,280
Welcome potential initiates.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,340
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,240
Bob?

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,560
Bob?

22
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,100
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,860
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,340
What about slack?

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,560
That's your key phrase.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,840
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,100
And now, the self-genius hour of slack.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,780
Slack.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,140
Slack.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,960
Slack.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,020
Slack.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,860
Slack.

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:49,620
Slack.

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,880
Slack.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:50,880


36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,060
Slack.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,540
Slack.

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,540


39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,540


40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,540


41
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,540


42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,540


43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,540


44
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:06,540
, if you sailing in the working room is listening to the radio station...

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,620
K-n-o-n.

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,200
That lives and lives only in the city of Dallas, Texas.

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,820
advised to remain calm, to contact the printed or unlisted officials, in the event of any

49
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,680
material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcasting.

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,520
Small animals or other chimps, or other chimps.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,280
Children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks in brain frequencies

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,420
constantly scanned throughout our program

53
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,040
should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,620
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,040
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,800
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,580
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

58
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,900
Ah, it's so good to have the power here in Dallas once again.

61
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,200
Ha, ha, ha.

63
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:32,280
Ah, well, friends, I'm afraid Pastor Buck Naked, the mighty co-host,

64
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,580
suddenly had to leave for a quick emergency trip to Malaysia this afternoon.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,340
Couldn't make it to the show tonight.

66
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,780
That's right, friends, Buck is in Dobstown,

67
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,720
the church's mighty jungle encampment in Malaysia,

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,860
where Buck has been called by Bob to use his powers of mystic soul travel

69
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,660
on some problem students.

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,760
We got out there.

71
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,300
Now, you know, Buck's a master, a master of mystic soul travel,

72
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,100
whereby the soul gland of the foot travels at a high velocity

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,780
towards the rear end of some dumb bobby,

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,600
some mindless Bob wallower.

75
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,560
Ain't even followers, they're wallowers.

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,820
And a usually unsuccessful effort to disconnect the mind of the zombie

77
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,620
so that he can quit saying praise Bob or huh or whatever

78
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,660
long enough to take him to the hospital.

79
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,820
Take some orders and get those latrines dug.

80
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,860
Ah, yes, dear friends, Buck is communing with nature

81
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,060
and imbibing perhaps a bit of that sacred Tibetan herb,

82
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,440
Habifrop zippulops.

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,900
Ah, yes, dear friends.

84
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,800
By the way, today we had an esteemed church scientist come by

85
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,260
with a secret he had to reveal to me.

86
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,500
He said that his team was on the verge, the very verge, my friends,

87
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,640
of being in a relationship with a man named Bob.

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


90
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


91
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:54,640


92
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,140
And he said that he had been able to synthesize the active compounds

93
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,760
in that rare medicinal and safe herb that could make us all live forever

94
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,480
or else die seeing Bob.

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,660
Ha, ha, yes.

96
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:15,180
And we have here as a guest the great Reverend Ian Allen of,

97
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,400
that's right, those experts out there knew it, Negative Land.

98
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,060
Negative Land.

99
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,380
Negative Land is probably about one in 20,

100
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,620
but the listeners of this show have the amazing Negative Land albums

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,400
and we're going to be playing some of that stuff.

102
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:39,520
Coming right up as soon as I can find the Media Barrage End of the World section

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,780
because it gets a little bit political and, well, you know, let's...

104
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:45,900
Ah.

105
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,660
Bob.

106
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:50,940


107
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,300
Bob.

108
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,300
Bob.

109
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,300


110
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,600


111
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


112
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


113
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


114
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


115
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


116
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


117
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


118
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


119
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


121
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


123
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


124
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


125
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


126
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


127
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:54,620


128
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,400
Bob.

129
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,420
Bob.

130
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,420


131
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,420


132
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,420


133
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,420


134
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,420


135
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:01,420


136
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,780
The Church of the Subgenius.

137
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,420
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed,

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,240
over the quality audio-visual techniques

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,740
exacerbated and complicated

140
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,080
by the Church of the Subgenius.

copyright 1985-86.

142
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,180
Oh, Dr. Sperman.

143
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,580
She said,

144
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,140
cutting her own legs off

145
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,480
in what was to be the foe man of a...

146
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,240
Bible prophecy is a very, very important subject

147
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,060
for every Christian to study

148
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,860
to help you better understand current events,

149
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,560
to put things in perspective.

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,220
And most importantly,

151
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,320
to help you have that inner peace of knowing

152
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,120
that God is on his throne and in control.

153
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,440
I like to go to the lake

154
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,460
and try to go to the beach

155
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,200
and people will have a number

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,740
in their hand, in their forehead.

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,940
Someone with a lot of energy.

158
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,260
Okay, your code number once more?

159
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,040
237.

160
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,300
237.

161
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
And you're calling from Dallas.

162
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:23,860
Sorry.

163
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,900
Okay, thank you.

164
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,560
Thank you.

165
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,200
Bye-bye.

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,120
Bye-bye.

167
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,880
Hi, you're on hotline.

168
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,300
Yes, my code number is 238.

169
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,480
Amen.

170
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,380
We're living in terrible, perilous, chaotic times.

171
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,020
Praise the Lord.

172
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,420
And these times are not gonna get any better, my friend.

173
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,900
Amen.

174
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,680
They're gonna get worse and worse.

175
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,540
Amen.

176
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,540
They're gonna get worse, amen.

177
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
And this morning at half past ten,

178
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:05,800


179
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:05,800


180
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:05,800


181
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:05,800


182
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,780
And now for the uncensored Sino Russian news

183
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,960
from the Church of the subgenius

184
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,460
news untouched, friends by the conspiracy news

185
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,020
invented by the people.

186
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,520
Now friends,

187
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,540
Have you ever watched it?

188
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,540


189
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:30,500
wondered why NASA's last three launches ended in tragedy and waste, body parts all over the ocean.

190
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,300
How many more classified launchings have also failed but been covered up, friends?

191
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:44,680
Now, sources highly placed in the U.S. government, close to Bob, have revealed a startling story of

192
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,580
corruption within the conspiracy itself. Now, according to the report we got, now this is just

193
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:58,740
a rumor, let's say, just a rumor. The United States has actually been attempting to put into

194
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,360
orbit a type of doomsday device capable of annihilating all anti-American life on Earth,

195
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,500
however that phrase may be defined. The idea is that any other nuclear-armed powers would be

196
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,260
cowed into disarmament, and we'd all have world peace thanks to the threat of

197
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:20,560
international nuclear weapons.

198
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,300
There's an instant obliteration from above, hence the unusual code name for this doomsday bomb,

199
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,840
of which we've been told, the Hammer of Justice. Now, the Challenger space shuttle was apparently

200
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:42,500
only one of the cover stories intended to mask the launching of this deadly F-ray emitting so-called

201
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,200
peace bomb.

202
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,260
Needless to say, friends, the Russians have made attempts to halt or sabotage these launches.

203
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,780
When the Challenger exploded, the Pentagon, or actually the giant corporate conglomerates who

204
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,860
secretly control the government, blamed the Russians, and in retaliation, zapped the Chernobyl

205
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,180
nuclear power plant near Kiev, knowing that the Russians were going to be the ones to be killed.

206
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,760
That the released radiation would also punish other countries who had earlier sided with Libya.

207
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,820
World War III was barely averted three hours after Chernobyl.

208
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:33,920
The Russians had launched an all-out first strike against the U.S., friends, but all of their warheads

209
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,500
mysteriously failed to launch.

210
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,600
Supposedly, this was because the American launches of the doomsday

211
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:42,940
materialized.

212
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,320
The Russian launchers were not sabotaged by the Russians in the first place, friends, but by

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,920
aliens.

214
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,480
Extraterrestrial beings, friends, in this case, the kind with metallic saucers.

215
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,900
Not the Exis, nay, not the Exis, friends.

216
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,180
We're not that lucky.

217
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,540
It's another species of technological aliens.

218
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,700
Space beings, which were also halted.

219
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,980
Russia's attempted first strike.

220
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,540
And who knows how many other potential nuclear...

221
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,420
skirmishes.

222
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,920
Their motive?

223
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,960
They want to maintain their monopoly on instant obliteration from above of all anti-American life on Earth.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,620
At this time, I'd like all of the cabin attendants to please be seated for our departure.

225
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,080
This is again Radio Yerevan with our news.

226
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,080
Thank you.

227
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,440
Thank you.

228
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,560
Thank you.

229
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you.

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Thank you.

231
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:42,900
Thank you.

232
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:42,920
Thank you.

233
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:42,920


234
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:42,940


235
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

236
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,340
And to turn on the machine, this is Radio Yerevan.

237
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,680
My name is Franz Ivanovich Hagen, and this is the news.

238
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,220
I was born in...

239
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,360
Ooh, la, la, la, la.

240
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,960
Oh, my mother's found.

241
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,580
My father was a junkie.

242
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,320
And we were very old.

243
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,100
My brother was a soldier.

244
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,040
By the war in Vietnam.

245
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,540
Shit!

246
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,820
My uncle is a spy.

247
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,420
In Soviet Union.

248
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,100
He was a Mr. Presh.

249
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,340
He was a Soviet Union.

250
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,460
He was a Mr. Presh.

251
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,940
VaIajes friIiding.

252
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,180
HENZEL V sleeves.

253
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,180


254
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,420
ining.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,740
K como Vitamin.

256
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,860
Right?

257
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,940
Trish.

258
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,320
Yeah, and he waves the face.

259
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,060
Dus trings.

260
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:55,060


261
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,500
Bizim is life in it.

262
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:02,880
No wonder.

263
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,700
Yeah.

264
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:12,400
But we think you have to be coming here.

265
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,460
Our friends now.

266
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:12,920
You're in PhilISE, Gunslinger teachings.

267
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,780
One day we will be free

268
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,660
We will be free one day

269
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,780
One day we will be free

270
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,580
We will be free one day

271
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,900
One day we will be free

272
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,840
Well I believe in Jesus

273
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
And that's a long time

274
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,160
And that's a long time

275
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,340
I'll tell you by me along

276
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,100
Jesus is the world's king

277
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,660
Jesus is the world's king

278
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,300
It's gonna be a big disaster

279
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,360
It's gonna be World War Number 3

280
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,960
It's gonna be a war or something

281
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,760
I know it now already

282
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,900
It's gonna be a war or something

283
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,040
One day we will be free

284
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,140
One day we will be free one day

285
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,360
One day we will be free one day

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,100
Fist and fist, fist and fist,

287
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,100
Flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter,

288
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,100
Let's do the end, let's do, let's do, let's do direct, let's do direct.

289
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,140
You set me so fresh now, the spelling of reunion,

290
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,740
You set me so fresh now, the spelling of reunion,

291
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,200
You set me so fresh now, the spelling of reunion,

292
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,260
I love it, I'll never lie,

293
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,660
Ah!

294
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,060
Don't you think I wonder if I could make soon?

295
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,720
Okay, kids, the car is packed.

296
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,700
Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more.

297
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,240
New house.

298
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,380
Okay, now you're saying, Reverend Stang, you lost me.

299
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,180
All that stuff about the Americans and the Russians.

300
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,600
Now actually, you know, that might make a surprising bit of sense.

301
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,880
But start talking about them aliens.

302
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,100
Oh, forget it.

303
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,260
But let's look a little deeper, friends.

304
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,320
After the U.S. gave up on launching our own satellites and Star Wars weapons,

305
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,820
which we'd already had since 1955, by the way,

306
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,820
the government tried to use French rockets.

307
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,860
But those were disasters, too.

308
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,640
So now, friends, you hear about this on the conspiracy news.

309
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,820
We're getting the red Chinese to put our payloads into orbit.

310
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,020
That's right.

311
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:36,100
Our doomsday device for world slack will be going up in a Chinese Long March 3.

312
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,960
Rocket.

313
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,600
Those are fine rockets because the Chinese invented rockets while my ancestors were still throwing sticks at prairie squids.

314
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,340
In fact, anybody can launch a payload on a Chinese rocket.

315
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,600
Anybody who's got cash can walk into the Jianguo Hotel in Beijing, China.

316
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,760
And I've been there to see it.

317
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,420
There's an ad in the lobby.

318
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,480
Big old four-color display.

319
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,820
Biggest ad in the city.

320
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,100
Directing you up to room 505 where you can sign up to have your orbiting spy satellite or death ray delivered.

321
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,820
By a Long March 3 rocket.

322
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,280
Now, not only that, but the Chinese Communist Party, and this is true, provides the insurance.

323
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,380
Your payload is delivered or your money back, friends, and that's the truth.

324
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,220
The most amazing thing about the Long March 3 is that nobody knows how it works.

325
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
Not even the Chinese.

326
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,300
Now, friends, as Chairman Mao said,

327
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,240
what the people did yesterday, the party does today,

328
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,300
and the Church of Bob Dobbs will do tomorrow.

329
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,500
So we're going to take him up on that.

330
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,320
At this moment, church scientists are hard at work building the prototype of a new water pressure launched rocket

331
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,320
to compete with those pollutant jet-fired rockets used by the normals.

332
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,820
You know those little red plastic rockets you got as a kid where you filled them up with water and pumped them up real hard?

333
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,400
Then they blast off about 300 feet in the air?

334
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,760
Well, the same principle will be used for the new Slackmaster 1 four-stage rocket.

335
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,120
A team of...

336
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,820
CRACK!

337
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,960
Hydroelectric engineers are feverishly drawing up the plans,

338
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,020
and another team is searching for a dam or reservoir that can double as the giant pump.

339
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,140
The, uh...

340
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,500
Uh, the hydraulic-powered Slackmaster 1 rocket, friends, armed for dominance in a world in turmoil,

341
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,820
from the Church of the Subgenius.

342
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,360
Put your order in today, won't you?

343
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,380
Crawling over the face of the moon...

344
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,460
And you break!

345
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,120
Oh!

346
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,660
Even though we're traveling at 23,000 miles per hour, I feel like we're floating.

347
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,440
It's...

348
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,700
Bob? Meltdown.

349
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,180
Here on the Subgenius death ship, we approach San Francisco.

350
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,560
Our mission? Destroy anything.

351
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,880
Somebody help... help me, please.

352
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,540
Has this ever happened to you?

353
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,500
Meltdown.

354
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,080
Please remove all humans from container area six.

355
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,980
Be relieved.

356
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,480
Doug, pull over! We gotta scrape the collar off the front of the show!

357
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,760
We got it.

358
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,520
If we have another collar...

359
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,540
The show could overheat if not.

360
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,900
If we get another collar on the front of this show smeared like that last one, we're gonna be in severe heat damage.

361
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,960
Well, I don't think we should drive the show so fast.

362
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,700
Well, you're right.

363
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,540
It's just stupidly keep wasting fuel running over listeners like this.

364
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,980
There is no collar.

365
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,640
There is no collar.

366
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,940
There never has been a collar.

367
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,320
Mr. Jacobs?

368
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,380
Radio is all a dream.

369
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,680
You're listening to tapes. All the collars are gone.

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,720
The show was just a tape.

371
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,300
Yes.

372
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,640
This joke has been real.

373
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,120
Well, but they did survive and they're willing to give us their wristwatches and most of their...

374
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,160
That's what I mean. Imagine listening to this show and surviving.

375
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,880
That's what I mean.

376
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,080
The internal organs.

377
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,660
Unfortunate. Yes, it was.

378
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,560
We do have some...

379
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,320
But the doctors were still here.

380
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,540
Good morning, tiny collar.

381
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,240
Don't drive any faster.

382
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,380
Yes, well, it would have been nice to hear your message.

383
00:18:59,420 --> 00:18:59,820
Yes.

384
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,560
But at this hour, we're asking all messages.

385
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,520
Just my little way of showing you this.

386
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,540
Ten minutes left to...

387
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:03,940
Ten minutes.

388
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,560
Rotate your message toward the war and off the...

389
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,720
So aim high with us.

390
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,140
To find out more, all you have to do is speak with your nearest Air Force recruiter.

391
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,700
Ah, that's more like it.

392
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,580
We're all in the Air Force now.

393
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,760
We're all heading toward...

394
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
Los Angeles approach control.

395
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,360
No, no, wait.

396
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,280
We're over Los Angeles.

397
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,600
Don't drop the bomb now.

398
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,900
Look out, it's too late.

399
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,360
Holy cow, that's LA Stadium down there.

400
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,060
Oh, this is awful.

401
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,660
What are we going to tell the newspaper?

402
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,420
We're not going to tell the newspaper.

403
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,360
No one can keep anything, but it's exploding bright.

404
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,520
They're congratulating us.

405
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,680
They're congratulating us.

406
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,460
Look at that beautiful bomb pattern.

407
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,260
Yes, happy Olympics.

408
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,140
Take it out in one final sweep.

409
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,920
I'd say that was one of the most beautiful patterns I've seen in the performance so far.

410
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,680
I think that'll get a nine for most of the judges.

411
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,580
Don't you, down there on the floor.

412
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,960
That was a flawless performance on that last explosion.

413
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,520
The Olympics are over.

414
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,520


415
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,520


416
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,520


417
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,520


418
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,520


419
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,300
The Olympic nuclear explosion competition has been a fierce and competitive one with

420
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,620
some unexpected...

421
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,700
Oh, yes, the LA Olympics this...

422
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,540
...smaller countries, but this...

423
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm trying to get my tickets there.

424
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,520
You know what?

425
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,280
I've even bought a spare ticket for my Cabbage Patch doll.

426
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,200
Well, I hope you left that Cabbage Patch doll at the door.

427
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,100
The baby's back.

428
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,220
There's no place in the future...

429
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,600
As you know, they said some of them have a mind of their own.

430
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,920
But silence did not follow.

431
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,520
The awful heat...

432
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,680
And I couldn't see.

433
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,960
Oh, ground zero.

434
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,240
I couldn't stand it.

435
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,780
The place...

436
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,660
The smell...

437
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,760
The terrible...

438
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,180
The smell of hurting life.

439
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,460
Oh, my hero...

440
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,260
Ground zero...

441
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,860
Ground zero.

442
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,460
My hero ground zero is a place for me.

443
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,380
Subdivie.

444
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,500


445
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,500


446
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,500


447
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,500


448
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:03,500


449
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,020
Ground Zero, my hero

450
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,900
Ground Zero, my hero

451
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,460
Ground Zero, so please

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,960
Here again, oh yeah

453
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,040
Somebody help for me

454
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,540
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Long Dad was at Ground Zero.

455
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,760
That's awesome, Austin.

456
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,000
All over here

457
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,200
Oh, oh, how does the Easter Bunny

458
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,360
Friend, would you like to learn and earn at the same time?

459
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,080
Then El Centro's Job Start program is for you.

460
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,440
Job Start, a more than free training program,

461
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,620
is offering transportation, basic skills training,

462
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,700

and vocational training in air conditioning and refrigeration,

464
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,400
automobile service and repair, cable TV installation,

465
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,340
office careers, paint,

466
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,740
and water.

467
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,360
All covering in home health aid training.

468
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,400
And they pay you $5 a day just to learn these skills.

469
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,400
So if you're 17 to 21 years of age,

470
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,100
a low-income resident of the city or county of Dallas,

471
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,540
and a high school dropout,

472
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,620
call 746-2492.

473
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,220
Call now.

474
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,580
That's 746-2492.

475
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,160
So what is your point?

476
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,420
Nobody is perfect.

477
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,100
You know.

478
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,400
So what is your point, Glenn?

479
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,440
There's two things they'll talk about.

480
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,360
One's politics, the other one's religion.

481
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,880
You mean...

482
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,120
The reason you don't talk about them

483
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,940
is because they combine in each other.

484
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,600
You know what I'm saying?

485
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,540
Do you know how many time zones there are in the Soviet Union?

486
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,160
You know what I'm saying.

487
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,120
Don't you kid yourself.

488
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,140
Thanks, Glenn, for the...

489
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,900
Just thanks for the good thoughts.

490
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,480
This concludes our transmission to Oceania.

491
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,760
However, listeners in East Asia may continue listening

492
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,660
on the following shortwave frequencies.

493
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:22,480
6110, 7230, 9565, 9760, 15160, and 15425 kilohertz.

494
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,500
Separate them.

495
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,380
Separate them.

496
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,820
Get on the line now.

497
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,960
And...

498
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Here it comes.

499
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,920
The one that was...

500
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,480
Sir, there are hundreds of people outside.

501
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,040
They can't get in.

502
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,600
You have even gagged us.

503
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,600
All this is...

504
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,380
We asked you to stop construction of the plant

505
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,440
and you didn't listen to us.

506
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,600
You didn't listen even to your own two consultants

507
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,420
of the advisory committee on the reactive state side

508
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,040
when they said that this plant is dangerous.

509
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,060
You could.

510
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,640
You have had to come up.

511
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,180
You don't even live here.

512
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,800
You have no strength in this.

513
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,400
I know.

514
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,640
I know.

515
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,040
I know.

516
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:28,780
I know.

517
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,440
I know.

518
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:36,780


519
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,280
I know.

520
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,520
I know.

521
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,320
I know.

522
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,480
I know.

523
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:44,900
I know.

524
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,360
But I have the same reasons.

525
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


526
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


527
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


528
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


529
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


530
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


531
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


532
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


533
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


534
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


535
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


536
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,360


537
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,180
You told us that a Class 9 accident was incredible.

538
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,560
Our fellow citizens have learned too painfully

539
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,780
that you were wrong again.

540
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,940
The NRC said that the money eight years ago, money will never be a factor in licensing this plant.

541
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:14,280
Yet today, self-righteously, you make claims that we've got to get this plant licensed because any delay costs the plant millions of dollars.

542
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,580
Sir, may I remind you that as taxpayers, we in this community pay your salary.

543
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,620
As taxpayers, we pay the NRC salary.

544
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,920
As ratepayers, we pay PG&E salary.

545
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:32,500
We, sir, are paying for this whole goddamn proceeding and you won't even let us talk!

546
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,320
Is there anything for a moment?

547
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
What orchestra is this?

548
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,100
Oh yes, dear friends, and that and this.

549
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,020
What you just heard and will be hearing.

550
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,500
And I sure hope you have headphones on for this.

551
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,020
This is the world premiere of the new Negative Land album.

552
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:55,140
That's right, friends, you're hearing it here on the Hour of Slack for the first time here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

553
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:02,020
And there's many sub-geni in town for the Seagraph Computer Graphics Convention.

554
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,380
And among them are, well, Dr. Court Holland never showed up.

555
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:16,040
But yes, the evil Ian Allen of Negative Land is here with me in the studio.

556
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,060
You can hear him talking to his co-pilot in the background here.

557
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,780
Oh, listen to that slack, friends.

558
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,500
Listen to that.

559
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,080
Let's just lay back and let the slack wash over us for a second.

560
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,040
Oh, it feels so good.

561
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,820
It feels...

562
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,660
Friends, give yourself to the feeling.

563
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,400
Uh, this may not sound like music to some of you.

564
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,760
To me, it's ear candy, a delicious nectar of the senses.

565
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,740
To others, it may be a hideous, confusing experience,

566
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,340
like hearing glass breaking in a spook house or a garbage truck grinding along.

567
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,260
But to me, these things are music.

568
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,980
And friends, to an ascended holy man,

569
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,200
to a woman or man trained by Bob,

570
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,060
music can be found in a car wreck.

571
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,160
Uh-oh.

572
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,460
Uh-oh.

573
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:25,480
Uh-oh.

574
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,300
Maybe found in a potato.

575
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,640
Uh, yes.

576
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,920
It's so beautiful.

577
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:33,600
Uh-oh.

578
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,900
Uh-oh.

579
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,320
Uh-oh.

580
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,040
Uh-oh.

581
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,100
Uh-oh.

582
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,460
Uh-oh.

583
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Uh-oh.

584
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,460
Uh-oh.

585
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,160
Uh-oh.

586
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,740
Uh-oh.

587
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,780
Uh-oh.

588
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,540
Uh-oh.

589
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,480
Uh-oh.

590
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,000
Uh-oh.

591
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,860
Uh-oh.

592
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,300
Turn on the dishwasher.

593
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
The blender.

594
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,800
The electric hand-opener.

595
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,720
And you can get paid.

596
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,220
When your wife comes to the park,

597
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,440
you can't hear her.

598
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,840
And she thinks you're not paying attention.

599
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,500
You're not getting paid.

600
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,340
There's a kind of movement that stresses marriage.

601
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,540
The power of the noise contributing.

602
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,360
There's a kind of movement that stresses marriage.

603
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,760
The power of the noise contributing.

604
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,900
There's a kind of movement that stresses marriage.

605
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,380
There's a kind of movement that stresses marriage.

606
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,300
Whew, help me somebody.

607
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,600
And friends, I'm about to play

608
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
a tape of

609
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,240
oh, we're going to go down

610
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,680
into a real subgenius devival.

611
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,560
I'm sorry we can't minister to you

612
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,300
over the phones, no calls tonight.

613
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,460
Maybe never, because we're tired

614
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:58,280
stupid calls and particularly profane calls. This is a religious program, friends, and even if it is

615
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:05,140
a religion for mutants, sickos, geeks, gimps, weirdos, crazed inventors, and so forth, even

616
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:12,060
though it is all that, why, just because it is one of the most controversial shows, why, by that very

617
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,500
same token, by the conspiracy's rule book, that means we also have to be the cleanest and the

618
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,600
tightest. Got me? In other words, the law has been laid down, and we can talk about Prairie Squid, but

619
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,080
only if we're polite about it. That suits me fine. I'm a hip-with-it God, and I work for Bob, and though

620
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:37,880
though Bob does happen to be a sex god, he's also a family man. So anyway, friends, yes, negative land,

621
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:46,080
and we're about to play a tape of the subgenius devival in LA, the hideous, and I mean that word

622
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,520
literally.

623
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:59,180
Alexandria Hotel. Negative land provided a peculiar type of sound backup. In other words, what they do on their

624
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:06,260
albums, they were punctuating the rants with, and it was an amazing technical setup. I'm going to go on into that

625
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:15,260
revival. You hear the heelings and so forth. This is St. Janer, Hypercletes, with Doctors for Bob, accompanied by

626
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,140
negative land.

627
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:25,220
In the very belly of the beast, preaching, dear friends, on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

628
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:44,240
You can't hide from God. Not in your reaper. You can't hide from God in a liquor bottle. You don't be hiding from, you don't be hiding in a liquor bottle when Judd would take a little hit with somebody.

629
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,420
You can't hide from God.

630
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,480


631
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,480


632
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,860
You can't hide from God. He's bigger than you. He's bigger than all reality.

633
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,460
Oh, that was somebody. My leg's on fire. She ain't got no leg to break my body.

634
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,440
You can't hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

635
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,380
Because he's stupider than you are.

636
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,500
He smokes more froth than you do.

637
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,000
His face is miniographed and put up in more places than yours is.

638
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,480
His face has got more.

639
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,820
More black and white dots on it than yours does.

640
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,740
You cannot hide from this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

641
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,540
Help me somebody. I need some help.

642
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,520
My leg's on fire. She ain't got no legs to break my body.

643
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,040
You cannot run from your own legs.

644
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,720
Is that what you're using to run away from a whip?

645
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,900
You can't run from your own legs. You cannot hide from Bob.

646
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,800
Because he's stupider than you are. You cannot hide from God.

647
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,300
Because he's bigger than you. He's bigger than all reality.

648
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,140
Help me somebody. My leg's on fire. She ain't got no legs to break my body.

649
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,020
Need some help. Need some help.

650
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,700
You cannot swallow your own throat.

651
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,240
Where do you gonna swallow it with?

652
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Did he use that to swallow it with? Where do you gonna swallow?

653
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,120
You cannot swallow your own throat. You cannot run from your own legs.

654
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,800
You cannot hide from this man.

655
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs can't do that.

656
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,180
You cannot hide from God. He's bigger than you. He's bigger than all reality.

657
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,960
Help me somebody. My legs are on fire. She ain't got no legs.

658
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,240
Hold that leg and down you go. Praise God.

659
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,380
You cannot digest your own stomach.

660
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,820
You cannot wash soap.

661
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,780
You cannot cut it in half and rub the ends together.

662
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,260
Not a mop. You cannot wash soap.

663
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,800
You cannot do a car wash.

664
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,880
You cannot have a car wash.

665
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,320
You cannot turn on a car wash.

666
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,560
You cannot throw it in a washing machine.

667
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,000
You can't wash soap.

668
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,680
You cannot digest your own stomach.

669
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,340
You cannot swallow your own throat.

670
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,760
You cannot hide from this man. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

671
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,840
He's stupid than you are.

672
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,520
You cannot hide from God. He's bigger than you. He's bigger than all reality.

673
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,520
Help me somebody. She ain't got no legs.

674
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm gonna get my legs off my boob-a-legs and I'm gonna go spray-bop these other drugs.

675
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:22,400
You cannot wet water, it's already wet. You just don't get more water from your run water on water.

676
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,280
You cannot think about your own brain. Part of the problem.

677
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,480
You cannot think about your own brain. You cannot wet water, you cannot wash soap, you cannot digest your own stuff.

678
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,580
You cannot love your own soap. You cannot love your own bed. You cannot hide from this man's help.

679
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,340
I'm not disturbing you. Get out of here, you baby!

680
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,720
You're not really helping much.

681
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,820
You're not really helping much. You got no place to hide.

682
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,800
This all is an act!

683
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm not doing this.

684
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,960
Yellow and black and...

685
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,600
And, uh...

686
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,440
Yellow and black and rectangular.

687
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,460
Rectangular, yes.

688
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,920
And, uh, what else?

689
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,920
Well, yellow and black and rectangular.

690
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,260
Rectangular, yes. What else?

691
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,320
Well, doctor, it has kind of black and yellow and black and...

692
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,840
Rectangular, yes.

693
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,360
It has kind of shapes inside.

694
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,780
Yellow, black and shapes inside.

695
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,560
I see them everywhere.

696
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,020
Uh, uh, what else?

697
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,220
It has kind of wet shapes inside.

698
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,620
Yellow, black...

699
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,700
Black and yellow and...

700
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,600
And with...

701
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,660
Rectangular.

702
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,980
Wet shapes inside.

703
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,080
I see them everywhere. Do you hear me?

704
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,600
There, there. Just lie back.

705
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,600
Black and...

706
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,480
Black and yellow with...

707
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,560
Everywhere, do you hear me?

708
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,460
There, there. This is black and...

709
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:03,900
Uh...

710
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,400
Well, wet shapes.

711
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,280
This is...

712
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,680
Wet...

713
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,180
Everywhere.

714
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:07,780
There, there.

715
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,540
Back on the couch.

716
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,800
What does it mean?

717
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,740
Rectangular, black and with wet shapes inside.

718
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,400
I see them everywhere. Everywhere.

719
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,160
Just lie back on the couch.

720
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,340
What does it mean?

721
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,300
Yellow and with black shapes...

722
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,760
Wet shapes inside.

723
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,640
Inside.

724
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,820
Everywhere, do you hear me?

725
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,600
There, there.

726
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,380
Back on the couch.

727
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,620
What does it mean?

728
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,700
This is yellow...

729
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,980
Uh, back on the couch.

730
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,200
What does it mean?

731
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,120
Am I losing my mind?

732
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
Just lie back on the couch.

733
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,340
What does it mean?

734
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,340
Uh, just lie back on the couch.

735
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,040
Am I losing my mind?

736
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:42,960
There, there.

737
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,700
Black and yellow with wet shapes inside.

738
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,140
Everywhere, do you hear me?

739
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,440
There, there, this is...

740
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,940
Everywhere, do you hear me?

741
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,720
There, there.

742
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,800
Do you hear me?

743
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,220
Uh, this is...

744
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,480
Rectangular.

745
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:55,820
This is...

746
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,140
Rectangular, yes.

747
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Am I losing my mind?

748
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,240
What you have been seeing everywhere you look...

749
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,180
Are those yellow and black signs used to indicate a fallout shelter in buildings.

750
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:08,760
Uh-uh.

751
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,700
So you see these signs too, Dr. Black?

752
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,240
Why, sure, Mrs. Rectangular.

753
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,600
Oh, well, I feel better already.

754
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,480
Somewhere over the rainbow

755
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,820
Way up high

756
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,600
There's a wind that I heard once in a lullaby

757
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,720
Somewhere over the rainbow

758
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,640
Way up high

759
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:59,000
There's a wind that I heard once in a lullaby

760
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:06,800
Someday I'll reach upon a stark wake up where the clouds are far behind me

761
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,660
Where troubles smell like women dropped away above the hay

762
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,100
Away above the...

763
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,140
My chimney tops

764
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,300
Where...

765
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,000
Um...

766
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,000
Far...

767
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,000
Me...

768
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,740
Somewhere over the rainbow

769
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,780
Where the tide is

770
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,940
is named

771
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:57,980
I pick up on

772
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,360
dort

773
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,320
Steel part, drag line, grease and chrome

774
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,660
Two pump up for universal bearing

775
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,820
Aerial brake, chute, shock absorber

776
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,740
CARBON!

777
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,000
3-2-1-0!

778
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,740
X-ray air through the oily rag

779
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,040
Fed valve flywheel left arm rest

780
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
Brake shaft, tire jack, rear view mirror

781
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,180
Glass spring, piston spring, carbon foam, dice

782
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:26,820
CARBON!

783
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,220
3-2-1-0!

784
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,180
Lock the dealer out, dashboard padding

785
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,260
Up cab, road bar, rear-chill wiper

786
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,240
The hand, the land, radio dial

787
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,800
Front seat, back seat, air contangular

788
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,320
CARBON!

789
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,500
3-2-1-0!

790
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,440
Rubber holes, rocker belt, engine noose, pedometer

791
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,420
Spike, butt gas, cap, cigarette lighter

792

CARBON!

795
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:26,120
Burn out,cken and

796
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:33,420
Star, reckless, little planned

797
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,000
persona on the green house

798
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,040
Ay ay ay ay!

799
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,400
Stan!

800
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I like seatbelts and go cover it up with a sticker that says...

801
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,320
You don't know how they're possibly...

802
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,260
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha.

803
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:06,280
Friends, that was Car Bomb from the new brand spanking, I mean it's not even pressed yet,

804
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,660
Negative Land album, if you want to call it that, Escape from Noise.

805
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:20,600
And here with me in the mighty studio overlooking downtown Dallas is Ian Allen of Negative Land.

806
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,580
And you can buy that record, friends, but I can't tell you that.

807
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,440
Later on maybe we'll say where you can write for information.

808
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:36,260
And Ian, what do you have to say?

809
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,200
What do you have to say for yourself, man?

810
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm very happy to be here in Dallas.

811
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,380
I've been working on my accent and I think it's pretty good, but it might be from some other state down here.

812
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,020
You can pick up those accents at 7-Eleven. They're about 30 bucks.

813
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,100
Texas accent. That's for all the, you know, half the city now is out of towners.

814
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,180
No offense.

815
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,540
Well, the new record will be done and we'll have it out on the market, I think,

816
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,420
in about a month, in about two months.

817
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,040
Packaging is still a little undecided, but the record is pretty much finished.

818
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,260
And anyone who wants to write us can write us, but they won't get anything back.

819
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,100
They'll be able to buy the record at a record store in their area when it does get distributed.

820
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:33,260
It's a possible, possibility that it will be released on a semi, half, demi, major label, but maybe not.

821
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,540
Well, there you go.

822
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,520
Sounds good.

823
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,000
Sounds just like the Subgenius album, only it's finished.

824
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,540
Big difference.

825
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,320
And friends, yes, watch for that negative land thing now.

826
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:54,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, speaking of non-commercials, dear friends, a little bit of entertainment news.

827
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,120
Buck asked me to give you just on his way out of town.

828
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:03,320
Free to everyone, there's a world premiere of the epic video,

829
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,040
Batman Dallas, the movie.

830
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,280
Yes, it's finished, friends.

831
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:15,180
All of you who've had to listen to Buck tell you the plot of Batman Dallas, the movie, it is done.

832
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:22,680
This cheap, zero-budget spectacular, a year in the making, with a cast of 200 of Dallas' most insane.

833
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,240
This world premiere should be a real happening, friends, a B-in, a slack-out.

834
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,940
Buck Naked, who plays the aging, decrepit, sadistic, alcoholic Robin the Boy Wonder,

835
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,820
will be in attendance.

836
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:41,540
That's this Saturday night, the 23rd, free, with five shows at 9, 10, 11, 12, and 1.

837
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:50,280
And that's at the stepladder, 3406 McKinney, and that's on McKinney, just south of Lemon.

838
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,200
And that one's free, baby.

839
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:02,200
So we're going to dive back into the land of negative land, the anti-land, right quick.

840
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,940
Mr. Noisy gave up.

841
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,480
We can't wait to see what's in the bag.

842
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,920
We can't wait to see what's in the bag.

843
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,320
Ah!

844
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,220
We shot it.

845
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,920
You can see the

846
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:02,920


847
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:02,920


848
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:02,920


849
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:02,920


850
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:02,920


851
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,940
Huh?

852
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,920
The first thing that happens is that the bones splinter.

853
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,200
We're moving over to conquer.

854
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:39,580
And to my surprise, the act ofrendent

855
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:39,580


856
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:48,560
succinctly transcript the

857
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:48,660
data recorded in the

858
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:48,740
network.

859
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:48,800


860
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:48,840
Yes.

861
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:48,880
Yes.

862
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,000
Utility circuits are about to be activated.

863
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,800
Stand by for initial processing shock to AI ROM chips.

864
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,860
Good morning, Laz.

865
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,860
Hello, Dr. Hugo.

866
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:30,760
I'm removing the protective synthal membrane from your cranial urethra.

867
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,200
There.

868
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,660
Now, for just a few adjustments.

869
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,840
And...

870
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,180
Now you're ready.

871
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,700
Ready.

872
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,280
Yes, Laz, now that you're fully activated and operational,

873
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,840
you'll be leaving the factory for the first time.

874
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,060
You're unique, Laz.

875
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,660
You're the first robot programmed with the capacity for free will and emotion.

876
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,100
However, in order for you to feel, you'll need more than just knowledge.

877
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,380
So we're going to add real experiences to your database.

878
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,140
Experience.

879
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,620
That's right, Laz. Human experience.

880
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,060
Choose the ones you'd like to have.

881
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,540
Search your database.

882
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,280
Most desired experience.

883
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:52,200
Fun.

884
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,880
Let's have fun.

885
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,180
Absolutely.

886
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,900
Let's start with that.

887
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,000
Toil is stupid.

888
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,700
I heard a man say

889
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,120
He burned himself out

890
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,700
On a 12-hour day

891
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,060
He cut all the power

892
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,220
And shut down the plant

893
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,620
He beat up the foreman

894
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,420
They threw him outside

895
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,900
With his clothes in a heap

896
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And banned him, he ran

897
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,000
To a dying security man

898
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,360
Man working

899
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,920
Is what the sign says

900
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,580
Danger in yellow and black

901
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,020
Blurred all the working men back

902
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,040
Oh, for sure.

903
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,080
Fresh way into the mic

904
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,360
Three, fresh air

905
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,480
Ten, two, three, fresh air

906
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,400
Hey, that sounds really academic.

907
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,640
Hey, look, when he talks, the show speeds up and slows down.

908
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,240
Hey, can you make...

909
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,220
Can you do that again?

910
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,920
Too big.

911
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,240
Wow, it's purely an amazing scientific fact.

912
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:20,560
That's amazing.

913
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:21,740
How does he do that?

914
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,520
He must have Pinot Kidons in his voice.

915
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,580
Yes, well, we're assuming you now have special, uh...

916
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,020
I don't know how these callers do it.

917
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,120
Telegram hotline.

918
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,380
Oh.

919
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,140
Make to the future, yeah

920
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,000
Perry, any sub-game issue, please, but don't.

921
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,640
Hey, uh, is this for real?

922
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,700
Yes, answer yes.

923
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,020
This is our goal.

924
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,320
To purify our genes.

925
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,020
To deny them our essence.

926
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,160
To wrench the reins of control in our tainted compounders

927
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,200
and as mass-graze so presumptuously called evolution.

928
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,320
Rule number six.

929
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,120
Don't run over any small animals with a car while on a date.

930
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:01,840
Shut up, Pink Boy.

931
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,740
To become overmen and overwomen.

932
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,920
Oh, shut up, Pink Boy.

933
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,160
Well, let's see, what did we hear?

934
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,180
That little bit there at the end was from another hour of slack show in Richmond, Virginia.

935
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,840
The Rat Cave crew.

936
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,300
Oscar and Tim Slack.

937
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,840
But what we also have here, or we had here,

938
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,940
that was some negative land after the little miscue there from Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

939
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,020
And here's some, yet again,

940
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,960
uh, more negative land from Escape for Noise, I believe.

941
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,720
Three, two, one.

942
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,860
Three, two, one. That's it.

943
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:37,620
Go.

944
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,780
Kill me.

945
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,620
Let's see. Oh, there we...

946
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,140
Did you fix it?

947
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,900
No, it's that poltergeist again. Hold on just a second.

948
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,020
Fix it. Fix it.

949
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,540
Uh, Bob, give me power now. Vanquish demons. Give me dominion.

950
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,020
Oh, there we go. Thank you, Bob.

951
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,900
Well, you know, actually, right here in this neighborhood, we don't have a heck of a lot of noise.

952
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,960
We don't either.

953
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:11,160
Um, because, uh, well, you know, there's the big city of St. Louis.

954
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:17,220
And, uh, we do hear somebody shooting off a couple of guns in the distance.

955
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,300
And, uh, somebody rattles some tin cans or something.

956
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
And that's about all.

957
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,640
So it's, it's pretty quiet here, you know.

958
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,000
Wahoo! Look out! Here I come!

959
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,860
Michael Jackson! Look what you've done!

960
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,140
Michael Jackson?

961
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,620
You spattered mud all over my dress with your old bicycle.

962
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,980
Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson?

963
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,600
Gee, Carol, those mud sands will never wash out.

964
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,060
Bruce Springsteen?

965
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,500
Oh, gee, what am I going to do?

966
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,820
Van Halen?

967
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,400
Oh, I'm sorry, Carol, but you were too close.

968
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,520
Tina Turner?

969
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,400
Sorry? What good does that do?

970
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,500
David Bowie?

971
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,080
You know you aren't supposed to be riding your bike during lunch hour.

972
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:05,320
Prince? Madonna? Huey Lewis and the News? The Cars?

973
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,080
Ruby Hancock? Bonnie Tyler?

974
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:38,060
ZZ Top? Weird Al Yankovic? Cindy Looper? Pink Floyd? The Pretenders? Billy Joel? Billy Idol? Elton John? Neil Young? Sheena Easton? John Lennon? The Alan Parsons Project? Rick Springfield? The Rolling Stones? Pat Benatar? Harlan Oates? Adam Ant? Queen? Jack Cougar Mellencamp? Fleetwood Mac?

975
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:38,060


976
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:53,480
Duran Duran? Police? Eurythmics? Culture Club? Including Boy George? Kenny Rogers? Stevie Wonder? Jay Iglesias and Diana Ross? Donna Summer? Dean Martin? Kiss?

977
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:02,840
And we especially call for the judgment in this hour and in the destroying of rock music directed specifically against children, and working specifically through these individuals,

978
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,060
for whom we call forth the judgment of the sacred fire in this hour before the throne of almighty God.

979
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:08,060


980
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,020
Wahoo! Look out! You're not called!

981
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:32,280
You've got a good beginning. Hit and miss and trial and error. It just depends again on breaking the records over radio.

982
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,500
Rock music blares!

983
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,180
Doors slam!

984
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,260
People yell!

985
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,240
Children scream!

986
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,040
Sirens whine!

987
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,520
Trucks crumble and roar!

988
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,060
And rock music blares!

989
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,980
Blares! Blares! Blares!

990
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,960
You can hear me!

991
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,060
Get ready!

992
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:08,060


993
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:08,060

If you don't rock, you can 사람이be for knocked off!

998
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,340
We mostly do it rock-اد and rock-ad TV shows and movies.

Burn in me!

1005
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,780
If you're a monster, like a looker,

1006
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,780
baby won't cut his tongue.

1007
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,800
You're tired.

1008
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,920
You're weak.

1009
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,600
You're vulnerable.

1010
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,260
You're a physical help.

1011
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,760
You're suffering.

1012
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,680
Is there any escape?

1013
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,440
Is there any escape from noise?

1014
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,220
Is there any escape from noise?

1015
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:49,380
Is there any escape from noise?

1016
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:57,200
Is there any escape from noise?

1017
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,280
Supposing you're watching the Playboy channel

1018
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,760
and it's...

1019
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,240
just about time for them to have an orgasm.

1020
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,620
When all of a sudden...

1021
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,780
Wham!

1022
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,380
The horrible noise comes in

1023
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:26,060
and completely destroys your orgasm

1024
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,820
on the Playboy channel.

1025
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,880
There it goes again.

1026
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,200
That awful interference.

1027
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:40,540
Wrecking your orgasm on the Playboy channel.

1028
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:47,980
You've called the cable TV company six times.

1029
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,900
Each time the technician comes out,

1030
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,560
he can't fix the problem.

1031
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,780
He is fired.

1032
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:12,920
Wham!

1033
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,780
Wham!

1034
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,560
That sound is more important than you are.

1035
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,380
That sound is more important than your entire life.

1036
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,000
And it will stop you from having an orgasm.

1037
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,760
The baby does not deserve an orgasm.

1038
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,000
The baby is sick.

1039
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,000


1040
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,440
On the Playboy channel.

1041
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:55,380
The baby rest of life.

1045
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:21,180
Uh, and many of you say, Reverend Stang, why do you subgeniuses have to be so bad anyway?

1046
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,400
I mean, isn't this a religion?

1047
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,140
I mean, they say, I'm into Bob, but why do you have to be so X-rated about it?

1048
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:33,400
I'd like to have my child baptized in the subgenius church, but your altar girls don't wear any clothes.

1049
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,460
I never heard of a church where you were supposed to be sinners.

1050
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,300
I'd say, well, it's true, dear friends.

1051
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,160
We have at times used rather vivid and forceful language for shock value,

1052
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:53,280
but see, in our religion, for our preachers, corniness is the worst and most common sin.

1053
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:58,900
So, friend, we don't want to tame now our slack any more than we'd tame a prairie squid.

1054
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,020
It'd be like killing it.

1055
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,320
But by making it ready.

1056
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,660
For the whole family, friends, we become that much more subversive.

1057
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,900
Ah, yes, we're coming up near the end.

1058
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,340
Norm Ward and Johnny Horton on the Monday Morning Show will be coming up next.

1059
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,160
And that's right, it's no calls on the hour of slack for a while, friends.

1060
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,680
That's right, we're gagging you, the listener.

1061
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:32,820
But you can write for information from the Church of the Subgenius at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1062
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,820
I'll give that number again.

1063
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,780
At the end of the broadcast.

1064
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,320
It is just about.

1065
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,160
We've got ten seconds to go.

1066
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,540
Oh, by the way, I did get a tape of the Prairie Squid Show.

1067
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,700
Thanks to Arch Reverend Immortal Light David Aguilera.

1068
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,020
And winner of this month's Proof of the Conspiracy Award goes to Tony Granados,

1069
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,620
who called to our attention a prominent billboard in Dallas which reads,

1070
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,480
We're working to keep you working.

1071
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,380
We're working to keep you working.

1072
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,160
Proof of a conspiracy, friends.

1073
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,720
How far away is 1980?

1074
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,240
And who is Big Brother?

1075
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:07,160
And is the movie Brazil a documentary?

1076
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,620
Well, here at the hour of slack, we're spending to keep you paying.

1077
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,280
Praise Bob.

1078
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,620
By the way, I saw Transformers, the movie, and it's great.

1079
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:26,180
And I will reveal that Optimus Prime dies in the movie Transformers, the movie, and doesn't come back.

1080
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:26,960
Ha, ha, ha.

01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:32,720
Ha, ha, ha.

1086
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:32,720


1087
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:32,720


1088
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,200
Ha, ha, ha.

1089
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:33,640

01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,580
Ha, ha, ha.

1095
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,320
Ha, ha, ha.

1096
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,060
Ha, ha.

1097
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,380
Ha, ha, ha.

1098
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,720
Ha, ha, ha.

1099
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,760
Ha, ha, ha.

1100
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,020
Ha, ha, ha.

1101
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:57,220
Ha, ha, ha.

1102
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:57,440
Ha, ha, ha.

1103
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,800
Ha, ha, ha.

1104
01:02:59,120 --> 01:02:59,920
Ha, ha, ha.

1105
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,980
Ha, ha, ha.

1106
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,220
Ha, ha, ha.

1107
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:01,680

1108
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:01,800


1109
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:01,800


1110
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:02,560
Ha, ha, ha.

1111
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:02,560


1112
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,040
Ha, ha.

1113
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,360
Ha, ha.

1114
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:03,840
Ha, ha.

1115
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:03,840


1116
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:03,840

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:03,920


1119
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,460
Boy, it hadn't sounded that good in a long, long time.

1120
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,780
If you'd like to call and be on the air, have something interesting to contribute or at least intelligent.

1121
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,740
I don't know if our listeners can be both.

1122
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,040
You're right, Stang. I can say the same for your audience.

1123
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,020
I said that.

1124
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,960
Why do you think they call it subgenius?

1125
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,500
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Subparticles.

1126
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:39,860
Yes, indeed.

1127
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,320
So, if you'd like to pick up the phone, give us a call.

1128
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,660
We've been trying to get a hold of some people to be on here.

1129
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,120
And have not had too much success.
