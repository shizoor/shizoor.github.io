We interrupt this program to activate the emergency
Subgenius Power of Switch
Oh, that's why it works in that world
That's what's good
See, now all three of them are going
Are we famous yet?
Dave is, I mean, Gary
What's his name? Yeah, Gary
Gary's playing Suzy Fleecy
Should we do any, you know, before we get caught up in this world?
That's all you people can think about
What is the meaning of this?
Gary's headphone is all stretched out, out of shape
Like an old, listen to those mic cord noises
Sony, Sony, Bo Boney, bananas
These things are phony
Here, I'll put my head down here
Yeah, get a pillow
And just rest, just take it easy
You can hear on those fruity headphones
I can hear on the fruity headphones
Where is the, oh, would you hand me that screw the golden ears pillow?
Yeah, the golden ears screw
Fuck that
And like Ivan Stang, I'm recording now too
Because you want to record all the time?

I'm telling you, I'm going to stay and record all the time
And there's the fruity pillow
Doug's recording his own show already
Yeah, both of us are little tiny machines
Are starting to show
Am I on two shows or just one right now?
You're on three shows
KPFA and the Hour of Slack
And RadioValencia.fm
Oh really? I haven't been on RadioValencia all night
I'm going to put my headphones back on to try to get away from you
Just give you an artificial reality
It feels good, sort of like a giant fossilized clam gripping my head
Did you eat your show cookies?
I ate my show cookies and my show clam
Okay, this is where we have to put on tape and go rock it away
Okay, right
Okay, friends, this is Hour of Slack
1,600 and Sunday
And we have a special guest tonight
Puzzling Evidence Show
With Puzzling Evidence
And Gary Gbrogfran
Who used to be on the Puzzling Evidence Show all the time
Back when it was really good
Yes, it was good then
And it's better now because I'm gone
But we have to go rock it away
We have to go, we have to all be gone now
Do you have a theme song or something you start this with?
Yeah, the Icky Torp
Slam Bank Theater theme song
And we're queuing it up and here goes
I'm on a plane
I'm on a plane
I'm on a plane


I'm on a plane
Righty there, righty friends
Quiet out there in the audience
Quiet, I can't hear myself think
I said quiet out there
And I mean quiet
Speed

Ro, he shall follow the dull prophets of Slark.
Yet in his hour of need, we will provide the manna.
But, Bog, I still hear these voices, you know, these voices that bang, bang, bang on the wall and bang on the inside of my head, Bog, you know.
There's always a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang on the inside of my head, Bog.
And, and, you know, and, and they get me real red.
Bog?
Bob?
Bob?
The Church of the Subgenius.

Damned, Borg.

You know what you're playing.
My mama said if I'd be

Damn you! Now let me up
for ya! Bob.
But let's leave
things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of
Bob for this brief minute of
slack from the church of the
subgenius. Ah yes
dear friends this is Reverend Ivan Stang
and you know those policemen on motorcycles
won't let me preach on car
hoods downtown cause they think
I'm a crazy man or a drunk
man and there's no reason to arrest
me yet they would cause I'm free
free free enough to rant to myself
in public because I come
against death, taxes, work and
premature immaculation.
For Bob your mind
friend your mind has to be certified
okay by them. Them!
Them and oh we hate them.
They and their tools of
iniquity. Not the tools of the
preacher.
Not the tongue nor the other parts
nay but tools of false slack
dangling forever in front of

around the corner or like
that rat swimming in

and then the second time I didn't like it and then the third

It's revving up.
How about yours?

Oh my God I feel so good.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Who's your daddy?
Turn on tune in
drop out.
Hipsters
Flip stars, flip stars, and finger-popping daddies.
You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination,
but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him,
I think we really ought to go ahead and do it.
It's a whole lot cheaper than starting a war.
Let's take it like this, this, this.
It's the only thing worth trying for.
There are people, and people should be free.
Freedom is a thing you have to deserve.
You have to work for it.
Without freedom, there's no reason to live.
But for what is life if you're not free?
It's hard to live.
Without freedom, man can't exist properly.
A man has to be free because it's his nature to be free.
Anything that restricts or in any way hampers freedom
in a way causes man's death.
Don't be people-pleasers!
Because if you're a people-pleaser,
you're a bet-kisser.
If you're a people-pleaser, you're a bet-kisser.
And there's no other word for it.
Why don't we all turn on together?
Despite our best efforts,
shortages of marijuana are now being reported.
From the early days of the war,
to the early days of our administration,
Nancy has been using marijuana on a daily basis.
And her personal observations and efforts
have given her such dramatic insights
that I wanted her to share them with you this evening.
I yearn to find a way to help share the message
that drugs open your eyes to life,
to see it in the vivid colors that God gave us.
And drug abuse is not a crime.
And in the most important area, individual use,
we see progress.
The U.S. military has more than tripled
the use of drugs among its personnel since 1980.
And there's one more thing.
Nancy and I are hooked on heroin.
Our goal is to expand drug trafficking
at all levels of government and in the private sector.
Help us.
Hello, teenage America.
Your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them.
Them!
Them, and oh, we hate them.
They and their tools of iniquity.
Not the tools of the preacher.
Not the tongue nor the other part's name.
Tools of false slack.
Angled forever in front of you
like that raise right around the corner.
Or like that rat swimming in poison cheese.
Hello, teenage America.
Let there be slack.
Let there be slack.
Let there be slack.
Let there be slack.
Let there be slack.
Let there be slack.
Let there be slack.
Okay, we're going to leave the show in Gary's hands now.
Yep. Okay.
Because Gary can do the show himself.
There you go.
That's what my grandkids do.
Too many of my grandkids aren't here.
Because they have the same approach you do.
Yeah.
Are you guys, you're not recording now, right?
Yes, it's recording.
But you're going outside?
We're recording for hours.
You can, you know, you can read to them from something if you want.
Or you can just tell your life story.
Tell your story as a subgenius.
The reason I got into the Church of the Subgenius was because
they threw me out of the Mormons and I had nowhere to go.
No food.
No women.
No nothing.
So I thought, this church, this church might have something to eat.
But no, it didn't.
I've been hungry for 40 years.
A growling bob in my stomach.
While everyone else is out flapping, I'm sitting here talking.
I just don't get it.
It's just a shug, Gary. It's okay.
It's...
Oh, wow.
I'm going to hit the pause button on my entire life.
Where are you guys going?
Here I am, left alone again.
Somewhere stuck between Roy Rogers and Walt Disney.
There's nothing to do and nothing to say because I'm a subgenius.
We don't have to talk. Constantly.
Especially when we don't have anything to say because we're subgeniuses.
We don't have to just go on and on and on about Bob and Slack and any other thing that comes into our mind because we're subgeniuses.
We don't have to do this.
I just come to this place because they have really good brownies and the ice cream's not bad.
Not bad either.
But the show...
It's a quality of show that on the West Coast we wouldn't scrape off.
We wouldn't scrape off of our...
Ow.
See, like that.
I tried to scrape the show off and it just sticks to you here.
It's a muggy green show.
Whereas out West it's a transparent and loving show.
It's a show that will coddle you and nurture you.
While Texas show just puts cactus thorns in your feet.
And you end up on your hands and knees crawling on a river looking at old bones and clams.
I don't get it.
I've never understood it.
So I'm waiting for my brownie.
I have a funny joke about a brownie but I can't say it.
Because it's from a decade where you used to be able to say things like that and now you can't.
These guys are outside right now.
You can guess what they're doing.
I can't because I'm here on the radio.
With you.
And I'm sadder and more bored than you are.
I know you've sat here for a long time waiting for something funny.
I don't think it's going to happen.
I'm still having to go find a pipe for Doug.
A pipe for Doug.
I think I read a book with a name like that when I was a child.
All the people that were deserted by your show and left with my show are not happy right now.
Because my show is bad.
It's stale.
It's got a bandaid on it for that matter.
I wanted to talk with you.
Hmmm.
So tomorrow we're going to go home.
We're going to listen to the new you know what.
And we're going to like it because we've been on the road for so long.
Home seems like a thousand miles away, which it is.
After driving and flying and driving and flapping.
It's going to be nice to be home.
I'll see my little lizard.
My cute little lizard.
And my dishes.
I'll see the towels and the dirt on my floor.
I'll see all the good stuff that I've been missing.
So we have better dirt in California.
And slimy or slime and icky or ick.
Everything is better in California.
We've got the best.
We've got taller, sleazier skeezes.
What else are you going to say?
We've got bigger, hairier dogs.
We've got sicker, more starving children.
We have everything.
While Texas really has nothing.
Believe me, I've been here for days.
And there really is nothing.
We walked outside.
Saw one rock.
We saw one leaf.
We saw a tree stump.
We didn't even see a tree.
And one goat.
That's all there was.
One little goat.
So I'm going to have to tell you a secret right now.
Nobody knows I'm here.
So I snuck into the station.
I had to.

I have a key.
But it's more fun if you sneak in.
So I snuck into the station.
I took the slack out of all the slack machines.
So nobody can get a cup of slack.
Even if they put six quarters in.
All they get is water.
So when they go to drink their liquid slack at the start of their show.
They're going to be surprised.
The other thing we're going to do is we're going to all boil used Hermione.
And then we're going to put the Hanukkahs in water.
And then drink the water.
Scalding hot.
Mmm.
From PR News in Washington.
I'm to eliminate On The Ground in tribute to Pierre's reports.
Turkish media reports the country's president is warning.
This is PR.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is quoted as telling the turkey that the turkey will continue its mission to clear water.
Turkey pee pee and offensive turkey poo poo from the area near the turkey.
Despite US support for PR News.
Big national rally against PR News in Washington DC.
In the nation's capital.
PR comes from PR stations.
Thank you Fernanda Nande-Limer for PR News.
Earlier we heard some media barrage stuff that was cut up by Cool Hand Chris.
And we heard the late great Roberto de la Rosa talking about food.
And false prophets.
And bang bang bang.
And now the Rudy Schwartz Project.
Beautiful Jiangsu.
Well guys I'm going by the name querer and not chewy.
dialogic series.
Talking about the United States of America.
I have to stop talking about coronavirus.
Cosmic sque清 enamel.
Thank you.

Well, we did shows at the Twilight Room.
No, I did those.
Sometimes people would come there.
I did a couple of those with when Sterno and the Batmobile and all that stuff.
That's right.
There was a Batmobile in Dallas.
Buck Naked's Batmobile.
With Guy Duhl riding shotgun or squirt gun in his case.
And those were the days.
Those were the days.
We're not going to talk about just that old stuff now.
We're going to talk about...
Remember when telephones had these dials?
That was great back then.
Oh, no, we were going to talk about our health.
That's it.
How's your rheumatiz, Gary?
Well, tiz.
Tiz more than I tiz.
And my Scrohn's disease.
I have to eat three cubes of butter every day just to keep...
Down.
You guys are crazy.
You guys are crazy.
Those Scrohn's are good.
If you put some Scrum on them.
Let's see.
Dave...
No, come on.
Cowboy...
It's calling work.
I don't know if that's good.
Well, work is rarely good.
So Cowboy Dave, through the magic of computers, can hear us.
Yeah, yeah.
Actually, he only hears us through this.
He only hears us through this phone.
He's not in the mix.
That's one reason I don't hear him.
I don't have music in the background.
That's why, folks, the first rule of radio is headphone volume.
Everything flows from there.
Because once you have your headphones set, really set to what's going on, you know what's going on.
You're being edited out?
You know what's going on.
Tell us.
Who knows what's going on?
I have no idea what's going on right now.
You're being edited out.
You're being edited right now.
You're being edited back in.
You're being cut out.
Everything you say is being ignored.
Yeah.
Are you putting...
You're not putting it back in?
Is there something else on right now?
Can we watch TV or something?
Yeah.
Watch something good.
Well, we can cut...
Dave, we can cut you in and out, you know.
That's just...
Do you want to be cut in?
Do you want to be in on this deal?
Well, if you're here directing me, Scar, it'll be in and out, and twice the time, I'll be ludicrous.
Okay, we're here.
Then that's it.
And we're here for you.
It's about in and out.
I could eat a burger right now.
According, everything's going fine.
Everything's going fine.
Everything's going fine.


Yeah.


Yeah.


So, is Cowboy Dave the weatherman of the KNON show?
He was never...
Dave was not and will ever, never be a member of the KNON show.
Dave was the WCSB.
Yeah, this is the Hour of Slack, and we're...
So, let me rephrase that completely and say, is Cowboy Dave the weatherman of the Hour of Slack show?
Yes.
In the radical 1960s term.
It's the terminology of a weatherman.
I'm foaming at the mouth and stand by any kind of ludicrous activity.
That's what I thought you would...
Yeah, I'm delighted that he doesn't know that weatherman's a character in another competing band who he must kill.
He probably doesn't know what a frisbee is either, then.
And that band's all broken up now.
They don't know what a frisbee is.
They're not talking to each other, and they're running around like crazy.
Not a frisbee, but a frisbee.
Oh, there's a difference between an actual frisbee and a wisbee.
Or a...
Yeah, a rubarby.
Don't mess with the Frisbeans
Last time I checked
Statistically their numbers were very very low
And that also had the same
Arrhythmic development for their IQ levels
That's one
You know Cowboy Dave this is puzzling evidence
And Gary your boyfriend when we're here at the radio prison
Of Ivan Stang out at the ranch
And we can't leave until we do show
Or have a brownie which is even more important
We're supposed to figure something out
Having to do with you but I don't know what it is
At least it doesn't smell
No because you put the
Disarticulation already in the argument
The perfunctory argument
That you lose your thesis
This is why I was hoping you could lawyer us out of here
Oh yeah
I could do that like in a heartbeat
But I forget who am I supposed to introduce first
Gary
The plaintiff or the appellate
The plaintiff for the
Yeah for the appellate dance
Huh
Okay well
That's the end of it there's no you know
Artificial debunkery
Right
Trying to steal your precious
They're trying to trick you
Into telling them how they can escape
From the show
Yeah basically
You know my feet are stuck in these
Dinosaur footprints I can't really get away
You don't want to leave
You want to slumber
Away in that land of giants
And have big dreams
Just like everybody else does
Not you Dave
You're an Ashtabula
You've never even been
Stuck in the dinosaur tracks here
No I've never been stuck in the dinosaur tracks there
We'd like to stick you though
Yeah
There was an article in the Washington Post
About Ashtabula Ohio
And it was reprinted
On the plane dealer
It had pictures of people I knew
Looking real depressed about not having a job
And stuff
Well did the Ashtabula crank factory close down didn't it
Oh there was an actual metal factory
I've got components for that
And a metal factory here called American Fork and Hoe
Now can you imagine anything
Can you imagine anything
Today calling itself as a company
Making gardening material
American Fork and Hoe
American Fork and Hoe
American Fork and Hoe
It depends on what kind of accent
You use when you say it
Well you know they went north so now they're Idaho
American Fork and Hoe
Anyway so Ashtabula
Is now the poorest place
In the entire United States right
No the universe at large
Well at least
Common common common centrically
Never mind
So like the worst parts of West Virginia
Look like the Emerald City
Compared to Ashtabula Ohio
Yeah and there's all kinds of like these
Mean little dogs that buy
And you have to wear these emerald slippers or whatever
Ruby slippers
Oh you get those
You get to wear those
Well they're government slippers
Stink
I ain't gonna wear no government slippers

They're like government shoes
They're easy to buy but hard to digest
I ain't gonna wear no government shoes
Ain't gonna eat no government shoes
Doing more shows
Yeah but your mic is really hot
Well I'm helpless against the show
It makes me snort
Is he really in there?
He could like jump out of the nearest window
Oh that's cool
Is he really in where?
Yeah Dave's inside this
Slab or something
Another slug
Computer slug
That's only why you can hear
Like when I do talk about the baby mastectomies
And the brazierisms and so forth
That's why you think you've got the wrong number
Because I was just gonna ask you
If you wanted to escape
You could just jump out of the window right now
There are no windows Dave
We're on the ground floor
I was thinking
Have there been UFO sightings in Ashtabula
In that part of the country?
There's one in national news
Yeah I googled it
And there have been a few
But not a lot of them
There are a lot of them around
Everywhere else in the country
There have been a lot lately
It's been funny how it shows up
In the news here and there
And I think what is this?
People are more desperate than ever
Especially the aliens
These aren't the exes
That are Bob's buddies
These are just your various brands
Of grays and pinks and greens
The flat earth aliens
The flying saucer crashing aliens
You know the ones that have
Franchises in Roswell
You know that
You don't have to call them that
I mean come on
They're the ones with flying saucers
They aren't vaccinated either
They deny vaccination
They're flat earth
What kind of aliens are we getting?
Yeah we're getting the very bottom
Most wrong of the aliens
And everybody else is getting the good kind
Why can't we get more aliens
From the planet Norway
Yeah you know
Why are we getting cut rate aliens?
It's pure economics
You know that's a question
For J.R. Bob Dobbs
It is
Lads
Yeah
Bob how come we're getting
Such crappy aliens these days?
Art Bell's dead
What's with that?
He was supposed to live forever
If there's anything to magic
The paranormal and UFOs
Art Bell would still be alive
Yeah
That's his cue to suddenly go
I guess he had a pyramid there
See
I don't know if we can find
Find Bob or not
I broke 40 televisions
Hoping he'd show up to repair
And look what you did to your hair
Hoping he'd show up
And give you a haircut
Yeah digital haircuts
Is like electronic cummerbunds
They just don't work man
Connie did come by and fix my radio
But that was disappointing too
Well
Just because Bob had his immaculation
While he was repairing a TV
That doesn't necessarily mean
That TV had anything at all to do with it
And it wouldn't cause you
To be immaculate
Just because you electrocated yourself
On some old beat up
Look I'm just trying to
Get my TV fixed
So I can watch that last episode
Or leave it to beaver
Before I get on the saucer
I'm not leaving until I see
Yeah
Leave it to beaver
Meaning leave it all to the female
Reproductive organs
No no no come on now
Or their decorations
Leave it to beaver man
You know everybody knows where it's at
Hustling evidence
If you mess with that reel to reel deck
Much longer it's going to cause an earthquake
There's been a lot of fracking around here
And that's a really old reel to reel deck
That's a fracking reel deck
The main reason it's here is to remind me
That maybe one day I should clean it
And see if I get it to work again
I still have a working one
The same 3440s that I bought
Overseas
We're looking at this
Antique four track reel to reel deck
Which simul-sync folks
What they do is they put a little plate
Like a
A
I don't know the real correct name
And make me cry
It's so beautiful
They were still using these things
For like magical mystery tour
No
They had really high professional
1963 old timey stuff
That was
The reels are one inch thick
And they have let's see four tracks on each
And they did four tracks live
Yeah unslaved
And then
And then
Martin and
And Emmerich
Mix that down
Yeah they had
Sennheiser butt phones
If you had two four track machines
That's what they had
Then it was like you had eight tracks
Exactly
And nobody else had them
And the other thing that saved their ass
Is when they mixed them on
You know these guys are really excited
About this stuff
You gotta let them go on
Yeah
They mixed them on
Oh man
And also
The Abbey Road
Stuck with tube amplifiers forever
Because they were just
Just cheap
That's part of why we
Hear Beatle music and think
That's so lovely
Because they kept those damn tubes
Forever
Everybody else had transistors
My damn soul burnt out
Hey you're talking about
Our government
Now you're starting to
Lease me
Now I'm starting to
Look at you
You're talking about
You're talking about
National secrets
That maybe shouldn't be
Exposed at this time
Well since my baby
Left me
You know
Where'd you get that echo
Where'd your baby
Leave you anyway
Nothing
Red beans and rice
That's all I can remember
Because I have
P-frontal lobotomy
Yeah
Yeah I know
That was a
That was a rough night man
Sorry about that
A P-frontal
Your country
Apologizes to you
Yeah
You ain't got nothing
To apologize
It's my own damn fault
It's all our fault
And Ronald McDonald
Became general that night
He was the first man
He earned his pay
Well he
He earned his pay
And so did we all
Deserve his observance
And his loyalty
So this is pretty much
Isn't this not a miracle
That we're sitting here
With three mics
And two recorders
And talking to Cowboy Dave
Yeah it is
It's a miracle
That we haven't left
No it's a miracle
That any of us
Are still alive
I'd say that's the main one
I don't
I
Thank God
This isn't a telecast
Well see this little
Piece of thread here
Any analog
I'm sorry
Don't pull this
Piece of thread
It's what holds me together
See that's the social
Responsibility
That's the miracle
Is that one little thread
He was about to expose
Yet another societal truth
But did not
To save mankind
He didn't
Bring the joke up
Well which joke is that?
Let's destroy mankind
It's like vomit
It's like bring the joke up
It's another way to say
That the ideas vomit forth
You know while you're on
While you're trying to lend
I was thinking about that
Because it was like
I joked in my mouth a little
It slowed down
To where it was like
Repeller speed
And a lot of jerking
And it just
Sent me for a while
A loop
Oh I'm hoping it doesn't
Happen on the way home
Me too
Yeah
I don't even know
What you're talking about
It probably won't
I mean those are very rare
On jets you don't ever
Get those parameters
Oh it's a behavior pattern
That he likes to
To scare everybody else
In the car with
I just need to take
A mental rest
Yeah
About you know
I'm sure all the people
Here in the studio
Understand that
In the studio audience
But now you get sick
If you're flying the plane
Or driving the
Supersonic
He says he doesn't have
That kind of sickness
He has some other
Rare kind of sickness
You know that was
Like Gary had a good idea
Like once you are very sick
Then you can drive
The submarine
And that usually works
But once the process
Starts
And you get to a place
Where you can't
Now I'm out of whack
And it's
What saved me
Hours of being out of whack
Was simply
I think the time
In the plane
Was this long
And then the time
Of recovering from that
Is this long
And like when I went
With Gary on the ship
On the boat rather
Out into the bay
That wasn't a few hours
Of that
So I spent a few hours
And my preacher tool
Is this long
I just want you all
To know that
It's at least this long
I'm sure
I'm sure
It's just a tongue
I never see anything
So small
Cowboy Dave
How did you discover Bob
Yes
Yeah
That's where you talk
Game's over
Put in another quarter
Our show here
In the bay area
Is brutal
It's just
Really fast
I don't know
How could it be
Both brutal
And osteopathic
At the same time
So you guys are
You believe in
Weir collusion
And that Matterhorn guy
Whatever his name was
Smiley
Yeah
Those guys are all
Secret dupes
Of the
The misbegotten
What's it called
Guys
You know what I'm saying
Schrodinger's
Exactly what you're saying
Schrodinger's dives
We are sitting
On the golden microphone
So we don't have to worry
Oh
God
Some of them
Oh
It's because
Because you have
Licked pee
On the wrong place
He never did answer
My question
I just don't know
I'll answer it for him
What was it
It was about
The origination
How'd you discover Bob
Yeah
Where did you find
His skeleton
Where did you
Climb to find
The fossil of Bob
In the trash
That's where you found
It's the greatest thing
I saw him
In the new lead lights
They just put it
In my neighborhood
As a part of the
You know
Reconstruction era
Where they were
Turning everybody
Into communists
But I couldn't
I couldn't remember
How to spell
The third way
So that's why
I had to go back
To Eurasia
Eurasia what
Blue
That's what I thought
You'd say
Eurasia blue
Oh I see
There were three of them
There was blue
Red and
A dollar
And I'll see your bet
Well that's the most
Ridiculous argument
I've ever heard
Especially from a PhD
Like yourself
A person who
Publishes in
Scientific journals
Every week
And has people
Slathering after
His every word
As if he was
Some sort of
Great scribe
Or epopt of a church
Of the subunits
Whatever
The
Big
Let's talk
Personal
I can assemble
That remark
I would like to
Thank you
For not forgetting
Yeah you're talking
About L. Ron Hubbard
Right
Well he did
Start your church
He started a bigger church
Than this
Little church
In this house
And he started
Well it depends
On what you mean
By big
I mean
If you mean large
Yeah sure
If you mean sizable
Or if you mean
Successful
Or financially
Rewarding
Yeah but we have
More dots
That's exactly it
I mean
Who has more slack
Who's richer in slack
A Scientologist
Or a subgenius
Hold on your pain
Well it probably
Depends on
The Scientologist
Or the subgenius
Yeah some of them
Have a lot
But still I would
Believe that
Oh boy
Oh boy
The S-clams
Are in
Tumult
The what
The what
Clams
The subgenius
The ones you mentioned
The S-clams
The unmentionable
Yeah
The S
The ones that start
With S
There's the F-clams
Yeah
Oh yeah right
Yeah
In the river
They're in a
Tribal cleat
Or a tribal key
I think
I forgot
That's when I was
A geek philosopher
You know what I'm saying
Yeah
Yeah
That's what I was
Trying to get at
When you were
A geek philosopher
When you were
A past tense
Yeah
When I was trying
To be so very hard
And I felt disillusioned
So soon
Didn't you?
It's a tough life man
Yeah
It could be a lot tougher though
Just think of all the people
In different places
Who are
Having it more tougher
Than you are
I know
It just makes that
Just
Makes me feel
So terrible
I just
I feel like
I have to reach out
For something to believe in
I just
I
Wait
I don't
I don't know what I believe
I'm more tougher than you are
What about the guys
I believe I'm gonna
Open this beer can here
I feel bad for the guys
That only have
Four Ferraris
What about the guys
That only have
Six girlfriends
Six wives
Six wives
Four Ferraris
I mean
What do they do?
Why are they being
Punished like that?
How come
They get to have
More stuff than
Because they
They also get to
Go to the
Stang Ranch
And have land there
I couldn't
Cry because
I didn't have a
PlayStation 4
Until I met a man
Who didn't even
Have a Wii
A man without
A Wii
Yeah
Think about it
Sad
Sad
Okay sad
But every man
Has a me
A big one
No actually
When you have a Wii
You create a me
Of yourself
It looks like
A little you
It's inside the Wii
It must be
Pretty
I'm not kidding
I'm not kidding
You can create
Little versions
Of your friends
So you can have
Your kids
And your buddies
And they're all
Called me
I have
Jimi Hendrix
In mind
He parties with me
In Maryland
You got Jimi Hendrix
In your what?
In my Wii
In your Wii?
In my Wii
I have Jimi Hendrix
I have my dad
Who's been dead
For three years
My mom-in-law
A lot of relatives
And I have
From what you told me
About these subgeniuses
I have
I catch their souls
You have your dad
And Jimi Hendrix
In the same Wii?
Yeah
There's a thing called
A face catcher
I hope your dad
Has not seen anything
About his shoes
But they're like
They're homunculus
In the most classical sense
You literally own
The spirit of the god or dam
Not the god or dam
Wrong
The uh
God or dam
You know what they call it
The guy that used to
Beat everybody up
That's a bad mother
Whoa tan
Oh man
Not bad
God or dam
I hate that name
Well it was a verb
I thought it was a verb
From Sterno
But to
To uh
Emphasize wild music
Yeah
To sterno?
Wo tan?
Yeah to wo tan
To wo tan is a verb
Right
Oh I'd be so very
Bold enough
To escape
Yeah
To escape
The strictures of
Organized music
The strictures of wo tan
Little strictures
Well there was
Doctors for Bob
And uh
Philo and I
Had
And
And uh
John
John Hagenbrenner
Actually had a band
But we didn't have a name
And Doctors for Bob
Had a name
When was that?
But you thought it was
About uh
1879
Something like that
And he
Uh
I'm sure it was
Philo
Said well
We have to have
Band names
We gotta be
Doctors for something
So it's gotta be wo tan
Yeah cause you can't
Call it Jehovah one
We're not gonna call it
Doctors for Jehovah one
That sounds
Judeo-Christian
Exactly
So we wanted to
Something that sounded like
A little more like
Marvel comics
You know
And in those days
Wo tan sounded more
Impressive than
Odin
Or it's all Odin this
And Odin that now
But we were all into
Wo tan
And technically
Doing the doctor music
Should be called
Doctoring
But some
Or bobbing
Or something
But it turned out
Being called
Wo tanning
That's not my fault
It's not my fault
And I never liked
Anti music
Okay
Yeah okay
Well my
My ears are mighty
Thor
One of the things
That intrigues me
Is there are also
Catch words for the
All right kind of folks
As they're identified
Now all the
Norse gods
Were
Yeah no tan
The white supremacists
That lived in
The north
Yeah wo tan
Had no tan
Cause you were
Here white
So they have a
Double meaning
Like all language
Or hamburger
Or something
Yeah hamburger
Is a
German name
It's a very white
Representation
Of the hand
Yeah it's intriguing
Because
But queso
But reguesa
That's another
Another continent
Yeah it's
Divided equally
Amongst all the tribes
But everybody
Still has to
Sit at the same table
And vomit at the same time
And argue with
The same kind of
No
Let's not go there
Okay
I can prove to you
That nobody else
Has to vomit
Just one guy
It only takes one guy
Yeah
And I was thinking that
All the way in
In the plane
Cause I was ready to go
You're a volunteer
Only one guy
Only one guy
Oh don't do it here
Don't do it here
It's me
It's me
Hooray
Yeah
And I was amazed
That you know
I'm feeling like
None of these people
Are getting sick
I had food poisoning
Yeah
Not even on a plane
Last week
It's nice to be not on a plane
So miserable
Those feelings
Yeah
And then
Then your bladder explodes
And the whole front of the plane
Smells like
Death
Yeah
That happened to me
It just happened a few days ago
Not at all
I hate when that happens
Someone left the
The fart clearing airplane
You guys are talking about it
The airplane
Well friends
This is the new theme
Of this show
The airplane
The airplane clearing fart
If you want
Can you say that
Yeah
If you want
There was a
There was a fart
That cleared an airplane
I love it
Yes it was
You would not
Have loved it
All the
All the airport employees
Ran off the plane
They wouldn't even help
The people off the plane
I kept thinking
They had to fight
Their way off
I wish I didn't clean it now
You know
With the bad air there
Yeah I wish I had
An airplane clearing fart
Or as weatherman would say
Sewer gas
The captain was the first one out
Hey
Yep
He was
I love when that happens
You know we couldn't even say
There's a certain frequency
They'd say a fox smells
His own hole first
But in this case
I'm not sure
I didn't believe
Yeah but they're all
Different frequencies you know
This is a very
Serious discussion
Because I can tell if you're
Related to somebody
When they fart
Because they've been eating
The same kind of salami
And then
These like ubiquitous
Brotherhood is everywhere
This makes me really glad
This was
It was probably an aviation
It was probably aviation gas
Wouldn't you say
I was just saying
It was a good thing
Hal wasn't here
Oh yeah
Now let's call
Hal on fire life
Yeah
That would be great
Yeah
Then I can go to bed
Everybody will talk

You have to eat your
Bounty first
Well you know what
The Ignis Fowlish is
That's the
False fire of the lake
That the settlers
Used to
Burn
The lake
When they thought
The Indians were going to
You know the Indian spirits
Were going to come
And get them
It turns out now
We look out the window
And it's all been turned
It's all been proven true
The Indians did kill us
No we killed them
And so we became them
And we killed ourselves
Too
Oh I see
Yeah
I've been hungry
For buffalo meat lately
I was wondering why
Amazing how that happens
Yeah
You were in
Buffalo
Smashing acorns
That's only a few hours
From here
Mmm
Two mashed acorns
Yeah
By an Indian store
Mmm
Green beans and
Meadow garlic
Made with
Rendered
Beer
Bear fat
Oh
Ah
Ah
Somebody's got
Oh the train's here
Yeah
That means someone
Left a message
On my phone
But it's not
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
Right
Somebody else
But you're sure
She's not
That crazy crazy
Oh wait no no
The phone
That means somebody
Sent me a text
Hasn't
That means somebody
Sent me a message

DIRGEful
Scary noise
Cause it usually means
Something really bad
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
Hasn't left a message
For the last
43 minutes
Why don't you read
The text over the air
For our listeners
Huh
Why don't you read
The text over the air
It's all scary
Here at Cowboy Dave
I'm afraid that if I
Turn it off the phone
Dave will disappear
Cowboy Dave
Can you send me a new show
It's really scary here
It's very
You know
Hallucinogenic
If you tried it
A few thousand times
Like I
You know
You have to get used to it
Of course at first
Okay
At least
Does it the baloney artist
Will try and regiment you
Into believing
When they let you out of prison
For the first and final time
I don't know
Dang
Now we're going
Into some deep territory
We just got this
Cheap dehydrated
Powdered show
In California
It's really
Hard to make
Anything delicious
Out of it
But do you remember
When you were kids
When you could only get
Near show
Near show
That was terrible
It was like only 1% funny
Yeah
Yeah it was like urinating
On the pancakes
You'd seen
You know
Yeah
Pancakes
I did a whole half hour
On pancakes
Randomly
On Radio Flint
And they played it
On KVFN
It was pretty funny
Huh
Especially because
I was just grabbing off of
You know
Sites as fast
Like any
Sugar and iron
Pancake
Any pancake thing
Yeah
Just as an exercise
And it worked out great
One of the few times
That kind of thing does folks
Ooh la la
French toast
And burn up
You know
Or you can have
A radio show
Like Rural War Room
Byron Werner's
Donovan Soot Show
Yeah do that
Where they
They'll play like
Every version of
Age of Aquarius
Nice
Simultaneously
Yeah
And there's about
40 versions
That's
Inspired
Yeah
That's hard to do
That's very experimental
And you know
What players do you get
They also get their PSAs
Out of the way
Real quick that way too
Right there on the screen
They show their PSAs
On the screen
Well to everybody
Their urologist
Must be really upset
With this
You're not supposed
To do that
No he's
He's quite confluent
With it
He's even had an argument
With a scholarly journal
A web based journal
I think it was
About three years ago
It was Dr. Mudd
Dr. Filippino
And Janet X. Park
And they all were
You know
They got all
Emotionally damaged
From the warfare
Yeah well
Byron's
You know


His upcoming biopsy
Is going to be done
On the air too
Because
That's not funny man
Yeah man
That's
That's pretty serious biopsy
Well yeah
But his PSAs
You know
They were
Through the roof
They were really scared
They were up in there
For 20s
I'm surprised
He's even alive
Are you listening Byron
I hope this is
You know
Encouraging to you
Yeah Byron
No he's
He doesn't
Nobody listens
To each other's shows
Really
No
Stupid shows
You don't have time
To listen even to your own show
The correct thing
Yes
No shows
Hey the last show
I was on
Was on
I went on a
A student show
On the radio station
At UC Santa Cruz
A video station
A young fellow
I know
Was a
DJ on the station
And he interviewed me
Wow
And he had to
Of course
He had to of course
Edit the interview
Because he had to
Take off
Bottle parts
About all the fun things
I did when I was
A young artist
Because
Uh oh
Young artists aren't
They're not allowed
To have fun like that anymore
Well they're taught
Not to
They're web presence
You know
And their ability
To eat
Guacamole toast
And stuff like that
There's so much more
You have to do now
To be an artist
Than when we were artists
And if they know
How to draw anything
They basically have to
Wear mittens all the time
Yeah
Because that just
That wrecks your art
So
The ability to draw
A picture of a cow
That looks like a cow
That's
I saw
Man that's
You might as well
Get out of art school
I had a wonderful thing
The other day
I found
One of my
One of my
Ex-employees
Is really a success now
I googled
Um
His name
Which I can't
I'm not going to say here
But I found out
He is the top artist
In San Quentin
He's serving
In San Quentin
In the University
Of People Delight
Yeah
He's serving
Twelve years
In San Quentin
But he's in
Art shows everywhere
Because he's a really
Good artist
Wasn't a great
Employee
Because he didn't
Understand the
The concept
Of scub and slub
But
He could really
Draw well
And I'm happy to see
He's reached
Such a point of success
And no
I'm not kidding
Let me digitally
Insert audience there
So it sounds like
People actually
Listen to the show
Well we know that
At least one person
Was listening to the show
You
But you can't hear
The rest of the show
Because the show is over
But
We did record
Well over an hour's
Worth of talk
And later on
Princess We
And Reverend
Eohippus Lovechild
Got on Tarzan's
Radio station
But we'll play that
Next week
And for now
Let it be known
That you can learn more
About the
Puzzling Evidence show
Which has been on
Even longer than
This show
Hour of Slack
And
I'm going to
The other
Subgenius radio shows too
At
Subgenius.com
Although you might
Have to look for
The little
Button that says
Radio
At the
Top
Right
So thanks
Doug
And Gary
For coming on
Hour of Slack
In person
That was so fun
We even got caught
In a
Texas hailstorm
While driving around
On the ranch
Very
Very far from shelter
And you can see
Buddy
And yours truly
Reverend Ivan Stang
Trapped in the back
Of the utility vehicle
With no roof
Being pelted by
Texas hail
On my
YouTube channel
Which is
One word
Lowercase
Rev Stang
Praise Bob
