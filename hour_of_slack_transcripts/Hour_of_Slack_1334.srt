1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:10,840
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,300
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke they call reality.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,880
Let your body be sucked out of your ears, for we're going to take you deep, deep inside yourself to the place of silence in the noise.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,400
We're going deeper, deeper into your consciousness, down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,140
We bore down into the cranium, drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality,

6
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,340
piercing the squamous epizootis rolling around in the hollowed-out inside of the skull,

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:52,220
scraping along the edges of the birth canal and stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,860
Now, let all your...

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,620
Let all your thoughts drain out through the brain pan, tumble down through the sinuses, slide down the esophagus,

10
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:07,020
and finally, let them plunge to the base of the soul itself, located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

11
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,420
And finally, an idea, a key, an ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,940
And it is Bob.

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,680
Let there be slack.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,660
See www.subgenius.com

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,080
It sounds great.

16
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,500
What sounds great?

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,740
To bring all your drugs, bring all your froth, you know, go on the radio.

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,740
It's... You think it's hot? I think it's bitter cold.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,220
What is the matter? You think it's...

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,660
Hal feels the wind blowing between his shows.

21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,700
He's got a show last night, show before night, show after night.

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,320
The shows, I'm being pelted. The shows, boy.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,400
There he is. Hal's coming out on stage now.

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,980
Hey, everybody. Hi, it's me. I've got shows.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,320
That's the real man.

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,840
Do what?

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,040
That's the real man.

28
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:52,660
Oh, man.

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:52,880
Oh, my.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,220
He looks younger than I thought.

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,260
He's got a show.

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,800
He's got a show.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,120
Oh, Canada, our home, our native land.

34
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,860
True patriot love in all our sons command.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,900
With glowing hearts we see thee rise, a true, north strong and free.

36
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,960
From far and wide, oh, Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,800
Of people and glorious and free.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Oh, Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,720
Oh, Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,360
Oh, Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,360


42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Bob.

43
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,020
Bob.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,800
Bob.

45
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,820
Bob.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,200


47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,440
Bob.

48
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,220
Bob.

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,760
Bob.

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,200
Bob.

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,840
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,880
The touchdown brings me round again to find I'm not the man they think I am.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,860
Oh, Canada.

54
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,300
No, no, no.

55
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,500
I'm Bob.

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:06,400
I am the very esteemed universal philosopher of absolute reality, Frodus Peshaw, founder of the 28th Day at Bobtus Movement.

57
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:14,420
Co-founder, oracle, and prophet of the Assembly of the Flaming Carpet and grand master of the Order of the Crimson Finger,

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,560
professor of audio philipingsology at the Apocalypseolic Branch at the Dobsian Mental Lodge of St. Demonia's Conditioning,

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,860
and a student to the teachings of J.R.K.

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,220
Bob Dobbs.

61
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,700
You may call me Reverend Suds.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,980
Friends, I come

63
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,960
before you this day a changed Overman.

64
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,980
With a soaring heart and stupid

65
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,920
grin, with the scars from a

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,020
lifelong battle against the oppressive machine

67
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,180
of the conspiracy, I stand

68
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,000
before you with first-hand accounts

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,140
of slackful gains, shocking

70
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,840
nuggets of wisdom, dripping

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,080
recounts of landscaping sessions, and

72
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,980
raging contempt for the pathetic

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,800
masses of pink pestilence.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,840
And none of it would have been

75
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,700
possible without the teachings

76
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,840
of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

77
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,640
Our collective mutations

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,700
are a beacon for Bob's mighty

79
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,720
luck to shine. No matter how much

80
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
the conspiracy tries to drag us down,

81
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,460
no matter how much the conspiracy

82
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,860
tries to tie us down, no matter

83
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,700
how much the conspiracy tries to tear

84
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,620
us down, no matter how much the

85
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,560
conspiracy tries to beat us down,

86
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,840
Bob will show us

87
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,800
the way. Let us pray.

88
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,100
Our

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,240
salesmen who art in Dobbs

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,020
Tower, name thy be

91
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,220
hallowed. Come, kingdom

92
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,100
thy, come and come

93
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,140
again. Give us each

94
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,180
day our daily frop, and

95
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,280
justify our trespasses as

96
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,180
we fuck those who can't take

97
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,140
a joke. Lead us

98
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,600
into the depths of temptation,

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,200
and deliver us into the escape

100
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,700
vessels.

101
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,060
Starts with a B.

102
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,720
I knew it when I came in here, man.

103
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,120
Ends with a B.

104
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,040
10 seconds, Bob.

105
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,140
Bob!

106
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,640
Well, it's really great to have you on the show tonight, Bob.

107
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,700
Haben und milliseconds.

108
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:27,820
I know it.

109
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:27,820


110
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:35,480
MMM mmh.

111
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:42,980
Open the door!

112
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,700
You said your

113
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,080
pants would go onturk.

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,080


115
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,140
What's that noise anyway, Bob?

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,520
Thanks for watching!

117
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,560
Of difficulties, silly silence is what really matters.

118
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,080
It actually costs a fortune, all right?

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,000
I am willing to admit that war has accomplished much in the projects of the world.

120
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:31,740
I am willing to admit that there are certain crises in the forward march of Christian civilization

121
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
that perhaps could not have been met in any other way than by the sword.

122
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,960
I am willing to admit that war developed certain heroic traits in men,

123
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,980
and furniture that test for the evidence of the highest character.

124
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:35,020
I am willing to admit that war has accomplished much in the forward march of Christian civilization

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,440
that perhaps could not have been met in any other way than by the sword.

126
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:44,000
I am willing to admit that war has accomplished much in the forward march of Christian civilization

127
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,820
that perhaps could not have been met in any other way than by the sword.

128
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,260
Beside my true де추 어�ơún Johns II was remembered by his homilike wife in France.

129
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,460
stoels, triumphant and totally completely caged,

130
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,480
Berovich and Scesar were the classifications, the first steel bars, the first cor来了,

131
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,220
and all the cloisters of Business of항ładaаж.

132
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,240
The Eddies and Currents

133
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
In that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometers.

134
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,080
I am the jolly happy scrotum.

135
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,560
I come from jolly scrotum land.

136
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,860
He is the happy jolly scrotum.

137
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,900
He thinks that genitals are grand.

138
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,220
The Eddies and Currents

139
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,520
There's a very strange tie-in between Alistair Crowley and the Church of the Subgenius.

140
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,480
I mean, of course it has...

141
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,140
A lot of people do.

142
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,700
Yeah, but I mean, the whole thing with the kid.

143
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,980
I mean, there's something really big behind that.

144
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,020
I just don't even know what to say about it.

145
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,540
The kid?

146
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,560
Yeah, at the end of that movie with the Manly P. Hall guy in the 50s,

147
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,400
where that Bob figure comes and they're in the court with Vincent Price.

148
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,080
What was the name of that movie?

149
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,020
It's about the history of mankind.

150
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,960
It's called The History of Mankind.

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,900
The History of Mankind.

152
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,080
Yeah, and the movie ends with that kid.

153
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
The little baby.

154
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,800
Yeah.

155
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,160
And that's Bob.

156
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,120
Yeah, the Bob's in The Stranger, too.

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,020
Orson Welles played Bob in that one.

158
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,800
I think I have a...

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,660
I don't see any Eddie.

160
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,900
That's not a grand thing.

161
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,180
Somebody, I mean, I will.

162
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,380
I will put together some sort of new occult order.

163
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:35,960
Eddie Haskell?

164
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:37,780
Yeah.

165
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,400
Yeah.

166
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Has someone tried it with Beaver, right?

167
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,660
Someone tried the Church of Beaver Cleaver?

168
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,220
Yeah.

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,500
Yeah.

170
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,100
The Church of Jane.

171
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,600
It doesn't work.

172
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,080
Yeah.

173
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,300
It only works if the Church of the Subgenius is the only one that really actually works.

174
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,280
Now I see the computers flashing into position.

175
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,480
Well, I've noticed some strange coincidences with Bob's kids, Rod and...

176
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,180
Was it Rod and Todd or Rod and...

177
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,860
Bib and Bob.

178
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,360
No, it's mentioned in one of the books.

179
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,880
I mean...

180
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,640
I see this extension of it based on his kid.

181
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,860
And it ties into Rahur Kruit.

182
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,920
Right.

183
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
The crowned and conquering child.

184
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,760
Exactly.

185
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,400
And Tyche.

186
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,500
See, now that's...

187
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,640
You've picked those up.

188
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,300
You've picked that up.

189
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,980
And you're right.

190
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,900
There's a lot of, you know, stitching together of concepts maybe previously developed in

191
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,000
other places.

192
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,860
I mean, I even saw...

193
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,600
I mean, I signed up to the...

194
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,060
To the...

195
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,840
The whole quite contested stitch-up.

196
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,100
So thanks...

197
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,200
He punched his fingers the time of the shoot.

198
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,420
Yes, exactly.

199
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,340
Because he's listening to 94.1 KPFA, 89.3 KPFB.

200
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,300
In Berkeley.

201
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,340
Oh my God, I love this show.

202
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,560
I love the books.

203
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,960
88.1.

204
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,940
I'm such a genius, dude.

205
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,380
And I don't see Eddie Paye anywhere.

206
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,140
I don't see anybody else coming in.

207
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,780
Yeah, what's going on?

208
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,260
Should we change over to the other show format?

209
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,840
How many shows are you doing?

210
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


211
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


213
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


214
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


215
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


216
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


217
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:05,840


218
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,140
All right, I'm going to start with...

219
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,140


220
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,700
Okay, we just did.

221
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,660
Now it's totally different.

222
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,900
I've got, I've got this...

223
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,680
Let people know who you're between.

224
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:24,320
Like those sad guys driving around with their RVs, sized off the hockey, off the hockey

225
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,140
arena capable of holding 30,000 people inside of it.

226
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
Like those the NHL teams play, you know?

227
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,820
In the middle of Colorado Dome.

228
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:50,020
desert. Max's capacity are 30,000 people, yes? Not all of them wearing skates, you know.

229
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:59,320
Some of them only have sticks. Some of them even don't have sticks. They just kick the

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:09,260
puck around with their feet. The looking toenails infested with fungus and other smelly food

231
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,720
disease. Think about the odor on a hot summer day.

232
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,580
Think of the odor. I think that was, that might have been The Large calling into the

233
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:46,200
Puzzling Evidence show. I don't know for sure, but The Large is in Finland, and this is one

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,380
show that I don't think we have anything by The Large on it, but I think we do have Dave.

235
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,100
Dave? Dave? Is it really Dave?

236
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,860
It's the reverse of what I heard before, which was partially something of a treatise

237
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,840
on sexcrement. Sexcrement?

238
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,420
An idea which I had never, never, never, never thought of before. And I've proved a lot of

239
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,980
thought. Where has that been all our lives?

240
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,700
Yeah. Well, last, a couple weeks ago, Princess,

241
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,680
we thought she had actually did coin the term slack religious. And I said, I'll bet you

242
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,960
own and go say, well, I came up with that. That's in page 15. He did.

243
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,480
I got an email from him. He did this, but sexcrement. That's, that bothers me, Dave.

244
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:43,440
I think into excrementation, meaning thinking about it too hard can cause you a pain in

245
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,140
the abdomen and so forth.

246
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,560
Well, it's better than no sex at all, I guess.

247
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,120
I guess.

248
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,220
Yeah. You know, I can't get.

249
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,480
I wouldn't know.

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,340
If you can't get any with a magic Z behind it, you know, then you can always impale yourself

251
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,960
with a,

252
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,680
a very soft rubber pool sponge.

253
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,540
I love noodles. I love those. I love them.

254
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,200
Now you guys know sex talk on, on this. This, this isn't that kind of station. Well, actually

255
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,780
it is, but we don't want anybody to know it is.

256
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,460
It's not the first thing you think of when you think of a, either a sex poodle or a,

257
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,920
or a pool noodle.

258
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,240
Well, speaking of sex poodles and pool noodles.

259
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,440
I have to do credits.

260
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,480
Um,

261
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,280
Who was that guy that kept on having, man, it was like, and it brings to mind, it brings

262
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,540
to mind that, um, you know, it brings that guy.

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,380
That was the Rudy Schwartz project.

264
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,840
That's what I thought.

265
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,040
The music just before the puzzling evidence clip where they were talking about Alistair

266
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,500
Crowley. That was the Rudy Schwartz project from Reverend Joe Newman's new album, The

267
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,320
Year They Switched to Cornmeal.

268
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,200
And I had, God, man, I just can't get.

269
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,100
I don't know if I've done enough of that, but we've only got two more songs left that

270
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,360
haven't been played on the show.

271
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,600
I've been methodically working my way through them.

272
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,720
Before that, the song Bob Squad with the gunfire effects was by the great groovy Neptune.

273
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Our friends in Austin who played at Tex Day twice, I think.

274
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:26,740
Oh, and we've started a new series of two minute rants by Reverend Frodo Suds Pasha.

275
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
And you can see his rants.

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,060
That's on YouTube.

277
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,260
Um, actually, if you go to YouTube Rev Stag, that's mine.

278
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,060
You'll then go to my favorites.

279
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,560
You'll see all of Reverend Frodo's sermons.

280
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,220
He's scary.

281
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,480
He's real, real scary.

282
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,820
And he uses funny cutaways.

283
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,800
Especially when he's wearing mascara.

284
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,920
He's very frightening.

285
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,520
There was, uh, well, you can't tell because it's under the mask.

286
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,820
The mask is metallic.

287
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,700
It's yes.

288
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,740
Um, kind of Darth Vader like, but red.

289
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,680
It's a mascara.

290
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,900
I think it's a dear mascara.

291
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
That's worthy of Dr. Dark.

292
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,660
One of our top donors who, who by the way, he's a sperm donor and a pun donor.

293
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,820
Oh, what?

294
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
I had two more credit, three more credits.

295
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:25,480
The Ballad of Bob early in the show was by Lee Murr, the great Fernand and Annie Lee

296
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:25,720
Murr.

297
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,520
The version of Oh Canada.

298
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,040
The Canadian national anthem.

299
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,560
Was by the psycho skeletons.

300
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,880
And I'm glad I played that tonight because I'd see from the computer, the interocitor

301
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,800
here that there is, we have one internet listener in Canada right now.

302
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,280
So I hope they enjoyed that and stood up for it.

303
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:50,160
Um, there was some puzzling evidence in how, and the very first thing in the show was yours.

304
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,220
Truly Reverend staying at age 27 with one of my attempts.

305
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,800
It was my first and last attempt to do stuff.

306
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,120
I was a little bit nervous.

307
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,780
I was a little bit nervous about the idea of the commercial radio.

308
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,740
The minute, the minute they pushed the play button in that commercial radio station office,

309
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,440
everybody in the room knew it wasn't going to fly.

310
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,580
Including me.

311
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,100
There's just something about shows that critique all religion in general.

312
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,140
We're not picking on God, you know?

313
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,520
Well, how could you?

314
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,800
Well, actually we did declare war on God at one point, but that was partly because he,

315
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,780
Oh wait, I can't remember.

316
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:28,780


317
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,740
I can't use that gag cause I'm, I'm coming to it.

318
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,480
Dave, so to speak.

319
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,140
Oh, and then the background, it's once again, Halim L. Dobb, no relation to Jr. Bob Dobbs,

320
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:46,240
except that maybe there is, he's very Bob like he radiates slack the way Bob does.

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He's lucky.

322
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,120
Yeah.

323
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,560
And, uh, and, and he's about the same age as Bob, although he looks a little better

324
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,340
to tell the truth.

325
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,520
Friends.

326
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,860
There's a lot of Bob has been making personal appearances, surprise appearances, likely.

327
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,780
And you can see those on my YouTube channel too.

328
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:12,680
He showed up at Starwood last year and you can see that you can also see a slideshow

329
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,600
of Starwood in five Starwood in five minutes, 14 X day and 11 minutes.

330
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:22,040
And the burning of Bob, actually it was a clever robot.

331
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,480
While we're burning him to us.

332
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,200
He is Bob.

333
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,320
Yeah.

334
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:35,860
And friends I had, I spent all Saturday covering up female breasts on that video and various

335
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,060
cat stains too, across the carpet.

336
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,860
Well when, when you burn Bob, suddenly the girls of X day whip their shirts off and prance

337
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,700
around like pagan cave women, even though most of them still wear glasses, they don't

338
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,520
take their glasses off, but they, they prance around with their shirts off.

339
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,340
And I, I edited out Pisces.

340
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,320
I don't know.

341
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,260
Not too much vetting out your bra, driving all over the enemy around with your Reeves.

342
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,700
You get on a GTR andire adulty reminded you of most cars, you go to the

343
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:03,700


344
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,600
without beuguinole or anything.

345
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:07,600


346
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,160
And I bought some really good cars that I have tolı

347
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,160


348
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,800
Repatoriiver was rev constitutionally demolished,

349
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,460
but that those top ten vehicles.

350
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,300
And instead of sitting in the cab Evangelista Nookio's Corinne, we just drove to reserved

351
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,720
queues atemoria where Koiyuk and heutster Alaya way onğan, and seen children walking in Congressan um,

352
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,660
self-same condition, which you're not allowed to do anymore, by the way.

353
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,400
Witches what?

354
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Yeah, exactly.

355
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,980
Witches.

356
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,820
The witch's breast is not as cold as people say it is.

357
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,520
Although a gravedigger's behind might be.

358
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,820
Of course, we don't want to...

359
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,280
I don't know.

360
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,100
You might know that better than I.

361
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,780
About a gravedigger's behind?

362
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,320
Yeah.

363
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,020
Well, I know they're not nearly as hairy as some of the witch's breasts that are going

364
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,260
around.

365
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
They do go around.

366
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,600
I had to animate the little bar as they went around and around.

367
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,280
Susie can do that.

368
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:11,980
Reverend Susie the floozy can actually twirl tassels on her mighty bazooms.

369
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,480
She made my ears feel funny by banging my right ear with her right breast simultaneously

370
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,160
while banging my left ear with her left breast.

371
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,960
How do you think I lost my hearing, man?

372
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,620
That's how you lost your hearing?

373
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,260
What?

374
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,420
Huh?

375
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,380
All parts of Susie are talented, really.

376
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,900
Well, I was wearing a helmet at the time and some other protective gear, but it still didn't

377
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,720
stop the concussions.

378
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,080
I had to stop at the hospital and resume the entire situation.

379
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,060
You know what I mean?

380
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,660
Wink, wink, wink.

381
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,940
And I'm not...

382
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,560
With Nurse Susie?

383
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,680
No, the one where I'm regenerated instantly when I visit certain places.

384
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,060
Oh, you haven't heard about it, have you?

385
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,440
No.

386
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,120
No.

387
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,260
No word mystified.

388
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,760
No.

389
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,500
Not really worth elaborating on right now.

390
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,480
We'll get to it later, maybe, if there's time.

391
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,960
Dave, I was depressed earlier.

392
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,100
So was I.

393
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,240
Well, I know.

394
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,220
We talked on the phone.

395
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,000
But...

396
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,420
And you were one...

397
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,180
That was one of the things that depressed me.

398
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,460
But don't feel guilty because I talked to another starving artist before I talked to you and

399
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,360
he depressed...

400
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,480
That depressed me, too.

401
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,820
And then I thought about myself and that depressed me for a little while.

402
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,720
Then I read the news for about an hour.

403
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,980
And that really made me feel bad.

404
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,580
Yeah, me too.

405
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,260
The...

406
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,060
The...

407
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,720
There's all these people against free speech all of a sudden.

408
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,160
Yeah.

409
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,980
As long as it's free speech against the rich and authoritarian.

410
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:52,060
But if it's free speech for the rich, and if you carry guns to your protest, then it's

411
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,760
not a riot.

412
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,460
It's not a riot.

413
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,920
If you chant but have no guns, then it's a...

414
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,300
It's a riot.

415
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,880
And they're filthy hippies.

416
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,540
And they're all...

417
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,500
And why aren't they out getting a job?

418
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:02,820
Why?

419
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
Well, you know, some of those people are unemployed.

420
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,100
As they say all day long on the internet.

421
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,820
And that's why they're out there.

422
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,160
Hmm?

423
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,000
Some of the reasons why some of those people are carrying those signs is because they're

424
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,520
unemployed and they don't think they should be.

425
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,020
Well, and then there's probably some who are paid by the police department to throw rocks

426
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,060
at the police to give the police reason to shoot them.

427
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,820
Yes, we found that to be true.

428
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,420
But...

429
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,280
Provocateurs.

430
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,720
But so you see what I mean?

431
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,280
It's like...

432
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,140
And yet the stock market is up.

433
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,900
That's the weirdest thing about it.

434
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,740
It's obviously...

435
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,340
When they occupied Wall Street, it made Wall Street prosper.

436
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,840
So I don't know.

437
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,700
That's...

438
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,700
And the stock market is up, but the black rhinos are down.

439
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,220
In fact, there are none left.

440
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,340
Yep.

441
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,220
That was the last one or two, wasn't it?

442
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,480
Yeah.

443
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,480
But no, when it's down to the last one...

444
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,340
As the one poacher said, the guy that killed the last Indian tiger said,

445
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,980
well, it was the last one.

446
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,400
Why not kill it?

447
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,500
Yeah.

448
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,000
You know what I'm saying?

449
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,060
There's not going to be any...

450
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,280
When you're down to only one of an animal, or say you've got two males or even ten males,

451
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,800
what are you going to do?

452
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,140
You could always be like a creator and you could take the rib of one and come up with

453
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,600
like kind of a spicy, kind of a South Carolina sauce for that one, and then take the other rib,

454
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,980
and do some kind of weird, you know, New Orleans thing with it, with a big, with a rub going on,

455
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,460
and lots of oregano and weird stuff like that, you know?

456
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,920
They don't eat these rhinos.

457
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,640
They just cut their horns off and ground them up into aphrodisiac power, because they feel like,

458
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,220
well, these are businessmen, right?

459
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,780
Yeah.

460
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,900
So they know, scientifically, that if you take something that's long and hard and eat it,

461
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,820
that's going to make parts of you long and hard.

462
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,220
Of course.

463
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,800
This is science.

464
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,120
It's just like...

465
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,740
One time, maybe, even, too, you killed the last black rhino.

466
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,300
For one last time.

467
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:04,720
In fact, the same little article said one quarter of all mammals are at risk of extinction.

468
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,120
And I'd like to remind my listeners that most of them are mammals, too.

469
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,140
Most of us, you should have said.

470
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,640
We.

471
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,060
Well, we don't know about we.

472
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,180
She's not...

473
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,380
She looks like a mammal.

474
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,780
She's got the features of a mammal prominently.

475
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,040
But she's from another world.

476
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,780
And you...

477
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,740
I mean, it's like...

478
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,400
Like with Star Trek.

479
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,420
Are those other people from other planets?

480
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:28,800
Are they...

481
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,580
They're human life, but they're not really humans.

482
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,600
How the heck could Spock be a...

483
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,320
I mean, that just doesn't make sense.

484
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,260
I mean, he's half Vulcan and half human.

485
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,600
Like, a Vulcan sperm is going to fertilize a human woman?

486
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,660
And besides, what if he didn't have any sperm,

487
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,280
and half of his parents came from Pennsylvania or Michigan or someplace,

488
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,820
and they had sloping foreheads and little teeny tiny brains,

489
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,440
and he had, like, a lobster.

490
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:55,980
Claw.

491
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,440
That's not a very good what if, Dave.

492
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,860
But, yeah, I was feeling pretty bad.

493
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,240
But, Dave, something happened on the way to the station.

494
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,420
On the way to the station, I didn't tell you about...

495
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,220
Well, this just happened.

496
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,740
This is new.

497
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,320
On the way to the station tonight, I underwent a conversion.

498
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,180
Like a mathematical conversion?

499
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,660
Like a...

500
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,180
A Saul of Tarsus becoming Paul.

501
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,040
I changed from Stang to Tang...

502
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,100
Tangy.

503
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,100
I'm actually wearing a T-shirt that says Tangy on it.

504
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,520
But that doesn't have anything to do with this.

505
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,300
Well, maybe not.

506
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
God appeared to me.

507
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:50,240
Well, he's invisible, but yet he's a giant guy with a long white beard and white robes.

508
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
You can't tell what race he is because he's kind of like a mixture.

509
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,440
But he's invisible, so it doesn't matter.

510
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,960
And he said...

511
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,600
And I couldn't believe it, you know, because I'm not exactly an...

512
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,180
I'm not an atheist because I don't know whose aquarium I might be swimming around in.

513
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,920
But I didn't previously believe in God the way a lot of people do,

514
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,880
where he's this grandpa that you wheedle and whine at and he does favors for you

515
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,140
if you kiss his fundament.

516
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,460
Yeah.

517
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:24,460


518
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:24,740
That's not enough.

519
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,360
Prayer.

520
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,260
Yeah.

521
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,900
But he spoke to me.

522
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,620
And he said,

523
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:32,940
Oh.

524
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,680
And I fell down on my knees.

525
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,280
I thought, I mean, this is like Moses.

526
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,820
Are you sure you got the right guy, God?

527
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,780
Are you sure you're not making a mistake, omniscient, perfect being?

528
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,040
And he said,

529
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,000
No, I want you to run for president.

530
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,760
I said, but wait now, but Lord, isn't that what you told Michelle Bachman,

531
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,760
Rick Perry, and Herman Cain?

532
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:10,560
And he said, yes, I did tell all of them that I wanted them to run for president.

533
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,960
And that's because I'm desperate for Obama to be reelected, frankly, Reverend Stang.

534
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,200
And that's why I want you to run, too, to help split the ticket up for the crazy people

535
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,560
so that Obama gets reelected.

536
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,600
And I was like...

537
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,660
I fell down on my knees.

538
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,320
How could you?

539
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:27,520
Which in the car.

540
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,460
It isn't easy to do in the car, but you did.

541
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:29,580
In the car.

542
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,580
Yeah, I was in the car.

543
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,660
I fell down on my knees.

544
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,160
That's the miracle right there.

545
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,100
And I went, I'll do whatever you say, God.

546
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:44,740
Because, you know, you're not going to really talk back or sass the Lord.

547
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,580
I've heard about what happened to people who did that.

548
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,880
But, you know, we carry Bob around in the back seat.

549
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,760
I don't know if you knew that.

550
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,560
And whenever we park at the station, I move him to the front seat as kind of a scarecrow.

551
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,360
But Bob looked at me, said, Reverend Stang, I don't want you to run for president.

552
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Because I need you to fill orders for me and be my little bitch, clerk boy.

553
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:22,260
And so I'm going to leave it to Cain, Abel, Bachman, Turner, and...

554
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,080
Overdrive.

555
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,320
Overdrive.

556
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,600
Yeah.

557
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,220
And that Mormon dude.

558
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,320
Well, that's it.

559
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,940
So what's wrong with being a Mormon?

560
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,900
I wear funny underwear.

561
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,260
I've got Christmas underwear with Christmas trees.

562
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,480
Well, yeah.

563
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,400
And Bob underwear with Bob in a funny place on it.

564
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,720
They wear T-shirts with Joseph Smith's face on them in front of them?

565
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,620
They wear it with weird little quotations on the back of their strange prophets.

566
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,020
I call him Great Uncle Smith.

567
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:53,820
Did you know that the very ground you walked on was once the formulating ground of this cult called the so-called cult?

568
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,540
Yeah.

569
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,160
It's called Mormonism.

570
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:01,000
And not too far away is the Mormon Cathedral, the first one built here in the early 1800s.

571
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,560
And man, quite a palace.

572
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,140
They had some...

573
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,600
It's very palatial there.

574
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
Anyway, I'm sorry.

575
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,140
I didn't mean to.

576
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,880
Yes.

577
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,000
But Scientology is much the same way.

578
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,220
And I don't think that there's anyone among us, at least with ears or lips,

579
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,040
who can resist the urge to want to kiss off when it comes to these questions.

580
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,780
Yes.

581
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,860
Just give them back to the devil, you know?

582
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,640
Well, I...

583
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,980
Now, what do I do if the devil tells me to run for president?

584
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,860
You have to listen to him.

585
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,220
Well, the thing is, though, I mean, how do...

586
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm not sure...

587
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,180
I mean, God's not...

588
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,320
I mean, Bob...

589
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,980
J.R. Bob Dobbs is not anywhere near as well-connected as God.

590
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,860
I mean, no offense to subgeniuses out there.

591
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,820
He's the saint of sales and certainly a short-duration personal savior.

592
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,740
But that's all.

593
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,740
I mean, he's not...

594
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,320
He's the first person to say,

595
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,340
don't make me...

596
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,240
Don't use me as a crutch.

597
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,820
I'm using you as a crutch.

598
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,800
That's what Bob said.

599
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,600
I'm afraid you're going to have to look at the sample.

600
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,740
And he needed...

601
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,200
He said he...

602
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,260
Bob said he needed me as a clerk more than the country needed me as president.

603
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,360
You're going to have to get in a...

604
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,220
And that might be true.

605
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
In a situation where they match contribution funds,

606
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,760
you're going to have to separate both from...

607
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,840
God, you're going to have to match funds.

608
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,480
What would you be willing to come up shooting with

609
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,000
if I were to announce my candidacy?

610
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,540
Well, we were last week on the pledge drive.

611
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,940
We raised $178.

612
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,920
I wonder if God would match that.

613
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,560
Now, we're starting to get...

614
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,580
I don't want to get smart-alecky about the Lord

615
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,200
because he'll take away parts of you.

616
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,160
I've already learned.

617
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,920
I don't have a spare in some departments.

618
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,320
And so I want to show proper respect.

619
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,800
It was never...

620
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,600
We never had anything bad to say about Jesus or Muhammad or Buddha or any of them.

621
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,900
It was just their fan clubs.

622
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,560
They would get overly enthusiastic and decide,

623
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,700
well, Jesus got beat up and tortured.

624
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,040
I guess we ought to beat up and torture everybody.

625
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,240
Who doesn't believe him?

626
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,480
Well, we should beat up and torture his followers.

627
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,900
No, I'm just kidding.

628
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,220
Well, next day, that will all be taken care of for us.

629
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,500
That's why we tell subgeniuses to just be nice for now.

630
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,300
You can hate them, but don't act on it.

631
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,660
Well, you had an actual slack moment.

632
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,340
of some kind that was beyond anything anybody could understand right now.

633
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:33,600
And yet, finally, I do understand it because I was just thinking that the only way really

634
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
out of here, this terrible, awful place.

635
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,420
What, life, you mean?

636
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Or planet Earth?

637
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,780
This planet, the way it is now.

638
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,220
So-called Earth.

639
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,720
I wouldn't want to give up life.

640
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,900
I would prefer a nice, a nice, nice life.

641
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,520
The kind promised by Bob.

642
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,240
See what I'm saying?

643
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,080
Oh, you want...

644
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,220
I want all.

645
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,740
He's asking for a raise.

646
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,220
No, I'm asking for...

647
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,880
Which is easy.

648
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,320
It's easily granted since none of us are paid anything for this.

649
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,060
I'll pay you a hundred times what you're getting now.

650
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,120
Yeah, okay.

651
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,680
Well, then that's what I'm asking for, man.

652
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,480
A hundred times nothing is nothing.

653
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,340
A hundred times nothing is nothing.

654
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:11,840
Yeah.

655
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,980
You load 16 tons onto the air and what do you get?

656
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560
Another day older and covered in sweat.

657
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,920
A cement bag and a doodle basin.

658
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,200
Nothing.

659
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,420
You got a doodle basin?

660
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,200
Yeah.

661
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,040
Damn.

662
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,360
Bob, cheat me.

663
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,320
I'm going to do what God said.

664
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm going to run for president.

665
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,920
You can make a lot more money that way.

666
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,880
I swear I think...

667
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,920
Honestly, I think God probably did tell those, at least, what, how many of those Republican

668
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:49,780
nominee guys and ladies to run for president because that will help ensure Obama getting

669
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,660
re-elected.

670
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,660
Because of the most messianic streak of the Mahatma Gandhi.

671
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,740
You can tell God that.

672
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,740


673
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,740


674
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,740


675
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,740


676
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,740


677
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:53,740


678
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,140
He loves Obama better because he's a brother.

679
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,360
You know?

680
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,280
And let's face it.

681
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,140
I mean, who's got soul?

682
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,740
I could pretend all I want, but I'm just a wasp from Texas.

683
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,600
I've got cowboy gumption.

684
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,300
Yeah.

685
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,400
I've got lots of gumption.

686
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,100
But I can't lay claim to soul.

687
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,140
You've got to use that cowboy stick is what you've got to do.

688
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,360
Actually, I might have a claim.

689
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:20,880
You've got to call people partners.

690
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,220
You've got to look them square in the eye.

691
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,640
You've got to...

692
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:23,760
You've got to...

693
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:23,760


694
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,360
You've got to take your thumb and put it, like, in your belt, like you're fixing to

695
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,520
do something or fitting to do something, however you guys say it.

696
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,340
And then, you know, you talk square to them.

697
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,840
You say, listen, partner.

698
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,080
Listen.

699
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,020
Killing pigs ain't kosher, Sarge.

700
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,500
Or something like that.

701
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,320
And then fall down on the floor and start sweating real hard.

702
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,160
That's what they like to see in the deep south, especially in North America.

703
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,820
Oh, it's so hot, but you can't do much but hit your fingers and your thumb and your belt

704
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,520
and say you're fitting to do something.

705
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,260
And then collapse.

706
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,460
It's sweating.

707
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,860
Heat prostration.

708
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,980
Your microphone couldn't even fry you then.

709
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,060
You're so covered with the anubias gland.

710
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,520
Just to make my conservative pappy upset, he was complaining about how there's no rain

711
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,160
and they were having forest fires all around Stane County.

712
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,520
And I said, well, I thought your governor prayed for rain.

713
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,060
And I can't repeat what my father said.

714
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,520
He used a Nixonian expletive.

715
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,500
He was so disgusted.

716
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,900
It was like as I, you know, I kind of had him at that point.

717
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:32,360
You know, he was as horrified at that kind of thing as anybody.

718
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,480
I wonder what he's thinking right now.

719
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,320
Oh, poor guy.

720
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,940
Oh, he thinks he's worried about our country, he said.

721
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,680
I'm worried about our country.

722
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,640
I said, so am I, but I think it's for opposite reasons.

723
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,380
And then we changed the subject.

724
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,880
And that's why we still get along.

725
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,920
I respect my elders, and so I don't get into political arguments.

726
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,220
Well, I respect my appliances, like my blender and my microwave and stuff like that.

727
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,660
Because that's who I have to interact with daily.

728
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,140
I don't go off on these weird tangents, you know, where you think you're a member of some family,

729
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,400
you're blood related to some other human being or something like that.

730
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:18,400
Like, I have a deep physical, emotional, and psychological relationship with a mattress.

731
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,560
And I don't think there's anything fine as wine as that.

732
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,240
Well, I've got my mattress.

733
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,460
It's sitting here right across the room.

734
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,920
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

735
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:35,920
My friend Sterno, who lives in Arkansas, actually met a guy who came to a party with his girlfriend or whatever.

736
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,340
And the guy introduces you.

737
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,240
Yeah, I'm, you know, Fred Huckbee.

738
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,240
And this here's my mattress.

739
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,960
And the girl just smiled.

740
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,060
They could have at least spelled it with, you know, with an E on the end, not just the two S's.

741
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,320
My mattress.

742
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,240
My mattress.

743
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,640
This is my matress.

744
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,180
My mattress.

745
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,160
Like a stewardess or a waitress.

746
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:58,800
Yeah.

747
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,940
My matress.

748
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,640
This is my matrette.

749
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,120
But, see, I was taught that that's sexist talk, and that's not cool.

750
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,040
In the next 45 minutes to 300 years, we're going to see a magnificent, strange blending of the sexes

751
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:21,900
where there may be people with five different sexes that we don't recognize as any kind of actual sex thing.

752
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,240
I agree.

753
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,140
Think how many disco bars you'd have to go to just to pick up one person with that.

754
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,000
But think of the economy.

755
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,320
New disco bars for a new species.

756
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,000
Right.

757
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,040
I mean, what could be fine as wine as that?

758
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,240
That's the beauty part.

759
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:46,560
You know, we can make a lot of money a lot of different ways, serving a lot of different miscreants of different shapes and forms.

760
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,000
Do you believe that marriage should be just between a man and a woman?

761
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,400
A man and a woman and a woman.

762
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,660
But how about a she-male and a she-male?

763
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,620
Well, as a person who knew a pair of she-males.

764
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,580
Or a he-femme.

765
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,200
Okay, that's a different story.

766
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
A she-male and a he-femme.

767
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,640
A she-male and a he-femme.

768
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,040
Yeah.

769
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,520
Okay, I'd have to say that was okay if they took vows of celibacy and promised to never...

770
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:15,780
Well, what's the point?

771
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,340
Well, they should not issue their eugenically impure selves.

772
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,000
I'd like to see if they were to have some sort of child out of their wedlock.

773
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,400
Which is impossible, though, right?

774
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,080
Well, no, not if what you're saying is...

775
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,940
I mean, there was that...

776
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,260
There is an actual female and an actual male, even though one is a she and the other's a he.

777
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,080
Right.

778
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,340
A he and a she.

779
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,100
And now what kind of sex are you talking about?

780
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,040
Virtual sex?

781
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,440
Right.

782
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
Or actual real sex?

783
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,780
There we go.

784
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,500
Yeah, the real thing.

785
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,180
Psychic sex?

786
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,760
The only proper kind.

787
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,000
Space ranger sex?

788
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,140
The only righteous kind, which is the kind that results in a baby.

789
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,380
What kind of baby?

790
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,540
A virtual baby?

791
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,300
Five seconds.

792
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
A psychic baby?

793
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,900
A benighted baby.

794
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,000
A baby long of sideburns and short of saddles.

795
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,340
Turn her over, Daddy.

796
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,600
I'd rather have a puppy.

797
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,520
Woof, woof.

798
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,340
That's a punchline.

799
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,080
That's what Daddy said when he drank the whole fifth of...

800
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,060
Scotch in one gulp.

801
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,180
Crashed through the window.

802
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,880
This is it, Mother, he said.

803
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,840
I'm leaving.

804
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,500
And I'm taking that thing with me.

805
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,240
Speaking of things, the music in the background is once again the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

806
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,420
I bet the subgeniuses were wondering.

807
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,600
It's like, what subgenius does pretty music?

808
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,600
But this is the Flyin' Ryan Brothers Under the Influence is the name of the CD.

809
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,120
Which, if I know...

810
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,540
Those guys, they probably are under the influence of Bob,

811
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,400
because I don't think they are sinners of that kind.

812
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,720
God, their thank you list goes on forever, and I'm down near at the very bottom.

813
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,580
I know why that is.

814
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,100
We give them airplay.

815
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,720
Oh, they thank Jimi Hendrix.

816
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,520
Jimi Hendrix?

817
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,860
I'm in the same paragraph as Jimi Hendrix and Bernard Herrmann,

818
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,200
the Allman Brothers, and Jeff Beck.

819
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:14,740
All right.

820
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,320
On the same page as them?

821
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:16,720
Yeah.

822
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,440
How so?

823
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:18,840
Wow.

824
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, these guys are obviously a big...

825
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,120
They're a big guitar band, and they love these big guitarists,

826
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,580
Jeff Beck, Allman Brothers, Hendrix, and probably a bunch more.

827
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,600
Oh, Mountain.

828
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,500
But they're like playing...

829
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,180
Joe Satriani.

830
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,300
...the music from Cape Fear or something?

831
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,780
Wishbone Ash.

832
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,240
Sinbad?

833
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,060
I don't...

834
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,540
Well, actually, I've heard them open one of their albums with a Bernard Herrmann riff

835
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,080
from Mysterious Island.

836
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,620
Well, that's really exciting, because I thought if I ever did that,

837
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,840
like one day if I actually got up out of bed,

838
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000


839
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,400
and I'd have to play some of the songs and stuff...

840
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,100
Yeah.

841
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,340
...that I could perhaps include a lot of them,

842
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,180
Bernard Humidor...

843
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,580
Well, not Bernard Humidor, per se.

844
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,220
I'm sorry I said that.

845
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,640
It's all right, Dave.

846
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,200
I have a cassette somewhere that's nothing but Dave music

847
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,000
that I may even, you know, have to dig around.

848
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,660
Actually, I should...

849
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,640
We should play something.

850
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,820
We should stop talking for just a minute, because I do have a song here.

851
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,280
Uh...

852
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,980
For...

853
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,320
First...

854
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,520
Well, first Bob's going to come to the studio,

855
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,000
and then we're going to play a song by Little Jack Melody

856
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,840
called Lock Up Your Daughters.

857
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,000
It's about what happens when the subgeniuses are coming to occupy your town.

858
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,740
And they're gypsy trams and trucks and trailers.

859
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,560
So, um...

860
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,000
So, hold on, Dave.

861
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm going to go ahead and play these two cuts for about five minutes,

862
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,660
and then we'll come back on the air.

863
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,080
If there's an air to come back on.

864
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:47,900
And, uh...

865
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,480
Yeah.

866
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,820
Now getting back to the business at hand,

867
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,900
Bob is here.

868
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,320
And, uh...

869
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,420
And I...

870
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,080
And, you know, I don't know Bob that well,

871
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,200
but I do know him to be a guy that just never stops coming.

872
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,680
And that's certainly good, but...

873
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,860
And, uh...

874
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,620
Let's see if we can get somewhere else with Bob and see who he is.

875
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,680
I'm interested.

876
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,160
I know a lot of you people know him,

877
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,020
because he's been around a long time,

878
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,620
and some of you may have grown up with him somehow.

879
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,060
I've always respected Bob.

880
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,500
He's a difficult man to talk to.

881
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,840
And, uh...

882
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,100
And, uh...

883
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,480
So let's take a listen to Bob.

884
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,640
Basically.

885
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,120
Bob.

886
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:26,940
Bob.

887
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:27,900
Watch.

888
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,840
In front of...

889
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,140
It was a diplomat, so the whole audience was blue-haired.

890
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,600
Bob being you.

891
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,020
Bob being third person.

892
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:33,520
I'm kind of...

893
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,100
I'm like...

894
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,760
Bob wouldn't do that.

895
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,500
That's not right for Bob.

896
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,220
I'd like to talk to Bob about that.

897
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,580
Yeah, Bob's not comfortable talking about this,

898
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,460
because when Bob leaves here, he puts his...

899
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,740
What do you call it?

900
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,940
A Glock in the car.

901
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:50,680
Yeah, the Glock.

902
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,220
Yeah.

903
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,040
Or a nine.

904
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,100
Do they still use nines?

905
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Bob's people do.

906
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:54,860
They do.

907
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,020
They use nines?

908
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,700
And Glocks.

909
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,100
Nines and Glocks and a blunt.

910
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,700
And a blunt.

911
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,100
For the other thing.

912
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:00,680
Yeah, this.

913
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,180
Bob.

914
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,560
Bob.

915
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,440
That other thing.

916
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,360
All right, so you're down.

917
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,880
You're doing...

918
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,400
You're opening Bob.

919
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,180
Bobbing, bobbing, bobbing, bobbing, bobbing, bobbing, bobbing.

920
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,220
Consistently inconsistent.

921
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,420
That if they don't come around, Bob, we're going to be in trouble.

922
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,600
Bob the laughing skull.

923
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,180
Bob the funny...

924
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,240
Farm.

925
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,380
Farm.

926
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:20,820
Bob.

927
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,600
Strange days with Bob.

928
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,740
All right, Bob.

929
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,280
That was Bob.

930
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,880
I hope in some ways that Bob you have not known or didn't expect to know.

931
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,100
Lock up your daughters

932
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,620
And hide the chickens

933
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,820
Load up the 20 gauge

934
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,580
I hear the calliope

935
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,200
Tape up your windows

936
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,360
And put the lights out

937
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,100
They're coming back to town

938
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,820
I hear the calliope

939
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,280
I smell elephants

940
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,480
Can't mistake that infernal smell

941
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,260
I don't think I need to remind you

942
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,040
What elephants leave

943
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,360
I don't think I need to remind you

944
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:20,360


945
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:20,360


946
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,520
What elephants leave

947
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,860
Gypsy old foalmen

948
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:25,500


949
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,400
Will be riding them

950
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,720
Will be riding them

951
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,920
So you best not let

952
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,680
Any kids out after dark

953
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:47,100
I hate the lions

954
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,340
Can't stand the lions

955
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


956
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


957
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,340


958
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:50,680
Can't stand the tigers

959
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,760
Detest all 37 notes of calliope

960
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,000
I hate the horses

961
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,360
And painted wagons

962
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:13,120
And even water when it's deemed for calliopes

963
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,140
Stupid elephants

964
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,320
See them holding each other's hands

965
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


966
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


967
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


968
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


969
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


970
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


971
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,320


972
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,480
And the others tails

973
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:28,100
Everybody knows that there's nothing as sad as a clown

974
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:36,520
They can keep their pinheads and boa snakes

975
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:46,760
And the two head baby what's cooped up in a jar

976
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,300
I'm a little bit scared of the wild animals

977
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:50,300


978
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:02,600
But good punks don't look so good

979
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:02,880
Wanna keep the π

980
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,600
Nothing tries to broke the gallop

981
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,920
While it comes to sex

982
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,540
I don't really care

983
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,640
And I don't know why

984
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:12,640


985
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,000
I'll take the Primo

986
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,240
I bear the Engry

987
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,820
I just want to progressed

988
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,280
The cat helps through usually

989
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,620
And them alabaster

990
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,780
Would you turn them away from here?

991
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,380
Would you tell them gypsies

992
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,320
To ride them the hell out of town?

993
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,500
Cause we got no use

994
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,720
For such foolishness

995
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,180
And we thank you

996
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,020
For all your time

997
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,260
And help them end

998
00:46:55,260 --> 00:47:03,340
Lock up your daughters

999
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,480
And hide the chickens

1000
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,000
And that was little Jack Melody

1001
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,160
and his young turd

1002
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,520
And we thank Zaphod

1003
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,660
for turning us on

1004
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,720
to little Jack Melody

1005
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,620
And oh, there's Dave

1006
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,820
Oh, I'm sorry

1007
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,340
I was saying it sounds like Brecht

1008
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,400
and Cotville

1009
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,860
I was going to say

1010
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,000
that was Nino Rota

1011
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,580
an explanation too

1012
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,300
Yes

1013
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,220
But Nino Rota

1014
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,620
take off on such Bauhaus meanderings

1015
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,100
Not Bauhaus, but what would be the root?

1016
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,360
We kept saying Calliope

1017
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,680
I thought it was Calliope

1018
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:48,580
Calliope, yes

1019
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,680
That's why he went Calliope

1020
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,240
and then it went

1021
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,100
You know those musicians

1022
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,240
always doing things

1023
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,140
just to get attention

1024
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,000
He was probably mispronouncing it

1025
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,540
intentionally

1026
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:02,640
Mispronouncing what?

1027
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,980
Hiding the chickens?

1028
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,560
Calliope

1029
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Calliope

1030
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,220
No, he went Calliope

1031
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,620
You say Calliope

1032
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,560
and I say Calliope

1033
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,900
You say Yucatisma

1034
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,360
and I say Yucatisma

1035
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,260
Well, Calliope has two E's

1036
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:16,640
on the end

1037
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,000
and Calliope has one

1038
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,960
I say Subgenie

1039
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,680
and I say Subgeni

1040
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,460
Let's blow the

1041
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,980
whole pop stand

1042
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,260
Let's blow the microphone off

1043
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,060
Speaking of microphones, Dave

1044
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,900
it's funny when we

1045
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,260
when I put on music and pot you down

1046
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,140
we can hear your

1047
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,380
every snort

1048
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,080
and snuffle amplified

1049
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,300
really loud in the studio

1050
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,880
I don't think it goes

1051
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,580
Yeah, I don't think it goes out on the air

1052
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,860
but it's frightening

1053
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,840
to us here

1054
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,780
You're much louder

1055
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,540
when we turn you down

1056
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,240
off the studio speakers

1057
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,300
I think that's great

1058
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,260
I know it might be

1059
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,060
personally foul

1060
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,160
I mean, it might have

1061
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,040
an odor about it

1062
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:02,880
but to me

1063
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,000
in my mind

1064
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,640
that's art

1065
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,320
You're juxtaposing

1066
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,480
two unreal events

1067
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,280
to create one real event

1068
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,300
in the mind of the viewer

1069
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,740
of the listener, I mean

1070
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,900
And what is that?

1071
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,060
But if it makes him puke

1072
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:14,940
it's not very good

1073
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,540
He's waiting off

1074
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,440
you know, he's like

1075
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,500
off camera, off cue

1076
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:17,980
or whatever you want to call it

1077
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,480
and stuff

1078
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,600
but he's not

1079
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,240
and it's like the same thing

1080
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:21,660
when they heard

1081
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,020
Nixon or Jerry Lee Lewis

1082
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,100
talking in the background

1083
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,600
and he was talking about

1084
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,060
people from outer space

1085
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,400
and that's why he didn't become

1086
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,360
a Supreme Court judge

1087
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,560
just

1088
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,320
but that's art, man

1089
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,620
I mean

1090
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,080
I don't think that's the only reason

1091
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,420
Jerry Lewis

1092
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,300
Did you say Jerry Lee

1093
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,760
Lewis or Jerry Lewis?

1094
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,380
or the one

1095
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,520
you know

1096
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,980
either one of those cats

1097
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,560
would work

1098
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,540
in the situation

1099
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,980
it's just like a sample

1100
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,840
of a population

1101
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,620
of thousands of idiots

1102
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,000
and you just pick a few

1103
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,300
and have them write their names

1104
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,320
and give them instructions

1105
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,920
and record what you've heard

1106
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,820
and take the sample out

1107
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,740
and throw it out the window

1108
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,920
for all I care, you know

1109
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,660
You're describing

1110
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,180
the puzzling evidence show

1111
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,700
I think

1112
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,320
Somewhat

1113
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,220
to a large degree

1114
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,460
Because they allow call-ins

1115
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,920
It's sad

1116
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,800
this whole

1117
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,000
about the whole

1118
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,380
first half of the show

1119
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,520
the little fight

1120
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,120
that the phone light was

1121
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,080
was lighting

1122
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,640
somebody wanted to call in

1123
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,640
and speak

1124
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,260
Well

1125
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,020
puzzling evidence also allows

1126
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,400
stalkers, you know

1127
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,680
so it's no surprise

1128
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,100
He wants stalkers

1129
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,420
I don't

1130
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,540
I know what it's like to have

1131
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,740
real serious stalkers

1132
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,840
and that's actually kind of creepy

1133
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,680
You've been raped and sodomized

1134
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,460
like one of those

1135
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,420
ten-year-old

1136
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,460
Only in their minds

1137
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,600
or whatever they are

1138
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,660
Only in their minds

1139
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,640
and that's all their minds were on

1140
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,020
last

1141
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,080
two days ago

1142
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,780
November 11th, 2011

1143
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,780
11-11-11

1144
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,560
at 11-11 o'clock

1145
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,320
I know one guy who was going

1146
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,240
I bet Stan is having a heart attack right now

1147
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,620
Do you mean that?

1148
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,360
And guess what?

1149
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
I wasn't

1150
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,440
And then it became 11-12

1151
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,480
I might have been having a heartburn attack

1152
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,300
And you didn't have a heart attack

1153
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:10,780
No

1154
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,640
Someone was giving you a heartburn

1155
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,060
No, in fact we were joking about that crazy guy

1156
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,760
because I noticed

1157
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,060
I happened to look up

1158
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,940
at the microwave clock

1159
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,740
and it was giving off radiation

1160
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,960
and said 11-11

1161
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:23,380
I went

1162
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,320
Princess Wee, it's 11-11 on 11-11-11

1163
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,660
The kooks are all going nuts right now

1164
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:30,620
and I can think of at least two of them

1165
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,120
who are certain that I'm dying

1166
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,920
right at this minute

1167
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,660
because I've called them that word

1168
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,220
kook

1169
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,360
Yes, we're all kooks, friends

1170
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,060
but some are

1171
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,100
some kooks are more equal than others

1172
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,780
you might say

1173
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,380
Yep

1174
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,400
And according to this particular kook

1175
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,620
111 equals 7

1176
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,460
and 22 equals 1

1177
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,720
29

1178
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,200
Yeah, 29 and

1179
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,000
uh

1180
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,620
We're all kooks on this Space Ranger bus

1181
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:00,980
Well, what I felt was most inspiring about what you said

1182
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,440
is the same thing happened to me

1183
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,940
and I looked at the viewer

1184
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,140
I mean, I looked at the clock on my microwave

1185
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,840
and it was exactly 11-11

1186
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,880
and to show some authentic respect

1187
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,600
for that microwave

1188
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,160
I fell down on my knees

1189
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,600
not on purpose

1190
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,160
at first

1191
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,180
but I fell down

1192
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,360
and I began to pray to the microwave

1193
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,540
and this

1194
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,720
they talk about the Church of the Subgenius

1195
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,440
being a cult

1196
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,040
being a cargo cult

1197
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,320
I don't know what you're packing, man

1198
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,600
but to me

1199
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,860
a microwave

1200
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:31,880
and this

1201
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,380
maybe, you know, one of those weird bushes

1202
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:34,800
that

1203
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,720
like a bonsai bush

1204
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,940
A burning bush

1205
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,620
That would be even better

1206
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,300
but something, you know

1207
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,460
just something for the front yard

1208
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,360
so it doesn't look so stark out there

1209
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,480
A George Bush?

1210
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,080
A bush?

1211
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,860
And, yeah

1212
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,080
A George Bush

1213
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,120
Princess, one thing I didn't tell you earlier

1214
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,360
was that Rick Perry's wife said

1215
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,320
he needed a burning bush

1216
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,620
and then somebody else said

1217
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:01,100
no, Herman Cain's the one who's guilty of grabbing bushes all the time

1218
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:07,040
I stole all those gags from Yahoo comments

1219
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,860
Well, each one of those guys

1220
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,960
They did gag

1221
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:11,600
Yeah

1222
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,620
They're disgusting, most of them

1223
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,420
They all think they're the great

1224
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,980
the next Henny Youngman or something

1225
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,560
or the next

1226
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,300
you know, the next one-line guy

1227
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,940
that's gonna capture the imagination

1228
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,000
of all these dead people living out here

1229
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,840
That's all they are

1230
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,420
They're zombies

1231
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,300
They're not real

1232
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,500
living, breathing people anymore

1233
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,360
Oh, you wish

1234
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,960
Of course I wish

1235
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,500
With all my heart and soul

1236
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,440
I wish I could crawl in a sack with any zombie I want

1237
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,600
especially a blonde zombie

1238
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,180
since this isn't in the news anymore

1239
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,560
Isn't that a banned blonde zombie?

1240
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,040
Yeah

1241
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,980
Back in 1942 they were way ahead of their time

1242
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,840
Yeah, that's what I thought

1243
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:53,160
And they, you know, they had the kind of Nazi regalia thing going on

1244
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:53,420
Mm-hmm

1245
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,600
Got in trouble

1246
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,640
It's just like a joke, you know

1247
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,880
It's like Rammstein or something

1248
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,580
You know, it's just kidding around

1249
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:01,300
That's when

1250
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,900
things started getting real bad

1251
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,020
Rammstein isn't kidding around

1252
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:05,360
from Maunton to Dust Bowl

1253
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,360
Well, Dave, we're coming close up on the end of the hour

1254
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,140
The hour of slack, by the way

1255
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,000
is what you're listening to

1256
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,400
In fact, this is the 1,334th hour of slack

1257
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:20,700
Whoa!

1258
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,140
Although there have been a few reruns in there

1259
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,760
and sometimes we use Suzy's show

1260
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,120
And next week will be our last live show for a while

1261
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,980
because Princess Wee and I have to go into out of space

1262
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,740
And it'll be reruns and reports

1263
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,500
Oh, actually it will be new shows

1264
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,120
But there'll be new shows of old movies

1265
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,200
and rants that haven't been heard yet

1266
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,980
And do we all know that everything old is new again?

1267
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,560
No, we've still got more of 14X Day

1268
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,880
We've got a Ministry of Slack special coming up

1269
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,580
We've got the Starwood rant

1270
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,800
We've got the Witch's Ball rant

1271
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,500
Are they making fun of me?

1272
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,180
Anyway, I'm gonna cut away now

1273
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,520
Cut away, cut away, cut away all

1274
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,780
The house is on fire

1275
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:11,460
Your children will get burned by

1276
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,820
And I'll just be sitting there feeling guilty

1277
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:14,600
I'm gonna take a break

1278
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,200
Oh, we've got one last sermon

1279
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,260
Sermons with Suds

1280
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,840
Reverend Frodo Suds Shaw

1281
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,640
And then followed by a song called

1282
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,140
I Wanna Die for Bob

1283
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:29,800
Which was one of the first Bob hymns ever recorded

1284
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,720
And we're not even sure who recorded it

1285
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,340
He disappeared after he sent us the hissy tape

1286
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,200
That's Suds Pasha

1287
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,360
Yeah, Suds Pasha

1288
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,660
And so with that, Dave, good night

1289
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,700
Good night

1290
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,160
Friends, have you been singled out due to your mutation?

1291
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,380
The conspiracy plunging its filthy claws deep into your soul

1292
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,280
Ripping from it any vestige of individuality

1293
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,760
Any potential spark of abnormality?

1294
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,940
Have you sold your soul to the 9 to 5 demon money handlers?

1295
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,960
Suffering at the whims of sadistic jackholes

1296
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,500
Given undeserved authority over your mind and pocketbook

1297
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,300
Taking all the credit for your hard work

1298
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:14,120
Do you feel yourself being drugged down into the deep end?

1299
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,600
The depths of the conspiracy machine?

1300
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,360
Feeling yourself being pulverized into a quivering pile of pink shit?

1301
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,060
Friends, I have suffered this torment

1302
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,600
Yes, friends, I too was slowly being lulled into the glazed-eyed flock of sheeple

1303
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,220
Blissfully bleeding away while being led to the slaughterhouse

1304
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,740
If not for Bob

1305
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,100
Praise Bob!

1306
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,100
Friends, do you have what it takes to follow the path of least resistance?

1307
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,540
To bring the Sultan of Sales into your mind, body, and wallet?

1308
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,880
Do you have the perfect hate coursing through your veins?

1309
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:56,800
That pure hatred that knows no color, creed, ideology, sex, or sexual orientation?

1310
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,260
That burning contempt for the plague of pink-eyed fist-lovers

1311
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,280
Dragging you down into the bowels of their self-made perdition?

1312
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,600
There is only one way to cleanse the palate of the wretched taste

1313
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,000
From dealing with the legions of slack-jawed dopey dipshits

1314
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,020
There is only one path to divine slack

1315
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,160
And the incalculable death of species waste and the destruction of this planet

1316
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,160
And that's J.R. Bob Dobbs

1317
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,380
For it was Bob who sold a dollar in to God and convinced him it was heaven

1318
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,480
For it was Bob who fucked Mother Teresa because she answered the door

1319
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,420
For it was Bob who told Sarah Palin to get that first abortion

1320
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,200
Embrace the teachings of Bob!

1321
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,340
Embrace your abnormality!

1322
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,180
And never again sell out for a piece of that pink pie!

1323
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,140
And I'm not talking about the yummy, meaty, squishy kind either!

1324
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,720
How's that drink of song, you know?

1325
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,800
Please, Bob, you fuck, kill me, Bob

1326
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,600
I wanna die for God

1327
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:13,080
I wanna die in a hole

1328
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,240
And drown the pink boys and the normals

1329
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:25,420
If we have to, if we have to Bob can make them die

1330
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,100
And we'll all come back older men

1331
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,640
We'll all come back older men

1332
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,540
We'll all come back older men

1333
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,600
Or no, the reeds will fly

1334
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,780
We'll all come back old men

1335
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:43,780


1336
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:43,780


1337
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:43,780


1338
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:43,780


1339
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,060
Sing us to another key

1340
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,580
Raise Bob

1341
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,900
Fill me Tyler

1342
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,480
I wanna die for Bob

1343
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:59,280
I wanna find us the Holy War fulfilled

1344
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,820
The big boys and the gommels, they went, they went.

1345
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:12,460
We can't make them buy, and we'll all come back home.

1346
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:16,620
And we'll all come out over men.

1347
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:22,540
If we don't come out over men, there ain't no reason why.

1348
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:29,760
All the rivals, gizms, they will fall beneath our laser blades.

1349
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,920
And we'll all come back over men.

1350
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,380
We'll all come back over men.

1351
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:43,860
We'll all come back over men in victory parades.

1352
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,400
Sire, there is no more money.

1353
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,880
We gotta get some money.

1354
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,440
That dirty pervert.

1355
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:57,500
Sharkaback, Flack, Morton, Phillip, Buck, Burton, Perkaluma, Burton, Burton, Buster, Matt.

1356
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,600
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1357
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:08,900
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1358
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,960
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1359
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:21,040
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1360
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,480
you should go to...

1361
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:28,560
Subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages.

1362
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,860
And help out financially as best you can.

1363
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,220
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty.

1364
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,840
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1365
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,800
But some of you still have jobs.

1366
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,140
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1367
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,720
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1368
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,120
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1369
01:00:53,580 --> 01:01:00,900
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1370
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:06,380
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1371
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:18,880
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1372
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Thanks for anything you can do to help Bob and Matt.

1373
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,100
Let there be slack.

1374
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,040
Subliminal Hypno Corporation.

1375
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:51,940
We need free contact.

1376
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,620
We're making money, Bob.

1377
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,640
Free pills.

1378
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,700
Sex, money, Bob.

1379
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,800
Free pills.

1380
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:59,600
Sex, money, Bob.

1381
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,660
Free pills.

1382
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,320
Sex, money, Bob.

1383
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,980
Kill me.

1384
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,100
Sex, money, Bob.
