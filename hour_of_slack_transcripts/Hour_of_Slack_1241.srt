1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
At the moment I'm thinking about my reputation.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,540
You're going to marry me, Bob.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,940
Listen, I've told you how it's going to be and you might as well get used to the idea.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,300
Because if I have to, I'll smear you, Bob.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,580
I'll ruin you for...

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,380
The Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,540
Bob?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,640
Bob?

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,220
My conscience has a thousand several tongues.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,920
And every tongue brings in a several tail.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,980
And every tail condemns me for a normal.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,440
I am normal, you know. I'm just as normal as anybody else.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,340
Bob, if you're restless, why don't you go bowling?

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,140
I don't know.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,360
Why don't you go to the men's gym tonight and play some badminton?

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,020
Bye.

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,860
Bye.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,480
Who's that?

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,220
This is absolutely insane.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,220
Bob?

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,720
Must have been out of my mind.

22
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,260
Didn't you hear me?

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,820
I never intended for it to go this far.

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,240
I don't know how I could have been so incredibly stupid.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,860
Bob?

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,340
That's ridiculous.

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,600
I don't know.

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,840
Have we really stopped it?

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,820
These days you'll be sprinkled all over yourmund.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,780
You'll be flourishing!

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,200
You've noises and your

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,420
stupid voice.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,320
Bob?

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,380


35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,380


36
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,060
I'm keeping an eye on you.

37
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,520

I miss you so. Where have you gone to? Ocadio, Ocadio.

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:57,060
Ocadio, Ocadio.

77
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:13,020
Wasn't it yesterday I held you tight? Why did you run away just before our wedding night?

78
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,880
Ocadio, Ocadio. I miss you so.

79
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Where have you gone to? Ocadio, Ocadio.

80
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:49,880
My darling, my darling, what changed your mind?

81
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,740
My heart is broken.

82
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,780
I heard you cry Ocadio.

83
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,460
Ocadio, Ocadio.

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,600
Ocadio, Ocadio.

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,720
Ocadio, Ocadio.

86
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,580
What a freak!

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,200
He wants to be smart, but that's lame!

88
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,100
I wanted to run away that day.

89
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,920
But you can't run away from your own feet.

90
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,980
You can't run away from your own feet, dear friends.

91
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,580
That was a tiny little clip there from that cartoon movie called

92
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,260
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,

93
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:13,140
which I was surprised to find was a really bull-dada surreal movie, visually,

94
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,420
since it's about junk food raining from the sky.

95
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,060
And...

96
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,520
There was a lot of subgenius influence in that movie.

97
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,100
The music was by Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh,

98
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,260
and Reverend Bruce Campbell did the villain's voice.

99
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,140
Did a great job of it.

100
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,320
Oh, she's villainous.

101
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,220
Before that, O'Connie, that ancient song, that was for real,

102
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,100
and I don't know who it's by, because it didn't end up on this sheet of paper.

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,020
But I know that we have it because of the great Fernanda Nande, Lee Murr.

104
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,500
And Lee Murr did almost everything else.

105
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,460
I heard from the beginning of the show,

106
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,300
the titles and most of the collages there.

107
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,060
He even produces PR news.

108
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,460
Except for a one-and-a-half-minute stretch by Local Color,

109
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,860
who has been sending us some great stuff lately.

110
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
Local Color.

111
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,660
And, uh...

112
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,620
And?

113
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,720
And, uh, yes, yes, yes, we're actually live in the station this time.

114
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,500
Yippee!

115
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,920
And expecting...

116
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,480
more guests to appear, some way or another.

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,060
Princess We is here.

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,580
By magic.

119
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,340
And, uh, actually, the great Halim El-Dawb and his wife Deborah are both here,

120
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,580
having just done a show with Kamir, so...

121
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,440
It's a slack-imbued room.

122
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,640
Actually, I'm lying.

123
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,340
Princess We and I have had a rough day.

124
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,360
Ha ha ha!

125
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,460
And as soon as this show is over, we are going to get smashed.

126
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,900
We're going to go find an atom smasher

127
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,860
and get our atoms collided somehow or another.

128
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,560
Even if we have to stay up all night, we're going to get some rest.

129
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,480
I swear it.

130
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,140
We shall rest.

131
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,100
And that'll be fun.

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,700
Ha ha ha!

133
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,120
Yee-haw, yee-haw, hi-haw!

134
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:16,460


135
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,720
Um...

136
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,840
Actually, it's been pretty slack.

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,260
It's been pretty slackful up till, till, uh, today.

138
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,640
It has been.

139
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,900
Well, Princess We retired.

140
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,760
I didn't.

141
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,640
But the fact that she was still in bed when I woke up every morning

142
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,900
meant that every day was Saturday.

143
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,520
And until today, it has been Saturday for two weeks, as far as I'm concerned.

144
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,780
It's not Saturday today because today is a show day.

145
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,500
And that's different.

146
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,480
I have to be on my best behavior.

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,800
It's a work day.

148
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,100
It's kind of work slack.

149
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,260
That's my favorite kind of slack, actually.

150
00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm looking at the, uh, computer screen in front of me that says that we have several people streaming the show.

151
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,360
There are more people streaming the high-res than the low-res version.

152
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,220
One of those people streaming is me.

153
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,460
If you're streaming Cleveland radio, you're a Cleveland streamer, man.

154
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,840
Ha ha ha!

155
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,080
I've been wanting to use that one for a while.

156
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,040
Yeah.

157
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
That was a bad one.

158
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,080
Apparently, the Cleveland...

159
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,980
Oh, so long, Halim, Deborah, everybody.

160
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,820
Princess We is showing them out.

161
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm watching for invaders through the video surveillance cameras.

162
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,060
This newly created station studio is great.

163
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,440
You can surveil everything around you through hidden cameras and so forth.

164
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,220
I can even watch myself if I wanted to.

165
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,540
Every now and then, people say,

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
Well, I'd really like to come in and watch you do your radio show.

167
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,560
Watch you while you edit your radio show.

168
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,140
It's like, you want to watch a guy sitting there in headphones for an hour?

169
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,680
For hours and hours and hours?

170
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,680
Listening to the same sounds over and over and over again.

171
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,400
Well, no, sometimes you hear it backwards and you...

172
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,980
Yeah.

173
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,600
So, that's...

174
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,000
Eh, eh-heh.

175
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,900
Eh-heh.

176
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,200
Princess We and I have been...

177
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,660
slacking off in that we've watched two movies a day lately.

178
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,320
Oh, by the way, this bizarre music in the background, I should mention, this is Rural War Room.

179
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

180
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,580
There's also some Thegmo tactic on this reel, so we may get some of that, too.

181
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,420
But, yeah, we watched...

182
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,220
Yesterday, we watched that new movie called The Road,

183
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,200
which is...

184
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,180
about a father and son at the end of the world.

185
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,340
Some terrible cataclysm.

186
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
My theory is a super volcano.

187
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,380
Has pretty much destroyed almost all life, except for humans,

188
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,060
and most of those are cannibals, what there are left.

189
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,260
And that was so realistically done.

190
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,280
It actually kind of bummed us out.

191
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,500
Normally, I mean, we're subgeniuses.

192
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,120
End-of-the-world movies are like porno for us.

193
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,780
Movies.

194
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,600
Not...

195
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,960
CNN reports on earthquakes in Haiti.

196
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,940
That's not the kind of disaster porn I like.

197
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
I like fake stuff.

198
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,060
You know, that's the subgenius porno.

199
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,440
The Road is a little bit too real.

200
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,020
I mean, it's...

201
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,520
If you want to have trouble going to sleep,

202
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
go see The Road.

203
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,600
The Road.

204
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,620
Yeah.

205
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,640
If you want to worry for the rest of the night about those people in that basement being kept there for food,

206
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,400
then go ahead.

207
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,260
Go see The Road.

208
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,740
Now, we...

209
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,040
We're so bummed that we...

210
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,720
We had to get it out of our heads, so we put on another movie,

211
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,540
Sherlock Holmes.

212
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,880
The new Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it,

213
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,800
which...

214
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
My one-sentence review would be,

215
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,440
Holmes.

216
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,220
Sherlock Holmes.

217
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,460
Because it's really a James Bond movie,

218
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,740
set in the olden days.

219
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,880
And subgeniuses might really enjoy it because...

220
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,700
And other weirdos might...

221
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,920
They might enjoy it because it's Sherlock Holmes versus Aleister Crowley,

222
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,680
and the O.T.O.,

223
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,080
and the Illuminati.

224
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,760
But not by those names.

225
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:36,640
They probably very wisely fictionalized Big Al and his cult pretty well.

226
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,480
And...

227
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,820
Oh, there's some...

228
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,860
It's fun, though.

229
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,760
It's lots of fun, and it's the kind of thing that'll take your mind off.

230
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,860
It's a standard Hollywood movie.

231
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,860
You can almost...

232
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,540
Guess what is gonna happen every second,

233
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,420
but not quite, because it's fairly well done.

234
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,740
And it's kind of an Indiana Jones meets...

235
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,380
Is Sherlock Holmes, is James Bond,

236
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,520
but with a sidekick.

237
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
And that was fun.

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,060
Yeah, kind of steampunk James Bond.

239
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,820
Yeah.

240
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,800
There you go.

241
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,680
That's a good description.

242
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,220
Now, I'm still...

243
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,380
I'm not seeing Dave showing up here.

244
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,640
There's no little flickering green.

245
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,020
There's no flickering green light.

246
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,440
Where's our Dave?

247
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:27,280
But we are, however, happy about some news.

248
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,520
I don't know if I mentioned this.

249
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,480
On the internet, you've heard of that.

250
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,080
There's a forum.

251
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,520
It's been there for a long time.

252
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,500
It's on Usenet, which existed before the World Wide Web.

253
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,520
Alt.slack.

254
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,880
It's been there forever.

255
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,660
Anyway, we just recently found out...

256
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,860
It is the 20th most popular news group on the internet

257
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,480
of Usenet news groups.

258
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,600
How about that?

259
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,840
Some fun, huh?

260
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,380
Very, very cool.

261
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:56,900
Okay.

262
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,160
Now, what happens if we do that?

263
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,460
Anything?

264
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:01,780
I...

265
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,760
What?

266
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,160
Got a buzz.

267
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,120
Got a buzz.

268
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,120
We got...

269
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,160
No, I got Dave for half a second.

270
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,540
How about that?

271
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
He's a slippery one, isn't he?

272
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,300
Okay.

273
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,740
Well, he knows what to do.

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,720
That doesn't...

275
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,780
Doesn't mean he'll do it.

276
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,160
Because he's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

277
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,840
A real-life subgenius.

278
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,200
Hello?

279
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,480
What?

280
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,860
He does know what to do.

281
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,060
Hello?

282
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,840
Oh, hello, hello?

283
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,720
Hello?

284
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,900
You sound so quiet and so distant.

285
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,500
You sound so hummy and buzzy.

286
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,600
It's so damned buzzy here.

287
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeah, it is.

288
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,240
It is buzzy.

289
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,300
How is old Buzz...

290
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,020
It's annoyingly buzzy.

291
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,680
How's Buzz and Bunny crumhunger while we're at it?

292
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,080
They're not doing badly for little aliens

293
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,380
that live in petri dishes and consume your neophyte...

294
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,120
No, no.

295
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,940
Buzz and Bunny crumhunger.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,860
They were on that voyage with us on the Golden Hind.

297
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,020
You remember.

298
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,280
Everything you know is wrong.

299
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,540
When we feasted upon the Golden Hind

300
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,920
and the Golden Front as well as the breast of the Golden Rooster...

301
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,880
You are buzzy as heck.

302
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,200
I feel like I should be, like, yanking and knocking things

303
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,100
and pushing things,

304
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,760
but this is all...

305
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,180
It's all digital.

306
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,080
He's got a Buzz phone.

307
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,520
So that doesn't really do any good.

308
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,380
Dave has a Buzz phone, man.

309
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,840
Use your elbow.

310
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,160
Should I call back again?

311
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,920
No, no.

312
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,080
It already was the same

313
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,560
when I mistakenly hung up on you before.

314
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,340
During that brief second, I heard the buzz,

315
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,900
and I thought, man, that's got a...

316
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,540
That's a great carrier signal

317
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,580
for mind-control secret Frankenstein computer god radio.

318
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,860
My favorite kind.

319
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,600
You can use those waves to our benefit somehow.

320
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Use the ripples in the waves.

321
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,840
You can measure from peak to peak.

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,700
Find the longitude and the latitude

323
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,060
and know the exact angle into the brains.

324
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,680
Into all their brains.

325
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,700
Well, or brain, as the case may be in some sad cases.

326
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,740
There may be only one...

327
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:02,760
Like me.

328
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,700
Yeah.

329
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,240
I only have the one...

330
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,400
I don't even have the full brain.

331
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,680
I've only got half a brain,

332
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,240
and Princess Wee's got the other half.

333
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,220
If we get separated, we're in bad shape.

334
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,820
Real bad shape, yep.

335
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,420
Oh, man.

336
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,200
That buzz, it's just awful.

337
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,560
That's not the same buzz that I hear all the time.

338
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,140
It's not the buzz that I hear when I call you from home.

339
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,400
You mean you can't just tune that buzz out

340
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,320
like all of our listeners have had to do?

341
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,000
When I first heard it,

342
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,660
it sounded like it was coming from your end.

343
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,080
Now it sounds like it's coming from my end.

344
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,000
Dave, maybe you shouldn't have eaten beans for lunch.

345
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,200
Maybe I shouldn't have been born.

346
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,740
Yeah, maybe you've been the wrong...

347
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,360
man this whole time.

348
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,360
Well, at least I'm not inimmigrating

349
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,320
and disarticulating on all.slack

350
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,800
or other sources of misinformation.

351
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,300
No, I was bragging about how it's the number 20

352
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,200
in popularity of Usenet newsgroups,

353
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,840
which is actually saying something.

354
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,640
It was way ahead of Alt-Fan Rush Limbaugh

355
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,380
and Alt.Scientology.

356
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,380
So there's something.

357
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
There's something to be said for that.

358
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,220
Not very much.

359
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
We still must reckon with the Guelf and Ghibelline factions

360
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,780
who are determined to chew each other's knees off and stuff

361
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,860
to a loud buzzing tone in the background.

362
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,260
Why do they do that to each other?

363
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,160
Especially since they're high in parts,

364
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,260
as we discussed earlier in the syllabus.

365
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,840
When they're always exposed like that,

366
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,980
showing bare bones and cartilage, sheesh.

367
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, that is just the way of their peoples.

368
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,940
Just a cultural thing, huh?

369
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,280
I need to kick something to get rid of the buzz.

370
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,660
How do you think I feel?

371
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,580
I mean, I don't know how I feel.

372
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,300
The beating of his hideous heart.

373
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,500
But my darling, don't you understand?

374
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,320
We can't get rid of it.

375
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,600
It's with us now.

376
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
We just have to...

377
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,100
Oh, I can get rid of it all right.

378
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,320
Oh, how did you do that?

379
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm flushing with my phone here

380
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,520
and it doesn't appear to be changing anything.

381
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,400
Hey, try yelling.

382
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,540
Yell louder, Dave.

383
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,520
All right.

384
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,860
All right then.

385
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,320
Now.

386
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,620
All right now then.

387
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
Well, that helps a little bit.

388
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,400
I'm putting it sort of in between.

389
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
That's kind of like a just hideous noise.

390
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,080
Yeah, it's pretty hideous all right.

391
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,920
It's hitting my brainius.

392
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,580
But hopefully it will be able...

393
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,680
We will be able to ignore.

394
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,080
Should I try one more time?

395
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,600
No.

396
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,800
Sure, sure, sure.

397
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,260
Go ahead.

398
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,300
Go ahead.

399
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,100
Try it one more time.

400
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,200
Hang up and call back again.

401
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,340
Goodbye.

402
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:45,780
Bye.

403
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,140
That was easy.

404
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,420
Oh, God, it feels so good.

405
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,920
Well, it did until you laughed.

406
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,220
Let's just bask in silence for a second.

407
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
Bergman knew how to use silence.

408
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,140
To quote Peter Bergman.

409
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,820
And, well, meanwhile,

410
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,580
Meanwhile, friends, Winterstar is coming up,

411
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,100
for those of you in the listening area.

412
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:28,780
February 11th through 14th, Winterstar at Atwood Lodge

413
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,040
in Delroy, Ohio, which isn't too far from Cleveland.

414
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,160
This particular Winterstar will be the last one

415
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,020
at the Atwood Lodge because they're closing the place down.

416
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,200
They're going out of business.

417
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,940
How about that?

418
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,040
All right.

419
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,220
All right.

420
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,800
All right.

421
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


422
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


423
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


424
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


425
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


426
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


427
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


428
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


429
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


430
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


431
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


432
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,800


433
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,840
So, this particular Winterstar will be a wonderful one

434
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,500
because it's still at Atwood.

435
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,220
And it happens in cabins.

436
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,000
It's not an outdoor campout.

437
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,360
It's not an indoor sci-fi convention.

438
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,520
It's kind of in between.

439
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,560
And the performers include yours truly, Reverend Evan Stang.

440
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,840
And I'm not getting paid, so that's why I can advertise it on this.

441
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,600
Which disco, which is the band that was kind of like

442
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,000
everybody from Einstein's Secret Orchestra who's left

443
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,360
and still has a car.

444
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,280
So, it's Bob Mosick and Ron Slabe and Michelle George

445
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,640
and I guess Steve English and those folks will be playing.

446
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,280
They're fantastic and they'll probably jam all night long.

447
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,700
I will be showing a brand new video, I hope,

448
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,100
because I'm still working on this.

449
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,920
A video starring my flea circus of little monsters.

450
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,760
The Flea Manginarium of Dr. Stang, you might call it.

451
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,240
I wonder what ever happened to Dave.

452
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,260
He seems to be struggling to remember the number.

453
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh, and Fat Mandy.

454
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,500
Fat Mandy will be at Winter Star.

455
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,880
So, it's like the three subgenius kind of different things.

456
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,260
And Fat Mandy is a singer and she's a great singer.

457
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,760
I mean a really, really good torch singer

458
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,980
who does original stuff and covers

459
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,740
and just generally puts on a great show.

460
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,500
She's fun. She's a real pro.

461
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
So, we have my flea circus.

462
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,120
Everybody will get to see my little tiny monster pets

463
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,620
that I've been studying under my microscoparium.

464
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,740
And I can mention this because I won't be there at all.

465
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,740
There is seriously a revival, a subgenius show

466
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,180
in Shanghai, China on March 23rd.

467
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,460
And I cannot tell you where it's going to be

468
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,000
because we don't want the Chinese authorities

469
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,620
to know where it's going to be yet.

470
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,540
But there really is one.

471
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,720
It will be a mini revival and a video show

472
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,060
in Shanghai, China.

473
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,820
So, for all our listeners in Shanghai.

474
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,500
The best way to find the information on that

475
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,520
would be to look at the subgenius website,

476
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,440
subgenius.com.

477
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,340
On the way over here, Princess Louie and I

478
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,960
were listening to African music

479
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,560
that was on the previous show.

480
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,900
And it sounded alien as heck.

481
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,340
If not as hell.

482
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Alien as hell.

483
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,900
And not bad or anything,

484
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,720
but it's remarkable how different

485
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,280
somebody else's culture might be.

486
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,080
Know what I'm saying?

487
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,580
Know what you're saying.

488
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,760
But, at the same time, I was remembering

489
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
to Princess Louie

490
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,080
that compared to Chinese classical music,

491
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,920
the weirdest African music I ever heard

492
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,580
sounded normal to my...

493
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,620
American Pobucker standard ears.

494
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,400
Listener there, have you ever heard

495
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,760
Chinese classical music?

496
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,480
And I don't mean Chinese pop music.

497
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,840
I mean Chinese opera.

498
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,760
You kind of go,

499
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,080
well, I hear the kitchen help banging around,

500
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,560
but when does the music start?

501
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm not putting it down.

502
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,300
I'm saying that that's how unfamiliar

503
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,020
it sounds to me.

504
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,060
From PR News in Washington,

505
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,280
I'm eating spiders.

506
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,340
Yummy spiders.

507
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,860
Afghan President Hamid Karzai

508
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,900
today acknowledged Afghanistan's presidential election,

509
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,400
but Bangkok...

510
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,560
But Bangkok...

511
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:18,860
But...

512
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,640
On Wall Street,

513
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,000
one nine nine six six,

514
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,520
a new report finds people in good health

515
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,580
are getting severely ill from PR News in Washington.

516
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,560
Now, wait a minute.

517
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,600
What's going on here?

518
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,460
The buzz went away for a short while when you did that.

519
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,500
When I did what?

520
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,460
When, uh, that wonderful sound came.

521
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,740
It was just there.

522
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,300
It was like...

523
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,040
It was...

524
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,320
It was...

525
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:41,480
It was...

526
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:41,600
It was...

527
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,920
It was...

528
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,160
It was...

529
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,400
It was...

530
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,600
It was...

531
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,320
Well, see, there's things happening here

532
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,880
that I don't understand, Mr. Jones.

533
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,380
Well, from what part of the table are you squatting?

534
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,380
If I must ask, in Urdu,

535
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,000
since you were trying to, uh, transliterate there.

536
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,780
Well, let's see.

537
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,800
If I turn everything off, that doesn't...

538
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,640
Well, here's what happens if I turn you off.

539
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,200
Ah, it sounds great.

540
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,940
But you couldn't hear that.

541
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,340
He's impassive.

542
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,140
It sounded great.

543
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,500
Impassive.

544
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,680
So...

545
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,340
Yeah, there's...

546
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:13,620
There's...

547
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,220
The only buttons on are my little button,

548
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,000
your tiny little button,

549
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,780
and Princess Wee's great, big, round, sexy button.

550
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,960
You're not allowed to talk about that on the air.

551
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
Yeah, I'd like to climb on that other button.

552
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,980
Because that's what you're referring to,

553
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,220
a part of a person's anatomy that could be used as a psychological weapon.

554
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,720
No, I'm referring to...

555
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:34,900
A conspiracy.

556
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,440
I'm referring to a plastic knob on the...

557
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,520
The dashboard in front of me.

558
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:40,780
What knob?

559
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:41,620
Bateman.

560
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,600
Why couldn't you have said perhaps a dial?

561
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,660
No, you had to use the secret word for onions.

562
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,040
And, uh, big, beefy flavors.

563
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
Ah, forget about it.

564
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,760
I just...

565
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,040
I just pushed your...

566
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,140
I just, uh, yanked your knob, but...

567
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,560
I shaved off the knees...

568
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,820
Pardon?

569
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,400
Okay.

570
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,180
I shaved your knees off a second ago.

571
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,320
I just pushed your button, like, three times,

572
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,500
and you didn't do anything.

573
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,660
So...

574
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,320
What is the point of these buttons, man?

575
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,340
I mean, why...

576
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,260
What is the man...

577
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,100
Why does the man, like, make us, like, adhere to these mechanical contrivances

578
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
and, like, these...

579
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,600
These rules, man.

580
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,800
It's just rules everywhere you turn.

581
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,420
Everywhere you sign.

582
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,680
It's like dogma.

583
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,300
Dogma.

584
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,260
Everywhere, dogma.

585
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Yeah, dogma.

586
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,580
Didn't you ever see Fritz Lang's Cats?

587
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,420
No, uh, Fritz, um, you know, the Metropolis guy.

588
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:32,980
Yeah.

589
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,760
Didn't you ever see Metropolis by...

590
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,860
Not Fritz the Cat,

591
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,700
because you said something about cats or something.

592
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,620
But, you know, haven't you ever seen that?

593
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,240
Fritz Lang.

594
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
Fritz Lang's Metropolis.

595
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,980
1924 German film.

596
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,600
You just threw it up on the computer.

597
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,780
No, actually, I, uh, I sat in the same room with Fritz Lang and watched it.

598
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,400
You looked up his dress.

599
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,120
Admit it.

600
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,440
No, I really did watch it in the same room with Fritz Lang.

601
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,800
He wasn't sitting next to me.

602
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,880
He was 95 years old,

603
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,740
and he was up on the stage at the USA Film Festival or something in 1970 or something like that.

604
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:11,980
Yep.

605
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,580
I got to see all kinds of movies.

606
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,360
I was in the same room with all kinds of movie stars.

607
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,040
You want to touch me?

608
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,720
Not fair!

609
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,680
I didn't like the way you put that.

610
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,440
That was disgusting, frankly.

611
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,500
Yep, I've been in the same room with all kinds of famous people that never noticed me.

612
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,200
Jimi Hendrix,

613
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,680
Frank Capra,

614
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,720
um, yeah, lots of...

615
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,600
I just...

616
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,540
He just said,

617
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,200
Smokey Pie?

618
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Yeah, it makes me want to masturbate.

619
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm just thinking about how many cool...

620
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,020
I've been in without anyone noticing.

621
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,900
I just remember like it was a little Super 8 cut of you at home.

622
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,200
I think it was in 1970, 60 something real early.

623
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,200
And you were...

624
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,840
There was a picture of Hitler on the wall and you were just masturbating furiously.

625
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,060
Yeah, I was kind of a weird little kid.

626
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,700
And I was like, oh, mom, leave me alone.

627
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,760
You know, everybody laughed about it and stuff.

628
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,580
But you can still quite clearly see that one Sturman-Drawn picture on the wall.

629
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,980
No, that was Stang and Drummond, not Sturman-Drawn.

630
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,560
Ah.

631
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,020
And not Stong-Turman either.

632
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:13,600
But it's very close.

633
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,600
Real, real...

634
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,580
They're very similar.

635
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,460
Yeah.

636
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,520
You know, no one would, would, uh, would argue with that.

637
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,440
Except for the facial structure.

638
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:27,440
The bone structure is different because somebody's, uh, Aryan and somebody's Barbarian or something.

639
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:27,800
I forget.

640
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,440
And then there's the Barvarians.

641
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,320
You know, that's a whole different breed from Barvaria.

642
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,600
Barbaria was such a nice place until the erudites reflipped the switches.

643
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,760
Now look that they've got to pay twice.

644
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
They take the bus.

645
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,960
Say, perhaps they enter a town or a village.

646
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,440
Uh-huh.

647
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,460
Some of their covert militants, their police force comes out and examines their underwear for explosives.

648
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,180
Mm-hmm.

649
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,240
And then, and then another group of people comes out and wants to see if they want to file an injury claim.

650
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,100
Yeah.

651
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,980
Now, who, who wants to live there besides you and me?

652
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,580
I don't know.

653
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,540
That's too tricky.

654
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,880
And if we could get people, if we could get them there, what kind of mode of transportation would we use anyway?

655
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,640
Like, we'd be like filling hats with rainwater.

656
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,700
Or farting in the wind or any of those other things that are supposed to be hard to do.

657
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,120
Right.

658
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,620
It would be.

659
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,080
Like trying to ride a hot air balloon there or something, huh?

660
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,020
Right.

661
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:29,680
We could get, we could get some child maybe from Langley Headquarters or something like that when they, you know, abduct, abduct Aborigines or something.

662
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,020
I forgot what they did, but we could get one of those guys.

663
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,760
They pick up pygmies.

664
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,220
They, they do.

665
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,020
That's where they drop Coke bottles out of and make movies out of them.

666
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,680
No, they pick the pygmies out.

667
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,600
They're not very heavy.

668
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:48,200
Though I lost my career and I cry in my beer, this show is my only reality.

669
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,720
That much?

670
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,400
Ye dance!

671
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,680
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah.

672
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,900
They would be a part of my, my life.

673
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:04,900


674
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:04,900


675
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:04,900


676
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:04,900


677
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,400
facing another z落o

678
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,980
How do we ever turn a profit?

679
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:10,540
I don't know.

680
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,900
Now we're going to put the heavyset man over here.

681
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,520
Hey, shy, Radisson.

682
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,720
Hey, shy.

683
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,980
Here, strap these glasses on.

684
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,260
Put the brown hat.

685
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,420
Little brown hat, how I love thee.

686
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,520
Is it made from jellyfish?

687
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,260
You know, you can't drink jellyfish.

688
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,580
He peed out of sailing solution.

689
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,480
Hello, this is me, Bernard.

690
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,800
This is Genius Foundation.

691
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,900
The sub-genius foundation.

692
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,260
You know, you're right.

693
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,900
You're right.

694
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,300
The UFOs.

695
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,460
The UFOs are appearing in the skies.

696
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,980
They keep, you know, returning.

697
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,800
They keep returning.

698
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,560
They know what's going on.

699
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,200
The beings, not from this world.

700
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,800
They know what America is.

701
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,380
They know what America is.

702
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,380
They know what's going on.

703
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,180
They know what's going on.

704
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,300
Since 2006.

705
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,380
The UFOs.

706
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
Appearing in the skies.

707
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,640
They are concerned what's going on.

708
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,140
They know what America is.

709
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,160
They know what America is.

710
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,140
Do you understand what I'm saying?

711
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,080
The UFOs are appearing in the sky.

712
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,440
Personally.

713
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,640
This is nuts.

714
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,120
This is Phil Proctor.

715
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,000
And David Osman.

716
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,960
Of the Firesign Theater.

717
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,980
And we're enjoying listening to the hour of slack.

718
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm slacking off myself.

719
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm slacking off myself.

720
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,480
It's a secret?

721
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


722
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


723
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,480


724
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:34,820
My вор спросソгни, вы верEverything в прекрасномANNAены!

725
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,340
What are you doing, Steven?

726
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,380


727
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm plotting to attack a newspaper in Mumbai, Denmark,

728
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,800
and I'm also approved by President Obama for the health and welfare of the American people.

729
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,360
The Environmental Protection Agency says the president should get part of the blame.

730
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,180
On Wall Street 1030-19, federal prosecutors say this is PR News from Washington.

731
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,900
Two giants are helping plan attacks on terrorists in Mumbai, North Carolina.

732
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:27,200
In a filing with the National Transportation Safety Board, 16,000 U.S. giants violated PR News in Washington.

733
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,420
And thanks to Lemur for that.

734
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:32,980
We...

735
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,780
Oh, there's...

736
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,940
There's a little piece of music there by The Large.

737
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,800
And a call from Bernard, our friend, who is...

738
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,360
Well, he took...

739
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:51,840
Last week, he took credit for the earthquakes in Haiti, which he said he caused to happen using the power of his mind.

740
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,120
And he said that the church should start doing the hour of slack again someday.

741
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,280
And he has said that we should leave Texas, because Texas is bad.

742
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,380
So maybe we should take all his advice, Jimmy.

743
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,320
I don't know.

744
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,020
Now you're as quiet as a mouse.

745
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,200
And you know what?

746
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,020
You are too.

747
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,140
That is very disruptive to the entire process.

748
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,740
Yeah, I haven't changed anything.

749
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,900
And you haven't changed anything.

750
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,680
I can tell from here you haven't changed your pants.

751
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,740
Well, that's your third nostril working for you.

752
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,200
Yeah.

753
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,060
You just hung up and called back in, right?

754
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,020
Yes.

755
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,100
And you see?

756
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,460
There's a...

757
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,920
You know what I think it is?

758
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,340
I think there's a dead cat on the line.

759
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,080
That'd be a curse.

760
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,280
There's a dead cat on the line.

761
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:58,960
If your wife has a child, and that child in no way resembles you, there's a dead cat on the line.

762
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,280
That's not your child.

763
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,260
Well, I still don't understand what the hell you mean by that.

764
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,540
You know, it sounds all folksy and everything, but what are you driving at?

765
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,620
That means that there's something where it shouldn't ought to be or shouldn't ought to have been.

766
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,820
That's like there's something fishy, but it's Texas style?

767
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,380
Yeah.

768
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,400
I see.

769
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,120
Yeah.

770
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,660
It was a rough, tough cream puff.

771
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,360
A dead cat on the line.

772
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,380
And I think that's what we had.

773
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,020
Now, the cat may...

774
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,100
Boy, obviously, that cat got blown off in the wind or you kicked it off or something,

775
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,960
but we never know when another cat might suddenly be crossing that line, step on that live wire, and fall down dead.

776
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,240
Well, what if it all crossed like two?

777
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,900
It's got like supernatural powers.

778
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,080
That'd be really, really bad.

779
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,480
What if that dead cat happened to be on the line just when the president was saying,

780
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,880
don't fire all the nuclear weapons?

781
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,360
After all, we changed our mind.

782
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,600
It was a false alarm.

783
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,680
What if that's when the dead cat is on the line?

784
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,400
Hmm.

785
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,420
I'm waiting, just sitting there like a Cheshire cat on the line with one eyeball pointing up and one eyeball pointing down.

786
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,560
Ah.

787
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,120
You've gone through the looking glass and now you're in the excretoria and you wonder how the hell to get out of there.

788
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,380
Well, we don't need to get out now.

789
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:18,960
It's okay.

790
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,380
We can stay in here because it sounds fine.

791
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,800
It smells like ranch and beef, though.

792
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,940
Well, you already mentioned that my pants haven't been changed in a while.

793
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,660
These pretty long-distance whispers.

794
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,120
Well, but most of our listeners...

795
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,400
Most of our listeners are listening with standard old-time radio.

796
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,380
They're not on this new satellite smell-o-vision radio.

797
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,500
Now, a few are.

798
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,020
In fact, I can see somebody just tuned in from Canadia.

799
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,680
And they're using the...

800
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:45,700
They've already got it there.

801
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,740
It's been mandated by the Inuits.

802
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,700
That's what...

803
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,080
I guess they've been...

804
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Their counsels have...

805
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,440
I'm sorry.

806
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,460
We have a new Cleveland streamer.

807
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:52,840
Uh-huh.

808
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,540
Uh-huh.

809
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,300
Uh-huh.

810
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,280
Well, what does that mean as far as me getting millions and thousands of dollars?

811
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,080
Nothing.

812
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,820
Nothing.

813
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,960
Not a damn thing.

814
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,480
Nope.

815
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,920
Not a damn thing.

816
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,760
You're riding the same boat as Princess Wee and I.

817
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,880
Twiddling our thumbs.

818
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:08,960
We're on a ship of snakes.

819
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,300
Waiting for our ship of snakes to come in.

820
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,980
We're kind of like Johnny Depp in Dead Man.

821
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,920
Just drifting out there like a waiting...

822
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,440
Jeez, man.

823
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,420
They put me in a death canoe and everything, and I'm still awake.

824
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,240
There's a great line at the end of that movie where the medicine man says...

825
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,620
Johnny Depp is dying.

826
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,980
And a medicine man says,

827
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,760
No.

828
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,200
You're going to go to the place...

829
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,640
Where you came from.

830
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,720
Where all the spirits came from and where they go back to.

831
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,220
And he goes,

832
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,840
You mean Cleveland?

833
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,860
He's from Cleveland at the beginning of the movie.

834
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,880
It's a Jim Jarmusch movie, and he was from Cleveland, right?

835
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,580
Yes.

836
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,360
Yeah, they worked it in there.

837
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,160
Johnny Depp is going to play me in the Subgenius movie, by the way.

838
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,600
Did we already discuss that?

839
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,320
And Mel Gibson is playing you.

840
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,260
He's reprising his role for the...

841
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,000
In that movie, Conspiracy Theory, where he played Lonesome Cowboy Day.

842
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,760
Does he argue with policemen and stuff and run around naked and stuff?

843
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,720
Yeah, yeah.

844
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,480
It's the younger Lonesome Cowboy Day.

845
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,360
Wow, man.

846
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,040
I can just see something like that.

847
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,820
I can just see the millions and billions and trillions of dollars I'm going to make off it, too.

848
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,760
Yeah, me too.

849
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,960
I'm already spending it.

850
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,380
I spent it last week on my car, in fact, getting new shock springs.

851
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,240
Princess We will be played by Scarlett Johansson.

852
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,600
Doc Frop will be played by Daniel Day-Lewis.

853
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,720
Pappy, my father, will be played by Jack Nicholson.

854
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,160
These are all signed.

855
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,480
These guys are ready to go.

856
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,260
Yep.

857
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,600
And Philo Drummond will be played by Jim Carrey.

858
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,180
I'm not a big Jim Carrey fan, but there's reasons...

859
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,940
But he could pull it off, you know?

860
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,500
Yeah.

861
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,120
Literally, he could reach...

862
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,160
He could reach down there, yank it right off.

863
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,460
And he'd do that for a laugh, and that's why we need him to play Philo.

864
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,920
Yeah, we need somebody with them big, broad strokes to move it along, you know, so to speak.

865
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:20,100
Yeah, the alternative was Robin Williams, and there's no way any of us would be in the same room with that guy at this point.

866
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,500
Does he still have Stephen Colbert on the line, or is he maybe...

867
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,080
Yeah, yeah, Stephen Colbert is doing a cameo in it.

868
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,840
And our real, real score was Tom Cruise.

869
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,720
As well.

870
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,240
Who will actually...

871
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,140
Who will actually do a...

872
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,100
No, not as Bob.

873
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,720
Of course not.

874
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,100
Andy Serkis is doing performance capture of Bob.

875
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:36,360


876
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,220
No, Tom Cruise does a commercial for the Church of the Sub-Junior Center.

877
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,300
So, and that cost, that was the one that really...

878
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,460
That's like everybody else.

879
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,960
Even Tommy Lee Jones, who plays my brother, doesn't get as much money as that guy.

880
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,220
And he's only on it for 30 seconds.

881
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,980
And not with anybody else.

882
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,360
In front of a green screen.

883
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,940
Yeah, he's doing a Super Bowl commercial.

884
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,040
I don't want to give it any people away, but...

885
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,220
Right, right.

886
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,540
Yeah, we can't tell too much.

887
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,000
But he said that...

888
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,180
Well, I don't know if he said this.

889
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,720
You know, this is just kind of rumors going around and stuff.

890
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,120
He said the first offer was just...

891
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,000
He laughed.

892
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,240
He laughed.

893
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,880
He said, who would want to do something like this?

894
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,760
Well, it's a funny script.

895
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,740
Huh?

896
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,040
It's a funny script.

897
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,760
I mean, it's...

898
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,280
Well, yeah, that's true, but...

899
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,200
It's written in five different...

900
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,000
It's printed in five different languages.

901
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,320
It's printed on so many different kinds of paper,

902
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,040
you don't even know which ones are the covers and what are the inner pages and...

903
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,680
The scene directions are all...

904
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,040
And sometimes they're in different languages, of course.

905
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,340
Right, nothing's numbered.

906
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,160
So sometimes the dialogue will be in English

907
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,280
and the scene directions will be in Spanish

908
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,100
or even some, you know, like Kazakhstan or something like that.

909
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,060
It's...

910
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:55,920
I don't know.

911
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,920
I thought it was pretty funny, too, that way.

912
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,200
Yeah, it's a funny script that way.

913
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,920
I like also the way, you know, like when you read a page,

914
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,900
if you don't read it quick enough, it deteriorates in your hands and disappears.

915
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,380
Well, they don't all do that, just the key pages.

916
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,920
Well, those were the old paper pages, right?

917
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Well, it's a new invention of stuff that falls apart instantly.

918
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,140
Well, I thought you were talking about...

919
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,020
It goes with that publish-on-demand thing.

920
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,120
You can only read the book once.

921
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,380
After your eyes have canned over each word, the ink fades.

922
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,280
Then you...

923
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,240
That triggers...

924
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,020
Once seeing the word triggers the ink to fade.

925
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,900
That way you have to buy another copy every time you want to read the book.

926
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,900
And now...

927
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,360
That's the way publishing is going now, man.

928
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,020
Yeah.

929
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,400
You know, it's copy-protected.

930
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,220
It's sad, but it's true.

931
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,880
When you think of it, once that letter disappears from a page,

932
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,140
then the whole page starts to flash, too,

933
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,660
because the chemical's there and everything.

934
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,660
And it's pretty much echo-safe, but think of all the money they're making.

935
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,560
Right.

936
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,620
Well, that's the whole thing.

937
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,560
Millions of bucks.

938
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,320
Yeah, well, it's supposed to...

939
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,900
It'll save paper, see, because the paper just crumbles to dust

940
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,620
as soon as you finish reading that page.

941
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,540
Each word disappears after you read it.

942
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
Then when you turn the page, the page crumbles to dust.

943
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,840
It's beautiful.

944
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,000
From a technological standpoint, if you're a publisher, it's a great deal.

945
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,680
But for us readers, and even for the authors, it's not really that great

946
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,000
because the author only gets paid once.

947
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,960
The publisher gets paid every time you...

948
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,400
Destroy the book and have to get a new one.

949
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:34,980
Which is frequently.

950
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,160
Every time you want to reread it, you have to get a new one

951
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,760
because it's, you know, what's published on demand, read on demand,

952
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,600
but you have to pay for it every single time.

953
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,220
Retain information upon demand, too.

954
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,420
That's why there aren't any more penguins left.

955
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,540
Just think of what they've done to the wonderful Antarctic wilderness.

956
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,820
All the many motels and hotels we could have had or could have been.

957
00:42:59,820 --> 00:42:59,900
They did.

958
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,960
Given the correct circumstances.

959
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,680
But instead, they had to print copies of Book of the Subgenius.

960
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,380
That dissolve in your hands.

961
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,780
Right.

962
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,080
Yeah.

963
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,440
Right.

964
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,320
You know, there was a...

965
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,020
I found a copy of the entire book on the internet last week.

966
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,060
Well, somebody else found it and tattled to me.

967
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,220
And I realized, yeah, I knew that was on there.

968
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,520
And I didn't care because it was a really bad copy.

969
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,280
I thought all it's going to do is make you want to buy the book

970
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,920
because you'd be kind of frustrated.

971
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,100
Right.

972
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,200
Right.

973
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,700
Right.

974
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:29,800
Right.

975
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


976
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


977
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


978
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


979
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


980
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


981
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,800


982
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,020
It's bad PDF.

983
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,460
But somebody pointed out, well, now there's these Kindle machines

984
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,440
where you read your book on a machine because, you know, paper is too cheap.

985
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,660
So you buy this machine and then you load your book into it for a fee.

986
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,220
And this was not...

987
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,340
I wasn't getting the fee.

988
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:59,400
And plus, the person who put it on the intranet claimed that it was a public free copyright thing,

989
00:43:59,460 --> 00:43:59,800
which...

990
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:05,480
And he had put up a bunch of other things like the anarchist cookbook that are copyright free

991
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,780
or steal this book kind of things.

992
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,240
Well, Book of the Subgenius isn't like that.

993
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,240
We may make fun of capitalism and the conspiracy, but we do it for capitalistic reasons.

994
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,520
We want to become so rich that we can buy the conspiracy

995
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,280
because that is frankly the only way to fight the conspiracy.

996
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,880
With its own weapon.

997
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,560
Money.

998
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,160
Green.

999
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,340
Green.

1000
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,500
Cabbage and green, baby.

1001
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,220
Money walks.

1002
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,680
It walks for you.

1003
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,480
And BS talks.

1004
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,600
Now, if you have it backwards, but it still makes you...

1005
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,900
I agree completely with you.

1006
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,320
No, but talking is easy.

1007
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,660
Walking gets you somewhere.

1008
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,200
Well, if your fingers are all tied up in convoluted thoughts like so many subgeniuses are...

1009
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,040
subgenie...

1010
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,040
genie are nowadays,

1011
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,640
confused about the outcome of previous events and the up-cumbering events,

1012
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,160
which may be up-cumbering and so forth, stuff like that.

1013
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,360
And things that are, you know, just in their own heads.

1014
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,560
Things that they've drilled around in their minds for thousands and thousands of minutes now.

1015
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,020
And they're just waiting for their brains to explode

1016
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,640
and then for them to blissfully leave this benighted planet.

1017
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,120
Just think all them poor fools.

1018
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,400
Or don't.

1019
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,460
Well, I do.

1020
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,840
I think of them all the time.

1021
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,620
And I think of hitting them up for a new membership renewal.

1022
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:27,840
Well...

1023
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,580
Or something.

1024
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,340
Why did Bob get this dumb idea of a lifetime subgenius membership?

1025
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,900
Why didn't he?

1026
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:37,340
Yeah.

1027
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,880
I mean, no, why...

1028
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,600
Why did he?

1029
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,200
Yeah.

1030
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,420
What happened to the endless pyramid scheme that's constantly soaking you for more, you know,

1031
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,620
tithing a certain percentage every month?

1032
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,700
Or else you can't...

1033
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,660
Or you have to re-up every year.

1034
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:54,240
You can't...

1035
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,080
It doesn't carry over.

1036
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,560
You know, we actually did that.

1037
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,460
You're charged for charging.

1038
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,760
You're used for usage.

1039
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,280
Yeah.

1040
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,120
And in fact, you're stepped over a tiny little stool

1041
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,600
and whooped into a sundrance by a very large dominatrix.

1042
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,700
Woman or man, you can't make it out, but you're very scared and it hurts.

1043
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,320
We must be crazy to be giving things away at these free prices.

1044
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,860
Yeah.

1045
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,380
That's going around now, too, like a bad disease.

1046
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,160
The idea that giving somebody a good deal is a form of insanity.

1047
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,900
You hear it everywhere.

1048
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:26,660
Yeah.

1049
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,640
You hear it when you're sleeping.

1050
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,220
Sometimes the voices in your head tell you which way to look at in the middle of the night.

1051
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,720
And then you can see the shapes.

1052
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,560
And once you see the shapes and you can make them out clearly, then...

1053
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,420
Oh, the voices are always trying to make me feel bad.

1054
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,800
Stang, you screwed up.

1055
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,300
You could have been rich.

1056
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,340
It would have been so easy, but you blew it.

1057
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,060
You blew it.

1058
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,020
You just gave it all away to a bunch of idiots.

1059
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,680
Why, you could have...

1060
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,940
This could have been like Scientology.

1061
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,060
Or the Moonies.

1062
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,840
Or even the aliens.

1063
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:01,940
Oh, yes.

1064
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,740
Ooh, ooh la la.

1065
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,160
But, friends, it is better than all of those.

1066
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,640
And here's why.

1067
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,840
It's not because it's more holy or clever.

1068
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,720
It's because we've got Bob and they don't.

1069
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,320
It's that simple.

1070
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,960
We got Bob, they don't.

1071
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,660
For that reason, we can hate them.

1072
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,900
Hate them, hate them, hate them.

1073
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,520
And know that we're better.

1074
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,160
Yes, simply better.

1075
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,820
Your little ecclesiastical adventure could involve all of us.

1076
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:27,820


1077
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:27,820


1078
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,240
We're all just the forms of bestiality and mid-neck crew cuts and pointing out the thyroid

1079
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:33,640
gland.

1080
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,100
Well, it does.

1081
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,080
It does.

1082
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:35,700
We just don't...

1083
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,060
Pointing out the pineal gland.

1084
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,740
We don't charge them for it, though.

1085
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,080
Yeah, yeah.

1086
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,260
That's what I was trying to say.

1087
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,200
That comes with the excuse.

1088
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,600
The all-purpose divine excuse that comes in your membership package.

1089
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,420
You even get a doctor's, spelled D-O-K-T-O-R-S...

1090
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,300
Right, Doctor X of the Forbidden Sciences.

1091
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,300
And you get a doctor's excuse when you don't want and you gotta slack off.

1092
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,000
Right.

1093
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,580
And we should be charging a lot more than we do.

1094
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,120
But instead, we're retreating back up the hill.

1095
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,040
So instead of twisting your arms, we're just gonna tweak your knobs a little bit and hope

1096
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,460
that that feeling of soft warmth, that bliss that comes from the third nostril...

1097
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,300


1098
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,140
Stop that tweaking!

1099
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,680
...is gonna open you up somehow, like a ripe clam.

1100
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,820
Well, but when you're a subgenius...

1101
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:27,820


1102
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:27,820


1103
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,700
When you're a subgenius, you look at what the smart and sensible thing would be to

1104
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,760
do, and you ponder it, you approach it from all angles, and then you do the opposite.

1105
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,400
Just like, why is my phone not buzzing anymore?

1106
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,920
It's just the buzzing in my head.

1107
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,840
Right, the buzz...

1108
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,320
Of course, I could be paranoid, couldn't I?

1109
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,680
And say, well, they were screwing with me.

1110
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,460
Whoever they is, they are, or it is.

1111
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,600
Instead, I, I, I, I, I, well, I, I...

1112
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,220
You internalized the buzz.

1113
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,420
Yeah, yeah, I, I, I...

1114
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,560
Hey, at least you got a buzz.

1115
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,220
Yeah.

1116
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,800
Yeah, I, I, I, I got a buzz out of it.

1117
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:06,600
Princess, we and I are going to stop at the buzz store on the way home, and when we,

1118
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,660
when this, we are gonna end this day somehow or another.

1119
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,160
We're gonna pick up 15,000 buzzes.

1120
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,780
Yeah, we are going, we are going to put, we are gonna put an end to this day one way

1121
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,480
or the other.

1122
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,800
It's been, it's been one of those days.

1123
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,980
Have you ever considered your Second Amendment right to bear a ceremonial

1124
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,820
nuclear weapons in public?

1125
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,620
The much, the way you bear one of your parts you like to fondle?

1126
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:38,840
Well, now, according to the new rulings, an individual can't bear thermonuclear weapons,

1127
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,180
but a corporation can.

1128
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,020
A corporation has, has the, because they live forever.

1129
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,000
I see, and that, I feel freer already.

1130
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:47,600
Yeah.

1131
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,560
I personally, I'm, I'm glad.

1132
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:56,900
I know that large corporations are somehow nicer than the average individual, even though they are individuals.

1133
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:56,960
Yeah.

1134
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,720
They're somehow nicer than us, and will not abuse their,

1135
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,160
Right, and they would never abuse any rights.

1136
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:03,420
No.

1137
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,820
So they have a lot more rights than any individual could ever hope to have, a corporate, a corporate entity.

1138
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:15,860
And they will, they will sacrilegiously guard ours until the last, whatever it is that we're supposed to defend of your right to say so.

1139
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,560
Well.

1140
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:19,920
Well.

1141
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:20,560
Yeah.

1142
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,500
So I guess the world,

1143
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,800
It, it caused me to shave my chest.

1144
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:36,360
I, I gotta admit, I, there was a couple of times when I was reading the paper last week, or the dissolving internet page or whatever, that I thought, I better get ready to leave America.

1145
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,720
But then I thought, wait a minute, where am I gonna go?

1146
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:40,780
England?

1147
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,400
They've got different problems that are just as bad.

1148
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,340
Holland?

1149
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,920
Yeah, man, you can smoke pot in Holland.

1150
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,080
After you've given all your money to the government.

1151
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,760
Don't see any other way.

1152
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,280
You don't have any left to buy the overpriced pot.

1153
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,040
My God, man, what has this world come to?

1154
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,980
It's a shame, I'll tell you.

1155
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:09,100
You just, you know, you, you get, you wanna, you wanna, uh, you wanna split, but there's no place to split to.

1156
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,520
It's like being an amoeba that can't have sex with itself.

1157
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:21,500
You feel like, what's his name in, in the old 1960s spy film, The Prisoner, uh, Anton Gaudi, or whatever his name was.

1158
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,600
Yeah, yeah.

1159
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,520
Patrick Gouin.

1160
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:22,920
Yeah.

1161
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,260
Tony O'Gouin.

1162
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,740
Yeah, Antonio Gaudis, the guy who invented the steamroller.

1163
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,300
I am not a number, I'm a free man.

1164
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,700
Viva Picasso.

1165
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,840
I, I remember when they stole the art from the indigenous.

1166
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,900
Oh, the, the times did grow thicker.

1167
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:38,200
Uh.

1168
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,360
Who is number one?

1169
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,580
I am not afraid.

1170
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,840
You are number six.

1171
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,220
I am not a number, I am.

1172
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,680
Okay, I'm a number.

1173
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:52,620
Yep.

1174
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,800
A big balloon would go off and he'd go in his pants and say I'm a number, okay.

1175
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,220
I'm number six eight point two two one point one one three point two five three.

1176
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,520
That actually is the number of one of our listeners.

1177
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,420
Let he who has wisdom know, it is the number of a listener.

1178
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,460
It is a purgative feeling to say your number out loud.

1179
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,100
I mean, is it a purging thing?

1180
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,360
Well, I just gave somebody's IP address is what I did.

1181
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,920
And they do, too.

1182
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,600
I don't.

1183
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:27,280
Have you noticed that people are referring to each other as Dvochkis and Millicents and

1184
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,440
Deezer and.

1185
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,240
What happened to Clockwork Orange show on cable or something?

1186
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,000
No, I.

1187
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,000
Everybody's talking, talking clockworky talk again.

1188
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:36,460
It must have been on cable.

1189
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,920
That's the only way for a conflux of informational devolvement.

1190
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:44,620
Well, they're sure not going to read the book by Anthony Burgess that I've read seven times.

1191
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,060
It's, it's too, uh, it's too intellectual, the book.

1192
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,580
Actually, it's not all that intellectual.

1193
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,380
It's full of the old in and out and lots of ultra violence and.

1194
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,460
Paul Chuck and old games.

1195
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,780
Yeah, it puts knives in your blood.

1196
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,240
The crack put pretty Pauline show forth.

1197
00:52:59,260 --> 00:52:59,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1198
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,360
Oh, yeah.

1199
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,020
Of course, you could end up in this stripey hole.

1200
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,360
I ended up about three weeks ago.

1201
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,440
I had the thieving magpie, that old classical tune.

1202
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:10,940
Yes.

1203
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,360
Stuck in my head.

1204
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:17,760
Now, in a Clockwork Orange, they play that music in the background whenever the boys are out raping.

1205
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,280
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1206
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1207
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,220
I did not.

1208
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:21,220


1209
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,260
I said, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1210
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:22,940
Come on.

1211
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1212
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,600
No, no, no, no, no.

1213
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:25,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1214
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1215
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,440
No.

1216
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,500
No.

1217
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:27,520
No.

1218
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,520


1219
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,420
That was pretty bad.

1220
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:30,620
I was doing it right.

1221
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,040
And it made me want to go out and kill and kill and rape and kill.

1222
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,540
You're listening to W.C.

1223
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:41,760
Pardon me.

1224
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,540
I have to do this.

1225
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,200
This is a VF years.

1226
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:44,860
No, no, no.

1227
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,260
Heaps I see, but.

1228
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,620
Okay.

1229
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:47,560
Okay, then.

1230
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,920
Pleasure and enjoyment.

1231
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,200
Okay.

1232
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:50,500
Yeah.

1233
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,200
Office better beware.

1234
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,040
Edit here.

1235
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,860
Especially if they've got no...

1236
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,560
Edit here.

1237
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,980
No, edit here.

1238
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:57,620
There.

1239
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,640
Okay, there was a cut.

1240
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,840
Now we can proceed.

1241
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,740
It's so hard to make scissors space on this show and remove things without anyone knowing,

1242
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,840
especially when I refer to having done that.

1243
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,340
Right afterwards.

1244
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,920
I remember right after time travel got real big,

1245
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:17,300
and we went back to the lands of the ancient geeks,

1246
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,120
and Cleveland was a city of great pleasure and amusement.

1247
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,900
And there was guys walking around in sandals and stuff like that.

1248
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,200
Yeah.

1249
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,320
In like, you know, these square areas.

1250
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,840
And they would say all kinds of cool stuff,

1251
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,320
and then people would applaud and then go off and stab each other with swords and stuff.

1252
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,900
It's weird.

1253
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,000
I mean, there was no Bob in those days.

1254
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,840
There's no reason we can't do that now.

1255
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,040
Except for one thing.

1256
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,600
The show is over.

1257
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,940
As a matter of fact, if you look at your time machine, Dave,

1258
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,540
you'll see that we've actually leaked over.

1259
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,560
Do you think that we...

1260
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,580
And I'm going now to go away.

1261
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,360
I'm going away, too.

1262
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,320
I wouldn't want to step on Rob's shoes,

1263
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,340
because they're where they've been.

1264
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:03,860
However, Dave, you have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

1265
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,460
episode number 1,141.

1266
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:12,320
And for more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1267
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,540

1268
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,620
you can find more than you'll ever be able to handle at subgenius.com.

1269
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,860
Thank you for calling, Dave.

1270
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,000
Thank you for the buzz.

1271
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,740
Thank you for the buzz, my dear.

1272
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,720
And we'll hear you later.

1273
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,900
And goodbye.

1274
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:30,880
And goodbye.

1275
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,140
Ahem.

1276
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,200
And, uh...

1277
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,600
Oh, Reverend Stank, do you think that we maybe possibly could have let our treasured listeners down tonight

1278
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,680
with this buzzy show?

1279
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,160
No.

1280
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,060
Oh, good.

1281
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,240
I'm glad.

1282
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,800
People listen to this station to get a buzz.

1283
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:47,440
Oh, good.

1284
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,100
Good, good.

1285
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,340
All right.

1286
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:54,220
Um, we'll end with some, uh, lemur and the large,

1287
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,660
and, uh, music by local color if we get that far.

1288
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:58,660
Listen.

1289
00:55:59,060 --> 00:55:59,740
Listen.

1290
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:02,980
Listen.

1291
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,460
Don't gobble.

1292
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,980
Darn.

1293
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,500
Ah!

1294
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,080
Ah!

1295
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:15,980
Oh!

1296
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,780
Ah!

1297
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:18,720
Ah!

1298
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,400
Hey, screaming woman!

1299
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:22,740

He's swell!

1301
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,620

1302
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,080

1303
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,160

00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,180
Hot dog!

Greetings Professor Falcon.

00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,520
Greetings Professor Falcon.

1309
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,780
Greetings Professor Falcon.

1310
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,620
How about a nice game of chess?

1311
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,000
Excellent.

Excellent.

1314
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,280
Which side do you want?

1315
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,940
Which side do you want?

1316
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,760
Which side do you want?

1317
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:49,800
Which side do you want?

1318
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,380
Shall we play a game?

1319
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,740
Let's run the targets.

1320
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,020
Let's run the targets.

1321
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,120
Let's run the targets.

1322
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,220
