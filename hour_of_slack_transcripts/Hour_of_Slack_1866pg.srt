1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,100
A subgenius

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,700
Hour hour and a slack

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,540
Hour a slack

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,000
Hour a slack

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,740
Hour of slack

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,080
Subgenius

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,120
The hour of slack

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,100
Bob

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,860
Oh yes, dear friends, and welcome to the first live hour of slack in about a hundred weeks

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,780
And this is, we had a good excuse for it

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,400
For one thing, I can walk and

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,280
Wear a shirt and no bandages

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,340
And all that

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,160
But the other thing is, we have a special guest here

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,980
At Stang Ranch

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,560
At Tarzan's radio station

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,060
And my friends, it's none other than

18
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,040
The overman himself, Dr.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Philo Drummond

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Well I'm glad to be here

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm awful glad you're here

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,040
When was the last time you were on the

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,100
Puzzling Evidence show?

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,620
It was like three or four years ago, right?

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,900
It was, let's see

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,380
The 19th of June

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,960
2017

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Yep

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,360
The 19th of June

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,080
2017

31
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,780
Goodness

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,280
My swan song

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,360
In public radio

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,600
This can be your

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,320
Your new pyroflatulation

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,760
My re-entry back into the mainstream

37
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,440
Yeah

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,380
Of the non-mainstream

39
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,280
The mainstream of the backside of reality

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,800
Yeah

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,780
Now you guys remember to

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,920
Talk sort of close to the microphones

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,180
Don't do a Susie on me, okay?

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,720
Alright

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,040
Or a Hal

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,840
Actually, doing a Hal is when you fall asleep

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,880
With your head forehead

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,080
Leaning against the windscreen

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,680
You know, Hal would

50
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,420
He was like, at one point

51
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,980
He would like anchor himself

52
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,340
With his nose touching the windscreen

53
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,780
Right

54
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,300
And then he could kind of doze off a bit

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,320
He'd sort of meditate for a little while

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
It's really easy

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,480
Nobody would realize that

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,560
Until they try to be on a radio show

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,620
That simply touching your nose

60
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,400
To the windscreen on a microphone

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,060
Has a

62
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,260
I'm going to try that

63
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,920
It has a hypnotic effect

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,740
See what I mean?

65
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,720
Hal was on to something

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,240
Beep, beep, beep, beep

67
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,960
Beep, beep, beep, beep

68
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,000
Beep, beep, beep, beep

69
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:57,740
Beep, beep, beep, beep

70
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,420
Beep, beep, beep, beep

71
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,920
Beep, beep, beep, beep

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,260
Beep, beep, beep, beep

73
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,260


74
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,440
It turns you into shimp

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,220
Right

76
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
It's a shimp

77
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,460
Yes, friends

78
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,980
It's the first new hour of Slack

79
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,240
In months and months

80
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,260
And it's a new year

81
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,360
The conspiracy says it's 2022

82
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,000
You know, I mean

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,980
Obviously, that's silly

84
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,960
Because the X's haven't arrived

85
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,320
It's 1997 all over again

86
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,740
Right, yeah

87
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,020
Might as well be

88
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,160
I mean, we don't know

89
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,620
Who cares?

90
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,380
We don't even know

91
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,220
What planet it's on

92
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,900
Yeah

93
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,760
All that old stuff

94
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,300
I really

95
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm kind of going for the

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,620
That one theory of

97
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,700
It's 1998 was upside down all the time

98
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
86, 61

99
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,160
Yeah

100
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,940
So we've got a lot

101
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,900
We've got a lot of time

102
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,780
A lot of time

103
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,940
And that's proof that the world

104
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,560
Isn't really going to end anytime soon

105
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,620
Well

106
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,500
Because we know

107
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,980
X day is going to happen

108
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,220
And so how could the world end

109
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,980
Before X day?

110
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,340
We need X day to bring about

111
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:56,940
The end of the world

112
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,800
Right, right

113
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,200
So

114
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,620
Well, you know, the other

115
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,000
Some of the rival cults

116
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,040
Feel like they have to

117
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Have war in the Middle East

118
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
In order to bring about

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,440
The proper end of the world

120
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,360
With Jesus in charge

121
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,260
That won't be the proper

122
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,980
End of the world

123
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,240
That won't be like a sub

124
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,060
Sub

125
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
That's just some

126
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,940
One of the precursors

127
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,120
Of an end of the world

128
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,240
That's a precursor

129
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,300
To the true X day

130
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,800
Yeah

131
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,580
We've got to wait

132
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,700
Until 86, 61

133
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,580
And some of us

134
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,720
Probably won't make it

135
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Right

136
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,020
That red

137
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,180
That red calf

138
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,220
And the

139
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,660
And the white buffalo

140
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,260
Uh-huh

141
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:27,780
And all those things

142
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Different special creatures

143
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,180
Have to come

144
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,540
Yeah

145
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,560
And be born

146
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,460
The red heifer

147
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,420
The red heifer

148
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,920
That's right

149
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,200
Yeah, the red heifer

150
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,160
And the black

151
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,420
The black

152
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,240
The black yeti

153
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Yeah

154
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,000
The black yeti

155
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,720
Has to be born

156
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,580
And the blue

157
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,280
I was thinking about

158
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,940
The black yeti

159
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,960
We cut that from

160
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,100
Revelation X

161
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,620
The blue bull

162
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,960
Because the black yeti

163
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,900
Had the biggest

164
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,860
No, the blue

165
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,880
Of all the yetis

166
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,860
The black yeti

167
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,480
Of course

168
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
Had the biggest

169
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,180
Feet

170
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,040
Yeah

171
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,420
Feet

172
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:56,880
Yeah

173
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,780
And you know

174
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,660
You know what big feet mean

175
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,660
Big shoes

176
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,580
Big shoes

177
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,320
And big nose

178
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,400
Big shoes

179
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,300
Yeah

180
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,980
That's P-O-P-Y

181
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,420
But we do

182
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,760
Had

183
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
We did have

184
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,940
A peewee in Lawrence Fishburne

185
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,320
In fact

186
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
We had a blue ox

187
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,620
It was peewee

188
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,720
In Lawrence Fishburne

189
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,760
Lawrence Fishburne

190
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,620
Had the line I think

191
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,280
You know what

192
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,940
What big feet means

193
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,720
Big shoes

194
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,660
Big boots

195
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
He was cowboy Bob

196
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,460
Yeah

197
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,400
That was Morpheus

198
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,120
Yep

199
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,440
God

200
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,980
Morpheus

201
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,740
I guess acting

202
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,480
Is a thing

203
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
But you remember

204
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,100
I remember Lawrence Fishburne

205
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,660
Was in Apocalypse Now

206
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,440
He was

207
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,020
Oh that's right

208
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,680
He was a skinny kid

209
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,380
One of the guys on the boat

210
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,780
He was a real skinny kid

211
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,540
That went surfing

212
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,960
To Rolling Stones

213
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
He got all shot up

214
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,500
Yeah

215
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,720
That's right

216
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,220
That baby Lawrence Fishburne

217
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,540
Wow

218
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,320
Just never

219
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
He was 17 or 18

220
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,060
Or something in that movie

221
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,760
Man

222
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,540
Man

223
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,640
Actors can play

224
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,940
Somebody of any age

225
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,100
How could the

226
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,920
Pock faced

227
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,260
Giant fat guy

228
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,420
Lawrence Fishburne

229
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,060
Play that skinny

230
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,020
18 year old

231
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,100
Yeah

232
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,400
Yeah

233
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,460
Yeah

234
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


235
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


236
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


237
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


238
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


239
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


240
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


241
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


242
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


243
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,460


244
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:27,480


245
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:57,480


246
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:57,560
I remember

247
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,100
There was music in the background

248
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,680
It's really soft

249
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,940
French swing

250
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,560
French swing

251
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,740
By different bands

252
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,520
That St. Byron Warner

253
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,640
Sent to Princess Wade

254
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,200
Not me

255
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,960
He sent it to her

256
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
Well he knows that

257
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,780
She still has her hearing

258
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,040
Well we had a conversation

259
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
About music

260
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,920
That he'd been seeking out

261
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,260
And she can actually hear

262
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,340
The notes and things

263
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:22,740
Right

264
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,620
Hey speaking of music

265
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,220
Now this

266
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,460
Now see that's where I'm from

267
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:27,580
That's the French

268
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:27,580


269
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:27,580


270
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:27,660
Accordion

271
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:27,660


272
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:27,660


273
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,320
I could cut in the

274
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,260
Swinging live corpses

275
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,220
Right

276
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,980
Dirt

277
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,580
Things

278
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:31,780
Yeah

279
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:55,960
That's what was

280
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:55,960


281
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:55,960


282
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,700
guitar solo

283
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,340
Don't you go dancing with your blue jeans on

284
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,960
Better wear leather or maybe nylon

285
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,980
You won't have to wonder if you just got a stamp

286
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,880
You're looking at the folds in your underwear

287
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,860
Excuse the mom, mama's really back at home

288
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,460
And I didn't lock a room cause I'm dancing with my heart out

289
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,600
There's no place where I can hide

290
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,860
Cause if you're going and I'm pushing and I'm pushing

291
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,440
Come inside

292
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,520
I feel it getting bigger, it's about to rip

293
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,020
The jeans of my jeans are throwing a fit

294
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,140
Excuse the mom, mama's really back at home

295
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,700
And I didn't lock a room cause I'm dancing with my heart out

296
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,060
Hey kitty boy

297
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,700
Excuse the mom, mama's really back at home

298
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,520
And I didn't lock a room cause I'm dancing with my heart out

299
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,940
There's no place where I can hide

300
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Cause I'm dancing with my heart out

301
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:48,980
And I didn't lock a room cause I'm dancing with my heart out

302
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,620
Hey kitty boy

303
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,800
Excuse the mom, mama's really back at home

304
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,660
Yeah, I'm dancing with my heart out

305
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,260
guitar solo

306
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,240
guitar solo

307
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,580
guitar solo

308
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,220
guitar solo

309
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,220
guitar solo

310
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,640
guitar solo

311
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:09,720
guitar solo

312
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,200
guitar solo

313
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,100
guitar solo

314
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,060
That was such a great old tune.

315
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,960
I love that tune. Yeah, yeah.

316
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,120
Except we can't play it on the radio because it's so

317
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,200
dirty. Yeah.

318
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,140
Those filthy boys.

319
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,040
Dancing with a

320
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,160
heart on was always a problem

321
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,100
and there's not a bad

322
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,720
word anywhere in it really

323
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
but the concept is

324
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Excuse me ma'am, I must really

325
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
beg your pardon.

326
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,840
I need a lot of room when I'm dancing

327
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,000
with my heart on. Yeah, it's about

328
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,620
a guy with a purple heart. Right.

329
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,020
Proud of his purple heart.

330
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,960
And it's stuck right to the front

331
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,180
of his pants. Yeah.

332
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,700
Right on his zipper.

333
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,940
Yeah.

334
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,080
See my heart

335
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,780
on? Yeah.

336
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,120
You guys were so ahead of your time.

337
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,180
The Swinging Love Corpses

338
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,720
people may not understand this but

339
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,740
there was no spinal tap.

340
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
At the time that the Swinging Love Corpses

341
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,140
were doing their

342
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,180
commentary on the tropes

343
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,820
of modern rock and roll bands.

344
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,880
I think that we were co-temporaneous

345
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,780
at one point there because I remember

346
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,080
we got free tickets to go see Spinal Tap

347
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,300
when they were filming it.

348
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, when they were filming it but you guys

349
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,780
were already doing it. Yeah.

350
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,980
You know, I always had this

351
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,140
favorite band, festival lineup

352
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,120
that was like, it would open

353
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,760
Tenacious D would open

354
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,940
and it would have

355
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,180
a mighty

356
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,220
wind and Spinal

357
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,140
Tap and then the Swinging

358
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,120
Love Corpses and then the final finale

359
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,940
would be Frank Marino

360
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,940
and Mahogany Rush because he's

361
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,500
serious.

362
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280
He was the classic

363
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,020
example of one of those over

364
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,700
the top stadium bands

365
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,180
that had to have the hour long

366
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,980
bass solo and then

367
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,240
the hour long drum solo.

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,840
I went to see him in Cleveland about

369
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,520
ten years ago. He was still playing.

370
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,160
I made it through

371
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
the drum solo but then he said here comes

372
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,940
the bass solo. I had to leave.

373
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,300
I couldn't stay to hear

374
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,320
him. The Swinging Love Corpses, we used

375
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,640
to have, our drummer was

376
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
demanded his

377
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,240
solo of course

378
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,220
and so he was fairly self

379
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,320
indulgent which we promoted

380
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,220
Skippy Mojo Butcher

381
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,240
Mojo Skippy Butcher

382
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,160
and so he would go into his drum solo

383
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,960
and we would

384
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,900
drag out the lounge

385
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,580
chairs and turn on the TV

386
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,840
and read the newspaper

387
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,460
while he did his drum solo

388
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,780
and finally he'd be finished

389
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,040
and we'd put everything away and get back into the song.

390
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,580
I liked the Swinging Love Corpses

391
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,740
songs that would end

392
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,160
for like five minutes.

393
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,040
We had one that was like a minute long

394
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,300
and then would end for like five or six

395
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:57,640
minutes.

396
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,660
The ever more

397
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,320
triumphant buildups

398
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,640
to it.

399
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Dun dun dun.

400
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,140
And then the drummer would

401
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,980
but then they couldn't quite quit

402
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,680
you know just when you thought it was over.

403
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
Like the monster that keeps coming back

404
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,920
and you think he's dead.

405
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,160
That was

406
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,980
I remember there was a band that had

407
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,820
a song like that. I think it was

408
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,200
the

409
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,600
Outlaws.

410
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,060
They had that

411
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,740
one of those take off endings that goes on

412
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,820
that just goes on forever

413
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,620
and it's got like three guitars

414
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,920
going at the same time.

415
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,780
You guys

416
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,480
were a very visually

417
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,040
interesting band because you wore

418
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,500
really cool

419
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,660
hippie costumes and

420
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,140
back then you had long hair.

421
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,680
Yeah they looked like

422
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,080
something out of a quick silver messenger service

423
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,800
crossed with Country Joe

424
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,860
and the Fish or something.

425
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,980
That's the look we were going for.

426
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,160
And it was sort of defined by the fact

427
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
that we had gotten all of our clothes

428
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,800
at the same rag merchant.

429
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,120
We went there and dug

430
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,460
through the piles of clothes.

431
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,140
And found our best outfits that way.

432
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,620
Wow.

433
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,060
Huh.

434
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,340
Yeah.

435
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,540
Yeah.

436
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,340
And then we had to wear wigs.

437
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,460
And that was one of the cardinal sins in the band

438
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,220
is that you couldn't take your wig off.

439
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,800
Right.

440
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,580
Well that'd be

441
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,000
You'd be breaking character.

442
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,020
Well what happened we did have that time

443
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,340
in Chicago where we were playing in that club

444
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,420
that was about 150 degrees on the inside.

445
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:28,940
Oh my god.

446
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,820
And it was like playing inside of an oven.

447
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,220
Yeah.

448
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,960
And you couldn't play with a wig on.

449
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,760
We had to take our wigs off.

450
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,920
Or die.

451
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,000
Flip your wigs.

452
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,440
Yeah.

453
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,940
It was really sad because

454
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,180
Yeah.

455
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,840
Because they need to just look like businessmen.

456
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,640
And then our fans

457
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,100
You look like cable repair guy.

458
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,960
And our fans realized that that wasn't our real hair.

459
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,600
You look like Xerox repairman.

460
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,880
And yellow page salesman.

461
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,360
Yeah.

462
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,820
And conveyor belt manufacturers and things.

463
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,220
Right.

464
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:03,960
Yeah.

465
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,760
Yeah.

466
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


467
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


468
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


469
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


470
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


471
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


472
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


473
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


474
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


475
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


476
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


477
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


478
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


479
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:04,760


480
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,780
Pharmaceutical salesman.

481
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,280
It was crazy.

482
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,280
Our buddies on the show.

483
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,020
And some of our fans were so sad because they realized

484
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,420
that really wasn't our hair.

485
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,680
That wasn't our real hair.

486
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,940
And that some of us were actually bald underneath.

487
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,080
That's sad.

488
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,140
You know I'd do both.

489
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,360
I have real long hair and I'm bald.

490
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:31,980
Yeah.

491
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,180
I'm bald on top.

492
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,760
But I have long breasts.

493
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,080
I have brown hair.

494
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,400
It's all white in the front.

495
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,180
Look coming towards somebody.

496
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I look like a little old man.

497
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,360
Walking away I look like some kind of pirate or biker.

498
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,580
Or a pirate who mated with an angel.

499
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,380
I would keep reminding myself of that if I were you.

500
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,120
Well ladies like my punk.

501
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,600
How angelic and yet piratical you look.

502
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,500
I have horny divorcees come up to me from behind all the time.

503
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,680
I yank on that thing.

504
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,180
But then when I turn around and look at them and smile they kind of their face drops.

505
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,380
I'm so hopeful.

506
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,340
I'm so let down.

507
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,920
He had such a cute butt.

508
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,760
And nice long hair.

509
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,620
Yeah.

510
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,000
But he's much older than my husband.

511
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,480
He's much older than my dad.

512
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,140
Goodness.

513
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,760
The dogs are here.

514
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,000
My goodness.

515
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,180
It must be chilly out there.

516
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,720
It's chilly outside.

517
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,620
Chupacabra is here.

518
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,780
Oh there's an article about Chupacabra.

519
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,500
It's my new skeptic.

520
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,080
Oh really?

521
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,980
Inquirer newsletter I get in the email.

522
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,060
I read a lot of skeptical stuff.

523
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,180
Because I like monsters and they cover monsters and spooks.

524
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,140
I'm pretty skeptical about most everything.

525
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,580
Well you know Robert Anton Wilson was skeptical about everything and skepticism.

526
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,960
He had kind of a why not both approach although he called it maybe logic.

527
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,020
I've boiled it down to why not both or in some cases why not all three.

528
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,300
I think it's like an extension of your concept that I've applied to disagreeing and it's

529
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,940
really we just agree differently.

530
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,840
Right.

531
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,340
Right.

532
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,700
You never have to be disagreeing with anyone.

533
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,420
The whole world can just realize that they agree differently.

534
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,500
See this is when I should have.

535
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,560
I should have.

536
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,980
I copy stuff off of our secret news group and there's a whole thing about the differently

537
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,260
everything.

538
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,380
It was like you know the differently moral.

539
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,600
The differently sane of course.

540
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,000
The differently sane was the first one.

541
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,580
God.

542
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,780
That group really extends itself to be more of a philosophical discussion group.

543
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,200
Well I know but I like I've got a whole like six pages of stuff up there just from

544
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,020
the last three days of you me and Onan and Sterno just and Marty going back and forth.

545
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,760
I mean Sphinx Colonel.

546
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,920
Sphinx.

547
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,200
Yeah.

548
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,240
We're part of a very august and elite assemblage.

549
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,280
You talk about Illuminati and elites and lizard people and stuff.

550
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,380
We've got we've got it boiled down to the five or six.

551
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,100
It's only really five controllers of the universe.

552
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,000
It's you heard of semi sweet chocolates were like a semi secret society.

553
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,920
We're semi secret.

554
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,880
Semi.

555
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,620
Semi.

556
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,280
Semi.

557
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,160
I didn't mean to say semi.

558
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,780
Edit that part.

559
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:45,980
Semi.

560
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,480
Semi.

561
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,240
Semi.

562
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:47,620
Semi.

563
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,160
Semi.

564
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,420
Semi.

565
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,740
Semi.

566
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:50,800
Semi.

567
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,800


568
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,800


569
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,800


570
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,800


571
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,000
Semi.

572
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,220
Semi.

573
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,280
Semi.

574
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,260
Semi.

575
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


576
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


577
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


578
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


579
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


580
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


581
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,260


582
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,380
Now let's be smart again.

583
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,280
Okay.

584
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,100
That's easy.

585
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,940
I'll just turn it or turn it around backwards or something.

586
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,160
I go.

587
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,600
All right.

588
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,680
That's really clever.

589
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,900
Just you want me to know that that that means you're giving KBFA phone number.

590
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,560
Yes.

591
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,600
Or Р.

592
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,760
Or the WCS phone number.

593
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,020
Come on call in.

594
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,460
Why aren't you calling in?

595
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,260
Because I have the problem of this show actually plays on several different actual broadcast radio stations.

596
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,280
Not many, but they're the best ones.

597
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,000
And people want to call in and talk to us and they can't.

598
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,320
Right.

599
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,460
They would end up getting somebody at KPFA or somebody in Cleveland.

600
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,760
Why don't you just give them, just right now, give them your phone number and have them call us now.

601
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,420
Sure.

602
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,480
Sure. 216-320-9528.

603
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Call us now.

604
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,060
We're waiting for your call right now.

605
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:00,660
Yeah.

606
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:02,980
It's true.

607
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,440
Please call us.

608
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,620
It's on the website.

609
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,400
We're standing by for your call.

610
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,020
People go, well, Stang, I didn't know how to get hold of you.

611
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,520
Why didn't you try Googling Ivan Stang email or subgenius phone number?

612
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,160
That's the phone that rings in my pocket.

613
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
Nobody ever calls it, though.

614
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,400
Exactly.

615
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,400
Except Bernard, that psycho guy.

616
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,020
Well, I call it once in a while.

617
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,580
Hardly ever.

618
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,560
In fact, you had to ask me what my phone number was not that long ago.

619
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,880
That wasn't me.

620
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,540
Yeah, well, you had to ask.

621
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,240
Yeah, you've had, no, you're asking me the address.

622
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,920
It's like, what's your mailing address?

623
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,920
It's like, he doesn't even know the sacred P.O. box.

624
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,520
Yeah, well, I was in a position where I couldn't look it up.

625
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,060
But you were more accessible to me than other addresses.

626
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,640
Here's how you remember the P.O. box.

627
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,420
It's like 808.

628
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,400
It has eights in it.

629
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,700
But we couldn't quite get up to 808 for Bob, so it's 807.

630
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,100
Mr. Yarborough has 808, and I'm waiting for him to die.

631
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,000
I didn't say that.

632
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,800
But your street address is different.

633
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, but the mail won't come here.

634
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,860
This is too remote and deadly.

635
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,360
What do they do with that box out there?

636
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,960
That's for U.S.

637
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,220
mail.

638
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,020
Yeah, yeah, some mail goes in there.

639
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,380
So your junk mail goes in there.

640
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,760
Yeah, but we use a P.O. box.

641
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,220
807 Glen Rose, Texas, 760.

642
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,380
Come offers and...

643
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,820
But if he's like us, his children will then use the box after him.

644
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
They'll get 808.

645
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,740
Maybe you can just steal the box when he dies and swap it out with yours.

646
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,560
You know, actually, I could.

647
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,640
I have thought about writing the guy a letter and saying,

648
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,040
would you...

649
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,080
Would you be open to swapping post office boxes?

650
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,600
And explain to him that the 808 ties into my business logo.

651
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,480
Right.

652
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,080
And probably he's going to go, no, that's way too much trouble.

653
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,680
I've got all my business cards and everything printed with that.

654
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,800
I just don't think I can do that.

655
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,220
You want me to change the street to Martin Luther King?

656
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,100
Boy, you nailed Mr. Yarborough, and we don't even know anything about him.

657
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,420
And that's him, all right.

658
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,840
This is Garden Grove.

659
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,160
You will not...

660
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,840
You do a pretty good Texas accent, Dr. Drummond.

661
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,440
I've been known to live in this state from time to time.

662
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,480
It's not a lot different from a Kentucky accent.

663
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,460
They kind of drag it out a little bit flatter.

664
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,580
Actually, there's so many Texas accents, it's ridiculous.

665
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,080
You're here.

666
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,060
Yours is a little bit more Houston-y.

667
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,400
I like to use a classic Houston accent.

668
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,280
To the average human, you and me sound almost alike.

669
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,080
The people have told me they had trouble telling us apart,

670
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,120
although I don't understand that.

671
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,560
That's true.

672
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,820
Yeah, I don't get that.

673
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,500
The accent, anyway, but not the voice, timber.

674
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,800
Dr. Drummond has the loudest, most piercing voice

675
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,920
in the whole world next to yours, Princess Marie.

676
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,240
Oh, I didn't know that.

677
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,560
Yeah, that's why you're the only two people I can understand.

678
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,780
I see.

679
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,420
The speech.

680
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,120
Everyone else just sounds like they're mumbling.

681
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,580
I've been guessing what Dr. Howell says for 20 years.

682
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,280
Because I get tired of going,

683
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,140
sorry, how can you say that again?

684
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay, I'll say it again!

685
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,240
They always overdo it, you know?

686
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:38,540
Yeah.

687
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,380
It's almost like they're angry.

688
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,040
They're angry because you didn't hear.

689
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,020
Yeah, so they say it way louder than anyone would ever need it to be.

690
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm just differently hearinged.

691
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,640
Yeah, you're different.

692
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,800
I can hear you guys fine.

693
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,000
Of course, I'm in headphones.

694
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,580
They're cranked all the way up.

695
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,020
You know, our TV is set on 100 all the time.

696
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:06,780
My grandsons came in and literally, like, screamed when I turned on the Wii or something.

697
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,000
They were like, turn it off!

698
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,220
Where's the volume?

699
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,740
Please!

700
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,480
Where's the remote?

701
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,140
Where's the remote?

702
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,880
Please, grandfather, don't hurt us!

703
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,780
That's my sister's TV.

704
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,380
We never found the remote for it.

705
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,780
No!

706
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,940
Stop hurting us, grandfather!

707
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,860
Yeah, it was like that.

708
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,840
Alexander goes, it's turned up to 100!

709
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
And I said, welcome to the world of the hard of hearing boys.

710
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,940
They just couldn't grok it.

711
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,920
They've been forgetting that their entire lives.

712
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,840
Those poor sons of...

713
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,660
Grandsons.

714
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,240
Those poor sons of your...

715
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,140
Sons of our sons.

716
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,540
Sons of the pioneers.

717
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,000
Those poor sons of your daughter.

718
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,880
Yeah.

719
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,040
Those guys have it pretty good, let me tell you.

720
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,820
They really do.

721
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,000
These kids these days, they don't have to try anymore.

722
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,080
They don't try.

723
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,400
We can't do that.

724
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,200
We can't do that.

725
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:02,900
They don't try.

726
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,460
They do.

727
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,880
These zombies these days.

728
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,160
These zombies these days.

729
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,160
They don't try.

730
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,140
Now, when I was a zombie...

731
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,420
We got up at 5 o'clock in the morning to eat the face of a...

732
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Of a grandma.

733
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,280
Of a grandma.

734
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,580
Yeah, but see, we're ripping off Jane or Hyperclete's and...

735
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,280
Oh, no.

736
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,700
And that means we owe him a million more dollars now.

737
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:22,720
That's right.

738
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,760
That's exactly right.

739
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,780
Just for those five or ten words we said.

740
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,940
Just for mentioning his name, he's going to...

741
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,720
You know, Stang's been ripping me off.

742
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,940
He sold thousands of Jane or Device tapes.

743
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,400
I know, because I've met three people who just memorized part seven.

744
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,500
Yeah.

745
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,940
That means he sold probably two or three thousand.

746
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,880
A hundred thousand.

747
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,340
We sold nine a year like we sold of all the media barrage tapes.

748
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,360
That's about how many tapes we sold back then.

749
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:48,820
Yeah.

750
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,000
Yeah.

751
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,940
Yeah.

752
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,060
Yeah.

753
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


754
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


755
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


756
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


757
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


758
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


759
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


760
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


761
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


762
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


763
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


764
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


765
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,060


766
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,200
That's enough.

767
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,540
We're doing a little better now.

768
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,880
Although, whenever somebody buys a CD, I know they're old.

769
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,580
I know it's a really old person.

770
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,940
You know, I think the church is starting to hit its stride.

771
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:08,600
We're really kind of now finally starting to take off a little bit after...

772
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:08,940
We are?

773
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,200
Well, maybe in the next...

774
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,020
I can think I'm seeing...

775
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,080
We've been saying that for 40 years.

776
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,020
I think I'm seeing a little rise in the trajectory in these numbers here.

777
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,740
Well...

778
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,620
Well, Sandy Boone's award-winning documentary, JR Book Ops...

779
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,780
Maybe the world is tilting.

780
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,660
And the Church of the Subgenius, available on Apple TV and Fandango and others.

781
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,840
Can you buy that DVD on Amazon or anything?

782
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,020
You can't buy the DVD, period.

783
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,160
I can make...

784
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,580
But, I mean, do they have plans on producing a DVD?

785
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,480
No.

786
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Really?

787
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,660
Nobody did.

788
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,240
What optical media?

789
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,460
My son said this to me.

790
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,460
Dad...

791
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,800
I think you're the last person I know that still uses optical media.

792
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,680
It took me a minute to realize he meant DVDs and CDs.

793
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,980
Here's what I say.

794
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,800
We're using offline media.

795
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,060
Really?

796
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,100
Yeah, offline media.

797
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,820
Offline media.

798
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,520
Yeah.

799
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,840
Optical media is a type of offline media, son.

800
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Someday, we won't all be connected to the internet anymore.

801
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,220
And I'll still be watching a movie.

802
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,360
I've been thinking about teaching...

803
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,340
I've been thinking about teaching workshops at...

804
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:27,660
places like Starwood or Harvard University about data capture post-internet.

805
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,780
You know, post-electricity data capture.

806
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,720
Right.

807
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,620
I would introduce them to the pencil and the sheet of paper.

808
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,240
Right.

809
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,200
Which a lot of people don't even...

810
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,820
You know, it's like they don't...

811
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,560
You know what else you can do?

812
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,860
You can teach them the code of cursive handwriting.

813
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,660
It's a special code.

814
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,060
Oh, yeah.

815
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
That only some people can read.

816
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,360
Yeah, that's like...

817
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,660
Yeah, it's a secret.

818
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,540
That's secret.

819
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,540
It's a secret type of code now.

820
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:53,960
Yeah.

821
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,200
Right.

822
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,720
That's why they wrote the Declaration of Independence that way.

823
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,380
So nobody today could read it.

824
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,940
They don't even know what language it is.

825
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,960
They don't want to read it.

826
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,100
It would hurt their eyes to learn to read it.

827
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,620
And their brains.

828
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Trump had trouble reading it in a, you know, typed up, printed script form.

829
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,500
And he goes, it's almost like a foreign language, isn't it?

830
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:13,860
I'm like, no.

831
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,880
It's actually modern English.

832
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,440
Who was this?

833
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:17,960
Trump.

834
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,600
Yeah.

835
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:18,760
Trump?

836
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:18,760


837
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:18,980
He was...

838
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,860
Because they were recording...

839
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,800
They had all the presidents that were alive and a bunch of other people reading parts

840
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,480
of the Declaration of Independence.

841
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,920
The Constitution.

842
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,020
Yeah.

843
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,480
Or the...

844
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,700
Maybe it's the Constitution.

845
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,680
And each one had a different paragraph.

846
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,060
And apparently the tape of Trump trying to do it is like the Colonel Sanders tape.

847
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,760
You know, he's like, he couldn't...

848
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,060
He never got a good take of it.

849
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,980
And he just...

850
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,920
He didn't really understand some of the words.

851
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,780
Do you remember that?

852
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,580
That one where it had Orson Welles.

853
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,220
The peas?

854
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,360
Yeah, the peas.

855
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,580
That's so classic.

856
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,360
I love that.

857
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,340
See, those aren't prank calls.

858
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,340
We could cut to those.

859
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,860
He's taking apart the whole...

860
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,740
Telling them what a poor job they're doing.

861
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,020
The writer's bad.

862
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,180
The director's bad.

863
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,860
He's just tearing them apart because they're telling him to read it a certain way, you know.

864
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,320
Yeah.

865
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,440
It's just hilarious.

866
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,520
There's a whole bunch of those...

867
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,400
It seems like that came from a series.

868
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,400
Celebrities at their worst.

869
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,380
That's what it was.

870
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,040
Is that what it was?

871
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,360
Celebrities at their worst.

872
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:25,920
I bet.

873
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,440
And they have like John Wayne and he's drunk and he's doing something on stage and...

874
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah, he's talking to a college...

875
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,480
Yeah.

876
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,780
A college graduation.

877
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,780
And just a whole bunch of people that were really...

878
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,280
We used to play that.

879
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:37,980
Yeah.

880
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,280
Chaz played that John Wayne one a lot.

881
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah, the drunken celebrities.

882
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,400
I like that stuff.

883
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,860
Trump will be on one of those someday.

884
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,780
Oh, God.

885
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:48,960
Yeah.

886
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,540
I can't even imagine.

887
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,800
Remember that idiot George Bush?

888
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,680
All the things he would say.

889
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,600
We're putting...

890
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,360
We're trying to put food on...

891
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,500
What did he say?

892
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:58,980
I'm putting...

893
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,160
You're trying...

894
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,180
It's tough for you to put food on your family.

895
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:02,980
Yeah.

896
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,780
And, you know, fool me once.

897
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,400
Fool me twice.

898
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,120
You know.

899
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,480
Yeah.

900
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,840
But frankly, I totally...

901
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,260
It's like I...

902
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,740
Bush had so many gaffes.

903
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,140
But that's the way people talk.

904
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,260
I mean, come on.

905
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,040
That's actually...

906
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,360
If you cherry pick...

907
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,800
Anybody talking in public, you're going to...

908
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,120
You can easily pull up all kinds of embarrassing...

909
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,580
And now nobody can...

910
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:25,680
Sure.

911
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,640
And there's no privacy anymore.

912
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,280
So...

913
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,400
And everybody has...

914
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,020
Everybody's a reporter with a cell phone, you know.

915
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,680
Right.

916
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,360
So you can't escape the gaffe anymore.

917
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,180
Somebody's going to get it.

918
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,340
Well, it's perfectly normal.

919
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,960
And, of course, any gaffe by anybody of any importance...

920
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,440
Or anybody you don't like.

921
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,920
If it's somebody you don't like, it's the stupidest.

922
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,200
It's proof of senility.

923
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,800
It's whatever.

924
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,320
It doesn't matter.

925
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,580
If it's somebody you like, it's, well, hey, anybody can, you know, stutter.

926
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,940
I got to stutter myself.

927
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,220
But it all gets transformed into clicks eventually, you know.

928
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,460
Yeah.

929
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,560
Because it's all about traffic and, you know, selling advertising.

930
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,700
That's what rhymes the world.

931
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,040
I used to think that algorithm stuff was sort of sci-fi, but now I've realized it's real.

932
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,560
It's real.

933
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,380
Very real.

934
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:12,980
It's super real.

935
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,560
It's...

936
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,200
Neil Stevenson's novel, Fall...

937
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,600
You still didn't watch that movie.

938
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:18,860
Yeah.

939
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,960
I didn't want you to watch, did you?

940
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,460
The documentary?

941
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,580
I did, but Social Network or...

942
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,380
Social Dilemma?

943
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,020
Yeah, I did.

944
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,380
You did?

945
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay.

946
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,880
I sure did.

947
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
I watched the hell out of it.

948
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,800
Scared the pee water out of me.

949
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:28,940
Yeah.

950
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,800
When I first saw that, that's when I decided to quit Facebook.

951
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,020
It was the guys who invented the internet going, man, this stuff is dangerous.

952
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,320
I don't want my kids on this.

953
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,440
People that worked for Facebook and Google and different...

954
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,320
And Twitter, they...

955
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,560
Yeah, were higher ups.

956
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,440
I mean, these were like people in high responsibility.

957
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,880
And talking about those algorithms and how they're designed to...

958
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,880
To inflame you.

959
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,240
Yeah.

960
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,300
Because that's...

961
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,800
That's what you click on the most.

962
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,580
You're more active.

963
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,480
You do more scrolling and more liking and more reading and posting.

964
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,980
Now, see, the next generation of phones will track your eye movements.

965
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,640
Yeah.

966
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,920
So you won't even have to click.

967
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,840
It'll know exactly what words and what images you're looking at.

968
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,480
In my case, that's not a problem because...

969
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,380
And then when you want to post, you'll just blink your eyes.

970
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,120
No.

971
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,800
Yeah.

972
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,380
Right.

973
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,720
Right.

974
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,780
Oh, well, you won't even have to.

975
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,860
When you want to like something.

976
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,020
You blink your left eye twice.

977
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,920
It's just automatically saying what it thinks you would say.

978
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,500
Yeah.

979
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
You don't even have to.

980
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,760
It says, oh, I know this guy so well.

981
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,980
He's looking at the like button.

982
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,680
That's all I need is to indicate the like button now.

983
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,740
Well, we all three noticed that all of a sudden our phones were making these little movies.

984
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,780
Which they've always done.

985
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,160
But they were really pushing them at us.

986
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,660
This morning, I was typing keystrokes that said, Philo's coming.

987
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,020
Actually, Philo's coming.

988
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,980
Hide your frog, girls.

989
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,400
Philo's coming.

990
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,000
Hide yourselves, cats.

991
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,200
And so forth.

992
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,180
But my phone went, oh, Philo's coming.

993
00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,500
So it made a Philo collage of all the pictures in my phone of Dr. Philo Drummond.

994
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,120
Which were, of course, hilarious.

995
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,860
And it put this inappropriate sappy music with it.

996
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,900
It made it even funnier.

997
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,860
Don't you think I look better cutting off that nasty big old beard, though?

998
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:15,900
Well.

999
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,660
You got pretty big.

1000
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,000
You did look like a cartoon character.

1001
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,600
Yeah.

1002
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,520
And now you just look like any old, very, very old.

1003
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:26,840
Cable.

1004
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,180
Old cable splicer.

1005
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:28,680
Yeah.

1006
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,320
Old cable guy.

1007
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,920
Old pharmaceutical salesman.

1008
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,800
Well, you looked more like a farmer with that beard.

1009
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,540
You know.

1010
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:39,960
Yeah.

1011
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,960
Particularly with my overalls on.

1012
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,460
Yeah.

1013
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,240
The funny thing is, Dr. Drummond is a farmer.

1014
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,060
That's true.

1015
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,700
He is.

1016
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,700
He's a real farmer.

1017
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,620
He's an actual farmer.

1018
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,500
I'm not.

1019
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,400
I live in a ranch.

1020
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,940
You're a rancher and I'm a farmer.

1021
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,080
No, I'm not.

1022
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,500
My brother is a rancher.

1023
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,360
You are a rancher.

1024
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,340
You have all kinds of livestock around here.

1025
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,120
I see them.

1026
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,520
I really like ranch dogs and cats.

1027
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,360
Canine and feline livestock.

1028
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:10,060
But nonetheless, they require a lot of kibble and food and walking and cleaning up after.

1029
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,060
Canine livestock and key lime livestock?

1030
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:13,940
Generally.

1031
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,720
Feline.

1032
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,540
Oh, feline.

1033
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:15,700
Feline.

1034
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Okay.

1035
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:22,920
Generally, what's referred to as livestock doesn't live in your house or sleep on your bed.

1036
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,900
Not anymore, but back in the olden times when they first started, they had the livestock

1037
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,120
right in the house with them.

1038
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,780
They only had one.

1039
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,500
And they were keeping them warm in bed.

1040
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,360
What about that red goat up there?

1041
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,920
Didn't that goat live in your house?

1042
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,880
Reverend Stang?

1043
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:43,780
That was the first or second goat that my parents got before it was ever a goat ranch.

1044
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,540
I don't know what.

1045
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,540


1046
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,260
Possessed them to get a goat.

1047
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,300
But they kept it.

1048
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,220
They took it back and forth between Richardson near Dallas and out here at the newly built ranch.

1049
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,160
That particular goat, old Big Red is his name.

1050
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,500
Big Red.

1051
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,200
Princess Weir is referring to a mounted goat head.

1052
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,460
A huge goat, domestic goat head that's mounted up on the wall.

1053
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,100
With Dr. Seuss-like horns.

1054
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,200
Like a wild animal.

1055
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,540
Yeah.

1056
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,160
Like as if it was some wild animal that had been shot.

1057
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,380
That was actually a pet.

1058
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,960
But it went wild.

1059
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,540
It went feral like Boo Boo did that one time.

1060
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,900
Boo Boo runs wild.

1061
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah.

1062
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,980
And the goat was running around.

1063
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,160
Actually, this happened in Trailer Park Boys game.

1064
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,340
A willy goat did the same thing.

1065
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,480
It became a rapist.

1066
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,700
It was a male goat, a billy goat.

1067
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,220
And it started raping.

1068
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,080
It went off the hook.

1069
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,740
It was off the hook and it was causing total damage to other goats.

1070
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,980
Total mayhem and destruction.

1071
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,800
We didn't have that.

1072
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,140
It was a habit.

1073
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,160
It was having its way with the female goats.

1074
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,880
Yes, but they weren't our goats.

1075
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,060
They were other people's goats.

1076
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,220
Were they bearing the young of this crazy goat?

1077
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,880
I don't know.

1078
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:53,640
I don't know.

1079
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,540
But there he is.

1080
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,580
That's what happens if you start raping.

1081
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,940
You start raping.

1082
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,780
You end up on a wall.

1083
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,580
If you're a pet and you start raping, your head might end up on the wall like that.

1084
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,060
That's not people don't.

1085
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,880
Goats don't like that anymore than people do.

1086
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,820
There's a big old bighorn sheep.

1087
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,840
My dad shot that bighorn sheep and that bear.

1088
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,860
And that jackalope up there?

1089
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,640
Yeah.

1090
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,500
He shot that jackalope, right?

1091
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,300
There is in fact a jackalope mounted head on the wall.

1092
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,400
It was here when we moved in.

1093
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,260
Oh, so you can say that you didn't actually kill any of these creatures yourself.

1094
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:32,700
Me?

1095
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:32,900
No.

1096
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,240
I only shoot.

1097
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,440
I hunt, Dr. Drummond.

1098
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,180
I'm an avid hunter, but I hunt with a camera.

1099
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,620
Don't you see?

1100
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,060
Oh, yeah.

1101
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,380
I know.

1102
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:41,860
I know.

1103
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,440
The dogs and I hunt, too.

1104
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,440
Are you going to have a big year this year?

1105
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,180
Oh, I don't know.

1106
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,160
Did you watch, see that movie?

1107
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,120
Everything's going extinct.

1108
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,460
The big year?

1109
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,180
No.

1110
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:01,100
That was kind of Jack Black and Steve Martin are bird watchers.

1111
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,940
Oh, no.

1112
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,880
I meant to check that out.

1113
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,220
Kind of a good movie.

1114
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,320
I thought that might be fun.

1115
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,400
You could tell, you know, like probably Jack Black wanted to work with Steve Martin, you know?

1116
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,720
I would.

1117
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,820
Sure.

1118
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,220
I'd like to work with either one of those guys.

1119
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:16,600
I'd like to work with either one of those guys.

1120
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,440
It's another spaceship, but it requires a cord.

1121
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,440
You feed a cord into it and you pull it out and it flashes and makes noises.

1122
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,340
Friends of Tarzan's.

1123
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,120
But I don't have the cord.

1124
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,220
Tarzan's radio station is all packed onto a fairly small table, but it's really decorated.

1125
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:41,780
There's a replica 3D model of the moon up there and a giant cabbage worm rubber toy

1126
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,420
on top of a reel-to-reel camera.

1127
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,380
It's a real four-track recorder that hasn't worked for years.

1128
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,400
It just looks cool.

1129
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,620
And this spaceship.

1130
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,700
And three spaceships.

1131
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,940
Princess Wee has one.

1132
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,600
You've got one.

1133
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,180
And here's the good one.

1134
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,660
Let's put it there.

1135
00:39:59,160 --> 00:39:59,760
Man.

1136
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,100
That's a classic spaceship sound.

1137
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,700
Yeah.

1138
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,380
Who sent us this?

1139
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,700
Cosmic Layla.

1140
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,100
That's right.

1141
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,000
Cosmic Layla.

1142
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,320
Cosmic Layla.

1143
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,660
Yeah.

1144
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,180
What a character.

1145
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,400
Cosmic Layla.

1146
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1147
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1148
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1149
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1150
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1151
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1152
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,400


1153
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:13,900
Yeah.

1154
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,720
Wee Ma Ma, the 92-year-old that lives here, she sat and played this thing over and over

1155
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,200
and over again when we first got it.

1156
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,140
She just fascinated.

1157
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,000
She couldn't keep her fingers off of it.

1158
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,380
Yeah.

1159
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,560
She played that over and over and over.

1160
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,720
It's her driving.

1161
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,780
It's a very haunting melody.

1162
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,320
It's kind of Mars Attacks.

1163
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,420
It's a Mars Attacks-looking plastic spaceship.

1164
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,180
Yeah.

1165
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,260
It's obviously someone to take advantage of.

1166
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:53,000
Friends, the environment we're in is kind of across, the decor is crossed between Western,

1167
00:40:53,320 --> 00:41:03,100
a fairly tasteful Western style with landscape paintings, and subgenius slack alter Archie

1168
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:09,340
McPhee, Susie the Flusie, Bull Dada, like many subgenius houses.

1169
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,380
Every bit of it.

1170
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,600
Every bit of it.

1171
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,220
Every bit of it.

1172
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Yeah.

1173
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:14,880


1174
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:14,880


1175
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:14,880


1176
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:14,880


1177
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:14,880


1178
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:14,880


1179
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,700
We have horizontal surface taken up with-

1180
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:16,780
Okay, enough of that.

1181
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,140
Enough of that.

1182
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:23,040
Nick Nacks toy dinosaurs skulls, real skulls, fake skulls.

1183
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,120
There's just over our mantelpiece-

1184
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,620
It is quite the collection.

1185
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,260
There's a complete rubber-

1186
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,220
75-foot Dobbs head sculpture.

1187
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,180
A 75-foot metal Dobbs head, a Smilodon skull, that's a saber-tooth tiger, an Australopithecus

1188
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,880
skull, my grandfather's skull.

1189
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,360
Both of our dads had a skull.

1190
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,920
ashes and a bust of Pappy, my father.

1191
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,600
A brass bust.

1192
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,460
A well-done brass bust.

1193
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,600
Except for he looks more like L. Ron Hubbard than Pappy.

1194
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
Maybe he was L. Ron Hubbard.

1195
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,720
And you notice Pappy also.

1196
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,700
Maybe Pappy was actually L. Ron Hubbard.

1197
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,540
Pappy had many.

1198
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,660
Well, you know, that would explain a lot.

1199
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,980
That would explain a lot.

1200
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,340
The timing would not.

1201
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,520
It just doesn't fit.

1202
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:10,680
It doesn't fit.

1203
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,140
Although, maybe that's what his naval, that whole naval reserve thing.

1204
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,960
That's where he met him.

1205
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,540
Maybe he actually just.

1206
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,540
He'd be gone for weeks at a time doing, quote, naval reserve.

1207
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,220
He was probably ghost riding for L. Ron Hubbard.

1208
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,060
He was in intelligence in naval reserve.

1209
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,520
That was his code for the yacht.

1210
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,460
That's when he was going out to the yacht to run his secret cult.

1211
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,260
Sure.

1212
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,260
He would say it was intelligence.

1213
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,760
He was also really busy in the Masons.

1214
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,940
And he was.

1215
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,300
He.

1216
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,840
He taught Bible studies at the local Methodist church.

1217
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,200
And he was an atheist.

1218
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,400
A complete.

1219
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,140
He absolutely.

1220
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,460
He's a biggest expert on the Bible of hardly anybody I know.

1221
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,540
And we've got more books here talking about how the Bible is all made up.

1222
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,240
Bunch of hooey.

1223
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,800
Bible scholar.

1224
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,880
And Jesus never even really existed.

1225
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,760
Well, I'll be.

1226
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,740
My father, like me, was very interested.

1227
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,640
Don't you tell me now that Jesus didn't exist.

1228
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,500
He was interested in religion.

1229
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,240
That's just crazy.

1230
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,380
Crazy stuff.

1231
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:10,500
Crazy stuff.

1232
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,980
He was interested in religion.

1233
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,860
He was also interested in weird, twisted things.

1234
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,060
Well, don't you be down, downstroking my Jesus now.

1235
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,480
He was also a Sunday school teacher who planted doubt into all of his students.

1236
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:25,800
Yeah.

1237
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,480
Bible study.

1238
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,200
Bible studies.

1239
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,100
That's just the work of Satan.

1240
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,720
That's a satanic.

1241
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,320
No, it was all Bible quotes.

1242
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:31,880
He just read them.

1243
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,020
That's a satanic goal to implant doubt in the mind of a Christian.

1244
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,440
You know how much subgenius is who's never read books of the subgenius?

1245
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,160
Same with Christians and the Bible.

1246
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,820
They have never actually read.

1247
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,060
You don't need to read the Bible to understand it.

1248
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,120
You just put it under your pillow and sleep on it for 30 years.

1249
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,040
It just seeps in.

1250
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,580
It just seeps in and it teaches you the word.

1251
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,660
That's all you need.

1252
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:58,280
Oh, yeah.

1253
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,820
Quote me John 3.10.

1254
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,040
Quote me John 3.10.

1255
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,020
How about 3.16?

1256
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,560
Oh, that's better.

1257
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,300
That's even better.

1258
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,820
He so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1259
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,340
Postal.

1260
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,000
That whosoever shall believe within him shall be saved.

1261
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:13,360
In Glen Rose, Texas.

1262
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,520
76043.

1263
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,660
The Destruction Evidence Museum in Glen Rose, Texas.

1264
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,900
But how about John 4.10?

1265
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,420
How about John 4.20?

1266
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,720
How about Ecclesiastes?

1267
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,800
I'll have a John at 4.20.

1268
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,660
Let's see.

1269
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,800
What was that other book?

1270
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,100
Isaiah 4.20.

1271
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,820
That was a good one.

1272
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,240
That's a killer.

1273
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,000
I think I'm going to look one of those up just for grins.

1274
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,500
Hosea 3.22.

1275
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,960
Lo, for my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

1276
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,740
And so I spit them out of my mouth and accept them no longer into the temple,

1277
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,880
for they are as morons and dip.

1278
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,720
Oops, I cussed.

1279
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,760
Shoot, man, what time is it?

1280
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,900
Is it after 11?

1281
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,060
Oh, it's okay then.

1282
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,660
Huh?

1283
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,120
Remember, 11 o'clock was Safe Harbor on the real radio.

1284
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:14,900
Oh, right.

1285
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,200
Remember back in the days when we would drive?

1286
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:17,720
Yeah, I remember.

1287
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,220
It was real broadcast radio.

1288
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,960
We had to leave the dogs at home and drive across Cleveland and go into a locked up building

1289
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,700
and go through, put in all these codes and tricks and get up through the airlock and

1290
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,540
there'd be Charleston.

1291
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,180
Yep.

1292
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,080
Finishing up his show.

1293
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,460
And then when we left, there'd be Dr. Sinister.

1294
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,160
I'm missing.

1295
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,260
I'm missing.

1296
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,400
I miss him so much.

1297
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,360
I do too.

1298
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,160
I miss it a lot.

1299
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,940
You know, Dr. Sinister quit doing his show on WCSB.

1300
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,800
Why is that?

1301
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,240
Did he really?

1302
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,180
Well, he'd been doing it for 20 years since he was about 19 and he's about 40 now.

1303
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,680
I can't believe our friend Puzzling Evidence is still doing a show.

1304
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,660
He can't quit.

1305
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,880
I don't think he can quit.

1306
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,220
I don't think I can either.

1307
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,660
You know, I...

1308
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,840
It just gets in your blood and you can't...

1309
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,800
It's part of your DNA.

1310
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,240
Even doing reruns...

1311
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
To keep on yakking.

1312
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:18,260
I've been running reruns for 10 or 12 shows in a row, but I have to listen to them and

1313
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:26,040
drop in the PO box and stuff like that and look out for people who've since been unpersoned.

1314
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,520
You know, there's not many of those.

1315
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:29,820
Yeah.

1316
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,300
People who had to be unpersoned from the church.

1317
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,000
Oh, yeah.

1318
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,340
I know a couple of those.

1319
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,620
Yeah.

1320
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,580
I know about a dozen of them.

1321
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,900
Anyway.

1322
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,420
Anyway.

1323
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,660
On a lighter subject, there's so many subgenius radio shows or subgenius-related ones.

1324
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,080
Puzzling Evidence, of course, was the very first one since 1982.

1325
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,900
And Puzzling Evidence himself is still doing that thing out of KPFA Berkeley.

1326
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,400
He lives fairly nearby, lucky for him, in Oakland.

1327
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,020
Philo used to have to drive all the way from Martinez.

1328
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:10,360
Yeah.

1329
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:10,840
He had to drive all the way from Martinez to get there.

1330
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:11,720
Yeah.

1331
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,260
That was a really interesting experience.

1332
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,100
For 100 years you did that, didn't you?

1333
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,600
Well, 117 minus 100.

1334
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,620
That's a long damn time to do a weekly radio show.

1335
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,020
It is.

1336
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,300
Yeah.

1337
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,780
This, by the way, I think is our Slack number 1,869.

1338
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,000
Wow.

1339
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,660
Sixty-nine.

1340
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,800
You know what 69 means.

1341
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,300
Yeah.

1342
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,380
Almost 70.

1343
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,260
Right.

1344
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,240
Hey, aren't you about to be 70 years old, Dr. Trump?

1345
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1346
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1347
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1348
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1349
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1350
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1351
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1352
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1353
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1354
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1355
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,240


1356
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,100
Well, if I'm 69, I will be 70 in May.

1357
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:42,600
Yeah.

1358
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,500
Yeah, yeah.

1359
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,020
You may be 70 in May.

1360
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,920
I will be, assuming I may be there.

1361
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,280
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

1362
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:59,760
Actually, you're pretty much guaranteed not to die in that end of the world, the real

1363
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,000
end.

1364
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,460
You know, that portion of the world I live in now has been in the same place for the

1365
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,080
last 420 million years.

1366
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,880
The continent has moved around and seas have come and gone.

1367
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,100
But that section of the country has remained above and in the same place.

1368
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,580
Well, relative to the center of the earth, it's been in the same place.

1369
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,960
Relative to the universe.

1370
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,300
No, no.

1371
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,220
Relative to the other continents, to all the continents.

1372
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:21,540
Right.

1373
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:21,620
Right.

1374
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,300
To on this planet.

1375
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:22,620
Yeah.

1376
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:28,220
It has moved around the surface of the earth, but it's stayed within its same perspective

1377
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,860
to all the rest of the continents.

1378
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,220
Right.

1379
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,920
Because the whole solar system is moving real fast.

1380
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,240
And the orogeny is like 420 million years ago.

1381
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,040
Orogeny?

1382
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:39,640
That's.

1383
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,620
That's the term for mountain building.

1384
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,360
Oh.

1385
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,740
When mountains are built.

1386
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,240
Oh.

1387
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,280
That's when God.

1388
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,400
It sounds sexy, doesn't it?

1389
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:48,600
When God.

1390
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:48,720
When God.

1391
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,120
Did God just sort of leave off doing that after that?

1392
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,880
It just seems sexy.

1393
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,900
Orogeny.

1394
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,880
That's your orogeny zone.

1395
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,700
Please bend over and don't let go.

1396
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,440
Dr. Drummond, you have a golden voice.

1397
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,120
You have a real good radio voice.

1398
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:09,860
I do.

1399
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1400
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1401
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1402
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1403
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1404
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1405
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1406
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1407
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1408
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1409
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:09,860


1410
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,320
I really enjoy being on the radio regularly.

1411
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,200
And I would drive in.

1412
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,020
It would take me about 30 minutes to get there.

1413
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:21,560
And I usually came in right after the show started.

1414
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,160
Yeah.

1415
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,540
It took us about half an hour to get to the station from Cleveland Heights.

1416
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,900
It wasn't really all that far.

1417
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,260
It's just a lot of lights.

1418
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,340
You know, it's a big city.

1419
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:31,780
Oh, yeah.

1420
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,340
It was actually a nice drive.

1421
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,280
It went by the hospital.

1422
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,560
All the big, rich hospitals.

1423
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,840
And the music was great.

1424
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:39,840


1425
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:39,840


1426
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:39,840


1427
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,340
The museums.

1428
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,040
The hospitals?

1429
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:41,640
Yeah.

1430
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,100
The hospitals.

1431
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:42,480
Yeah.

1432
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,600
Case Western.

1433
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,020
Man.

1434
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,880
Case Western.

1435
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,260
University.

1436
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,820
I wish my drive went by the hospitals.

1437
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,320
Yeah.

1438
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,240
And the art museum.

1439
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,180
The science museum.

1440
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,000
All the museums.

1441
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,540
Mine just went by houses.

1442
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,440
I didn't go by any special buildings.

1443
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,440
It was only, even the slums that it went through were being converted into ritzy, some kind

1444
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,080
of thing.

1445
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,740
Oh, everything was being gentrified like hell.

1446
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,180
Yeah.

1447
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:05,740
Yeah.

1448
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,340
Cleveland was one of those towns everybody used to make fun.

1449
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:08,560
Yeah.

1450
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:08,880
Yeah.

1451
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,040
We're going to send him to Cleveland.

1452
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,320
But it's, now Detroit is the one everyone poops on.

1453
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:17,760
Yeah.

1454
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,140
And Cleveland's like, actually, not a bad-

1455
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,200
Seattle.

1456
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,320
Cleveland's a pretty fancy place these days.

1457
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:24,780
Yeah.

1458
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,260
It pulled out of its doldrums.

1459
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,920
The river doesn't-

1460
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,900
Burn.

1461
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:30,640
Burn anymore.

1462
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,220
And guess what, Princess Wee?

1463
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,620
What?

1464
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,460
The whole first half of the show, my zipper was down.

1465
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,280
Oh, no.

1466
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:38,540
Oh, no.

1467
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,540


1468
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,540


1469
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,540


1470
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,540


1471
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,540


1472
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,540


1473
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:38,740
Yeah.

1474
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:39,800
Really?

1475
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,220
Yeah.

1476
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,280
We'll have to erase the whole thing.

1477
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,300
And I missed it?

1478
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:42,600
Man.

1479
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,080
Well, we're going to have to erase the whole thing.

1480
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,620
I can't believe it.

1481
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,080
Doggone.

1482
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,740
Because that was a good part of the show that you messed up.

1483
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,580
Yeah, I know.

1484
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,380
With your zipper down.

1485
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:49,880
Yeah, I can't.

1486
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,320
I can't.

1487
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,220
We're going to be-

1488
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,180
It was probably the best part.

1489
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,440
Well, I didn't have my pants on.

1490
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,500
But that's okay, right?

1491
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,400
I heard that was okay on this show.

1492
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,320
That this was-

1493
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,660
It's always okay to do a radio show with no pants on.

1494
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,880
This was a pantsless show.

1495
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,060
But if you have pants on and you have your zipper up-

1496
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,220
You better have your zipper up.

1497
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:06,900
Yeah, right.

1498
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,140
Otherwise, it's kind of obscene and suggestive.

1499
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,180
Yeah, it's a little bit obscene and suggestive.

1500
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,480
It seems like you're trolling.

1501
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,080
Yeah.

1502
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,740
Yeah, you're hiding something, but you want them to look.

1503
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,700
Particularly if you have anything, like if the cows are coming out of the barn or anything.

1504
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,240
Barn dogs have cows coming out.

1505
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:26,620
Yeah.

1506
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,620
You heard that one, didn't you, when you were a kid?

1507
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:30,980
Of course.

1508
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,900
But see, you were a girl.

1509
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,080
Yeah, when you were a kid, that was a good-

1510
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,760
You were a girl, sir.

1511
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,060
Yeah, but they still said the same thing.

1512
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,340
Yeah.

1513
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,460
You heard it loud enough.

1514
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:47,920
In Ohio, they had almost all the same kid jokes and songs and sick, dirty poems that

1515
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,180
we had in Texas.

1516
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,580
But there's always differences.

1517
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,300
Yeah, there's always weird little variations, like the greasy, grimy, gopher guts thing

1518
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,080
is a little different.

1519
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:04,520
Great, great big gobs of greasy, grimy, gopher guts, mutilated monkey meat, dirty, dirty

1520
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,300
birdie feet.

1521
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,700
All wrapped up in something.

1522
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,560
Wouldn't you like to lick the spoon?

1523
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,000
I'd like to lick the spoon.

1524
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,460
Mars ended with eyeballs, eyeballs rolling down the dirty street.

1525
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,980
Let me think.

1526
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,400
And we didn't have the spoon.

1527
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:33,340
Great big gobs of gooey, gooey, gopher guts, mutilated monkey meat, dead heads and dirty

1528
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:33,840
feet.

1529
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,400
They're all different.

1530
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:36,900
Yeah.

1531
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,600
It's Mandela effect, man.

1532
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:39,620
No, it's just that-

1533
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,700
We were all in different dimensions.

1534
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,540
There wasn't an internet back there, so we didn't know what the internet was.

1535
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:43,540


1536
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,100
We weren't doing those on kids' shows.

1537
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,420
No.

1538
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,980
We didn't know how to say-

1539
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,420
Like they do now.

1540
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,420
What the right way to say it was yet, because we didn't have that whole system in place.

1541
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,080
Yeah, we didn't know what ass meant exactly.

1542
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,160
Yeah, no, we thought an ass was a type of a goat or donkey or something.

1543
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,380
Well, it was also a type of a bug that could sting.

1544
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:05,740
Yeah.

1545
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,860
Oh, that was an asp.

1546
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:07,540
Yeah.

1547
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,340
But then in the Bible, an asp was a snake, so we didn't know what to think.

1548
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,740
Right. Yeah, everything's all...

1549
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,420
It's just all messed up back then.

1550
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,280
It's all hornswoggle.

1551
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,100
But it's perfect now because we have the internet that lets us know what's right and wrong.

1552
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,160
You can tell what's true and what's false.

1553
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,140
They wouldn't put it on the internet if it was just some baloney, would they?

1554
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:33,520
Once all the people were joined together on the massive network, they were all shaking hands and loving each other.

1555
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,700
Yeah, I noticed.

1556
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:44,280
It's like a one-world community of harmony and melodic relationships where people sing together and dance together.

1557
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,400
It was.

1558
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:45,960
Hold hands.

1559
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:52,440
Remember, Dr. Drummond, when you first introduced me to it, it was still just college people and military.

1560
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,740
There was only 100,000 people back then.

1561
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,200
Right, and everybody on the internet was real smart.

1562
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,460
And they still had to exchange email with each other, and then they would call and say,

1563
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,600
Hey, I just sent you an email. Would you read it, please?

1564
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,140
Right.

1565
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:05,580
Yeah.

1566
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,620
Yeah, it's like a tell-all.

1567
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,680
Hey, man, what do you think of my email?

1568
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,460
It looks good. I really like the way you worded everything there.

1569
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:18,020
Thanks for giving me a call and giving me a heads-up that that email was coming.

1570
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:24,300
And now, really, I'll read it more in depth tonight before I go to bed and try to decipher the inner message.

1571
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,840
It's like calling somebody up and going, Hey, I just sent you a telegraph, so you better read it.

1572
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:31,320
Yeah.

1573
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:31,880
Yeah.

1574
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,460
It's got real bad news in it.

1575
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:33,780
Okay.

1576
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,480
Yeah.

1577
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:34,940
I'm sorry.

1578
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:40,800
Now, just remember, when you read it, and you will, will be affected strongly.

1579
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,900
I'm telling you, I'm sorry, and I didn't have anything to do with it beforehand.

1580
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:51,080
So, don't look at me when you really want to blow your mind.

1581
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,960
When you read that telegraph.

1582
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:53,100
Telegram.

1583
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,400
Telegram.

1584
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:56,780
Right.

1585
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,500
Telegram.

1586
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:57,620
Telegram.

1587
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,120
That's the word.

1588
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:58,800
Yeah.

1589
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,140
Don't think of me anymore.

1590
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,340
Hey, do you think we're starting to slide?

1591
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,960
I think we're sliding.

1592
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,020
I think I slid.

1593
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,040
Yeah, I think.

1594
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,640
Man, that's a long time ago.

1595
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,060
Maybe it's time to turn the show off.

1596
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,140
For ten minutes.

1597
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,160
Because what if we slide even further?

1598
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,820
What if we should turn it off for like five minutes?

1599
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,180
And then, of course, you know, it could be off for a week.

1600
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,980
It could be off.

1601
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,600
But, you know, we didn't get any callers.

1602
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,760
What happened to the callers?

1603
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,640
They never called in.

1604
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,160
It's a bummer.

1605
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,240
Bunch of slackers.

1606
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,380
They're out there just listening.

1607
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,320
And they're not really active.

1608
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:40,600
They're what you call an inactive listener.

1609
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,480
Because they're just listening, sitting on their hands, not really thinking about what

1610
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,540
the radio station actually needs.

1611
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:54,580
And someday someone will call in, and that will be considered an active listener.

1612
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,360
One that actually wants to interact.

1613
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,800
Well, first I'd have to hook my little iPhone up to this mixer.

1614
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,300
And then you'd have to hook the mixer.

1615
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:04,460
And then I can have one.

1616
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,920
And then I can have one.

1617
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:06,860
I can have one caller.

1618
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,100
And you'd have to actually be streaming this live instead of recording it as we are.

1619
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,180
I would never stream things live.

1620
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,060
It's pointless.

1621
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:16,940
It's crazy.

1622
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:17,680
It's...

1623
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,240
But...

1624
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,680
We did it for X Day.

1625
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,920
It makes it easier for the callers to call you when you're streaming live.

1626
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,760
It's the red light.

1627
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,020
It's the red light.

1628
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:33,160
Well, you know, Hal does his show every month on streaming live.

1629
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:33,920
And...

1630
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,900
But see, you know, then you have to shave.

1631
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:37,960
Yeah.

1632
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,680
I just can't see.

1633
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,980
I just put my mask on.

1634
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,180
I've had people go, why don't you guys...

1635
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,840
People can't see my face.

1636
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:49,320
You know, why don't you guys, you know, like, do a streaming YouTube show?

1637
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,340
You should have a mask that looks like your face, but it's shaved.

1638
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,880
And so then when you need to go on the show, you just put your mask on.

1639
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,460
Yeah, but the sound is bad coming through masks, as we know.

1640
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:00,800
That's true.

1641
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,480
That is true.

1642
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,440
It's terrible.

1643
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:02,640
It's terrible.

1644
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,800
My mask is kind of resonating a little bit right now.

1645
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,200
It sounds like...

1646
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,120
I thought that was your mustache.

1647
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,280
You know, when I used to...

1648
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,780
That overman head would make the sound echo almost.

1649
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,340
It was so big.

1650
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,840
Yeah.

1651
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,500
It's so round.

1652
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:19,780
Sure it did.

1653
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:25,520
I actually had to sacrifice a lot to wear that head all the years I did.

1654
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,880
I mean, to actually let my head expand that way.

1655
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,760
Swell up that way.

1656
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:29,980
Yeah.

1657
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,820
It looked like it hurt.

1658
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,560
It did.

1659
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,420
It was very, very painful.

1660
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,160
But I did that for the people.

1661
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:34,760
I know.

1662
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,340
You were selfish.

1663
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,720
Because I'm kind of magnanimous about things like that.

1664
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,280
You're the greatest.

1665
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:38,800
Yeah.

1666
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,640
You're the most humble man of all the greatest.

1667
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,580
I'll admit, sometimes I do let...

1668
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:47,960
I may not be as humble as I should be.

1669
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,380
And I regret that, and I'm going to try to be better.

1670
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,960
Like one of the butt sisters.

1671
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,520
The buttresses.

1672
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,180
Gutter.

1673
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,300
Gutter and...

1674
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,160
Gutter.

1675
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:01,920
Gutter.

1676
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:02,760
Gutter butt.

1677
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:04,700
Gutter buttress.

1678
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,460
And blinther buttress.

1679
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:07,680
Yeah.

1680
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,860
What was the other one?

1681
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,320
Blimper.

1682
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,740
Blimper buttress.

1683
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,580
Blimper buttress.

1684
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,240
Well, they didn't talk about blimpers.

1685
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,140
They kept her upstairs.

1686
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,480
She didn't move much.

1687
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,620
No, she was unfortunate among the buttresses.

1688
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,580
So, when is this break coming?

1689
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,700
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1690
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,460
Rocket away.

1691
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,120
Yeah.

1692
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,060
Yeah.

1693
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,340
Yeah.

1694
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,580
Remember that back porch?

1695
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,520
Yeah.

1696
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,180
Man, that was so good.

1697
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,180
That was good.

1698
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,740
I sort of remember.

1699
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,980
Until they told us we couldn't do it anymore.

1700
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,100
9-11.

1701
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,080
They put cameras out there.

1702
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,420
9-11 screwed everything.

1703
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,200
Yeah, we couldn't open the windows at the station at WCSB anymore.

1704
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:52,800
Nope.

1705
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,000
Dave couldn't smoke.

1706
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:00,040
Did you know 7-11 is just two less than 9-11?

1707
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,080
The company?

1708
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,160
7-11.

1709
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,520
It says everything.

1710
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,300
It's a conspiracy.

1711
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,000
They were involved.

1712
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,780
They set it all up.

1713
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,420
It's hidden in plain sight.

1714
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:10,760
Yeah.

1715
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,500
Everything is hidden in plain sight and nothing is true.

1716
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,320
Okay.

1717
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,180
I'm going to stop this machine.

1718
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,640
Goodbye.

1719
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,620
Bye.

1720
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:18,760
Bye.

1721
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:19,880
Bye.

1722
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:20,620
Bye.

1723
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:20,940


1724
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,320
Bye.

1725
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:21,700


1726
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,000
Bye.

1727
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,140
Bye.

1728
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,200
Bye.

1729
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:22,420
Bye.

1730
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:22,800
Bye.

1731
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:22,960
Bye.

1732
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:23,100
Bye.

1733
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,220
Bye.

1734
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:23,240
Bye.

1735
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:23,320
Bye.

1736
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:23,660
Bye.

1737
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:23,940


1738
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,000
Bye.

1739
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,080
Bye.

1740
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,080


1741
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,080


1742
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,240
Bye.

1743
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:24,820


1744
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:24,980
Bye.
