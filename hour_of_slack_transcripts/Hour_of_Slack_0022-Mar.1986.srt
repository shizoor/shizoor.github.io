1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Thank you for listening and stay tuned for the Hour of Slack, dear friends.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,820
Ah, yes.

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,080
Well, friends, I don't hear anything.

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,860
Do you?

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,760
Let's just see.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,200
No? No?

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,500
But what about him?

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,100
The leader?

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,880
Perhaps he can help us.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,380
For the first time in man's history, I'm president.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,020
And I can do this with dash and daring do.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,000
No.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,660
You're too old. You're out of touch.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,840
I don't think I'm out of touch.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Asked for too old?

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,360
Well, I have a very good memory about...

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,560
all the things back in my life.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,060
For example, I can remember...

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,560
Senator Benjamin Hill in 1878.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,080
When we were less than 70 years old.

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,080
Good times and bad.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,980
Ronald Reagan.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,740
You can see and understand the America of dirty streets and poor people.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,340
The problem isn't being poor. The problem...

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,580
The problem is...

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,420
uh...

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,800
uh...

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:28,900
uh...

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,720
So, poverty isn't...

30
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,940
uh...

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,140
uh...

32
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,300
uh...

33
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,540
uh...

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,360
uh...

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,280
uh...

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
uh...

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
uh...

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:39,260
uh...

39
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:39,460
uh...

40
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,580
uh...

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:39,580


42
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:39,680
uh...

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,680


44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,680


45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,680


46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:39,680


47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,120
I'm supposed to be the big reactionary.

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,980
Okay.

49
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,740
All right.

50
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,420
What...

51
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,860
What...

52
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,840
What people do you think you represented?

53
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
The John Birch Society was praising you.

54
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,880
Oh, yes.

55
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,640
All right.

56
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,060
The John Birch Society.

57
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,600
Sure.

58
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,600
Milton Friedman.

59
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,360
Certainly.

60
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,420
The far right.

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,380
All right.

62
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,780
The...

63
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:58,780


64
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:58,780


65
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,380
As a matter of fact, uh...

66
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,220
a few Republican panaceas, myself, and people like myself,

67
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,580
organized a task force of people outside government and inside.

68
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,200
Uh...

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,980
Well, this little group gathered, and we very carefully would open the car door with the window rolled down,

70
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,840
shove the man's arm across the window, and then break it.

71
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,700
The backbone of America, and then break it over the window.

72
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,840
Uh...

73
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
And then the pressure came on.

74
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,360
That hidden longing came out, and, uh...

75
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,760
Gunshot.

76
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,100
Gunshot.

77
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,720
Gunshot.

78
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,480
Gunshots, and so forth.

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,340
What about government's role in offsetting the negative consequences of the free enterprise business community you talked about?

80
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,140
Oh, now.

81
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,480
No, now you get back.

82
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,220
No, now you get back to what I said earlier.

83
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,700
What I'm talking about is the free marketplace, free enterprise.

84
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,100
The regulations that government exists to have, and are necessary,

85
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,580
is, yes, to ensure that someone can't sell us a can of poisoned meat.

86
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,280
I think, uh...

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
a can of poisoned meat had a problem that I think the people must recognize.

88
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,400
The problem is, uh, if you open a can of poisoned meat, hold it in your hand,

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
it gets warm very fast while you're drinking it.

90
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,460
We punch the holes in the top and drink it.

91
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,860
Well, this fella's made a very economic...

92
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,980
...stein handle.

93
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,480
You can buy a dozen of them and have them like you have your silverware.

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,780
You're serving people, uh...

95
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,820
poisoned food in the can.

96
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,180
You just clamp the stand.

97
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,600
Snap the stand.

98
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,300
You just clamp...

99
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
...clamp the stand.

100
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,800
Snap the handle onto it and people hold it, but the handle of the drink doesn't warm up.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,960
And you're gonna make a million dollars.

102
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

103
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,320
We're now deep inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

104
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,040
As you can see all around you there's sparking.

105
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,560
There was a short circuit.

106
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,440
All brain seems to have recovered.

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,260
Uh, there are sparking energy thoughts all around us.

108
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,840
Far more than the normal human brain.

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:37,980
but as we know, another misfire there, we know Doug Smith is not a normal human. No, and here inside the

110
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:46,100
brain of Doug Smith, we can observe some of the differences that make this man a unique leader among men.

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:57,280
Over here in this corner are the memory bags, and over here is the main printout area.

112
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:29,040
If you turn on the machine, this is Radio Yerevan. My name is Franz Ivanovich Hagen, and this is the news.

113
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,860
Wake up, puppet boy!

114
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,460
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,640
I have a bucket!

116
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,640
No trouble.

117
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,080
Let's get...

118
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,540
Set, get going. Amen.

119
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,140
Recording.

120
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,380
Everything's going fine.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,240
No trouble.

122
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,880
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,700
Bob?

124
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,980
Bob?

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,640
Bob?

126
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,260
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

127
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,300
Every time you say, see,

128
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,080
hear,

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


131
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


132
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


134
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,080


136
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,600
or think.

137
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,960
What about Slack?

138
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,140
That's your key phrase.

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,200
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

140
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,360
And now, the subgenius hour of Slack.

141
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Subgenius hour of Slack.

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,280
Subgenius hour of Slack.

143
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,320
Subgenius hour of Slack.

144
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,300
Subgenius hour of Slack.

145
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,940
Subgenius hour of Slack.

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,220
Subgenius hour of Slack.

147
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,220


148
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,220


149
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,220


150
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,220


151
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,220


152
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,320
The subgenius hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to

153
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,100
be played on radio station KNON, and only in the city of Dallas, Texas.

154
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,940
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is

155
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,760
advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials in the event of any material

156
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,920
from this radio or other resource.

157
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,140
listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

158
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,980
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and

159
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,140
brain frequencies constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved

160
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,100
safety unit only.

161
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,120
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases, but

162
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,820
truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

163
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,400
Hoping your time is all time, and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

164
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,100
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

165
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,860
Oh, yes, dear friends, and Pastor Buck Naked is expected momentarily.

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,960
And plus, as guest hosts, we have here the TV crew from SMU.

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,760
They're here to try to get pictures of the poltergeist that's been harassing the show,

168
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,340
the airways of the show.

169
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:13,880
I don't know if a lot of you folks knew this, but there's a dead, old radio

170
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,080
radio station.

171
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,960
A radio preacher who used to inhabit this airwave belonged before KNO, and it was a

172
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,780
different station.

173
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,480
But he died while on the air, friends, on this very microphone.

174
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:31,440
And that's why we're plagued by certain technical difficulties that afflict this show only,

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:31,880
friends.

176
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,500
Yes, last week it was the needle gouging its way across records right after we put him

177
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,020
on the air.

178
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,160
So we're hoping to catch some of that paranormal manifestationary visitation.

179
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,020
Uh, here on this show tonight on videotape.

180
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,720
And, uh, yes, dear friends.

181
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,600
And meanwhile, Norm?

182
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,800
Nah, Norm right here.

183
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:03,360
Friends, you've heard about the KNON pledge drive coming up, and it starts officially

184
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,300
at midnight.

185
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,480
That just means that since this is the hour of slack, you don't get any slack unless you

186
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
pledge, friends.

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,400
That's right.

188
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,200
We want your blood.

189
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,200
We want, uh, well, we want everything.

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,660
Here's the thing, folks.

191
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,160
Uh, you literally have to pledge to KNON in order to keep us on the air.

192
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,040
I mean, look at it this way.

193
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,140
You're already paying the conspiracy, right?

194
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,540
All the time.

195
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,660
You're paying them to make you work, dear friend.

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,380
It's the truth.

197
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,300
So if you're gonna, you know, if you're gonna be getting screwed every day, why don't you

198
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,820
do it the way you choose?

199
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,880
Some ways are fun.

200
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,080
Pick, you know, I mean, if you're...

201
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,860
If you're listening to something else, you're paying for it with the commercials that are

202
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,040
in the silent radio signals that are broadcast into your mind.

203
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,760
Listen to those phones light up, friends.

204
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,060
Yes, some of them are saved out there.

205
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,260
And, uh, why, folks, I'm gonna be giving those phone numbers relentlessly to the, this tune

206
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,020
of, uh, of WKGB, our friends in Boston.

207
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,120
We got a lot, playing a lot of Boston tonight.

208
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,200
Uh, but those numbers to call, friends.

209
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,720
And you can, you can actually...

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,280
Talk to Phil and the Blanks in person.

211
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,160
If you call and pledge your $5, $20, $30, $40, or a million dollars to KNOM.

212
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,680
That's right.

213
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,780
You can praise Bob and praise Phil and the Blanks if you will call and get that pencil

214
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,380
ready, friends.

215
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,760
That's one number.

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,460
Let's try that again.

218
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
8-2-3-7-4-9-0.

219
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm not gonna quit saying that, friends, until we get some souls, uh, pledged to this station.

220
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,820
And, and, you know...

221
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,760
Souls aren't enough.

222
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,120
A lot of you have been pledging your ears for years and years now.

223
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,420
Pledging your ears and your prayers to KNOM.

224
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,680
You've already done that, but we want you to pledge.

225
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,700
I mean, you know, dig deep.

226
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,840
Pledge a million bucks.

227
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,840
Pledge whatever you've got.

228
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,540
I mean, there's little old ladies out there that are starving or barely got enough.

229
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:08,260
You know, for them, uh, $300, $400 a week to KNOM would be a lot.

230
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,900
You know, uh, so if they could just spare $100 a week, that'd be great.

231
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,760
Some of you, of course, can only spare $5.

232
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,640
And for that $5, you'll get a KNOM newsletter complete with abs for this show.

233
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,100
That's right.

234
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,200
And, ah, hear those phones screaming again.

235
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,440
Ah, yes.

236
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,860
Ah, ah, oh, the power.

237
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:38,720
It fills a DJ with lust, friends, to know that you're gonna, you're gonna call us and say that you'll give $40 to KNOM.

238
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,800
Because that way you'll get the KNOM t-shirt, the bumper stickers, the newsletter.

239
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:52,160
And if you, if you make sure and praise Bob, friends, if you make sure and praise Bob, you'll make your way into heaven.

240
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,400
So, uh, and we'll take Visa numbers, uh, Master Charge numbers.

241
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,620
And there's even a tricky bank draft thing, which you can talk to the, to fill in the blanks about.

242
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,520
But see, and I'm not gonna play anything else until we get some more calls, friends.

243
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,200
This is important.

244
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,720
Our status, the status of Bob.

245
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,420
Bob Dobbs and the Hour of Slack on KNOM depends on how many pledges we can get.

246
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,500
So get on them phones, boys, girls.

247
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,920
Prove that we have listeners.

248
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,860
I mean, we've been pretending we have listeners for a long time now.

249
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,680
We need to, we need to prove it.

250
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,400
Friends, your survival hinges on, on your pledge.

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:41,740
The very earth itself, even, even Bob Dobbs' survival on the, on the airwaves anywhere hinges on your pledge right now.

252
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
And I don't mean later.

253
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,760
I don't mean calling up.

254
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,240
Tomorrow morning when you get paid.

255
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,120
I mean, you know, you'll get paid later.

256
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,200
Pledge now.

257
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,060
Get on those phones or you're killing Bob, man.

258
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,140
You don't want to kill Bob.

259
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,440
Well, maybe you do want to kill Bob.

260
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,120
I mean, he, Bob's always telling you to kill him.

261
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,660
But, uh, friends, I just, I don't know.

262
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,860
I don't even know what to play next.

263
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,260
I think if this is one of these tank decks that's running, I'd stop.

264
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,960
Oh, nothing's enough.

265
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,640
God.

266
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,680
I don't know what to play next in here.

267
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,160
Well, that's, that's not true.

268
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,580
I mean, this isn't good.

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,340
No, we just got back to normal.

270
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340


271
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340


272
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340


273
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,340
Would we trade something off to John Howard?

274
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:35,900


275
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,500
This guy really, really wants to live.

276
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,500


277
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:37,500


278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000


279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,060
Tate Missoula remove.

280
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,460
Now you should do that.

281
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:38,820
Now you're aware of the war.

282
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,320


283
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,620
ain't no good. They won't double-cash it without that extra $500.

284
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh, yes, dear friends. Well, has the station polder guy started up yet?

285
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,860
Video crew, say hello real loud.

286
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:56,660
Hi.

287
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,300
Yeah, that's the entire paranormal investigation team from SMU, friends.

288
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,440
What about the phone numbers?

289
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,280
Oh, the phone numbers. Yes, that's right. The phone numbers again, as we said before.

290
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,900
823-7490. These are more important than the sacred subgenius box number, friends.

291
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,120
823-8801. That's an easy one.

292
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,440
823-8801. 823-8801. And 823-8883.

293
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,480
That's going to be a strange year, friends. The year 8883.

294
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,480
The year when Atlantis will rise again from the ocean, and you'll have to...

295
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,040
Papa!

296
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,060
Master Naked just walked in.

297
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,400
Oh, yes, friends.

298
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,620
Hi, girls.

299
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:52,880
Tell them to use some of your special mojo sexuality charisma, you know, buck, to get them to send money.

300
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,100
That's all we care about tonight.

301
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,940
Are we on a pledge drive again?

302
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,800
What do you mean? This is the pledge drive, man.

303
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,340
It's wait until we actually start at midnight. You think this is bad.

304
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,620
All right, well, I've got my own little pledge drive thing I'm going to do.

305
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,340
But basically, here's my theme.

306
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:18,420
If you don't know if you want to pledge to the station or not, just turn the channels nice and easy right now.

307
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,120
Just try it.

308
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,500
I might be one of the first people who ever asked you just to turn around the other channels.

309
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,900
Go ahead and change the channel a little bit.

310
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,220
So call in.

311
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,080
That's right. Change channels. Listen to the trash for a minute that you heard before and then call back.

312
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,600
And listen to the trash that you've never heard.

313
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:46,160
And those numbers are the other the wimpy spirituals that that won't get you really massage gland on your foot.

314
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,760
Your massage.

315
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,780
Well, whatever.

316
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,840
Close enough.

317
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,480
We want you to massage that foot gland and then be in bed out there.

318
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,120
I want you to massage your sacred foot gland and ask it.

319
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,320
Should I pledge for Bob?

320
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:06,320
Reach deep, deep, deep into that most holy and sacred of receptacles on your whole body, friends.

321
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,360
Your back.

322
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,560
Your back pocket.

323
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,040
No.

324
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,460
Massage your foot first.

325
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,420
Well, yeah, but I don't care what they do to get the for the urge.

326
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:16,860
Foreplay.

327
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,860
That's right.

328
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,020
All right.

329
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,340
Anybody touching your feet yet?

330
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,380
I guess not.

331
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,800
823-7490.

332
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,900
Is there any up there?

333
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,700
That's 823-7490.

334
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,280
823-8801.

335
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,080
Well, I guess we're history.

336
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,660
We're out of here.

337
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:29,940
823.

338
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,300
Yeah.

339
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,660
Let's play in the other stations.

340
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,460
Can we do that?

341
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:32,860
Okay.

342
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,100
Yeah.

343
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,800
Well, like, for instance, this is what this is one of the other stations.

344
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,160
Listen.

345
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,940
Listen to this.

346
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,500
Welcome to the End Times, boys and girls.

347
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,700
We're going to shock shock the house with your brain and the world.

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,700
Bob is getting down with you here tonight.

349
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,140
Bob is getting down to help your plight.

350
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,420
Bob is coming here to ease your strife.

351
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,580
Karma suckers let Bob into your life.

352
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,780
Well, I'm MC Cleef.

353
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,780
I'm the master of rap.

354
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,340
I'm a dog like my mother's lips.

355
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,820
Gonna clap.

356
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,940
Y'all sitting out saying, oh, woe is me.

357
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,280
Well, I'm here to tell you it ain't worth peeing.

358
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,460
The End Times is here.

359
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,400
You're pretty mad now.

360
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,600
Time to make a pay for the past.

361
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,580
Who else is going to have to go through a real?

362
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:07,940
Rebirth.

363
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,960
And that means paying the spaceship Earth.

364
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
Exists will come from Planet X to remove from us the paintball sex.

365
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,500
In the meantime, we will have our say.

366
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,180
Get slack.

367
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,720
And fornicate every day.

368
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,040
Knock the conspiracy on its ass.

369
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,420
Make your life a ass.

370
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,200
Take your toes right to the hip.

371
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,440
Make the normal suckers fit.

372
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,760
Take the time to rape their minds.

373
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,920
Tell them to blow it out their behinds.

374
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
Take all their money.

375
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,960
Get what's your worth.

376
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,100
And continue to spurt to the rebirth.

377
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
Who's gone?

378
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,540
He gone.

379
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Who's gone?

380
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,000
He gone.

381
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,060
Who's gone?

382
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,420
He gone.

383
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,300
Who's gone?

384
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,720
He gone.

385
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,600
Slack faster makes you damn faster than any other.

386
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,860
So to the bone.

387
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,340
He's the one.

388
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,800
How about he get out of your behind?

389
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,480
If you want to know the truth, then that's a fact.

390
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,560
Somebody scream.

391
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,580
Gimme more slack!

392
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,700
Gimme more slack!

393
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,880
Do you like slack?

394
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,880
I like it.

395
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,160
I say, I love slack.

396
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,120
I love it.

397
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,360
Do you want slack?

398
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,400
I want it.

399
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,520
Do you need slack?

400
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,460
I need it.

401
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,740
Do you like niggi?

402
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,160
No.

403
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,540
How about nanini?

404
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,240
No.

405
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,900
What about noo-noo?

406
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,360
No.

407
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,740
Look out for Shagadisma.

408
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,560
Get down from the roof.

409
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:37,560


410
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,480
Okay.

411
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,700
I'm Pastor Buck Naked, and I'm sitting right here now with Dr. Chaos,

412
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:50,760
Table Football League coach, head coach of the, what is it, Chaos City Crushers.

413
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,700
All right.

414
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,100
Well, the Crushers didn't get to play this time.

415
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,840
The DeSau Destroyers took their place.

416
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,960
And, Doc, I guess you got the standings, do you?

417
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,580
Let's hear it.

418
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,700
I got them.

419
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,880
Okay.

420
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,500
This is the Feebarch standings, February and March.

421
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,700
Number one, Dallas Assassins, 12th career gold, always deadly.

422
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,940
Number two, Downtown Underground.

423
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,220
Three, Wazonian Doctors.

424
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,780
Four, Uptown Peace.

425
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,120
Five, Dr. Rudy Ray Moore.

426
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,360
And one of the Steve Gold, Mike.

427
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,560
And the Mavs.

428
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,420
Five, Know What's What.

429
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,840
Six, Dallas Assassins.

430
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,860
So come on over here and give up the game.

431
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:34,880


432
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Whip some scum on me, bitch.

433
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,420
Oh, give me all of your cash.

434
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,460
Return you wanted to whine about your soul.

435
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
Because when the exits come, you'll be right on my phone.

436
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,100
Dude, Doc's out in Malaysia.

437
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,800
We will go.

438
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,200
When you drink the cool, then I go home, home, home.

439
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,480
Yeah!

440
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,000
Now, I might be lying there with an ice pack on my nuts.

441
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,160
Or maybe I'll chase some other fine bucks.

442
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,600
But at least you won't have to wear machinery.

443
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,920
And you'll be free from the conspiracy.

444
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Play begins 9.30 sharp, Saturday, March 22nd.

445
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,220
And while you're wishing upon a star,

446
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,540
you'll probably lose me and some interstellar bar.

447
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,460
Come on, Cleve, that's your 17th bottle of night chain tonight.

448
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,120
Let's go home now before you pass out right here on the street.

449
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,680
Woman, I can drink more wine and stay sober

450
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,200
than all the heathen Hindus in Asia.

451
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,780
Yeah, I heard that before.

452
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,020
Get your popsicle sticks and let's get your damn...

453
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,960
Oh, yes, dear friends.

454
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,620
Ooh.

455
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,240
Well, yeah, that's right.

456
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,180
And if you don't pledge that mighty pledge, friends,

457
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,200
to KNON, when you call 823-7490,

458
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,500
why, that guest host, Chaos,

459
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,720
will come and give you the very kiss of chaos

460
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,580
at your very personal home.

461
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,980
Ooh.

462
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:53,340
The ear-splitting, grinding, mighty caress of the...

463
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,000
God almighty.

464
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,540
Well, friends, that's 823-8883.

465
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,760
Uh, 8...

466
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,140
823-8801.

467
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,640
8801.

468
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,300
That's when...

469
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,980
That's when that time intersection starts to end, friends.

470
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,500
Oh.

471
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,340
Buck, I think you better read this newspaper article here while we...

472
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,680
I thought I was gonna talk about the Dick Army Corps.

473
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,180
Huh?

474
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,320
Oh, okay.

475
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,160
Hey.

476
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,920
Join the Dick Army Corps.

477
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,440
The Dick Army Corps wants you.

478
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,740
Extreme right-wing patri...

479
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,120
Patriot, psychotic...

480
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,940
Uh, political lifestyles...

481
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,160
Uh...

482
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,560
Not dead.

483
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,380
So...

484
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,800
Men, women, join the Dick Army Corps.

485
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,940
Dick!

486
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,860
Army!

487
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,860
Dick!

488
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,020
Army!

489
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,900
Dick!

490
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,980
Army!

491
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,000
Dick!

492
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,980
Army!

493
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,720
Dick!

494
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,800
Army!

495
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,800
Well, friends, that, uh, just before the, uh,

496
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,020
hilarious Dick Army Corps, we got the, uh...

497
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,920
That was, uh, Reverend Cleve Duncan doing Welcome to the End Times.

498
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,800
That's the first time we ever played that one on the air.

499
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,500
I had to specially censor that one.

500
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,680
Because, uh, Slackman...

501
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,120
Cleve was in town last...

502
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,920
This weekend.

503
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,720
And we were planning to have him on the show.

504
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,800
He's a great preacher.

505
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,660
And a lot of the...

506
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,980
The, uh...

507
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,640
The, uh...

508
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,080
Del Fuego's, uh...

509
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,480
Groupies out there were really hoping to hear Cleve preach.

510
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:17,940
Huh?

511
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,260
Nobody knows who they are.

512
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,360
Oh, you should have seen those normals, uh, in that great cattle pen at the Ritz Club.

513
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,600
Uh...

514
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:29,440
Wallowing in sameness, waiting to hear the Del Fuego's buck.

515
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,840
Reveling in their normalcy.

516
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,240
Huh?

517
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,280
You think any of them listen to KON?

518
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,780
They pro...

519
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah.

520
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,960
Yeah, sure.

521
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,980
I would hope so.

522
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,560
But they pro...

523
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,700
They're probably too normal to pledge.

524
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,160
You think they know who Dick Army is?

525
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,060
They're probably...

526
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,320
No.

527
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,140
That's North Dallas.

528
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,940
I don't think...

529
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,400
That's strictly the buck-naked section of town, I believe.

530
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:48,700
No, no.

531
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,380
No, the Dick Army Corps is up in Denton and Farmer's Branch.

532
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,640
If you live in Farmer's Branch, Dick Army is already your congressman.

533
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,200
And he may soon be your president.

534
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:56,840
Yeah.

535
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,540
Would you explain that?

536
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,680
Dick Army...

537
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,240
Dick Army is such a man that he lives in the gym.

538
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,240
He lives in the gym in the U.S. House of Representatives.

539
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm not kidding.

540
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,720
They had to throw him out bodily out of the gym.

541
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,380
Because he doesn't want to sleep in an apartment.

542
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,740
He wants to sleep in the gym with the men.

543
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,960
Okay.

544
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,120
Oh, yes.

545
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Well, friends, it's...

546
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,980
I'm not kidding.

547
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,420
These are X-rated church hymns.

548
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,380
We're spreading.

549
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,080
Yeah.

550
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah.

551
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,460
Let's see.

552
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,860
I remember when I was 16.

553
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,940
Sure, we'll never forget that.

554
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,180
It was a great TV movie.

555
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,900
The 60s were burned on our brain.

556
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,480
Those engrams were branded on those tiny, multiple-minded fissures and fractures in the old...

557
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,420
Why don't you ask about the 70s, Nebio?

558
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,820
We had some fun in the 70s.

559
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,560
Yeah, the 60s didn't really start happening until the 70s.

560
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,860
And then the 70s never happened.

561
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,620
And so then the 80s had to come along.

562
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,160
Yeah, but they just all repeated themselves and were the same thing.

563
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,180
Well, we often repeat ourselves.

564
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,840
It's that same old thing that makes a tomcat scream all night.

565
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,440
Just like Howard Hughes.

566
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,520
With all his billions.

567
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,720
And he still lies without one thin dime in his skeletonous hand.

568
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,600
Or Beau Pham Hughes, who spins every cent he gets.

569
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,220
How do you feel about that, caller?

570
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,640
In the midst of life, we are in jazz.

571
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,880
We're so laid back, we can't even see us.

572
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,520
Only front end.

573
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,560
This can be prevented by removing the heart, like so.

574
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,260
Ow!

575
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,280
I'm sorry, that's just not the way it is.

576
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,040
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about? You're on the air.

577
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,960
Okay, hello, you're on the air.

578
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,680
Thank you, guys.

579
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,820
This morning, you were...

580
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,400
You woke me from a terrible dream.

581
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,420
There are few areas, indeed, that are entirely free from the devious influence of our sworn enemies.

582
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,180
Case in point, this caller who just dialed in.

583
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,460
Dobbs has recently suggested to us that TVs emit non-detectable F-rays,

584
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,060
which mysteriously fuse brain cells into predetermined patterns that then control the individual's behavior.

585
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,300
It is yet to be ascertained whether these emissions are con or exist in origin.

586
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,220
Yes.

587
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,080
Exercise your corpus callosum, caller.

588
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,100
Hello, right side?

589
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,580
Hello, left side?

590
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:19,240
Well, now, if your right brain is all hooked up and your left brain hasn't been left, if you catch my meaning, you ought to be able to copy the letter M in a mirror.

591
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,060
Go ahead.

592
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,700
Okay.

593
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,800
Take this simple test.

594
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,040
Okay, well, I'll have to get all that white powder off the mirror in front of me so I can...

595
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,340
Please.

596
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,480
Isn't it true?

597
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,260
Yeah.

598
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,500
Okay.

599
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,620
Well, Guy, you're plugged directly into the show here.

600
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,740
And you can see the Hushpoo Wizard in the background.

601
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,340
Yeah, Guy.

602
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,640
The most important...

603
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,680
...inside joke is...

604
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,280
Fear not.

605
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,940
I do not accuse you of common...

606
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:48,140
We can't seem to get away from the strange creatures that invade our airways, friends.

607
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,580
It's the KPFHO from Berkeley, California.

608
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,580
The puzzling evidence, Hal Robinson...

609
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
And friends...

610
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,360
It's getting pretty violent around here, I'm afraid.

611
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,240
This is KNON 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

612
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,340
But it won't be much longer.

613
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,620
It will be another insidious tool of the conspiracy, friends.

614
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,540
The conspiracy that controls your very mind, or what's left of it.

615
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,560
If you have ever had anything...

616
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,620
Well, you do, but you just gotta...

617
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,400
You gotta jump on it.

618
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,180
There's nobody by that name here.

619
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,980
Ivan?

620
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,000
Hm?

621
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,480
I think we got a call, Ivan.

622
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,220
I think that's just the...

623
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,680
Oh, really?

624
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,700
Do we have the...

625
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,120
The fated call from...

626
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,740
Let's see now.

627
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,400
I'll...

628
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,880
We're expecting a call from Little Rock, friends.

629
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,160
Alright.

630
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,340
And I...

631
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,960
His miscellaneous dial, don't I?

632
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,600
Hit on.

633
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,580
On?

634
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,460
Yup.

635
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,440
On.

636
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,000
Ah, yes.

637
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,420
And hit this.

638
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,740
And put your phone down.

639
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,000
Hello?

640
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,620
Put the phone down.

641
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,240
Hello?

642
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,680
Hello?

643
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,080
Ah, yes.

644
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,320
Hello.

645
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:50,980
Hello, can we hear you?

646
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,660
Hello?

647
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,520
I can hear you.

648
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,100
Try to talk to Doug Smith.

649
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,160
No, there's...

650
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,500
Who...

651
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,920
Who are you trying to talk to?

652
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,500
Do you want to talk to Ivan Stang?

653
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,020
I've never heard of that guy.

654
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,180
Oh, I guess you're right.

655
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,280
It is Ivan Stang.

656
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,660
Hey, look.

657
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:10,660
We're cutting you off unless you're ready to pledge a goodly amount to K-N-O-N, dear friend.

658
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,860
What does he say?

659
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,060
What's the decision?

660
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,620
You know, Doug, I was...

661
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:24,500
I mean, Ivan, I was just reading in the paper the other day how the Reverend Ike had 90 Cadillacs and Bob only had 89.

662
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,300
And I just thought that was the most insidious...

663
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,420
Yeah, but Bob just brought out those Rolls Royces from the commune in Oregon.

664
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,000
So even though Bob has less Cadillacs, he has more Rolls Royces than Reverend Ike.

665
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,340
Oh, wow.

666
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,020
Isn't it that way?

667
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,980
That...

668
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,820
That really makes me feel a lot better.

669
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,680
I was gonna pledge a million dollars.

670
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,120
I was so worried about it.

671
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,720
But since you told me that, I guess I'll just save my money.

672
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,520
Oh, no, no.

673
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,520
Go ahead, sir.

674
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,760
That million dollars would come in real handy here for the home for slackless children.

675
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,220
And also, K-N-O-N might get a new building, too.

676
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,660
Well, what about the research facilities in the commune?

677
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,520
We have the K-N-O-N tower here.

678
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,680
The research facilities in Dobstown, friend...

679
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,000
Now, you know, if we don't get a million...

680
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
It's not just a million dollars we need.

681
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,800
It's a million five hundred.

682
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:21,580
And if you're just pledging a million, I mean, I don't know what kind of an afterlife you're planning to get out of this whole thing.

683
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,600
I mean, are you trying to be a pretty boy or what?

684
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,600
Well, I could pledge a million four hundred and ninety-nine if you think that you're...

685
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,460
But he won't deliver.

686
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,840
I can whiff this guy.

687
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,340
He's a fake.

688
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,320
Hold on.

689
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,800
No...

690
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,520
Hello?

691
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,880
I just cut him off.

692
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,360
You did?

693
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:35,920
Yeah.

694
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
Well, thanks, Jayner.

695
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,860
I'm sorry, but, uh...

696
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,720
That was Jayner?

697
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, that was Jayner, Buck.

698
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,300
Oh, hell no.

699
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,880
Thanks a lot.

700
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,400
Well, friends, we're gonna head on out into the, uh...

701
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,320
It was a fake, folks.

702
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,040
It was a fake.

703
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,620
You see your last flame, Saucer.

704
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,060
The last thing I seen was here Sunday week, is on the wheat field.

705
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,340
In the wheat field.

706
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,560
Isn't that a little unusual?

707
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,880
No, I think they must feed off wheat or something.

708
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,800
Well, the little green man's name was Real Head Cat.

709
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,920
Rockin' and a-rollin' through the crazy flats.

710
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,060
Brought out a sax and it started to flow.

711
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,240
Brought out the drums and it started to roll.

712
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,340
Blind Saucer, rock and roll.

713
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,400
Blind Saucer, rock and roll.

714
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,180
I couldn't understand it.

715
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,640
A big head said it was a great deal.

716
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,100
The fans had beat it just to stop Mid-Dent Joe.

717
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,620
Thanks for waiting and go right ahead.

718
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,900
Yeah, I'm calling from Glenrose.

719
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,900
I talked to these two a couple of months ago about some cattle mutilation.

720
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,800
Yeah, you were the farmer, right?

721
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,360
Right.

722
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,820
I raise cattle and I told you all about the mutilation.

723
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,520
It's also a big, good idea if I sent some money in.

724
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,540
Might give me an edge.

725
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,480
Yeah, right.

726
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,240
Well, we've had another one down here.

727
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,000
Another?

728
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,180
Another cattle mutilation.

729
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,860
How much money did you send in?

730
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,000
Well, that's the problem.

731
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,480
I never got around to sending some money in.

732
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:15,380
Well, that's why, well, we can't, we don't have that much to do with cattle mutilation,

733
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,620
but we can help put you on the alert to who might be doing it.

734
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,760
And how to watch out for them.

735
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,040
Yeah, we, that whole situation with the cattle mutilations is pretty spooky.

736
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,540
Not very many people know about it.

737
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,860
Listen, you need to stop.

738
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,660
I mean, I've been to New York and they said, oh, two blacks had their heart, and I said,

739
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,180
I know some doctors and surgeons can't cut a heart out.

740
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:47,020
But, I mean, where, I mean, where were you just a few days ago when some horses came

741
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,200
up in Arizona and Wyoming with their hearts missing?

742
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,920
Six thousand sheep just fell dead out there in Utah, and this government made it look

743
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,940
like they didn't know what it was.

744
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,360
Well, it wasn't the visitors, they had to admit they ain't dead there.

745
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,420
That whole game.

746
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,280
Well, I still want me a Nobel Prize.

747
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:22,880
And the reason I want it, there's a lot of people in America that have Nobel Prizes,

748
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,500
but there's five white boys in particular that decided that their Nobel Prize had made

749
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,700
their sperms different.

750
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,980
So they decided to put their sperms in a sperm bank.

751
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,800
Well, that's why I wants me a Nobel Prize.

752
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,240
Let's go.

753
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,920
One, two, three, four.

754
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,100
.

755
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,540
.

756
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,120
.

757
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,120


758
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,200
.

759
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,360
.

760
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,700
.

761
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:55,760
.

762
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:55,780
.

763
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:55,840
.

764
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:55,940
.

765
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:56,720
.

766
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:56,800
.

767
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:56,880
.

768
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:56,920
.

769
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,660
.

770
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,200
.

771
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,220
.

772
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


773
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


774
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


775
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


776
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


777
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,220


778
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,240
.

779
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,260
.

780
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,260


781
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,260


782
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,720
.

783
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:13,820
.

784
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,840
don't make me say things

785
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,040
don't make me say things

786
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,080
you don't want to be

787
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,040
you don't want to be

788
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,120
don't make me say things

789
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,660
they say

790
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:34,000
you can be anything

791
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,460
this time around

792
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,420
we had six million

793
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,060
and 432,000 incarnations as lower forms of life,

794
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,260
where you got to be a human being.

795
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,100
And then you got 200,000 incarnations as a human being,

796
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,080
where you grab that brass ring in the center

797
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,900
and can say, as I'm telling you right now,

798
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,020
I can be anything this time around.

799
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,660
You can goof with this time around.

800
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,480
You can get hung up on that power trip,

801
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,980
chase money, competition, success.

802
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,700
You've done that before.

803
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,540
You're not going to do that again this time around.

804
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,160
You can be anyone this time around.

805
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,460
You can be anyone.

806
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:40,460


807
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
You can do anything this time around.

808
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,080
You're God, baby, and it's your reality.

809
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,100
It all comes from you this time around.

810
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,980
Make it a good trip this time around.

811
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,200
Make it a love trip this time around.

812
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,280
I know you won't goof with this time around.

813
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,300
This is the moment.

814
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,300


815
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,300


816
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,460
We're on a date tonight.

817
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,280
We didn't, yeah, he was a patriot.

818
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,740
We didn't say, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, we're on the air, we're on the air, we're on the air.

819
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,640
We're arguing about the Dick Army Corps, friends.

820
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,600
You know, Dick Army is your congressman if you live in Farmer's Branch, if you live in Denton and so on,

821
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,380
and hey, it's a free country.

822
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,120
I think everybody should vote for Dick Army.

823
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,200
So therefore, Dick Army's got my vote, and I'm the Dick Army Corps.

824
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,040
Well, friends, but what about you?

825
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,920
But what about you?

826
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,860
What about 823-7490 and that pledge, friends, for $20?

827
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,460
And I know that you have a...

828
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:47,680
This is not going to Dick Army Corps.

829
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,780
For $20, you can get that bumper sticker, friends.

830
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,960
All right, if somebody calls me right now, I'll stop talking about the Dick Army Corps.

831
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,580
How about that?

832
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,300
I'll stop talking about the Dick Army Corps before you light one up.

833
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:03,980
If you can kill Buck, friends, you can kill Buck by pledging $30.

834
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,900
That gets you a T-shirt, a bumper sticker, and an axe handle.

835
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,820
I'm leaving. I'm sleeping.

836
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,120
I'm kidding, Buck.

837
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
I'm mystery. I'm out of here.

838
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,500
Now, look.

839
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,940
Here we...

840
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,240
Whoops.

841
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,920
I like Dick Army.

842
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,640
I love the man.

843
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,320
I admire him more than President Reagan.

844
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,460
Before he came along, I didn't know what the true meaning of Dick Army was.

845
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,660
God bless the president.

846
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,280
God bless the president.

847
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Did you hear the president on earlier?

848
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,920
We had the president on the show.

849
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,760
The president, really?

850
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,560
Yeah.

851
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,320
How sexy.

852
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,320
He's sexy.

853
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,020
That man is a true star.

854
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,340
He's stud looking at him.

855
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:45,480
I mean, you ever see the pictures of him as a nude model, a semi-nude model when he was a young guy?

856
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,780
He was about 20.

857
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,440
Hey, are we still on the air?

858
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,180
Sexy.

859
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,760
I hope so.

860
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,400
Yeah.

861
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,560
See, the voice of me is moving.

862
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,020
Okay.

863
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,540
Somebody tune this radio.

864
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,460
Please tune that radio there.

865
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,120
And just leave it recording.

866
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,580
Call for Reverend Stang.

867
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
Call for Reverend Stang, please.

868
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,360
Let's get straight here.

869
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,220
We're talking about the unique section of Dallas Times Herald.

870
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,900
That's right.

871
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,300
Sexy.

872
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:16,000
And that's a funny, considering the subject matter of this particular, we're talking about the newspaper.

873
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,840
Let me see.

874
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,220
Hold on a second.

875
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,480
Let me see.

876
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,060
The 8237490 is open right now.

877
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,560
Pledge now.

878
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,200
Go ahead.

879
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,740
Okay.

880
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,860
And thank you for the pledges so far, friends.

881
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,940
You may be able to impress Kano and enough that we have a listenership that we stay on the air.

882
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,140
Now, as for this unique section, friends, this morning, if you open one of your newspapers,

883
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,840
you'll find this article about parents.

884
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,280
And punkers, which had some pretty incredible quotes in it.

885
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:52,240
To begin with it, they were talking about how the parents of punkers should realize their kids will outgrow the punk stage.

886
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,680
And that's the saddest thing about it, friends.

887
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,340
They will outgrow the punk stage.

888
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:05,440
They'll outgrow the politics of the punk stage, but maintain their fashions and hairstyles until they're 33 or 34.

889
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,540
But by then, they'll have to.

890
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,100
Or else they won't be able to get a job.

891
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:09,660
Yes.

892
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,000
But consider the fate of the burned-out freaks of the 60s.

893
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,080
Now, they still listen to their car radios all the time.

894
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,540
Well, that's not true at all.

895
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,360
I'm one of the burned-out freaks from the 60s.

896
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,680
And I don't look like a normal businessman.

897
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,480
No, you're an intellectual.

898
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
You were always an intellectual.

899
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,640
You were always a rebel, Stang.

900
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,840
I'm about the real burned-out freaks.

901
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,640
The guys that still have long hair and they still listen to the too loud stuff.

902
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,460
Okay, you're right.

903
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,420
Well, that's what I'm saying.

904
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,180
Is that there's...

905
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:47,740
Okay, there was those who became hippies or who now become punks because they were true weirdos.

906
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,780
But what about the Dick Army Corps?

907
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,100
It was their only hope for getting some.

908
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,360
Friends, Buck ain't gonna shut up about the Dick Army Corps unless you pledge.

909
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,400
That's 8237-490...

910
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,340
Oh, we got a pledge I'm gonna shut up now.

911
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,060
I've had it.

912
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,320
No more Dick Army all night.

913
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,280
Can I talk about it?

914
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,200
No.

915
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,300
No, no.

916
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,260
That's enough Dick Army, man.

917
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,880
That's enough.

918
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,160
That's enough.

919
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


920
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


921
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


922
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


923
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


924
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


925
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


926
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,160


927
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,160
If he starts talking about it, I'm gonna turn a tape on, okay?

928
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,880
This is my...

929
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,460
This is the King Stang Hour.

930
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,780
As long as I'm the only one who can...

931
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,020
Get him!

932
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:17,720
Get him!

933
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,620
Get him!

934
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,240
Oh, something, you guys.

935
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,860
Anyway, Janet says her punk clothes, and she wears only black, are a form of being her own person

936
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,820
and don't interfere with her interests at school.

937
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:37,160
The problem is, friends, now I know 375 people who look exactly like this punk girl pictured on the cover.

938
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,960
She says she's doing it to be different.

939
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,560
And yet her daddy, if you look further down the article, doesn't want her to be too weird.

940
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,080
And she agrees that she doesn't want to be too weird.

941
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,740
Are we getting...

942
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,480
She's getting weird.

943
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,120
Oh, okay.

944
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,840
Can I make a comment?

945
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,720
Yeah, go ahead.

946
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,140
I think her mom looks cooler than she does.

947
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,120
Hey, I was about to say the same thing.

948
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,460
Look at that, man.

949
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,620
I mean, that's my kind of woman.

950
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,420
No kidding.

951
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,260
Man, that is sexy.

952
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:03,780
She's a different...

953
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,400
She's a real sexy.

954
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,780
That's a real woman.

955
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,160
The more you look at it, the more you get it.

956
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,160


957
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,160


958
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,220
I say she's a desert cutie.

959
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,100
A desert cutie.

960
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,360
She does look like a cat.

961
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,400
Yeah, Santa Fe.

962
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,360
Yeah.

963
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,220
Okay.

964
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
That's more than my dreams.

965
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,540
Friends, if you don't send that money, we're going to give up.

966
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,620
Conspiracy style.

967
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,540
8-2-3-8-8-0-1.

968
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,540
Light that sucker up.

969
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,180
We want it on top.

970
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,260
Oh, thank you.

971
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,700
Thank you.

972
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,360
Thank you, Bob.

973
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,540
Oh, thank you.

974
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,860
They're lighting up good.

975
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,840
Oh, yes, friends.

976
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,660
Hold on.

977
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,200
Hold the line.

978
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,300
There is hope for this planet.

979
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,700
There seems to be some remnant of hope as long as these people can keep finally.

980
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,400
Please join our prayer family.

981
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,700
Yeah, you can hear them.

982
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,300
Please join our prayer family and send money to KNON.

983
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,140
Now, dear friends.

984
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,300
Let's give the address over the air just once, just for the heck of it.

985
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,740
Please do.

986
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:04,700
KNON Community Radio, Department 139, P.O. Box 141-199.

987
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,020
That's a pretty Bobby number.

988
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,440
Dallas, Texas 75214.

989
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,080
That's it, dear friends.

990
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,380
We don't need to ask for names.

991
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,380
All the lines are lit up.

992
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,880
All the lines are lit up.

993
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:22,660
This is the Swinging Love Corps is doing their beautiful rendition of Deadly Swill.

994
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,760
The

995
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,960
contemplative

996
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,720
It's back to the 60s with the Swimming Love Corpses, friends.

997
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Yes, and Tim Leary.

998
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,960
And back to the punk.

999
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,780
You see, one of these days, folks.

1000
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
Yeah, we've been in the punk.

1001
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:22,040
One of these days, friends, what you punks have to realize is that the same thing is going to happen if your world-saving new order has happened to the hippie world order of my day,

1002
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,800
which is that the conspiracy already owns it, friends.

1003
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,260
But what about the beatniks of the 1950s?

1004
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,200
They were the conforming nonconformists.

1005
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,020
The beatniks?

1006
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,280
They became the conforming nonconformists.

1007
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,960
Then the freaks burned out.

1008
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,280
And then the me generation became the us generation.

1009
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,860
Everybody sold out, you know?

1010
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,460
Everybody.

1011
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:49,340
And then don't you realize that pretty soon everybody will be in the dick army course.

1012
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,480
It won't matter anymore because we'll all be one people.

1013
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:51,980
One America.

1014
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,240
One movement.

1015
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:10,200
One army to take over the world, to slay the dragons that threaten us, to finally stop the menace of creeping socialism and creeping individualism and creeping immorality.

1016
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,780
Because immorality is subjective.

1017
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Remember that, friends.

1018
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,600
Immorality belongs to you and all your friends.

1019
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,140
And I want you to go out and tell the world that we're just going to live from now on.

1020
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,780
Dick army.

1021
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:34,280
You can tell the world by calling KNO and pledging your $20, $30, $40, or $1 million at 823-7490, 823-8801, or 823-8883.

1022
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,960
Now, friends, and if you don't, you know what's going to happen?

1023
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,100
Your music is going to become shopping center music.

1024
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,720
That's right.

1025
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,940
Your favorite punk hits are going to end up sounding like this.

1026
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,800
Well, maybe not like that.

1027
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,020
Maybe.

1028
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,700
Maybe like, hey, what happened, man?

1029
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,800
Huh.

1030
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,160
Huh.

1031
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,160


1032
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,660
Right now.

1033
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,840
Ha, ha, ha.

1034
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,980
I am an antichrist.

1035
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,200
I am an anarchist.

1036
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,320
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it.

1037
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:34,300
I want to destroy passes by, because I want to be anarchy.

1038
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,300
No dogs, buddy.

1039
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,280
Anarchy for the UK.

1040
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,580
It's coming sometime, maybe.

1041
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,060
Give the wrong time, stop a traffic light.

1042
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:07,260
Your future dream is a shopping scheme, because I want to be anarchy.

1043
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,120
Here's a break, boys.

1044
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,700
Here's a break, boys.

1045
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,220
Here's a break, boys.

1046
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,300
Here's a break, boys.

1047
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,660
Here's a break, boys.

1048
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,100
Give me that oafish ho Nos symbols, girl.

1049
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,100
I'll be there any minute

1050
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,100


1051
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,460
No, not that.

1052
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:43,460


1053
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:43,460


1054
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:43,460


1055
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:43,860
Oh yeah, I gotta think about those things.

1056
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


1057
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


1058
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:43,860


1059
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:50,640
You want me to help me?

1060
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:59,000
I want to be anarchy.

1061
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,580
Oh, yes, friends.

1062
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,020
That's the swinging erudites doing Anarchy in the UK.

1063
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,240
That's going to be, they'll play that in Skaggs in about the year 1998.

1064
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,740
You know, if you don't be pledging that money, friends,

1065
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,660
it's just 823-7490, KNOM, that's right.

1066
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,640
And I'm serious.

1067
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,260
It could be the end of free radio in Dallas.

1068
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,500
Free Dallas, that's what I say.

1069
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:39,380
But, friends, I'm talking about the fads that pass and go,

1070
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,780
you know, that everybody thinks is going to save the world

1071
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,040
and then they turn out to be idiocy.

1072
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,360
They turn out to be.

1073
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,080
A commodity, friends.

1074
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,900
What will my kids have to do to freak me out?

1075
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,440
One more time.

1076
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,960
What will the, I've got a little boy

1077
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,440
who's going to be in the graduating class of 1998.

1078
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,120
I can't follow your sign language.

1079
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,720
We have a caller.

1080
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:09,680
Oh, okay.

1081
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,300
That's a good idea.

1082
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,060
Let's try a caller real quick.

1083
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,140
Before I tell you what's going to happen.

1084
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,220
This one on off, right?

1085
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:16,840
Yep.

1086
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,480
Yep.

1087
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,500
Hello, dear friend.

1088
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,760
Reverend Stank.

1089
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,160
Yes.

1090
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,940
How's it going?

1091
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,600
We're barely alive, but the slack will be forthcoming

1092
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,180
as soon as I get off the air.

1093
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,480
Great.

1094
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,660
As soon as you send, have you sent your money?

1095
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,260
Well, I was planning on pledging some money,

1096
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,740
but I've got a stipulation here.

1097
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,320
Uh-huh.

1098
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:36,960
Okay.

1099
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,480
Now, you know Reverend Buck, right?

1100
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,280
Yes.

1101
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:39,980
Okay.

1102
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,880
I'm afraid so.

1103
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,300
We're going to have to get Reverend Buck

1104
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,960
to stop talking about his khaki shirts and the Dick Army Corps.

1105
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,180
It's like, I have decided that I'm going to give $98.

1106
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,220
Me and this friend of mine named Darryl DeBuzz, right?

1107
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,700
Yeah.

1108
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,180
We have decided that we will give $98 a week

1109
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,520
for the rest of our lives in addition to our left gonad

1110
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,880
if we can get Reverend Buck to shut up.

1111
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,460
You guys, you said your left gonad

1112
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,260
as if you both of you only had one between you.

1113
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,080
That's right.

1114
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,900
The one left one.

1115
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,200
Oh, God, that's quite a sacrifice.

1116
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,460
No wonder he said left gonad.

1117
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,720
This man is a leftist.

1118
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,120
I'll tell you what, guy.

1119
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,320
When you send your check,

1120
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,040
I'll stop talking about the Dick Army Corps.

1121
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:22,860
But for now,

1122
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,940
Dick Army!

1123
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,840
Dick Army!

1124
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,660
Dick Army!

1125
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,460
I command this radio station.

1126
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,940
I command you in the name of the power of Bob Dobbs,

1127
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,980
be gone demon.

1128
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:36,820
What?

1129
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,160
I hate that old demon.

1130
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,120
That demon got to my mistress,

1131
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,500
left her in the car with the motor running

1132
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,140
and ate sleeping pills in her.

1133
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:46,820
No, no, no.

1134
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,180
I hate that old demon.

1135
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,060
That demon.

1136
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,380
I brought to buy shoes for the children.

1137
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,860
Go ahead and put another tape on.

1138
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,240
I went to buy shoes for the children.

1139
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,040
And the demon got to me

1140
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,080
and he put me into a strain in his mind.

1141
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,240
And I woke up and the shoes was gone

1142
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,000
and there was three empty liquor bottles

1143
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,080
in the backseat of the car

1144
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,220
and the shoes was stolen.

1145
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,600
And I hate that old demon.

1146
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,040
Friends, it's bad.

1147
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,500
It's mighty bad.

1148
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,880
There's demons everywhere

1149
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,720
and there's only one demon.

1150
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:17,720


1151
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,360
There's only one way to get that demon out

1152
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,780
and that's to pay him to leave.

1153
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,160
The number to call,

1154
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:24,520
823-8801.

1155
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,200
It's open now.

1156
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,860
Please fill that sucker up.

1157
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,060
Yeah, right now there's nobody

1158
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,380
has called in to pledge

1159
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,380
and these are serious.

1160
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,420
This is quite serious, friend.

1161
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,920
I ain't going to put any more colors on right now.

1162
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,640
Friends, like I said,

1163
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,380
I was worried about

1164
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,780
what are kids in the future

1165
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,720
going to try to do to freak us out?

1166
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,240
You know, what are they going to do

1167
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,260
to freak me out?

1168
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,580
It's going to take a lot.

1169
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,520
And if we, friends,

1170
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,660
if you look to your concordance

1171
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,100
of the Book of the Subgenius,

1172
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,380
Dateline for Dominance,

1173
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,160
check out these predictions of Dobbs.

1174
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,900
We'll see what Dobbs has to say

1175
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,280
about the coming end times.

1176
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,720
Now, for the year 1995,

1177
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,920
we find a reference to teenage,

1178
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,920
it says marijuana still not legalized,

1179
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,620
a teenage, it says,

1180
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,200
extreme back-to-nature movement

1181
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,220
among teenagers.

1182
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,440
Friends, reversion to animal behavior,

1183
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,140
urinating in public

1184
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,880
to mark off territorial boundaries,

1185
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,600
sniffing for identification like dogs,

1186
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,180
mating rituals, and so forth,

1187
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,400
as if we didn't already have mating rituals, right?

1188
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:41,680
And the broomstick worn in the nether areas

1189
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,020
becomes a major teen fashion craze.

1190
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,680
Rich kids stick that broomstick

1191
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,340
in, hang heavy jewelry from them.

1192
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,840
Poor kids hang heavy things.

1193
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,820
This is our future teenagers, friends.

1194
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,480
And if we turn furthermore

1195
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,820
to Prescriptures 41 and 42,

1196
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,120
I believe it is,

1197
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,720
and I assume you'll be reading along with me, friends.

1198
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,200
He says,

1199
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,200
There shall be in the end hours

1200
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,760
wonders in the sky.

1201
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,000
The living spirit of Negi

1202
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,680
will be upon thy sons and daughters

1203
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,000
who shall fall down,

1204
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,560
your young men shall see visions,

1205
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,260
and thine old men shall take drugs

1206
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,280
and shall dump.

1207
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,460
I will be upon thy women

1208
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,460
which shall bear rotten fruit

1209
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,160
of their wombs.

1210
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,360
Men shall rave in the streets,

1211
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,440
speaking in tongues and prophesying,

1212
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,700
for thou hast besmeared

1213
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,060
the name of my son,

1214
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,880
and therefore ye shall not die

1215
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,960
when most fervently thou desireth death.

1216
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,720
Nyahaha!

1217
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,900
I, Jehovah One, thy God,

1218
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,240
shall laugh at thee.

1219
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,220
Now, friends,

1220
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,620
these are grim predictions for the future.

1221
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,500
And another one here,

1222
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,440
Though thy oils and petroleum fail thee,

1223
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,620
these my children shall possess it

1224
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,700
and keep it from thee,

1225
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,420
but they shall spread their elixirs

1226
00:50:58,420 --> 00:50:59,840
and medicines of the secret

1227
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,360
and shall sell them unto thee

1228
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
and unto thy children

1229
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,660
and thy children's children

1230
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,140
and shall curse thee

1231
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,240
through their drunkenness,

1232
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,360
for they are drunk with the food of the gods

1233
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,620
and none may raise them from their stupor.

1234
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,060
Friends, and that beautiful lyrical poetry

1235
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,980
of the prescription,

1236
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:17,420
which I think is a great example

1237
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:17,420


1238
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,260
refers to your failure

1239
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,680
to pledge at least a tenth part

1240
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,860
of your savings of this week to K-N-O-N.

1241
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,720
Because, I mean,

1242
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,420
you know, the devil weighs your worth

1243
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,440
in cash, money spent, friends.

1244
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,760
And if you've been spending money

1245
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
for heavenly things like K-N-O-N,

1246
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,580
keeping freedom on the air, why,

1247
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,620
you'll get to go to subgenius hell.

1248
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,220
And that's so much better.

1249
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,860
It's so much better than most of the other heavens, friends.

1250
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,160
Big joke.

1251
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,960
You think it's a big joke, don't you?

1252
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,720
Well, we're coming up on,

1253
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,400
God, look at this, the ghostly radio station.

1254
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,680
I don't understand it.

1255
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,280
This is the people's temple.

1256
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,120
The Pope of Chicago, Michael Flores, did this song.

1257
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,480
This is called Day of the Exist.

1258
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:25,220
And I'm willing to do aba-ly-haded

1259
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:25,220


1260
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,000
Well, yeah.

1261
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:39,840
Like I, like I'm 120 years old.

1262
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,140
I know, and produto positive.

1263
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:43,440
You know, somebody was talking

1264
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:43,540
about Atlantis up a mountain in India l Peace.

1265
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,300
I don't like people's

1266
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:45,300


1267
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,180
Can you tell me what that is up above?

1268
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,660
Have the exes finally come?

1269
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,740
I think it's the end, my friend.

1270
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,700
Here's where the nightmare begins.

1271
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,160
You have no right to take my life.

1272
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:20,680
You have no right to change my life.

1273
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:24,340
Come on down here and fight, space man.

1274
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,120
Well, I wanted E.T. or the Space Brothers.

1275
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:43,940
Tell me how to survive.

1276
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,200
But the aliens have...

1277
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,440
come from hell up above.

1278
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,120
And the world is about to die.

1279
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,280
I gotta drive.

1280
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,600
I gotta drive.

1281
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,820
I gotta make sure.

1282
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:07,080
I gotta make sure somebody survives.

1283
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,820
I gotta drive.

1284
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,680
As the song was sung,

1285
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,740
the movement of a curtain,

1286
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,680
a pen drops to the floor,

1287
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,080
a puff of smoke,

1288
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,200
a bell chimed,

1289
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,840
A thing just came through the door

1290
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,040
You had no right spaceman

1291
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,260
To fly by and scare me

1292
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,420
On this dark and lonely night

1293
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,420
Come on down here and talk

1294
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,640
Or we'll knock your ship out of the sky

1295
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,520
And we'll make you cry

1296
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:46,720
And we'll make you cry

1297
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,160
Eric Hosek, yes

1298
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,340
He made it, he broke his way into the station, friend, just to tell you that

1299
00:55:52,340 --> 00:56:00,700
And if you don't send that phone call to 823-8801-823-8883

1300
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,380
Or 823-7490

1301
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,520
Then we're gonna kill this young man

1302
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,600
But we won't do it on the air

1303
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,940
If you pay us enough money, we will sacrifice

1304
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:16,120
A living sacrifice to Wotan, Odin, Ra, Jehovah One

1305
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,200
Whatever you want to call it

1306
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,220
Whatever it is that likes to watch humans suffer

1307
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,680
Why, we're gonna offer up this young man

1308
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,040
As a living sacrifice

1309
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,060
And the next week after that, another one, so

1310
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,700
I want everybody who knows the sound of my voice

1311
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,240
To call this station and give them all the money you have

1312
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,120
Yeah, why not?

1313
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,160
And why stop at money, friends?

1314
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,080
Why not send your furniture, your house

1315
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,940
The deed to your, just not the whole house

1316
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,700
I mean, that's absurd, that's ridiculous

1317
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,500
What we mean is, you know, the deed to your house

1318
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,920
Your voter's card, your registration card

1319
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,820
Your library card, your credit cards

1320
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,520
And if not, if nothing else

1321
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:02,240
At least you can spare, you can spare 50 bucks

1322
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,660
I mean, there's some affluent

1323
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:07,040
I don't know what's out there

1324
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,780
Probably some of them are true subgeniuses

1325
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,040
But let's see if, it's that, we gotta do it, friends

1326
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,180
We gotta do it

1327
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,660
We're dead

1328
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,760
Howdy, friends, I'm Lord Jim Cravington

1329
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,700
From Medieval Motors, your friendly truck stop

1330
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,580
Of transportation in the Diet of Words

1331
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,600
Friends, whether you're in the body or at the lunch

1332
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,740
We've got the Gryphon, the Minotaur

1333
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,340
Or the sporty little Camel Leopard

1334
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,260
To suit your imaginary travel needs

1335
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,380
And gosh, what can I say about these little guys

1336
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,480
Yes, it's your all-new cardboard Vampirettes

1337
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,860
The economy transport that's got them all guessing

1338
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,980
On the other side

1339
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,300
Well, we've got continents and peninsulas

1340
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,900
Of new and used transfigurations

1341
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,640
And a secret rose garden of perfect color

1342
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:45,740
And a great variety of unique values

1343
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,560
So get your ass in gear and your oxen in here

1344
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,220
So as we can trade indulgences and get you on your path

1345
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,080
Now, we're just a painful mile off the freeway of lost hope

1346
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,660
At the intersection of Down and Out Avenues

1347
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,380
In the Citadel of the Angel

1348
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,500
How you doing?

1349
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,060
A lot of the good old boys are here tonight

1350
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,820
We'd like to welcome you down to the television mission

1351
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,460
Don't forget, if all you can do is sit at home

1352
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,440
Then try to keep yourselves awake

1353
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,760
And dial the phone

1354
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,140
Call in for pledges

1355
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,480
Call in for pledges, yes

1356
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,580
We have a lot of our special beauties answering the phones this evening

1357
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,620
And the best thing you can do is dial this number that you see on your screen

1358
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,380
As quickly as you can

1359
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,720
With a contribution to the television mission

1360
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,560
Don't forget to call in a pledge

1361
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,720
Talk about Jesus

1362
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,700
Talk about Jesus

1363
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,980
Well, you never know who's gonna be here this evening

1364
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,080
We're waiting for you

1365
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,040
Yes, well, it's one

1366
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,000
I know you are, son

1367
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,900
I know it's one of the real positive qualities

1368
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,760
Of the television mission

1369
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,760
Is we just never know who's going to drop by

1370
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,280
I mean, it's a lot of folks have been

1371
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:51,940
The band is here

1372
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,940
The band is getting set up

1373
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:53,740
The band is ready

1374
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,760
The band is ready

1375
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,220
And I'm here to tell you that it's time, ladies and gentlemen

1376
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,580
I want you to hold down your applause as long as you can

1377
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,980
Because it's time you heard from Red, Greenback and the Blue Boys

1378
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,440
Don't forget to call

1379
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,880
The number's on your screen

1380
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,140
Then you suspended head on

1381
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:13,060
Then you suspended head on

1382
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:13,740
All of my day

1383
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,620
Your my life

1384
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:16,480
And RSVP

1385
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,160
spicier

1386
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,140
mean

1387
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,020
As my fathers pick up jokes

1388
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:51,300
And I went home and I pissed on the roof

1389
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,960
Why must I be your teenager on the roof?

1390
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,400
If I don't cut the shit, it's bright to see

1391
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,800
I'm gonna spend my life doing PCP

1392
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:23,540
Each night I hang around with a bunch of thugs

1393
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,940
Why must I be your teenager on the roof?

1394
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,700
My boss says next time I get thrown in jail

1395
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:50,040
I love my daddy, gotta throw no pound

1396
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,120
Each night I ask the stars up above

1397
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,940
Why must I be your teenager on the roof?

1398
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:56,940


1399
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:56,940


1400
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,960


1401
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960


1402
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960


1403
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960


1404
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,960


1405
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,960


1406
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:03,960


1407
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,960


1408
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,420
I wanna get wasted, I wanna get laid

1409
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,040
Eat up my gold, I'll drive to the Cape

1410
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,840
Don't get no results, I'm gonna go away

1411
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,480
I wanna get wasted, I wanna get laid

1412
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:34,940
Eat up my gold, I'll drive to the Cape

1413
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:34,940


1414
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,800
Next time, baby, two bucks

1415
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,920
And I might take the shit

1416
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,620
Oh, yeah

1417
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:47,500
Yes, dear friends, that was the Dogmatics

1418
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,720
with that beautiful song, Teenagers on Drugs,

1419
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,360
which ties up our, I guess that just sort of says it all.

1420
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,020
That's a band from Boston, and that's a really obscure record

1421
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,020
called Mr. Beautiful Presents All Hard.

1422
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:09,320
Friends, and this is Kano and the subgenius radio ministry,

1423
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,260
Hour of Slack, signing off.

1424
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:16,460
And I want you to make that one last pledge call, 823-7490.

1425
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:22,680
And even when you're listening to the Monday morning show coming up,

1426
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:28,140
when you pledge, say praise Bob and tell him you're pledging for the Hour of Slack anyway.

1427
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,660
Right, Norm?

1428
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,440
Sure.

1429
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,700
And then we'll just write it down and we'll make any difference anyway.

1430
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:38,120
And friends, if you really want to get your soul saved,

1431
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:49,420
just write for information from Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1432
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,820
Praise Bob.

1433
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,940
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

1434
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,220
Bob is a way of life to millions, yet half of them don't even know it.

1435
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:10,260
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how

1436
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:14,320
to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

1437
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,180
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

1438
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,000
Now see another dimension on your TV.

1439
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,040
Yes.

1440
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,640
Fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

1441
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,520
Become physically attractive overnight.

1442
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:38,300
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

1443
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,560
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior,

1444
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:51,700
to explore new ways of going over the edge and coming right back.

1445
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,000
Plus, people bring back toys you couldn't make it on your own.

1446
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,500
You give them.

1447
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:03,540
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormalities.

1448
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,480
To turn conspiracy and blinded personality disorders around.

1449
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:14,900
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

1450
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,300
Bob.

1451
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,020
Bob.

1452
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:17,960
Bob.

1453
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:19,680


1454
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,120
Bob.

1455
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:20,660
Bob.

1456
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,060
Bob.

1457
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,540
Bob.

1458
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:23,920
Bob.

1459
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,120
Bob.

1460
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,440
Bob.

1461
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,300
Bob.

1462
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:36,540
Bob.

1463
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:37,720


1464
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:38,980
Bob.

1465
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,540
Bob.

1466
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:40,820
Bob.

1467
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:41,760
Bob.

1468
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:41,980
Bob.

1469
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,360
Bob.

1470
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:42,400
Bob.

1471
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,140
Bob.

1472
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:45,920
Bob.

1473
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:46,320
Bob.

1474
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:46,860
Bob.

1475
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:46,860


1476
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:46,900
Bob.

1477
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:46,940
Bob.

1478
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:47,440
Bob.

1479
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,940
Bob.

1480
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:48,940


1481
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:48,980
Bob.

1482
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:49,060


1483
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:49,360
Bob.

1484
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:49,780
Bob.

1485
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:49,960
Bob.

1486
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:50,420
Oh, my God.

1487
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,920
Oh, my God.

1488
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,400
Oh, my God.

1489
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:28,080
Oh, my God.

1490
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,200
Oh, my God.

1491
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:20,660
Oh, my God.

1492
01:07:49,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Oh, my God.

1493
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,780
Oh, my God.

1494
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,060
Oh, my God.

1495
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:27,600
Oh, my God.

1496
01:09:49,960 --> 01:10:00,640
Oh, my God.

1497
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,060
Oh, my God.

1498
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,520
Oh, my God.

1499
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,340
Oh, my God.

1500
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,180
Oh, my God.

1501
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:15,620
Now you stay on the right side,

1502
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,620
and I'll stay on the left side.

1503
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,120
Now let's see this feeling.

1504
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:19,940
Oh, good.

1505
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,820
Now we're far enough away that hopefully you won't get whatever it is.

1506
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,300
I've got massive vitamin C here.

1507
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,340
This is silly.

1508
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,200
I've got a lot of vitamin C.

1509
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,680
I've got orange juice.

1510
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,540
I've got a brand-new box of Kleenex.

1511
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,700
I'm ready to stay here for as long as it takes.

1512
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,640
All right, now, people, what makes...

1513
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:36,760
Get on the phone.

1514
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,920
Get on them phones.

1515
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,440
What makes Kano work?

1516
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,820
What makes Kano in work?

1517
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,580
Obviously not the same thing that makes your mouth work.

1518
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:51,200
Okay, but the reason Kano in is on the air is because people like you that are listening,

1519
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:57,060
they care enough about Kano in, send us money, and make it possible for us to be on the air.

1520
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:58,960
It is time to...

1521
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,340
We only do this three times a year.

1522
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,000
Has it been three?

1523
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,260
Last time it was like this.

1524
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,380
First time we're doing it in 86.

1525
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,360
We had a goal of 60,000 last year.

1526
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,180
We hit 75.

1527
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:11,860
I mean, last pledge drive.

1528
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:13,520
We can do that again.

1529
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,480
We need to hit 2,000 during this show.

1530
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:16,560
We need...

1531
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,900
We need $40 and $50 pledges, okay?

1532
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,580
That's what we need.

1533
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,160
If all you can afford is $20, I understand.

1534
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,460
We need $40 and $50 pledges.

1535
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,220
If you can afford $10 a month, it's what I've been doing.

1536
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,980
Last pledge drive, I pledged $10 a month.

1537
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:30,540
I give them $10.

1538
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,440
I've already given them my March check, right?

1539
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:32,680
Yeah.

1540
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,040
Okay, I send them...

1541
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,380
You did that on the air as a matter of fact.

1542
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:35,600
Always.

1543
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,200
Always.

1544
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,700
I do that every month on the air.

1545
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,920
I have my million-dollar checks sitting right here.

1546
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:40,380
Yeah, well, get out of here.

1547
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,140
Okay, now.

1548
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:42,760
Okay.

1549
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:43,180
Now.

1550
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,320
Now, I've pledged $10 a month.

1551
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,900
I believe in KNON.

1552
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,860
I don't get paid to do this.

1553
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,600
It's caused me money to do this, people.

1554
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:55,300
Okay?

1555
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:56,840
Sure.

1556
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,540
People that have sent money, we'll talk to them.

1557
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:00,880
Yeah.

1558
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,140
Okay.

1559
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:03,460
We'll do it.

1560
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,500
Yeah, send them in here.

1561
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,900
Yeah, if you want to give us money, we'll talk to you.

1562
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,160
Okay, that's how we're starting this out.

1563
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,280
Line one, hit it.

1564
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,560
Line one.

1565
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:12,480
Money.

1566
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:13,840
Money.

1567
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:13,840


1568
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:15,100
Go ahead.

1569
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:16,660
Oh, boy.

1570
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,080
Well, he was real serious about pledging, huh?

1571
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,000
Did he drink the pledge?

1572
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,420
He drank the pledge.

1573
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,300
He made a pledge.

1574
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,100
He made a pledge.

1575
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,720
Well, call him back.

1576
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,360
Call him back.

1577
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:25,900
Call him back.

1578
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:26,760
See how he is.

1579
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,500
Take care of this.

1580
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:28,980
I'm going to...

1581
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,100
The reason I told you about...

1582
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,920
I'm going to cough and sneeze and do nice things like blow my nose a lot.

1583
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:37,120
So, John is probably going to be doing a lot of the talking.

1584
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,540
I'm going to disappear every once in a while.

1585
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,280
I'll just take care of these nice, trivial things.

1586
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:41,840
But...

1587
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,200
Yeah.

1588
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,460
Anyway, if you were watching television this week...

1589
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:46,400
That's what I was going to mention.

1590
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:46,920
Thank you.

1591
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,160
If you were watching television this week on Heritage Cablevision, channel...

1592
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,040
Was it channel 9 or channel 25?

1593
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:55,760
One of the two.

1594
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:02,260
Wherever Dallas Music Videos was live on Tuesday night, you would have seen what we look like.

1595
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,800
The gorgeous faces of Norm Ward and John Horton.

1596
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,840
Not necessarily in that order.

1597
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,900
Anyway, we were on with Kathy Blaylock and Lee Tranchen of Dallas Music.

1598
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:16,220
Videos who will be our guests next week on Monday morning.

1599
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:21,580
So, think up your local kind of music questions for Kathy and Lee.

1600
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,020
And plus, they'll probably have some information on...

1601
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:29,840
If you're in a local band on how to get your video on Dallas Music Videos.

1602
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,860
Anyway, they will be with us next week.

1603
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,160
And we had a blast.

1604
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,420
We interrupted them.

1605
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,080
We kidnapped their music news coordinator.

1606
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,680
We have a tape.

1607
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:42,500
Everything we ever wanted to do on television.

1608
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,160
We did.

1609
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:45,940
Anyway.

1610
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,460
So, the phone numbers to call for the...

1611
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,320
Thank you.

1612
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,420
The phone numbers to call to put in your pledge for KON.

1613
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,900
It's that time of the year again.

1614
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,340
It's money time.

1615
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,560
Tax time is until April 15th.

1616
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,100
This is money time.

1617
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:05,200
823-7490.

1618
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,000
823-8801.

1619
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,240
823-8883.

1620
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,640
Get on the phones now.

1621
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,780
Take a look at this one.

1622
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,920
You know, we could have all sorts of money come in here.

1623
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,500
And we wouldn't phone for a first year.

1624
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,940
Or we sound a lot better.

1625
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:29,580
As in Harvey Pollack of Dallas, Texas.

1626
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:30,340
Who...

1627
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:30,660
Spam.

1628
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:32,340
Spam?

1629
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,380
Spam is on this record.

1630
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,540
Spam is on this record.

1631
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:39,440
Harvey, no relation to spam, has given us $40.

1632
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:39,760


1633
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:40,760
$40.

1634
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:40,920


1635
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:41,620
$40.

1636
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1637
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1638
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1639
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1640
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1641
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1642
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1643
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1644
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1645
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1646
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1647
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1648
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1649
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1650
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1651
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1652
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:41,620


1653
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,080
$40.

1654
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,220
$40.

1655
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:44,400
$40.

1656
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:44,860
$40.

1657
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:44,860


1658
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:44,860


1659
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:44,860


1660
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:44,860


1661
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:44,900
Rosenberg.

1662
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,280
Rosenberg.

1663
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:46,340
Rosenberg.

1664
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:47,180
Rosenberg.

1665
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,320
Rosenberg.

1666
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,260
Rosenberg.

1667
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:53,920
Rosenberg.

1668
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:53,920


1669
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:54,280
Rosenberg.

1670
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,740
Rosenberg.

1671
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,780
Rosenberg.

1672
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,120
Rosenberg.

1673
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,180
Rosenberg.

1674
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,440
Ponzi.

1675
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:11,320
Ponzi.

1676
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,440
being on the air here.

1677
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,660
I pledge $10 a month.

1678
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,960
Like I said, if we reach 2,000,

1679
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,000
if we can get 49 more people at $40

1680
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,100
or 39 more people at $50,

1681
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:23,180
if we reach 2,000, I'll kick in another 100.

1682
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,600
So come on.

1683
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:26,620
We need you to help us.

1684
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,000
If you don't help, we won't be on the air.

1685
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,700
823-749-0823, 8801,

1686
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,080
and 823-8883.

1687
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:35,400
Your turn.

1688
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,660
It's Norm's money.

1689
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:38,160
Make him spend it, huh?

1690
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:38,400
That's right.

1691
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:39,660
Anyway.

1692
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,820
Speaking of money,

1693
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:41,780
where's our log?

1694
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:42,760
The money program.

1695
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,940
Our log is being burned.

1696
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:45,880
Yes.

1697
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,660
There is nothing on the log you shipped.

1698
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,780
Pledge drive.

1699
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,100
Here's the log.

1700
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,580
Money, money, money.

1701
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,360
Here you go.

1702
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,500
Wrong log.

1703
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,360
That's the PSA.

1704
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:55,840
Wrong one.

1705
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,720
Yeah, it says pledge drive, all right.

1706
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,440
It says pledge those dollars.

1707
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,500
Big bucks.

1708
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,280
Moolah.

1709
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,100
Cash.

1710
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,480
Cents.

1711
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:07,500
Pounds.

1712
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,400
Sterling.

1713
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:09,220
Gold.

1714
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,180
Money.

1715
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:11,720
Lots of it.

1716
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:12,540
Here.

1717
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,540
Hit turntable two.

1718
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,580
Hit turntable two.

1719
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,340
Bring it up.

1720
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,160
Bring it up.

1721
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:17,660
Welcome to the money program.

1722
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,740
Tonight on the money program, we're going to look at money.

1723
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:24,180
Lots of it on film and in the studio.

1724
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:28,820
Some of it in nice piles, others in lovely clunky bits of loose change.

1725
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,640
Some of it neatly counted into fat little hundreds.

1726
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,280
Delicate fivers stuffed into bulging wallets.

1727
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,040
Nice, crisp, clean checks.

1728
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,340
Purch pieces of copper coinage thrust deep into trouser pockets.

1729
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:40,280
Romantic.

1730
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,880
Foreign money rolling against the thigh with rough familiarity.

1731
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,380
Beautiful wayward curlicued banknotes.

1732
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,980
Fiddly, copper plating cheek by gel with tumbling hexagonal milled edges.

1733
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,620
Rubbing gently against the terse leather of beautifully balanced bank books.

1734
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,520
Sorry.

1735
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,280
But I love money.

1736
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,500
All money.

1737
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,300
I've always wanted money.

1738
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,200
To handle, to touch.

1739
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,540
The smell of the rain wash florin.

1740
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,960
The lure of the lira.

1741
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,200
The glitter and the glory of the guinea.

1742
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,920
The romance of the ruble.

1743
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,240
The feel of the franc.

1744
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:12,900
The heel of the deutschmark.

1745
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,500
The cold, antiseptic sting of the Swiss franc.

1746
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:18,520
And the sunburnt splendor of the Australian dollar.

1747
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:23,100
I've got ninety thousand pounds in my pyjamas.

1748
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,200
I've got forty thousand French francs in my fridge.

1749
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,560
I've got lots of lovely lira.

1750
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,360
Now the deutschmark's getting dearer.

1751
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,560
And my dollar bills would buy the Brooklyn Bridge.

1752
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:35,860
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money.

1753
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,080
There is nothing quite as beautiful as cash.

1754
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:39,880
There is nothing quite as beautiful as cash.

1755
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,500
Some people say it's folly.

1756
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,260
But I'd rather have the lolly.

1757
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,460
With money you can make a splash.

1758
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,820
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money.

1759
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,940
There is nothing like a newly minted pound.

1760
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:55,980
Everyone must anchor for the bulgeness of a banker.

1761
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,140
It's accountancy that wakes the world around.

1762
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,700
You can keep your Marxist ways.

1763
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,180
But it's only just a phase.

1764
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:06,280
For it's money, money, money makes the world go round.

1765
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:09,420
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

1766
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,360
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.

1767
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:15,720
That's the Money Program.

1768
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,900
This is what you're listening to.

1769
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,840
KNON 90.9 FM.

1770
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,760
Dallas, Fort Worth.

1771
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,760
The voice of your pledge drive.

1772
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,860
Yes, your pledge drive.

1773
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:26,460
These people.

1774
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,920
I have, Bruce, I don't know if you're listening right now.

1775
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,620
Bruce Anderson in Plano plays last time.

1776
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,640
And I must apologize.

1777
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:36,460
I have not made good on my offers I have for the t-shirt.

1778
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:37,980
And the tapes from last week.

1779
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,540
I have them.

1780
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,640
They will be in the mail tomorrow.

1781
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,120
My apologies and thanks to Bruce Anderson and Plano.

1782
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:44,200
Also, Karen Haynes down in East Dallas.

1783
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,760
All right, what do we got here?

1784
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:47,780
We got from Denton, Texas.

1785
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,160
You ready for this, Pat Fielder?

1786
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,660
This is a student at North Texas, people.

1787
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:52,360
A student.

1788
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,020
A $50 pledge.

1789
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,500
A $50 pledge.

1790
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,300
Okay, now.

1791
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,200
From a student.

1792
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,700
A student at North Texas.

1793
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:00,400
No pizzas for two weeks.

1794
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,160
No kidding.

1795
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:01,960
Ooh.

1796
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,660
Now, at SMU, there'd be no pizzas for one week.

1797
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:06,100
But that's a different story.

1798
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,160
Okay, now.

1799
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,620
Where are the guys at the Sigma Chi House at SMU?

1800
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:09,880
New, huh?

1801
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,020
What do you say, guys?

1802
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,560
I know you're listening.

1803
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,960
You don't have to pay off the house anymore.

1804
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:16,660
That's right.

1805
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:17,820
Brand new house, you know.

1806
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,420
I think, no, Sigma Chi, no.

1807
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:19,920
I'm sorry.

1808
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,500
I meant Chi.

1809
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,100
Sigma Chi.

1810
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,140
My mistake.

1811
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,620
Sigma, what did you say?

1812
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,740
I said Sigma Chi.

1813
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:25,420
Yes.

1814
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,360
I meant Kappa Sig.

1815
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:26,980
Ooh.

1816
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,800
The guys at Kappa Sig are listening.

1817
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,560
Forget your pledges from Kappa Sig.

1818
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,440
Forget the guys.

1819
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,120
No, forget the guys at Sigma Chi.

1820
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,740
The guys at Kappa Sig are the ones that are listening.

1821
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:36,280
Okay?

1822
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,600
They live next door.

1823
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,760
To the KAs, and we all know what the A stands for, right?

1824
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:44,460
And it ain't Alpha.

1825
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:45,080
All right.

1826
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:45,820
Never mind.

1827
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,640
That's a different story.

1828
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,540
Pat Fielder in Denton, Texas.

1829
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,320
$50 pledge.

1830
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,200
All right.

1831
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,920
A Monday morning t-shirt also for a $50 pledge.

1832
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,240
They're going for $50.

1833
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,580
Guys, put this on here.

1834
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,140
Put a Monday morning shirt on here.

1835
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,680
I'm going to have to make some more, but I'll do it.

1836
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:01,760
Okay, so we got $50 for Denton.

1837
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,100
Explain to the people what the Monday morning t-shirt is for those of us.

1838
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,520
The Monday morning t-shirt says,

1839
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,100
I listen to Monday morning with Norm Ward on 90.9.

1840
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,740
Or KNO and 90.9 FM.

1841
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,560
All right.

1842
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,220
Aaron Hurd in Arlington.

1843
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:14,400
Head.

1844
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:14,980
Thank you.

1845
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,220
That looks like an R.

1846
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:16,800
Yeah.

1847
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,320
Sure.

1848
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:17,800
Okay.

1849
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,200
Anyway.

1850
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:19,660
Aaron.

1851
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,080
Let's change this typo.

1852
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:22,240
Okay.

1853
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,460
Anyway, Aaron.

1854
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,180
We appreciate your...

1855
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:26,680
Support.

1856
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,160
Support.

1857
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:27,760
$30.
