1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,320
Oh

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:21,160
Well, I'll tell you what friends

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,820
I'll do a public service announcement right off the top of my head and it's about heart attack

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,440
friends

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,360
if you're

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,700
hanging out

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,540
or even just waking up in bed feeling funny

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,800
and you have pains in your left arm or

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,320
your right arm or

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
places you've never had pains before or

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:57,200
Headaches that they're in the wrong place of your head like your neck or your lower jaw or your teeth

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,040
You may be having a heart attack

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,740
and

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,760
it also can feel like

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,440
the worst heartburn you ever had and one thing you can do is wake up or

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:15,700
Clutch your chest and go. Oh man, this is bad and I bet it's nothing. I think it's gonna pass

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,500
Bad idea I

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,860
Tried that myself it didn't work

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,580
They had to helicopter me to Fort Worth and stick up scaffolding in my

20
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,780
So that the clots wouldn't happen there again

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,920
So yeah, when you have those symptoms go ahead and call 9-1-1, then that's Might unscripted public-service

22
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:44,900
Message

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,640
Now it seems

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,420
Friends, I hate to break it to the regular listeners. So I know some of you are going to be terribly disappointed

25
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,100
but dr. Sinister can't make it and

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,520
And this isn't radio synesthesia.

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,500
Although this is the time slot of radio synesthesia.

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm afraid I'm having to fill in for two hours.

29
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,400
It's a bad night for me to have to do that.

30
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,800
Because I've got company coming tomorrow.

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,900
And I'm not done yet.

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,920
But I'm going to get my act together here.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,220
Yes, I will.

34
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:36,120
And let you listen to this music while I do so.

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the soundtrack of Kenneth Anger's weird underground movie called Lucifer Rising.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,060
This music was recorded in a prison.

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,880
And one of the key composers of it was one of the charlatans.

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,720
Lee Manson family, believe it or not.

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,880
And the nice thing about this music is it goes on for half an hour.

40
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,960
That will give me time to get more act together.

41
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,260
Praise Bob and thanks for listening.

42
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,320
Lucifer Rising.

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,420
Lucifer Rising.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,240
Our hero, Standard Mozek.

45
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,320
He's what you might call a combination cop and news reporter.

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,540
And he has finally tracked down the weirds.

47
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,460
The weirds are people who live outside of Neighbor World.

48
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,720
Neighbor World is the electronic environment.

49
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,180
You might call it the internet.

50
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,020
But it's a lot more than that in the future.

51
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,060
And Standard, our hero, is trying to defend his job.

52
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,360
He's a proud advo.

53
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,900
He goes, I whisper in what they tell me.

54
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,720
And it works for the average neighbor, I said blankly.

55
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,620
The signpost up ahead.

56
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,400
Pinpoint means evolution.

57
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,020
Everybody is information.

58
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,760
You're all.

59
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,740
You're all yacking artichokes, the fireman said.

60
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,320
You live in a mind-controlled prison, Shama said.

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,660
That's why you can't do what we can.

62
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
Our minds are free.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,960
We're a brotherhood, I continued.

64
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,180
We work for the global neighborhood.

65
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
It sounded stupid.

66
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,600
I felt shame.

67
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,960
Tears welled in my eyes.

68
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,460
There, there, the inspector said in a sarcastic sounding, comforting tone.

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
It must be tough learning.

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,640
Your info scam brotherhood is just a mind and evolution control tool.

71
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,840
And probably a front for some secret society, too.

72
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,580
The fireman raised an eyebrow.

73
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,200
Shama's narrowed his focus, looking right into my eyes.

74
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,680
The womb walls pulsed.

75
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,040
But I'm an advo, I said, wiping tears.

76
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,200
Advos bring hush mode cults into focus.

77
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,860
Shine the light on them.

78
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,940
ECU.

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,300
Listen, Bob.

80
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,300


81
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,440
Along their jeeps they'll stop and talk like delinquent Comme Ci,

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,240
being a local worker took it the wrong way.

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,360
If you love dark people, you want to see them.

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
You're lost.

85
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,900
Next time,Schema will pull back the pages

86
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,380
while a book provided the secret information from Dr.

87
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,380


88
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,680
we'll vote it down and round contribut thi.

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,180
I couldn't handle 진행 WHAT

90
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,520
ichtein

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,700
So, I found the lights on the waysel fingerl yenzhan nike.

92
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,300
What was it again?

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,640
A shadow ofП

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:22,900
ACIM

95
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,280
bonds that they've had.

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,280


97
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,860
It's paranoia, so folks don't know what's real, the elk concluded.

98
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,640
It's all lies, info scam to control them.

99
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,320
But you can't lie to people forever, the inspector added with a threatening tone.

100
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,420
He source-pointed, scrutinizing me with a distant look, then shook his head.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,700
I can see you still don't understand why we would never spotlight or join your neighbor world

102
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,200
or be any part of your info scam, he said.

103
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,340
Neighbor world doesn't help people evolve or live better, Shama scolded, waving his hand.

104
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,880
It just jerks off their nervous systems when they should be seeking their true natures.

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,020
I was zumbie to their jango, totally accepting and depressed.

106
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,680
The weirds had penetrated my stacks and the necks was wide open.

107
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,380
One thing seemed certain, this goose would never lay the gold op.

108
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,180
These folks would never spot me.

109
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,080
I was not like Gooey in the right, and I would never see the Advo gig the same.

110
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,120
The key to evolution isn't technology, Shama continued.

111
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,420
It's the teachings.

112
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,420
Tech changes.

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,980
The teachings never change.

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,940
The mirror is a beautiful thing, the inspector said with a grin.

115
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,940
Beautiful.

116
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,720
In synchro cue, the chamber got darker.

117
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,180
Crushing stillness moved through the room, forcing us all into awkward freeze frames.

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,480
I had a feeling a bunch of these weird kids were watching, invisible.

119
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,860
My diaper's full, the inspector said, looking sadly at the ground.

120
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,180
Mission accomplished, the shaman said, nodding in agreement.

121
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,900
There's only one way out, said the inspector,

122
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,320
shuffling slowly toward a plainly marked exit near the last omitted display.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,520
And I'm the only one who knows it.

124
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,920
A mental case.

125
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,060
Shama said, holding his nose with one hand and making the sign of the crazy with the other.

126
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,240
The shaman placed his hand on the fireman's shoulder.

127
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,880
The pyro-freak mumbled incoherently and made oblique gestures.

128
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,180
His pink and blue streamers glimmered weakly.

129
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:44,980
I lift my face to the invisible sun for an invisible tan, the fireman muttered.

130
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,060
Beauty's only skin deep.

131
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,180
By fool's day, everyone will glow.

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,840
They walked to the exit.

133
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,520
I followed my witch-clown masters, a crazy man in a volunteer fireman's outfit

134
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,920
and a comic-turned-shaman without understanding him.

135
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,840
I lowered my eyes in humility and relinquished my personality.

136
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:18,360
Well, that was on page 154 and 155 of Neighbor World.

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:19,480
Bye.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
By lonesome cowboy Dave DeLuca.

139
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,440
I've got some more nifty little spots I could read from that.

140
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,560
But let's do the music a little bit longer, okay?

141
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,880
Okay.

142
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:38,940


143
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:40,880
Okay.

144
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:44,840


145
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:44,920


146
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,940


147
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,940


148
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,940


149
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,940


150
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,940


151
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:44,980
Okay.

152
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:44,980


153
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:44,980


154
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,700
Okay.

155
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,340
Okay.

156
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,180
Okay.

157
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


158
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


159
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


160
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


161
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


162
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


163
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,180


164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,700
Okay.

165
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,540
Okay.

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Okay.

167
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,340
Okay.

168
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,740
Okay.

169
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


170
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


171
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


172
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


173
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


174
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


175
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,960


176
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000


178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000


179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000


180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000


181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,100
Okay.

182
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,100


183
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,100


184
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,100


185
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,500
Okay.

186
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,680


187
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,680


188
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,680


189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,680


190
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,360
Okay.

191
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,660
Okay.

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,720
Okay.

193
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,120
Yes, friends, we're listening to the soundtrack of Lucifer Rising.

194
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,740
An underground movie by Kenneth Anger.

195
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
Even though this would normally be radio synesthesia, it's not.

196
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,340
And it's going to be a subgenius show.

197
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,200
Or rather, actually, I'm going to play a lot of my favorite music in a little while.

198
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:14,320
But I need, X Day's coming, and I'm going to need material to put into a rerun-type production.

199
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,620
So, at some point.

200
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,860
Well, no, wait a minute.

201
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,460
Couldn't I just have the robots on the X ship do it for me?

202
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,600
Well, anyway, here.

203
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,040
Let's not worry about that.

204
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm going to read a different section of the book, The Bobliographon.

205
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,200
It's out of print, so it's the only way you're going to ever, ever be able to see it or hear any of it.

206
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,660
And I'm going to read from a little section called Subicide.

207
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,200
It's about why you shouldn't kill yourself.

208
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,760
And I've already, I think I've already read a lot of the materials.

209
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,600
No, I'll start here.

210
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,460
Many people insist that death is great, that it's a whole new adventure.

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,420
The subgenius euphemism for when someone dies is, he got triple his money back.

212
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:17,000
Our problem is that we've noticed that none of the people who said death is so great,

213
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,100
have actually read it.

214
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:26,300
And that those who finally did try it suddenly became very quiet about it indeed.

215
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,880
Almost as if they had something to hide.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,480
Hmm.

217
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:40,740
If on the day that I die, I find myself in an etheric light body flying down the tunnel of light

218
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,380
into some wonderful now incomprehensible level of awareness.

219
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,060
Well, great.

220
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,980
I'll be very pleasantly.

221
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:48,760
Surprised.

222
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,720
If on the other hand, I'm just plain dead, then you probably won't hear me complaining

223
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,100
about that either.

224
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,640
That was said by the great Reverend Ivan Stan.

225
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,640
So what is the hurry friends?

226
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,680
God or Bob are going to get you no matter what.

227
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,060
Do you really think you can do a better job of killing yourself than Bob or God can?

228
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,300
Are you that prideful?

229
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,800
Please leave it to the professionals.

230
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,080
If you must die, don't try.

231
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,080


232
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Try to do it yourself.

233
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,840
Let Bob do it for you.

234
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,060
If you try to do it, there's a very good chance you'll muff the job.

235
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,840
By definition, you're an amateur at suicide.

236
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,160
It's possible that old grim reaper Dobbs might take his sweet time about getting around to

237
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,720
killing you.

238
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,460
You might even get impatient.

239
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
But remember what Bob said?

240
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,060
At the 19th century.

241
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,060


242
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,580
1978 Dobbs-Kahn stockholders meeting at the Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge in Lake Tahoe,

243
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:52,820
Nevada.

244
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,800
Just as suicide is the most sincere form of self-loathing, my new church of the subgenius

245
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
is the most sincere form of send one dollar.

246
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,460
So friends, hitch your wagon of screwed-up-edness to Bob.

247
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,780
Reinforce and reaffirm that commitment.

248
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,120
That $35 bridle.

249
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,580
And jump on board.

250
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,200
Just don't drag your feet.

251
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,060
If he can't help it, he can't help it.

252
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,300
Don't push.

253
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,400
And remember, the first of Bob's five keys to magic, get off your butt.

254
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,660
Don't worry about being a failure in the conspiracy world.

255
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,980
They will try to humiliate you.

256
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,280
But they know not the sublime cosmic secret of the forbidden sciences.

257
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,800
That the only thing that never fails is failure.

258
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,040
The only thing that never works is failure.

259
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,900
The only thing that never works is perfection.

260
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:55,040
The only workable philosophy, the one rule of the church is...

261
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,600
I'll paraphrase it.

262
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,180
Screw them if they can't take a joke.

263
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,700
You must stop blaming yourself for your failures and get back to blaming the conspiracy.

264
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,040
Yeah, in fact, that's why I can't say the true law of the church on public radio.

265
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,020
The conspiracy is a lie.

266
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,780
The conspiracy tries to tell you that a failed experiment is bad.

267
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,100
And that you're a loser if you aren't rich yet and cute or smart.

268
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,740
And that it's somehow abnormal and unhealthy to be depressed, pessimistic, occasionally

269
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:39,040
consumed with hate, blundering and desperately seeking slack in strange places.

270
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:46,340
But those are actually appropriate responses to a world that's so screwed up that even

271
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,140
the church of the subgenius starts to make sense by comparison.

272
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,420
Now that's screwed up.

273
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:59,220
The idea that it's normal for everything to be cheery and hunky dory and slackful and lovey is a lie.

274
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,100
The pinks act like everything already is that way, so you'll stop trying to make it that way.

275
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,340
That makes them look bad.

276
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,800
As the old bumper sticker says, I'd rather be killing optimists.

277
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,700
That way lies a life of...

278
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,460
quiet desperation.

279
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:27,020
Although slack is the energy which powers the universe, it's equally true that invisible,

280
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,080
seething, self-contained hate particles comprise the missing dark matter of the universe,

281
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,780
the hidden mass for which quantum physicists still search.

282
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:46,320
The subgenius taps this pure, universal hate force and transmutes it from stupidity

283
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,420
into...

284
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,340
slack.

285
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,380
Hate and failure are part of nature and can be unsuspected paths to slack.

286
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,960
The life of a subgenius marooned in a sea of humans can be hard.

287
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:07,280
You might assume that we preachers of Bob, we fishers of the wallet, have the most slack-filled jobs in the world, next to Bob.

288
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,180
But you see, we took on the job of pulling God's leg.

289
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,320
And that's a mighty big leg job.

290
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,980
We're the first to admit that devouring your...

291
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:29,560
No, well, we're the first to admit that devoting your heart, mind, and soul to Bob won't solve all your problems.

292
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,960
But it will help you to blow them off.

293
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:41,200
You really do know what's best for you, and all those hundreds of nagging weenies and widgets don't know jack hooey.

294
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,260
Most of them don't even know what they want, and that's why they're trying to tell you what you want.

295
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:57,000
Most people have not the slightest idea what they want to do next, and are probably better off letting the boss and the spouse and the church and the society run their little lives for them.

296
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,180
But Dr. Drummond, most lives are barely touched by slack at all.

297
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:15,440
It seems at times that we are forlorn ships, drifting, dreadnoughts, stuck forever in the sargasso sea of slacklessness.

298
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,840
The Bermuda Triangle of failed desires.

299
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,780
Some subgenie constantly entertain thoughts of suicide.

300
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,760
In fact, they're remarkably creative in such thoughts.

301
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,420
If they didn't have those thoughts as a release, they'd surely go mad.

302
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:37,080
Instead, they reach a point where everything's so bad, they can only laugh.

303
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,160
Suicidal thoughts come when you feel the great battle.

304
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,820
The battle to cut yourself an island of slack amidst the anti-slack and toil...

305
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,240
The battle to cut yourself an island of slack amidst the anti-slack and toil...

306
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,880
...and the losing one.

307
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,400
It's like an itch you can't scratch.

308
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,920
The conspiracy is to blame for most of it, which is a consolation one must never lose sight of.

309
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,740
But there is an anti-universe of anti-sight and anti-sound, and that's where half of your thoughts are.

310
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,700
You are represented in the anti-universe by an anti-you.

311
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,540
In that universe, you are rich and good-looking.

312
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,220
Assuming you're not so now, a safe assumption regarding subgeniuses.

313
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,360
You're not in negative physically, but you're negative in concept.

314
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:29,620
The negative or backwards universe is also what causes that itch you can't scratch between your ear and your throat.

315
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,400
That's when you have to go...

316
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,220
...like that to scratch it.

317
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,760
The transtemporal opening to the anti-universe is located in that area of the sinuses.

318
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,580
That is the most telling manifestation of it.

319
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,020
That's what the overman had to say, friends.

320
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,740
Life may be tough, but don't worry.

321
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,800
There isn't much more of it left.

322
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,320
Remember X-Day?

323
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,160
You only need to stay alive until then.

324
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,420
The end times are nipping at our heels, dear friends.

325
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,640
This is no time to false slack off.

326
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:15,200
The conspiracy has become so powerful that they can brag in the mass media about how there's a secret CIA, mafia, Nazi, or whatever.

327
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:25,320
They can boast openly that they torch whole cult compounds full of families that dare to be really weird.

328
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:32,140
They show off their, quote, crash saucers, unquote, and turn them into tourist traps.

329
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:40,360
They can do anything they damn well please, and it's all just more entertainment to the pinks.

330
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,200
Hell, they even show them previews of X-Day and movie theaters.

331
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,860
Every summer in which the pinks win.

332
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,280
Every other TV and radio ad has some pink everyman named Bob submitting to anti-slack happily.

333
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,060
Are you going to stand for this?

334
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,740
Are you just going to eat, get stoned, and watch the tube and listen to this station?

335
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,020
Well, that may be just what Dobbs commands you to do.

336
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,900
But if he moves you to mayhaps rise from your butt

337
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,180
and do something that actually takes a little extra energy,

338
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,980
like agent our next Ukrainian bomb purchase,

339
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,560
or bill our latest trademark infringer,

340
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,820
or make a million bucks,

341
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,140
or find your true Yeti mate and parent the twins who bear the scissors of sight,

342
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,940
will you then falter?

343
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,060
Will you waver just a bit in your determination?

344
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,720
Will you pink out?

345
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,040
We won't tell you what to do.

346
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,940
Only you know what to do.

347
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,040
But for God's sakes, don't not do it.

348
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,180
Certainly the pinkness around us and the sheer massive weight of the conspiracy

349
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,680
is enough to send a subgenius spiraling into depression and paralysis.

350
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,860
Sure, don't feel guilty if it has.

351
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,600
There is a cosmic slackfulness to blowing even slack off.

352
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,280
But accept this pep talk.

353
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,900
If you knew half the toil, orgasms, and brain damage it has cost us

354
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,640
just to keep the church post office box open for 37 years,

355
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,180
and how worthless it is,

356
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,840
how worth it it was,

357
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,780
you would heed.

358
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,600
This is no nickel-dime-bum show, but the real thing.

359
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,440
Your life and how not to waste it.

360
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,660
Your one prank call to the local radio talk show

361
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,920
could be the domino that starts the arisal.

362
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,200
Your one economic takeover in subsequent dictatorship

363
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,240
over some seemingly useless nation

364
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,040
might just be the straw that breaks Goliath's back.

365
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,180
What are you waiting for?

366
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,740
Approval from Dobbs?

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,160
Hell, he doesn't care.

368
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,420
He's probably watching TV.

369
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,840
But you aren't him.

370
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,500
And so you must serve him.

371
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,940
Don't wait to be trussed up and served to him with an apple in your mouth

372
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,040
like the rest of the bobbies.

373
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,820
Take command.

374
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,360
Stuff the apple in his mouth and braise him well.

375
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,780
Core out the apple in your own head.

376
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,620
Spray paint it gold and throw it to the mongrel dog pinks

377
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,340
so they can fight over it.

378
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
You may be that one subgenius.

379
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,720
The 13th apostle whose one sarcastic remark

380
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,220
at just the right moment is the heretofore missing link

381
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,960
in the chain reaction that melts down the conspiracy's self-fueling reactor.

382
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,140
You never know.

383
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,300
Just don't miss your chance.

384
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,460
That's all we're asking.

385
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,340
When you're ready to give up,

386
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
when any pink would have caved in ages before,

387
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,300
make that last one Herculean effort.

388
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,560
One of you is the one.

389
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,340
The one who shall make up the world.

390
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,140
The one who has uncut the scissors of sight.

391
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,420
We have redoubled our efforts at shoving the work, the church,

392
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,920
down the resisting craws of all normals and unsaved subgeni alike

393
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,620
via TV, radio, and the internet, comic books, nightclub devivals, anything.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,120
We'll play kook.

395
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,860
We'll play literary outlaw.

396
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,300
We'll wear any mask to get Bob's word out.

397
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,340
Not only will this make us rich before X-Day, always a major goal,

398
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,340
but it will also possibly make us rich.

399
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,340
We'll probably save two important mystery souls from despair and suicide.

400
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,780
And that's probably our real contribution to Earth society.

401
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:31,300
To save from suicide the two really key individuals out there, whoever they are.

402
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,220
Dobbs wasn't specific.

403
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,840
Who will then go on to create the cure for normalcy,

404
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,100
or the anti-gravity teleporter, or whatever the hell it is,

405
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,120
that allows subgeniuses to buy out the conspiracy?

406
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,620
And replace it with slack?

407
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,600
You think we're kidding you?

408
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,440
Was Moses kidding?

409
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,880
Come X-Day, were we not promised a new government

410
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,920
where crime would be legal and Bob the only politician?

411
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,760
A new religion where you'd go to services on Saturday night,

412
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,160
drunk, not at some god-awful early hour on Sunday?

413
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,040
A new coolness where the weirdos would decide

414
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,140
what's cool, and the cool people would be either

415
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,300
in-weirdant or...

416
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,440
cleansed?

417
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:20,880
Yes!

418
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,640
Where all hate would be stomped out by force?

419
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,700
Well, what are we waiting for?

420
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,420
Why are we waiting for X-Day?

421
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,120
Bob taught us the hard way not to depend on God, aliens, or even salesmen.

422
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,280
Yet too many people still use Bob as a crutch

423
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,720
when they should be fighting over his armpit space to be his crutch.

424
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,100
You must stop asking what's in Bob's mind.

425
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,520
Throw yourself into that pipe and let him smoke you.

426
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
Let him make an ash of you.

427
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,420
Your mind is what he smokes in that pipe.

428
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,280
Your mind is what is sucked into his eyes and thoughts

429
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,500
when you look at his face.

430
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,920
And looking at his face?

431
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,600
That's all it should take.

432
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,880
People ask you,

433
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,320
Who's this Bob man?

434
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,260
Why is he important?

435
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,020
Just sit him down and make them really look at that face.

436
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,360
And they will see.

437
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,020
They will truly, finally see.

438
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,880
Oh, they had us fooled for so long.

439
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,520
They had us thinking that a one-world government

440
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,440
or else a one-world religion was the real conspiracy

441
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,160
when actually it was the one-world advertiser all along.

442
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,060
And it has already completely colonized Earth Farm One.

443
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,780
The subgenius must have slack, my friends, by any means necessary.

444
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,020
The Pink Man has held the Slack Man down.

445
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,080
But everything comes apart.

446
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,580
One way or another.

447
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,200
Heh. Heh. Heh.

448
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,980
Make no mistake.

449
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,560
God loves you.

450
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,540
But Bob, Bob wants you.

451
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,260
And he's going to find you.

452
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,720
You cannot find yourself.

453
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,300
Are you so confident as to think you can find yourself better than Bob can?

454
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,980
As Bob said,

455
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,100
I'll find myself when they pry me out of my cold, dead fingers.

456
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,080
Why should we let a total conspiracy clampdown get between us and Slack Man?

457
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,140
Just because the Norms ninnied out

458
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,260
and are busy building themselves into a prison corner that they painted themselves,

459
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,800
does that mean we have to give up our slack too?

460
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,400
Hell nay, say we.

461
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,800
For J.R. Bob Dobbs is our personal self-fulfilling prophet.

462
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,620
We don't know what year this is or even what planet we're on.

463
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,200
Praise Bob.

464
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,800
We don't know anything except that it's not yet July 5th, 1998.

465
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,080
Maybe we'll be lucky and tomorrow will be that.

466
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,480
Maybe these aren't the end times at all.

467
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,180
They might be the beginning times.

468
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,120
Bob said,

469
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,940
I want you to stop buying and start selling.

470
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,640
We have nothing to lose.

471
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,660
If we don't live forever,

472
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,740
we get our money back.

473
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,080
The final truth,

474
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,240
Bob is not the answer.

475
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,260
And neither is anything else.

476
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,440
You must learn to think for yourself.

477
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,600
But only Bob can show you how.

478
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,800
Question authority.

479
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,040
Or else.

480
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,940
Praise Bob.

481
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,160
And above all,

482
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,660
if they can't take not a joke,

483
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,680
let them mount up upon themselves.

484
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,620
So mote it be.

485
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,220
Motant it.

486
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,800
Motant it indeed.

487
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,780
So now I think it's time to go

488
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
to the real music.

489
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,280
The kind I mighty like.

490
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,620
And we're going to welcome in a new era.

491
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,620
Along with our old buddy,

492
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,440
Jimi Hendrix.

493
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,240
Praise Bob.

494
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,500
Five, four, three, two, one.

495
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,880
From Bill Graham and everybody in the Fillmore family.

496
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,420
We're going to welcome you to the new era.

497
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,720
A very, very happy new year.

498
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,160
In a new decade.

499
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,720
A happy new year, everybody.

500
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,740
A very happy new year.

501
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,480
And if you walk down the bay that I see

502
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,780
Guess I didn't really know

503
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,380
God, what I'll been feeling

504
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,460
shocked by

505
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,500
So many things

506
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,960
As it was

507
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,780
But one thing's for sure

508
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:01,880
That is anyone,

509
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:01,980
There will be

510
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,120
No one

511
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,980
But me

guitar solo

517

What you gonna do for me

532
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,600
Make us fall behind

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,180
69

534
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,740
69

535
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
69

536
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,960
69

537
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
69

538
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,420
69

539
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,960
69

540
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,620
I hope you don't mind us jamming a little bit.

541
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,760
We're gonna sing this one.

542
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,660
We'll see what we're gonna do to play next.

543
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:32,180
Yeah.

544
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,280
Hello darkness my old friend

545
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,360
I've come to talk with you again

546
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,320
Because a vision softly creeping

547
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,480
Left its seeds while I was sleeping

548
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,860
And the vision

549
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,360
That was planted

550
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,740
In my brain

551
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,560
Still remains

552
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,040
With me

553
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,880
In the sounds

554
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,600
Of silence

555
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,480
Oh

556
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,700
Oh

557
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:45,700


558
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:45,760
Oh

559
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,040
Oh

560
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,660
Oh

561
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,060
Oh

562
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,520
Oh

563
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,180
Oh

564
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:53,880
Oh

565
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:53,960
Oh

566
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,200
In restless dreams I walk alone

567
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,940
In restless dreams I walk alone

568
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,740
In restless dreams I walk alone

569
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,600
In the narrow streets of cobblestone

570
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:11,800
In the narrow streets of cobblestone

571
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,380
In the narrow streets of cobblestone

572
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,760
Neath the halo of an east street line

573
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,960
I turn my collar to the cold and down

574
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,400
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash

575
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,860
Of a neon light

576
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,580
That split the night

577
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:33,960
Of a neon light that split the night

578
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,940
And touched the sounds

579
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,920
And touched the sounds

580
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,680
Of silence

581
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,520
Of silence

582
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,660
Of silence

583
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,560
Of silence

584
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
Of silence

585
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:52,960


586
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:52,960


587
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:52,960


588
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:03,940
The red富loaps

589
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,260
In the naked light I saw

590
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,540
Ten thousand people, maybe more

591
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,340
People talking without speaking

592
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,820
People hearing without listening

593
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:31,920
Writing songs that voices never share

594
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,600
And no one dare

595
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,980
Disturb the sounds

596
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,680
Of silence

597
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,100
Fool said I, you do not know

598
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,420
Silence like a cat that grows

599
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,680
Hear my words that I might teach you

600
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,880
Take my arms that I might reach you

601
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,760
But my words

602
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,760
Like silent raindrops fell

603
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,660
And echoed in the well

604
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:01,900
And echoed in the well

605
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,980
And echoed in the well

606
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:03,980


607
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,960
Of silence

608
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,800
Of silence

609
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,660
Of silence

610
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,840
Of silence

611
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:19,860
Of silence

612
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:27,900
Of silence

613
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,320
And the people bowed and prayed

614
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,060
And the people bowed and prayed

615
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,500
To the neon god they made

616
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,280
To the neon god they made

617
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,220
And the sign flashed out its warning

618
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,000
In the words it was for me

619
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,360
And the sign said the words of the prophets

620
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,800
Are written on subway walls

621
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,300
And tenement halls

622
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,900
And whispered in the air

623
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,020
And whispered in the sounds

624
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,220
And whispered in the sounds

625
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,980
Are written on subway walls

626
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:15,980


627
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,300
Are written on subway walls

628
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,520
And whispered in the sound

629
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,520


630
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,640
Of silence

631
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,040
Are written on subway walls

632
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,540
Silence

633
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,960
Silence

634
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,040
Silence

635
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,160
Silence

636
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:24,040
Silence

637
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,300
I sometimes get feedback unless you play some good music, so I'll do that now.

638
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,280
Music

639
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,560
Father, father, I'm here in the zoo

640
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:17,320
I can't come home cause I've grown up too soon

641
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,540
I got my sentence, I got my command

642
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,020
They said to fake my name

643
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,020


644
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,020


645
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:51,980
Thank you.

646
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:55,720
Thank you.

647
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,080
Thank you.

648
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,020
Thank you.

649
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,580
Thank you.

650
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,060
Thank you.

651
00:46:59,060 --> 00:46:59,060


652
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,240
Thank you.

653
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,600
And the great Elvis Costello that was.

654
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,180
They call you Lady Luck,

655
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,580
but there is room

656
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,340
for doubt.

657
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,780
At times you have a very

658
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,980
unladylike way

659
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,600
of running out.

660
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,480
You're on a date

661
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:31,980
with me.

662
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,220
The pickings have been lush.

663
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:37,440
And yet before

664
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,180
this evening is over,

665
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,760
you might give me the brush.

666
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,540
You might forget your

667
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,520
manners. You might refuse

668
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,300
to stay.

669
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,320
And so the best that I

670
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,120
can do

671
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,020
is pray.

672
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,160
Luck, be a lady

673
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:56,640
tonight.

674
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,880
Luck, be a lady tonight.

675
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,440
Luck, if you've

676
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,460
ever been a lady to begin with.

677
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,460
Luck, be a lady tonight.

678
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,500
Luck, let a

679
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,480
gentleman see

680
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,460
how nice a dame you can

681
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:14,840
be.

682
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,520
I know the way you've treated other guys

683
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,240
you've been with.

684
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:19,880
Luck,

685
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,340
be a lady with me.

686
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,660
A lady doesn't leave

687
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,260
her escort. It isn't fair.

688
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,860
It isn't nice.

689
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,360
A lady doesn't wander

690
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,860
all over the room

691
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,040
and blow on some other guy's

692
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,160
dice. So let's

693
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,400
keep the party polite.

694
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,060
Never get out

695
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,880
of my sight.

696
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,920
Stick with me, baby. I'm the

697
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,840
fella you came in with. Luck,

698
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,840
be a lady.

699
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,060
Luck, be a lady.

700
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,760
Luck, be a lady tonight.

701
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,180
Luck, be a lady

702
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:00,680
tonight.

703
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,860
Luck, be a lady tonight.

704
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,500
Luck, if you've

705
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,200
ever been a lady to begin

706
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,040
with. Luck, be a lady

707
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,520
tonight.

708
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,260
Luck,

709
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,660
let a gentleman see

710
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,360
how nice a dame

711
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,040
you can be.

712
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,100
I know the way you've treated

713
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,180
other guys you've been with. Luck,

714
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,720
be a lady with me.

715
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,940
A lady wouldn't flirt

716
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,040
with strangers. She'd have a

717
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,080
heart. She'd have a soul.

718
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,280
A lady wouldn't

719
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,260
make little snake eyes at me

720
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,100
when I've spent my life

721
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,000
on this road. So

722
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,740
let's keep the party polite.

723
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,420
Let's keep the party polite.

724
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,360
Never get out of my sight.

725
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,740
Stick with me,

726
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,920
baby, I'm the fella you came in with.

727
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,420
Luck, be a lady.

728
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,940
Luck, be a lady.

729
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,720
Luck, be a lady.

730
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,260
Luck, be a lady.

731
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,320
Luck, be a lady.

732
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,440
Rollin' up,

733
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,360
rollin' up, rollin' up,

734
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,440
rollin' up right.

735
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,220
Ha!

736
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,700
Ha!

737
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:40,820
Ha!

738
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,960
Ha!

739
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,820
Ha!

740
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,460
Ha!

741
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,640
Ha!

742
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,120
Ha!

743
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,720
Ha!

744
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


745
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


746
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


747
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


748
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


749
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


750
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


751
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:49,720


752
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,860
I jumped ship

753
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,320
Head for South of South

754
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,080
Swam like a senator

755
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,400
I reached the shore

756
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,480
On the trip

757
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,900
The beauty was brewing

758
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,480
Handle to the cake

759
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,040
To the ocean floor

760
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,900
Now I'm alone

761
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,220
Yes, I'm alone

762
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,420
In the old world

763
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,560
Singing like a stone

764
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,580
I am a man

765
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,200
Without a country

766
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,780
And I'm a boy

767
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,380
Without a home

768
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,500
I'm a casualty

769
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,720
Of a battle

770
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,540
Of the roses

771
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,320
And the war

772
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,400
Of the broken home

773
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,780
I got busted

774
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,020
For drinking while begging

775
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,700
Carrying a weapon

776
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,220
Under my coat

777
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,220
And I got busted

778
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,180
For all the money

779
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,520
To people

780
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,260
And now I am a pirate

781
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,760
On the bad dream boat

782
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,580
And I'm alone

783
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,780
I'm alone

784
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,260
I got a lot of stolen bones

785
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,220
I am a man

786
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,880
Without a country

787
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,440
And I'm a boy

788
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,020
Without a home

789
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,140
I'm a casualty

790
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,200
Of a battle

791
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,200
Of the roses

792
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:08,960
And the war

793
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,020
Of the broken home

794
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,280
I see land

795
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,760
divided down the middle

796
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,280
And the sides are divided

797
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,560
And divided again

798
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,300
I see so many people lonely

799
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,160
I see so many people lonely

800
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,160


801
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,340
Hating lover, friend against friend

802
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,140
Now I'm alone

803
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,360
I'm alone

804
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,960
And now I'm never going home

805
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,860
I am a man

806
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,540
Without a country

807
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,780
Without a home

808
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,800
I'm a casualty

809
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,860
Of the battle of the roses

810
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,620
And the war

811
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,660
Of the broken home

812
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,180
guitar solo

813
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,060
guitar solo

814
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,220
guitar solo

815
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,880
The path is the mask of love

816
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,080
A way, a way

817
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,940
The flow is the task above today

818
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,940
There is no other way

819
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,540
guitar solo

820
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,080
You gotta try

821
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,780
to trust us

822
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,480
When you need a friend

823
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,340
To find us

824
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,960
You gotta look within

825
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,880
You gotta trust us

826
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,660
You gotta trust us

827
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,080
Before you turn to dust

828
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,820
Before you turn to dust

829
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,520
You gotta see it

830
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,720
before you see it

831
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,280
You gotta see it

832
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,500
before you be it

833
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,040
You gotta see it

834
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,260
before you see it

835
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,960
guitar solo

836
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,600
Out of here without fear

837
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,300
Without a fear to reveal

838
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,400
You gotta touch without taste

839
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,000
Such is ill and I ain't his ain't

840
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,920
Such is ill and I ain't his ain't

841
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,140
guitar solo

842
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,100
Well for you

843
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,580
Of you

844
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,180
Of you

845
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,280
Of you

846
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,080
Of you

847
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,760
Of you

848
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:49,760


849
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,580
Of you

850
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,220
Of you

851
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,960
Of you

852
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,020
guitar solo

853
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,900

860
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,160
We're telling the truth, we love you

861
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,040
We're telling the truth, we love you

862
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:45,940
The path is you, it's a dying life

863
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,480
The path is life, it's a lying life

864
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,280
It's a lying life, it's a lying life

865
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,880
It's a dying life

866

Thank you.

875
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,960
And this is the great Herb Alpert.
