1
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,120
The Man Bitch Sony brand fake plastic midget custodian

2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,360
danced in spastic recoil from the candy-ass half-dick

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,740
with the darkly stained underoos pulled up snugly into a V-shape

4
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,520
and ever so delicately duct-taped to his filthy crusted midriff.

5
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,120
So, with a mighty yelp from his companion, the sentient unibrow Clive,

6
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,160
he spun about air-guitaring and screamed silently

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,540
in the fashion of the well-trained Man Bitch.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,960
After which, the crusty underoos-clad fellow

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,240
squatted and shatted potato onto the street where he stood twitching.

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,840
He then quickly stood stiff, locking his knees

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,040
and stretching one dirty hand high in the air

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,100
before thrusting it.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,740
With a bold movement of self-determined directness

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,140
down the front of his darkly stained underoos,

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,960
a look of confusion and bewilderment

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,460
screwed his face up into a tiny corner of his head

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,140
only to suddenly have it spring back

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,320
plastered with the pure joy of idiot bliss.

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,020
As the aforementioned crotch-searching appendage

20
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,400
was yanked from its hygienically dubious exploratory excursion

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,860
into the darkly stained underoos

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,220
clutching the weathered nub of a Crayola branch

23
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,120
piece of pastel purple chalk.

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,160
And before the midget could flatuate

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,120
or get born again or become a Scientologist

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,100
or a scientist

27
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,100


28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,700
he acted anyway.

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,360
The filthy fellow dropped to his knobby pockmarked knees

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,320
and quickly tore a circle around the potato

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,380
he had recently astonishingly shat

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,640
onto the street where he stood.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
The chalk continued with a frenzied hurried scratching.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
The potato began to twitch.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
The midget broke and leant with a high-pitched scream.

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,900
In front of his midget-modified tough-skinned trousers

37
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,020
grew a deeper shade of blue with his flood of terrified piss

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,140
just as the frantic chalky scribbling stopped to reveal

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,800
a scary mess of symbols from the anals of satanic potato dough.

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,680
Symbols that would later be translated as

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,600
The Hour of Swack.

42
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,760
The following broadcast is a subgenius production.

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,660
Gaiety galore and lots of fun even.

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,360
I wanna be sure that you find out about Bob.

45
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,520
Now Bob, tell us the truth.

46
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,480
Have I mentioned I'm immense and immortal?

47
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,680
Station Bremen and Station DXB on the 31 meter band.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,520
You are about to hear our news in English.

49
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,600
Now Bob, tell us the truth.

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,420
Alright you primitive screwheads, listen up.

51
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,340
You're a loony.

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,960
You're not going crazy.

53
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,360
You're going sane in a crazy world.

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,300
Now Bob, tell us the truth.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,840
This man is no ordinary man.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
Now Bob, tell us the truth.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
There can be only one.

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
Oooh, spooky.

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,620
Yeah, whatever.

60
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,780
And now, here with an unlimited supply of misinformation is Bob.

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,140
Okay man, start it up.

62
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,320
Swack.

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,780
She's there for a while or two so.

64
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,360
She's my little spoleo.

65
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,400
I can't help it.

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,900
Acting like a fool.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
She upsets me.

68
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,200
I done lost my cool.

69
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,080
Swack.

70
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,240
Oh.

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,380
She's my little spoleo.

72
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,840
You were bad, how you done it?

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,000
She's my little spoleo.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,420
Ah, slack by the coasters dear friends.

75
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,560
And before that some brand new titles.

76
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,280
A new title sequence by the El Queso All Stars.

77
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,120
Followed by a wonderful new collage by the Bishop.

78
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,080
And, uh, uh, uh.

79
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,080


80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,100
Actually friends, I'm not at the station yet.

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
I'm on my way there.

82
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,860
I'm gonna play a bunch more of the, uh, great X Day, 5X Day material that we recorded.

83
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,380
And some other new things.

84
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,960
But, uh, I'm not there yet.

85
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:15,660
So in the meantime, I'm gonna, uh, run this new studio version of a classic subgenius song.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,760
Off of a new album by Victoria Ganger and Revelry.

87
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,880
Uh, called Highly Irrevelent.

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,460
Uh, see.

89
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,340
RevelryChicks.com for info about, uh, uh, Highly Irrevelent.

90
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,340
Uh, actually that's the name of the album.

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,820
This song is The Marriage of Bob and Connie.

92
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,100
Oh, yeah.

93
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,100


94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,100


95
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,100


96
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,100


97
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,680
And, uh, uh, in the world of mating habits, I have seen it all and more.

98
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,340
I see the ninety-eight year old couple lock their walkers right on this floor.

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,040
I've seen communal carnal relations nearly turn into a mob.

100
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,600
But for a truly unique sensation, you get to turn to Connie and Bob.

101
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,060
Oh, I see.

102
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


103
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


104
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


105
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


106
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


108
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


109
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


110
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


111
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


112
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


113
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


114
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


115
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


116
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


117
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


118
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,060


119
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:33,140
It's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

120
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,580
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

121
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:54,040
I've seen a mating of the iguana On the rocks is what they prefer

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,420
While the sloths just like to hang around Hoping something will occur

123
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,300
And though the rabbit is most unsteady He is always ready once more

124
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,520
But when it comes to Bob and Connie There's no way of keeping score

125
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:19,160
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

126
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,020
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

127
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,460
La la la la la

128
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:28,820
Ay!

129
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,260
A dragonfly has balance A black widow has panache

130
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,100
But Bob and Connie got their hands On each other's personal stash

131
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,640
An anaconda has got constriction And a crocodile has her grin

132
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,020
But Bob and Connie are the same

133
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,600
They are the one true origin of sin

134
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:04,800
Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s It's the talk of all the abyss

135
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,180
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie In the Church of Subgenius

136
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,720
La la la la la Ay!

137
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,380
A dragonfly has balance A black widow has constriction

138
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:17,380


139
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,000
La la la la la Ay!

140
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,460
A dragonfly is happy to become Old àshe oui

141
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,060
Oh, what an amazing trop female

142
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,080
канал

143
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,320
Hello, hello New York Deed Garrida

144
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,100
so many combinations

145
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,980
The results are always this way

146
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:05,560
the same. So prepare to get it on in Bob and Connie's name. Oh, it's the miracle of the 90s.

147
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,420
It's the talk of all the obvious. It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the Church of

148
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:21,420
Subgenius. It's the miracle of the 90s. It's the talk of all the obvious. It's the marriage of Bob

149
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:30,920
and Connie in the Church of Subgenius. It's the miracle of the 90s. So prepare to get it on in Bob and Joh mengs.

150
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:39,780
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the Church of Subgenius. It's the miracle of the 90s. It's

151
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,640
the talk of all the obvious. It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the Church of Subgenius.

152
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,480
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

153
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,080
Achoo!

154
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,800
And Connie

155
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,160
La la la la la la

156
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,320
And Connie

157
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,560
La la la la la la

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,520
And Connie

159

La

160
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,580
But somebody is at the door

161
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,360
and I believe it's the Reverend Ivan Stang

162
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,820
who's coming up a little early tonight

163
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,560
bearing CDs of the event.

164
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,780
So I'm going to go get the door

165
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,560
and let the Reverend in

166
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,680
and we're going to be spinning some CDs here soon

167
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,340
to take you back in time a few days

168
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,820
to Brushwood Folklore Center

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,920
and 5X Day

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,100
presented by the Church of the Subgenius.

171
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,120
This one was written for Bob.

172
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,160
It's number is

173
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,180
13 of 13

174
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,860
This is the

175
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,280
most beautiful

176
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,860
thing

177
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,800
that I've ever

178
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:20,800


179
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:20,800


180
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
ever found

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
Tommy, you

182
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,620
are

183
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,180
the one

184
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,900
I consider

185
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,000
the greatest

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,800
gene

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,200
in the world

188
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,780
Old man

189
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,060
cash machine

190
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,920
Number

191
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,460
13

192
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,480
13

193
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,920
But

194
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,380
Did y'all hear about the fact that the Earth was literally almost destroyed on June 14th?

195
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:09,240
Did y'all hear about that asteroid 2002 MN, which passed by the Earth 75,000 miles?

196
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,500
That's closer than the moon.

197
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,780
And it was going real fast.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,220
They didn't know it had come by until three days later,

199
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,940
because it was coming from the direction of the sun.

200
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,280
And they only saw it as it was going away.

201
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,900
And these astronomers kind of went,

202
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,560
Oh, we just missed another Tunguska explosion.

203
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,560
It wouldn't have destroyed the planet, but it would have made cloudy days for 100 years.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,360
It might have wiped out some species.

205
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,100
Could have caused a chain reaction.

206
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,620
We could have hoped.

207
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,560
After it happened, Dr. LeHume said,

208
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,780
Yeah, I need to improve my meteor magnet.

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,520
But the point is, it made not a ripple on the news.

210
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,040
I found out about it because Chas emailed me.

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,700
And he found out about it because somebody emailed him.

212
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,320
It was, the British astronomer said,

213
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,020
It would have been like a bolt out of the blue.

214
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,560
We wouldn't have had a hint that it was coming.

215
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,760
Now, you know, God damn.

216
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,340
The next time they laugh at you for not escaping on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

217
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:18,860
you can laugh.

218
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,200
You can laugh back at them for not even knowing that they really were almost destroyed.

219
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,460
And most of them don't know it.

220
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,780
And the ones that do,

221
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,840
This is like a warning direct from Bob.

222
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,640
It was like Bob shot a warning shot right over their heads.

223
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,660
Or the exes, rather.

224
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,820
Did a little warning shot right over their heads.

225
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,160
Bam! You know, could have.

226
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,940
You know, could have.

227
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,960
Are you going to wise up?

228
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,460
No! Don't let it happen again.

229
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,120
That rock goes in an orbit.

230
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,700
It's going to come back around.

231
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,360
Are they going to do it any differently in the year 8661 or whatever when it comes back around?

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,240
Hell no.

233
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,260
Are they going to have their nuclear weapons?

234
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,740
Oh, they got all the Star Wars nuclear weapons up in space.

235
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,220
Bob-a-woof-woof.

236
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,140
Where are they pointing?

237
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,920
Down.

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,240
Where should they point?

239
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,780
Out!

240
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,620
Friends, has anybody thought about what if the Yaku-Tees might happen again here before the exits?

241
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:13,980
Hmm?

242
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,980
What if all this stuff isn't a bunch of sci-fi garbage?

243
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,920
Well, I mean, what if they're going to do it again?

244
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,800
What if, what if, I mean, people don't say that about the Bible, do they?

245
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,140
No.

246
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,820
Ah, well, fuck it.

247
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,140
Well, one thing is for certain.

248
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,540
It calls for a song.

249
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:36,020
And the song that we're calling for is the song of X Day Current.

250
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,720
That's the one that just passed, kids.

251
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,980
And remember, all the money that you invested in X Day is going to be returned to you in spades.

252
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,820
But triple your money back.

253
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,120
Triple your money.

254
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Upon death, if you die.

255
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,580
Of course, provided, uh, what, you said if you die.

256
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,160
Right.

257
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,220
Then you come to Bob and request your, triple your money back.

258
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,140
That's if you don't get eternal salvation.

259
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,440
The problem is how, you know, it takes a long time to determine whether you got the eternal salvation or not.

260
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:11,880
It's tricky.

261
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,480
Some people merely mistake eternal salvation and a drooly mouth as a cupcake for a standard of living.

262
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,220
Oh, that's close enough for me.

263
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,780
Of course, some people, that's all they, that's all they need.

264
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,260
But some people demand a much higher, more, more figure-ish standard.

265
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,940
Some people are part plant, part vegetable, part insect.

266
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,520
Some people are, uh, just closed off from the rest of the world.

267
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,520
And I find those the most interesting, don't you?

268
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,260
They're intriguing.

269
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,780
Yeah.

270
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,960
And we'd like to get them in the Church of the Subgenius, and we just, uh, we're not having any...

271
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,720
Yes, I know. Well, they're kind of distant.

272
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,340
Well, that's because we charge 30 bucks and they don't have it.

273
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,320
No, they can't come up with the green. I mean, and they are green, for crying out loud, at least a majority of them.

274
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,240
And some of the insects are multisexual.

275
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,280
They may be green, but their money is green.

276
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,920
And they may be multisexual, but their orifices are clean.

277
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,360
So let's sing about it, shall we, kids?

278
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,360
Let's sing!

279
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,880
I like to, to, to...

280
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,800
Oh, okay, okay, forget that song.

281
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,840
Oh, I like that song.

282
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,440
Did you like that song?

283
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,720
Yes, yes, by all means.

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Go on!

285
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,620
I like to wander, I like to, I like to keep my orifices clean.

286
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,700
And that's all I had so far.

287
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,240
That's all?

288
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:42,480
No, I... Well, I actually have ten more verses, but somebody says it's like Marty Robbins' you know, like, West Coast, town of El Paso, you know, like, last five hours and shit.

289
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,360
Whip it out, man!

290
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,320
Uh, could I just maybe play the song instead? Or...

291
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,480
Yeah.

292
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,040
Okay.

293
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,500
I like to keep both of my hands in my eyes, I like to keep, I like...

294
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,800
I don't know if I like that song anymore.

295
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,460
That's a... I like the voice you're doing that in.

296
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:04,600
Me?

297
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,660
That's a new one on me.

298
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:05,980
Ew!

299
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,640
That, that, uh, that castrato...

300
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,100
Yeah, that's just what it is.

301
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,180
It's, it, and that's how I thought I could make at least some sort of commiseration with the vegetable people and the insects and stuff.

302
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
You're a real man to do that to yourself.

303
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Yeah, a real man to castrate yourself. And you've gotta be a real he-man to remove your pundrages and your pundrages.

304
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,880
Absolutely.

305
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,000
Because, you know...

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,520
I heartily agree.

307
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:32,740
You have to wear them in a spiritual sense. Like, some people wear things on their sleeve, like their harness, the other people wear, like, you know, dangling or, or, for sure, gentile on their neck.

308
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,240
Yes.

309
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:46,100
And they have to keep, they have to keep their neck smooth. And there's all kinds of, like, um, not actual legislation, but just, like, encouragements given by the local authorities to make sure that they don't slide off.

310
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,740
Incentives.

311
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,620
Yeah, especially if you're on a bus or something and it's starting to slide off. Can you imagine?

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,440
Exactly!

313
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,500
I haven't been able to imagine since they gave me the blue ones.

314
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,900
This year at X-Day...

315
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,500
There were other events that deserve mention.

316
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,340
There were Red Guards and the Pope visited Panama.

317
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,360
And there was a marriage of a Marine and a maiden in the East Wing.

318
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,000
And there were trips and happenings and people who blew their minds.

319
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,620
And skydivers jumped over the wrong cliff, drowned in a lake.

320
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,660
Airliners crashed in Ohio.

321
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,220
And there was Francis Cardinal Spellman, Harold Pope, Conrad Abner, John Nance Guttman.

322
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,680
Clemenatia.

323
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,180
And there was J. Robert Oppenheimer.

324
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,100
And there was flower children.

325
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,700
LSD and marijuana.

326
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,700
Paper dresses and microscope.

327
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,040
The Hours catalog a year's living, a year's dying.

328
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,980
The Good Ship Lollipop sank.

329
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,420
And there were trips and happenings and people who blew their minds.

330
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,040
Hello, I am Owen Norwood.

331
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,680
encontra la pueda una la 겁니다

332
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,560
de esto.

333
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,340
There was about 50 to 75 glue tubes at least.

334
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,100
Put your nose right here.

335
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,120
Now.

336
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,680
Sniff.

337
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,220
Sniff again. Go ahead.

338
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,300
Think about the old ones who got this up.

339
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,020
Put themselves up a big bonfire. What do you think?

340
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,320
Danced in front of it.

341
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,640
Their shadows writhing on the walls.

342
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,380
Some sort of fertility ride or something.

343
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,840
Where you going, girl?

344
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,640
You want to dance with me?

345
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,960
Ooh, that old black magic has me in its spell.

346
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,540
You're an F-I-I-U-T-O-C-C-P.

347
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,380
I understand our neighbors would wish to turn the clock back to 1947.

348
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,760
The fact is, however, that most clocks move forward and not backward.

349
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,880
Ooh, a walking casualty that is really a confused fellow,

350
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:40,720
as many of the White House aides continue to pour out of the building like water through a sieve.

351
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,420
It's been a very, very, very tense afternoon here in downtown Washington, D.C.

352
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,480
As the evacuations continue, the Sergeant of Arms of the United States Senate has said repeatedly

353
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:04,540
that some of the blunderheads that he services in his back room have no longer the equipment with which to service themselves,

354
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,960
and it looks like as a democratic power that rules the world,

355
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,700
and keeps each one of these people out of the way,

356
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:17,040
and that we, as private citizens, now, we do and must and can and will have the power to continue continuing on,

357
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,220
whatever the consequences might be.

358
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,660
That's back to you in the corporate arm of your yesterday.

359
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,120
It's me, Mr. Armpit. Back to me. One more time.

360
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:36,600
Well, we've, uh, we're getting reports that the last report was not only, uh, misdocumented,

361
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
but the man on the scene there,

362
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,260
Bob Jarolha,

363
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:47,560
is actually a taxi driver

364
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,440
in an area, uh, somewhere in the Bay.

365
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,600
And also we ask, O Lord, in your name,

366
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,580
that we come closer,

367
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,320
to your own memories,

368
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,680
fresh out those answers and questions that perplex us throughout the country.

369
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,480
And what we should do as better?

370
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,500
Uh, yes, dear friends, what should we do as better?

371
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,220
Subdue the mind.

372
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,220
What must we do?

373
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,100
What has Bob left us to do?

374
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,180
What, what? We can fight. We must fight.

375
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,100
Fight or slack off, one or the other.

376
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,580
Give me food or give me slack or kill me.

377
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,440
Or kill-file me. Or let me go to sleep.

378
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,360
Or give me food.

379
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,000
Oh, this is so filthy.

380
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,000
It kills me. It makes me so sad.

381
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm, I'm wasted.

382
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,680
And I'm smoking a little,

383
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,020
a little pipe.

384
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,260
And I got, I got, I got killed.

385
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,980
I got killed. I believe it was something.

386
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,560
It was a blue, it was like a blue oil, like,

387
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,320
Vishnu, man. It was like, I, I, I don't know.

388
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,900
I've never taken that shit before, but like,

389
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,600
and he said, you can kill me.

390
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,640
I go, oh, and so I had us.

391
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,200
Sadness.

392
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,900
It'll be all right. It really will.

393
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,000
Of course it'll be all right.

394
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,820
Stand right there.

395
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,460
Take the full dose. Yeah.

396
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,560
Let it drip down the back of your neck.

397
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,900
That way it absorbs into your brain a little better.

398
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,400
When you see dogs that way, you know you're making direct contact.

399
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,640
Oh, you don't know how many subgeniuses have tried.

400
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,680
Years, years, thousands of years.

401
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,940
And none of them made that kind of...

402
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,120
But that's because they didn't have Bob on their side.

403
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,560
Repeat.

404
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,320
The United States is under nuclear attack.

405
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,900
Take cover immediately in your area of fallout shelter.

406
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,640
Now, now, now.

407
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,520
There'll be plenty of time for brain eating after we conquer Earth.

408
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,840
Now, children, I, I want you to sit down here against the wall.

409
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,740
Good monkey.

410
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,040
Now, crouch tight up against it.

411
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,900
Now, listen to this.

412
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,200
If they're dropping an atomic bomb, it may go off any second now.

413
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,140
Oh, great, great.

414
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,940
I'll give the signal when it's all right for us to get up.

415
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,700
If there's an explosion, we'll wait about a minute after it's all over.

416
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,940
Then we'll go upstairs and take a look around.

417
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,760
See if it's all right for us to clean up.

418
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,240
This is...

419
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,380
Oh, smooth.

420
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,940
Oh, great, great.

421
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,220
Children, you'd better clear up the broken glass and all this debris.

422
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,300
Ooh, good monkey.

423
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,460
All in all, I'd say we've been very lucky around here.

424
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,220
Nothing to do now but wait for orders from the authorities and relax.

425
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,720
Now, now, now.

426
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,620
There'll be plenty of time for brain eating after we conquer Earth.

427
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,300
The marijuana is the bomb.

428
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,480
Nip it in the bud.

429
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,080
You have consumed enough alcohol for one evening.

430
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,160
It is wasteful and pointless.

431
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,820
Obey me and live or disobey.

432
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,640
And die.

433
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,440
You suck!

434
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:35,900
Excuse me.

435
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,020
I don't know either of you gentlemen,

436
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,600
but I can't help but noticing that you're screwing everything up!

437
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,680
The subject was booked under Section 601,

438
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,900
in danger of leading an idle, dissolute, or immoral life.

439
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,900
Oh, smooth.

440
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,640
Well, as I was saying,

441
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,580
I wouldn't worry nearly as much about the atom bomb if it were to kill you right out.

442
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,720
What scares me is that awful gas that deforms you.

443
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,680
Yeah.

444
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,760
That would be bad.

445
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,220
Yeah.

446
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,140
Mr. Ryan, would you characterize this as a first strike weapon?

447
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,680
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

448
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,580
Uh, it is designed to approach by stealth and to shower its target with multiple independent warheads with little or no warning before impact.

449
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,740
Goddamn, things bring just a ton of war.

450
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,660
Hot dog, a worthy adversary!

451
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,940
Never before have so many known so little about a subject so big and so important.

452
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,800
The capabilities of most weapons are to be found in the hands of the enemy.

453
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,740
The weapons are pretty well understood,

454
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,480
but when it comes to atomic explosions, the guessing game starts.

455
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,840
All right, let's take a few minutes right now and get acquainted with an A-bomb.

456
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,240
Meet test A-bolt.

457
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,940
A submarine bomb exploded in a harbor might affect a city.

458
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,740
The affected area would be a poor picnic site,

459
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,440
but might be entered briefly or passed through quickly,

460
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,320
with a varying degree of risk.

461
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,960
Some of the falsehoods circulated about radiation effects are trivial, but upsetting.

462
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,980
They're beamed right at one's self-esteem.

463
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,320
Enough exposure to radiation will cause loss of hair.

464
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,560
The treatment, if you'd insist, would be symptomatic.

465
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,560
A toupee.

466
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,300
But the condition would only be temporary.

467
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,880
Your hair would come back.

468
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,000
Same color, same cowlick.

469
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,780
Which puts the finger squarely upon one of the major fallacies in the public attitude toward atomic bombs.

470
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,880
The fallacy of devoting 85% of one's worrying capacity

471
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,240
to an agent that constitutes only about 15% of an atomic bomb's destroying potential.

472
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,140
And that's unsound.

473
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,460
Doesn't fit.

474
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,280
Excuse me while I whip this out.

475
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,960
You ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

476
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,780
You take the blue pill.

477
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,540
The story ends.

478
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,760
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you believe.

479
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,200
You want to be.

480
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,200
You take the red pill.

481
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
You stay in Wonderland.

482
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,840
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

483
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,180
Slight show. Boring. Losing consciousness.

484
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,460
Or consciousness.

485
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,780
Or consciousness.

486
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,020
Or consciousness.

487
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,800
Da Bomb by DJ Epoch.

488
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,240
And before that, some ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB in Cleveland

489
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,920
with Professor Chaz Smith and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

490
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,140
I just spent a bunch of time with those lads at the Starwood Festival.

491
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,660
Heard here in the background.

492
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,180
The big pagan festival.

493
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,920
We'll have some recordings from that next week.

494
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:53,180
The collage that we heard, the X-Day news collage, was by Soso Dada.

495
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,260
That was called Soso Dada's X-Day.

496
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,220
And the half rant you heard was by...

497
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,440
Yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

498
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,080
At 5X Day, before I caught this cold.

499
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,680
I have a Starwood cold.

500
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,520
If I sound funny, that's why.

501
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,540
Normally, of course, we don't sound funny.

502
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:22,900
And the very top, Saint N, did that song 13013 that was excerpted.

503
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,180
And we've got some more ESO music coming up.

504
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

505
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,380
Da Bomb.

506
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,740
Let's leave things of this world behind.

507
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,780
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

508
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,320
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

509
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,300
Now let's look in the Book of the Subgenius, Prescripture 614.

510
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:54,540
And yea, even the banks shall topple in the end times when these preachers of Bob Dobbs shall come.

511
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,580
And it shall wash away the filth and the unclean seed with the new seed,

512
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:09,120
upon which the mobile homes of the subgeni shall float and be carried on high with their party equipment, chainsaws and scalpels.

513
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:15,840
Yea, lo, those doctors for Bob shall float o'er Mount Interfirst and achieve slackdomness.

514
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,400
Now, friends, what do these lines from the Prescriptures mean?

515
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,900
It doesn't make any difference what they mean.

516
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:29,120
You just better learn them and memorize them, friends, if you want Bob Dobbs to forgive you for what you did to him.

517
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,120
Praise Bob. Let there be slack.

518
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,320
Put your hand on the top of the lower.

519
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,640
The buddy man's got a hammer'm icons all over the land.

520
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,840
Dear friend, my own foundation's the same.

521
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,260
But I'm your animal sometimes.

522
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:26,280
Whoever you might believe to call 53 will swallow my putting впow Japan 3,000 people would see this as a kind of kickin.

523
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,340
Thank you for tunneling my Prianut Spain and don't ever forget my name rap to Queen Joanne there

524
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,800
Now they're back again.

525
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,020
Those freaking kids on that shit again.

526
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,520
Oh, man, they stay up all night and it's stupid looking Dobbs head.

527
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
I'm going for the firebomb now.

528
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,260
Friends, get on that spaceship and ride, ride, ride with the Sub-Z and Bob.

529
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,360
Ha!

530
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,400
Yee-haw!

531
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,420
The unbalancing that happens when you work with these people

532
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,080
makes you really question what you know reality is.

533
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,900
I was thinking about like if the Beatles were all like actually poultry, you know, and stuff like that.

534
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,720
Hey, do you have any more of those cool X-Day songs?

535
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,880
Oh, yeah, sure.

536
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,400
They sound just like the Beatles.

537
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,220
Yeah, do another cool X-Day song.

538
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:15,680
The Beatles that reminded me.

539
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,680
Oh.

540
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm trying to dance to that.

541
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:51,280
I once had an X-Day, or should I say X-Day had me.

542
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,080
I went there to...

543
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,440
Then I turned blue in the cold.

544
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,520
I laughed and I laughed till my neck began to explode.

545
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,820
The frequencies louder, the nodules were pulling my toe.

546
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,080
Toe.

547
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,260
Oh, I'll never go back.

548
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:24,580
Back.

549
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,440
If I take crack.

550
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,740
I just, it's not in me tonight.

551
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,980
I thought it was going to be in me.

552
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,900
Oh, man, it was flowing.

553
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,780
It was flowing.

554
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,720
I planted the mushrooms.

555
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,340
Dude.

556
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,380
I was singing all the way here.

557
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,600
I can't believe you stopped.

558
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,620
That was really, it was flowing, dude.

559
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,260
Okay.

560
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,280
How do you like me?

561
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,160
Flamenco sounds?

562
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:42,940
Yeah.

563
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,100
Yeah.

564
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:46,920
Thousands.

565
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,180
Thousands of thousands of people.

566
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,520
Like, you know, Spanish Civil War song.

567
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:52,960
Yeah, yeah.

568
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,020
Yeah, I think you're fighting a fascist.

569
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,520
At least with bad breath.

570
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,720
Thousands of needy exes.

571
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,340
Place your fingers on the balls and scream, I am the nexus.

572
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,780
Okay, I'm done with that.

573
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Wow.

574
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,460
Boy, I feel lubricated.

575
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,380
I at least experienced.

576
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,920
Expunged for something.

577
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,500
That's the least expunged thing I've heard in quite a while.

578
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,300
That's really, really.

579
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,240
Well, you know, I could always come back to it, you know, and do it for the next 15 minutes

580
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,600
solid if you guys want it, you know.

581
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,860
You know, I'm just trying to know you guys aren't into music too much, so.

582
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,100
Monkey play in the jungle.

583
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,980
Robot work in the factory.

584
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,900
They will have a giant rumble.

585
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,140
Monkey versus robot.

586
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,960
Monkey versus robot.

587
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,680
Monkey hate technology.

588
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,540
Robot hate the monkey.

589
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,420
They will fight eternally.

590
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,140
Monkey versus robot.

591
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,960
Monkey versus robot.

592
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:24,960


593
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,720
Robot Monkey mates in the jungle

594
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:35,080
Robot replicated factory They both love their mother

595
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,620
Why must they hate each other?

596
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,860
Why can't we all get along?

597
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,640
Would that be oh so wrong?

598
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,460
Why can't we all love each other?

599
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,760
Monkey and a robot brother

600
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,740
Monkey vs. Robot

601
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,660
Monkey vs. Robot

602
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,480
Monkey and a robot brother

603
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:17,420
Monkey and a robot brother

604
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,720
Monkey and a robot brother

605
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,940
Monkey, Robot, M-O-N-K-E-Y

606
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:32,340
Monkey, R-O-P-R-O-B-O-T

607
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,980
Monkey, Robot, M-O-N-K-E-Y

608
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Monkey, R-O-P-R-O-B-O-T

609
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,740
James Kochalka, superstar for Monkey vs. Robot.

610
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,140
From the album by the same name.

611
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,840
One of my very favorite songs on Tarkin Records.

612
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,180
James Kochalka is the same as the cartoonist James Kochalka.

613
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,120
And you can reach him.

614
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,420
Get that pencil ready.

615
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,260
This is him.

616
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:19,880
James Kochalka at P.O. Box 8321 Burlington, Vermont 054.

617
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,580
052.

618
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,120
That's very Devo, friends.

619
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:34,520
And speaking of Devo, there is the third of the Devo conventions or the devotional 2002.

620
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:43,200
It's coming up August 10th all day on Saturday at Princess Wee.

621
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:50,920
That would be at the Starwood Center, 712 East 185th Street.

622
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,120
Okay.

623
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,940
In Cleveland, Ohio.

624
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,840
Yes.

625
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,760
And again, that's all day, August 10th.

626
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,880
I think there's, I'm sure there's some kind of a charge for it.

627
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,200
It's great.

628
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,400
I was at the last two.

629
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:13,500
And they've never been able to get any of the Devos out there except the first, from the very first order, the earliest evolution.

630
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,320
The first ones to crawl out of the water.

631
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,860
Jungle Jim Mothersbaugh, the little known first.

632
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,620
The first drummer is there, will be there, was there last time.

633
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,640
He's actually a real funny guy.

634
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,880
And General Boy.

635
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,020
Yes, the progenitor and sire.

636
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,160
A friend and a brother.

637
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,000
A monkey and a robot.

638
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,900
When are you going to learn how to use the phones?

639
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,740
There's like 50 people calling right now.

640
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,340
No, I can't.

641
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,600
I'm not going to.

642
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,760
God, I've never seen so many lights dancing.

643
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,740
And I'm not going to.

644
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,980
Dancing in front of my eyes.

645
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,960
The dancing lights of the telephone.

646
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,120
Just trying to get them.

647
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,320
That's true.

648
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,020
Did you take the pixie acid when you were in Snorwood?

649
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,820
The pixie?

650
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm not sure about the pixie.

651
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,580
I don't remember.

652
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,260
The pixie acid makes, gives you a real.

653
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,560
Did you ever pick your toes in Poughkeepsie?

654
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,500
Of course.

655
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:02,980
Uh huh.

656
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,440
Okay.

657
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,920
Thought so.

658
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,240
Why did he ask me like a psychic question like that?

659
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,100
He asked that.

660
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,180
Doesn't, isn't it obvious?

661
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,600
You look like the kind.

662
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,980
Of course I did, man.

663
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,580
Did you ever, did you ever buy any pie in Peekskill?

664
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,420
Come on.

665
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,420
I don't need to.

666
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,540
I don't, that's rather a personal question.

667
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,140
I don't.

668
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Everybody's had a.

669
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,340
Slice or two in Peekskill, Stan.

670
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,520
Why do you want to know?

671
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,160
That muddy old Hudson River gives your glands strange ideas.

672
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,100
As if they could speak.

673
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,740
Yes, your glands have ideas of their own.

674
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,920
No, don't they though?

675
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,600
Boy, yes.

676
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,520
You wanted to control them.

677
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,060
They, they.

678
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,880
They do though.

679
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,360
Sometimes they're going to the left.

680
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,200
You're going to the right.

681
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,080
Sometimes they're going straight down the middle and you're taking the back roll.

682
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,060
Sometimes they're tubby.

683
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,040
Sometimes they're friendly.

684
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,660
Sometimes they're very thin, like shards of glass.

685
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,680
Ow.

686
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,400
Your glands have a life of their own.

687
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,600
Praise Bob.

688
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:56,960
Praise Bob.

689
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,940
Oh God.

690
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,580
One of my glands.

691
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,000
One more landscaping from the.

692
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,280
One of my glands just about came out.

693
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,920
Well, I'm running mine now.

694
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,340
Ew.

695
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,820
And I have a full of, what do they call it, agreement.

696
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,320
What's the name of those agreements?

697
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:11,940
Like a.

698
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,740
Yes.

699
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,640
A pre-lease, pre-sale lease agreement.

700
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,940
A shrimdendon.

701
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,160
Yeah, like a shrimdendon.

702
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,440
Yeah.

703
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,660
But some of it causes fuzz on your pants.

704
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,660


705

Oh.

714
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,120
There he is, honey.

715
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,640
He believes that you will put the word of God down and you will quit.

716
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,140
Now remember, Ephesians 6 says that the sword is the word of the spirit.

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:20,620


755
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:33,760
That collage there was by Lee Moore, but now what follows is the complete rant from 5X Day of Popes Lilith von Frau Mitch.

756
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:46,860
Friends, it's become obvious to me that political correctness, despite its reputation as a literal circle jerk,

757
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:53,420
cuts both ways, because it's clearly politically correct these days to hate Muslims.

758
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:02,680
Not that I blame anyone. I mean, after September 11th, the West has started to look at the Muslim world as it's developed in the past few decades

759
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,380
and have freaked out that anybody could be living in such a backwards, regressive, oppressive society.

760
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,460
Unlike ours, of course.

761
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,840
But that's easy for us to say as we live in our glass skyscraper homes.

762
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:22,040
We're throwing stones off the roof at the slopeheads and the towelheads running amok below.

763
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,020
And then we act outraged when they throw the stones back at us.

764
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,980
But, Lil, some of you are probably asking, don't you hate religion?

765
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,720
I mean, Islam is a religion, so if you're subgenius, surely you have to hate Islam, right?

766
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,100
Well, honestly, I don't particularly like Muslims.

767
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,340
They're mostly religious nuts.

768
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,840
And worse, they're competitive.

769
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,120
They're competitors.

770
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:52,840
But when you get down to it, aren't we all religious nuts?

771
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,040
I mean, the atheists are as bad as the Catholics, are as bad as the Scientologists,

772
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:05,180
are as bad as the Sikhs, are as bad as the Jews, are as bad as your nutty old grandmother

773
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,480
who knows in her heart that Jesus will come back any day now.

774
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,260
Yes, I don't particularly like Muslims, but I don't particularly hate them either.

775
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,780
No more than I particularly hate any religion.

776
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,320
I don't particularly like any religious group.

777
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,220
They're all concerned about one invisible monster or another, and that suits me just

778
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,180
fine, because I know that in the final analysis.

779
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,380
They're all screwed to the wall with nuclear-powered corkscrews anyway.

780
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:40,180
Anything that gives hope to people is fine to me, because it's better than having a world

781
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,020
full of six billion pinks with absolutely nothing to lose.

782
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:54,200
I mean, at least religion, for all of its ballyhooed, voodoo, doo-doo, and its neurosis-inspiring

783
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:01,000
fantasies, keeps some of them from going ape-rematurely and killing everybody who might have a contrary

784
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,560
opinion.

785
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:09,320
There is something to be said for a feared hell, even if we'll all wind up there someday,

786
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:16,760
even if Bob has installed air conditioners and set up casinos and amusement parks there,

787
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:16,760


788
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,080
and even if the demons are all animatronic rubber mock-ups of the pre-recorded soundtrack.

789
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:29,480
No, religion is not the enemy, although it's certainly no friend of mine either.

790
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:37,320
The real enemy where I stand, and according to the one true word among the much-off-the-cuff

791
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,740
bullshit of J.R. Bob Dobbs, is the God-damned conspiracy.

792
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:44,760
Amen!

793
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,240
Yes!

794
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,200
Oh, you've heard of them, I wager, sometime, in between the promises of slack, fraud,

795
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,080
sex hurt, alien intervention, and all that.

796
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,000
But from the way some of you act, I can't help but think that you've fingered the wrong

797
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,180
damn conspiracy!

798
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:09,540
See, it's easy to convince yourself that the conspiracy has a recognizable face, that it's

799
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:15,540
run, for instance, by the rich white men with a never-slate thirst for oil, or that it's

800
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,820
run by the media companies, or Hollywood, or the Jews, or Muslims, or Freemasonry, or

801
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,700
the Vatican, or the British Crown, or by invisible monsters trying to bring forth Armageddon,

802
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,080
or by fill-in-the-blank.

803
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,200
But no!

804
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:39,220
For the real conspiracy, what we mean by THE conspiracy, is the forces behind even those

805
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,380
conspiracies.

806
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,700
It's a conspiracy that's too dumb to realize it is a conspiracy.

807
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:52,280
And so avoids detection, even as its slimy tentacles slither into every nook and cranny

808
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,520
of everybody's lives!

809
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:00,800
For the conspiracy isn't made up of religions or political groups, or even of people!

810
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,120
The real conspiracy, when you get down to it, can be summed up in two words.

811
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,520
Bad wiring.

812
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,680
It's the conspiracy that lurks inside every single conspiracy!

813
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,520
It's the conspiracy that makes every hairless monkey, regardless of the influence of even

814
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,520
Yeti genetics, that gives those invisible monsters a shake and makes their followers

815
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,080
act like devolved murderous bastards!

816
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,000
There are noble impulses in almost every religion, but by the time that wretched, sneaky conspiracy

817
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:42,440
behavioral programming gets done with religion or any good idea, it almost invariably looks

818
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,420
like a bum deal to somebody.

819
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,100
Because the follower types then get violently zealous and make even the greatest ideas

820
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,260
seem like the work of idiots.

821
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Think about it for a second.

822
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:03,100
What are the most basic programs that people run through their internal computer every

823
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,480
day?

824
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,760
Well they are EAT OR BE EATEN!

825
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,000
DOMINATE OR SUBMIT!

826
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,960
UNDERSTAND OR BE STUPID!

827
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,660
BE GOOD OR BE BAD!

828
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,300
And I don't care how enlightened any of you claim to be, if you haven't wrestled with

829
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,700
this basic programming, if you haven't tried to come up with alternatives to these dualities,

830
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:38,300
then you too have become both victim and pawn of the conspiracy that drives all other conspiracies.

831
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,420
Whether it's the conspiracy to defraud millions of their birthright, or the conspiracy to

832
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:48,340
put your sleeping roommate's hand in a bucket of warm water so he'd pee himself.

833
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,660
This is why I wrote back in 1992 that the ultimate conspiracy theory was that there were

834
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:03,140
over 6 BILLION conspiracies on this planet, and even that number was pitifully low because

835
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:05,580
I was only including the hairless monkeys.

836
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:12,400
And let's face it, even the most yeti-like among us is at least 50% of the world's yeti-like

837
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:12,400


838
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,500
monkeys.

839
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:20,700
Nothing to be ashamed of, really, but it means that you are a slave of the conspiracy

840
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,840
no matter what!

841
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,400
Unless!

842
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:32,300
Unless you go back to those dualities and add some magic mojo to that mix.

843
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,700
Unless you toss a monkey wrench into the monkey works, and that monkey wrench is...

844
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,960
SLACK.

845
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,380
For only then can you be a real monkey.

846
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:48,900
And slacking is the ability to disclude itself, and thus giving you a true option.

847
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,620
Thus some of us can indeed find slack even in the most conspiracy-drenched pursuits,

848
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,740
because we can slack off by NOT slacking off.

849
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:06,220
Thanks to slack, we always have an option against the conspiracy's own internalized programming.

850
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:09,760
Eat, or be eaten, or SLACK OFF!

851
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,360
Dominate, or suck!

852
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,200
Submit, or SLACK OFF!

853
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,960
Understand, or be stupid, or SLACK OFF!

854
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,500
Be good, or be bad, or SLACK OFF!

855
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,220
Goddammit, what will it take to get through your heads?

856
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:35,080
Every time that you find yourself wrestling with the urge to throttle someone, including yourself,

857
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,200
every time you find yourself stuck between two equally grim scenarios,

858
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,920
every time you find yourself indecisive about what you should do,

859
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,100
I ask you to remember the option to SLACK OFF!

860
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,900
Nay, I DEMAND that you remember the option to slack off!

861
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,420
I get on my knees and plead with you!

862
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,140
I beg of you to remember that you can always slack off!

863
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,900
I pray and I cry that you never forget that option,

864
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,960
because the conspiracy will never tell you that you have the option!

865
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,400
EVER!

866
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,780
Only JR Bob Dobbs will tell you that!

867
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,460
Only Bob has the guts to stand up to their monkey DNA robot gangster wetware ball crap

868
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,660
and step right in it!

869
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,200
And ride into the ground!

870
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,060
And dance upon it!

871
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:34,240
And then, and then, until there's nothing left but a mere moist spot on the ground,

872
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,260
and then wipe his damn feet on the labrum rug of pink boy sensibilities,

873
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,020
and...

874
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,720
What's that Bob?

875
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,340
I can slack off now?

876
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,900

883
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,860
Have you heard the bellow of a Bob White calling

884
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,000
in the diesel in the Appalachian Mines?

885
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,020
The look with awe and wonder drifting way up high

886
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,880
where men who braved a hard new world

887
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,320
first stepped on the diesel in the city dock?

888
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:04,920
Do you think of them when you stroll along a rock way high?

889
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,460
Have you seen the mighty Peet?

890
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:10,840
Have you seen an eagle roll along Missouri's shore?

891
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,140
Have you felt it rage along the shore?

892
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,980
Is the word, why am I a reef?

893
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,960
From Alaska's Everglades to Maine

894
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,140

896
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,420
You ask me why I love it?

897
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,900
I have a million Appalachian Mines

898
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,080

Let's go to the Whisstler Freeride roadway

905

906
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:58,340

Oh, yes, chopped up.

913
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,480
That piece there was chopped up by Fernanda Nellie Murr.

914
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,220
And, in fact, after the ESO sign-off coming up,

915
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,180
we shall hear Lee Murr actually singing,

916
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,640
as well as an ending piece of Loops by Heart Ignition,

917
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,300
if Dave remembers.

918
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:37,900
When they did the key change, I was a very young man.

919
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,780
It was the first time I was in Carnegie Hall.

920
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,600
Oh, yeah?

921
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,580
I beat up an elderly woman in the Bronx to get the money.

922
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,080
No!

923
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,560
And I took the Flatbush Avenue rat train,

924
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,240
and I smoked my way all the way there.

925
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:52,800
Oh, man!

926
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,820
The first person they greeted me naturally

927
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,920
was the seemingly defunct doorman.

928
00:52:59,340 --> 00:52:59,820
Yeah.

929
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,020
Still standing there.

930
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,160
Proud of his pubis.

931
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,260
His neck was swollen, much like the same, you know,

932
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,420
the people with the pustules.

933
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,280
But I just passed on by.

934
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,120
I gave him a wink and a nod, and there it was.

935
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,560
That big, fat, freaking head.

936
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,640
You know what I'm talking about?

937
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,280
Yeah!

938
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,960
With the pipe coming out of the nose.

939
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:19,380
Yeah!

940
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,620
I lost it, you know?

941
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,200
Man!

942
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,640
I couldn't focus for a week.

943
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,760
Oh, my God, I would have just died right there.

944
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,620
And riding the trains made me incontinent.

945
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,460
So there it was.

946
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,680
I couldn't see anything or hold my bowders.

947
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,920
And I was, you know, dreaming about this face

948
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,040
in the middle of the night.

949
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:35,580
Yeah, Butterfield.

950
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,180
Yeah, Butterfield.

951
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,080
Yeah.

952
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,220
Yeah, Butterfield.

953
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,880
Yeah, Butterfield.

954
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,380
Yeah, Butterfield.

955
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:41,680
Yeah, Butterfield.

956
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,240

957
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,680
Yeah, Butterfield, man.
