00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,340
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slash.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:17,440
We returned alive from both the X-Day Drill and the Starwood Festival with some 20 odd hours of recordings.

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,840
The sorting and editing of all that audio is going to take some time.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:36,800
So for this episode, we're taking the easy way out by stealing Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB Cleveland, Radio Sinesthesia, from June 28th of the year the conspiracy calls 2015.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:50,880
Dr. Howell, yours truly, Reverend Stang, Princess Wee, and Lonesome Cowboy Dave were all guests, along with a type of creature that the Hour of Slash rarely attempts to domesticate, callers.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,760
And this is only the first half of Dr. Sinister's two-hour show.

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,660
Praise Bob.

8
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,280
The saucers are coming, my friends. The saucers are coming. The end of the world is nigh.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,480
Pucker your lips for apocalypse and kiss your ass goodbye.

10
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,540
Ew.

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:20,860
This is the end of the world.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,620
This could perhaps be the series finale of Sinesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

13
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,660
I'm your host, Dr. Sinister, and the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,240
Thanks for having us on the show, Dr. Sinister.

15
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,200
It is my pleasure.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,120
I hope we don't die.

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,920
Well, we all hope that.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,620
But as you said, we may die.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,840
Yes, we may, but we also must strive to bring our last-minute message of good news to the assembled glyphosate.

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,480
Glistening listeners.

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,380
That's right.

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,700
You may die. We didn't say we may die.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,920
Are they glistening listeners?

24
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,120
They should be by now in the hottest year on record.

25
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,520
I guess so.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,360
As they exude certain primal fluids.

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:13,740
And it is only fair, before the ultimate heat that's coming, that they relax and prepare to sweat a little bit.

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,120
It makes me moist.

29
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:15,880
Yeah.

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,620
For those of you who have not figured it out yet, my special guests in the studio this evening are...

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,600
Dr. Howland Owl, Princess We Are Doe, and the Reverend Ivan Stang.

32
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,160
That's not like having the Pope on your show.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,920
That's like having St. Peter on your show.

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,500
I gotta say.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,480
But I can't go.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,680
I owe my soul to the company store.

37
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, well.

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,040
Well, how much did they pay for it?

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,660
That'll all be hashed out in the after reckoning.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,920
So to speak.

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,120
The interest is still building on that, Mr. Owl.

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,800
You see...

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:58,980
You have to stand in front of a giant panorama movie screen in front of the entire universe while they show every bad thing that you ever did.

44
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,740
And then...

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:02:59,960
Oh, goodness.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,120
You have to go through a suspicious-looking cave-like hole to the right of the celestial throw room with smoke coming out.

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,920
And it doesn't look good.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:19,220
The alley-oop angel gives you the heave-ho into the lake of fire, and you land right next to Hitler and begin your sentence.

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,760
I like to go wakeboarding.

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,580
I like to go wakeboarding on the lake of fire.

51
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,260
You have to have an asbestos wakeboard, of course.

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
In the subgenius hell.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,920
By the time you get to the lake of fire, you don't have to worry about mesothelioma anymore.

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,060
The best of subgenius.

55
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,700
We did it as best as we can.

56
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,980
It could be that the subgenius hell is the same as the Christian hell.

57
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,740
It's just the subgeniuses are the demons.

58
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:48,820
Well, that has been offered as a sop to subgenius vanity in the past.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,640
Well, it's just a...

60
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,840
It's just a break you in.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,980
It's just a break you in and get you ready for subgenius heaven, which is so much even more fun than tormenting normals.

62
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,860
Because let's face it, eternity gets boring.

63
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,220
All the gods had to go off.

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:11,740
Well, yes, eternity is boring, and it bores away the last part of you, which is uncomfortable by timelessness.

65
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,040
Some of my favorite jokes start off with a guy dies and ends up in hell.

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,720
That's hilarious to start with.

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,500
Yeah, it's funny as hell, literally.

68
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,660
But, you know, I mentioned this, I think, before, and yes, you know, I hate to repeat myself,

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,040
but there's a Jack T. Chick comic where maybe you've seen this one.

70
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,740
A virtuous woman goes to heaven, and she's welcomed, and the angel says,

71
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,600
Welcome to heaven, you know.

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,440
It's good that you led a relatively sin-free life and asked for Jesus to come into your heart, which is most important.

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,980
Now, let me show you where you're going to live for eternity.

74
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,820
Oh, well, blessed be...

75
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,380
Wait a minute, what are you showing me?

76
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,000
This is like a windowless garage.

77
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,540
I have to live in this for all eternity?

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,020
I mean, I know it is in heaven.

79
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,540
Well, that's because you never witnessed anyone.

80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,980
You see, you hid your light under a bushel, and you could have brought many good souls to Jesus,

81
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,200
but instead you didn't.

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,820
Even though you yourself were blameless, now you have to live in the outskirts of heaven, in this garage,

83
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,020
and better not complain too much.

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,640
You are in heaven, after all.

85
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,440
My mercy.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,820
If we don't sin, then Jesus...

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,740
Jesus died for nothing.

88
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,700
Yes, it's all that matter of sin.

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,180
It's all solved on the cross.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,000
So, do whatever you want.

91
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,540
Just, at the proper moment, you've got to bow and kowtow and knuckle under to that almighty spirit.

92
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,360
To bow and sue for grace with suppliant knee and deify his power.

93
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,980
But not in the Church of the Subgenius, of course.

94
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,200
We don't hold with all that un-American truckling.

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,600
And kowtowing and scraping and so forth.

96
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,160
We're Americans.

97
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,040
A real man walks up to God, thrusts out his hand and says,

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,800
Put her there, Lord.

99
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,580
Here.

100
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,100
We're equals, right?

101
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,020
Let's see what you got.

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,580
Yeah, show me what you got, buddy.

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,300
You know, speaking of witnessing, there are a lot of people who listen to this program week in and week out

104
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,240
who are not as familiar with the Church of the Subgenius as some of the other listeners.

105
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,020
Well, they're all going to burn.

106
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,140
They're going to burn.

107
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,040
It's as simple as that.

108
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,540
Yeah, they don't understand it.

109
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,180
So, this might be a good opportunity to just explain what this is.

110
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,180


111
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,180


112
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,180


113
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,520
This is what this is all about.

114
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,660
Now, you know, Jesus said he is the Alpha and Omega.

115
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,480
But, you know, J.R. Bob Dobbs is both the mouth and anus of the universe.

116
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,000
I call that much more of an Alpha and Omega than Jesus.

117
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,740
That's what makes him so ferocious.

118
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,300
He's on the worm plan.

119
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
It's frustrating.

120
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,840
But he is the one and the all.

121
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,480
He is both and everything.

122
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:44,940
He's Bob.

123
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,440
That's right.

124
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,500
That's right.

125
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,580
And, frankly, there's no avoiding him.

126
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,240
And Bob sold it.

127
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:51,820
I smoked it.

128
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,500
That settles it.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,980
So high.

130
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,140
And Bob can sell just about anything to anyone.

131
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,260
You know, he is also the patron saint of sales.

132
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,980
A lot of people don't know that.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,700
He has luck.

134
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,260
He surfs the luck plane.

135
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,920
And that gives him slack.

136
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,320
Or maybe because he has slack, he can surf the luck plane.

137
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,260
He was the saint of salesmen before he was a prophet.

138
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,180
He was a mortal who had seemingly magical sales abilities.

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,620
But he was immaculate.

140
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,280
He actually did sell snow to Eskimos.

141
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:24,620
But he did.

142
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:32,660
He was, after his immaculation, after being lifted up by the scruff of the neck by that

143
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,600
great dog owner, Jehovah One.

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,380
And he heard the pre-scriptures at that time.

145
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,300
He had shown those things which are to come.

146
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,240
Yes.

147
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,040
Then he was more than just a salesman.

148
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,400
He was a salesman and more.

149
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,900
A preacher, perhaps, among other things.

150
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,180
You know one sad thing.

151
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,180


152
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,180


153
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,040
Sure, sure, Bob was a pimp.

154
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,480
But most more than...

155
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,020
He's walked in the shoes of the pimp.

156
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,460
He's walked in the shoes of the sinner.

157
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,820
But most importantly, he's walked in the shoes of the shoe salesman.

158
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,600
He has walked in the shoes of the pimp with the platforms and the goldfish swimming around inside of him.

159
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,820
He's done that.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,660
He has.

161
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,720
He's walked in beautiful high pumps.

162
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,000
All dressed up like a beautiful girl.

163
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,600
I have seen Bob, you know, in person before.

164
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,740
He was walking into this coffee shop.

165
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,820
And he had his pipe, of course, which we all know is permanently attached.

166
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,500
Ah, the pipe.

167
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,500
And woe be to anyone who dare mess with the pipe.

168
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,600
Someone told him, hey, you can't smoke in here.

169
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,860
Who dares?

170
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,020
The barista dared tell Bob that he could not smoke in the coffee shop.

171
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,660
Oh, somebody.

172
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,240
And he, you know, it didn't work out so well.

173
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,420
They actually ended up kicking him out.

174
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,720
And they threw him into the street right as a bus came by.

175
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Where the hell did this all happen?

176
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,120
This happened just a couple of years ago.

177
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,380
Oh, okay.

178
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,580
Yeah, I saw it myself.

179
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,900
And they threw him out just as a bus was going by.

180
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,100
Yeah, and the bus ran him right over.

181
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,800
We went out to look for him.

182
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,940
He was gone.

183
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,920
He dis-corporated.

184
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,780
Then I was walking home there.

185
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,900
And I turned the corner and there he was again.

186
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,340
And he was looking great.

187
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,200
And gesticulating.

188
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,720
And he suddenly had a million dollar check in his hand.

189
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,780
Waving and winking.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,800
From the settlement for being hit by the bus.

191
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,700
See?

192
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,700
Well, as long as it happens in the settlement.

193
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,700


194
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,180
I guess it's all right.

195
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,860
But, uh, that Bob.

196
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,800
Whatever happens, happens to be what Bob wanted to happen anyway.

197
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,780
Just happens that way.

198
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,740
You see, Bob surfed the luck plane.

199
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,480
But although we should also do that.

200
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,320
And do do that.

201
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,460
One should remember that when one is surfing anything.

202
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,660
There are times that you wipe out.

203
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,740
But for the most part you can surf the luck plane.

204
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,340
And then you get back on the board.

205
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,000
And wipe the sand out of your crevice.

206
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,520
And move on to the next.

207
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,360
Phase of surfing the luck plane.

208
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,960
I hate when sand gets in the crevice.

209
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,960
Yes.

210
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,900
Well, uh.

211
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
It's sometimes.

212
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,740
You wish that they were sand.

213
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,140
Sand in the crevice wasn't a bad band.

214
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,040
They, their first two albums were great.

215
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,420
Yeah, you're right.

216
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,140
It was just after, you know.

217
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,600
They were okay.

218
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,420
They were really funny.

219
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,560
After they got popular, sand in the crevice was, you know, they were lame.

220
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah, I could dance to it.

221
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:10,720
Yeah.

222
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,160
After they were on Smothers Brothers, they went downhill.

223
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,560
Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,560
You know, fame does that to you.

225
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,460
Sand in the crevice.

226
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:18,720
Mm.

227
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,500
It was an itchy band.

228
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,460
So we actually do have phone lines open if anybody has any questions or comments or concerns

229
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,460
about the coming end of the world here.

230
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,820
So they're all going to be.

231
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,520
This could very well be the last episode of Synesthesia.

232
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,800
Bernard and Braithwaite.

233
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,520
And the.

234
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,660
They're going to be dialing.

235
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,300
They're going to be calling.

236
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,600
And we've got to give them some answers about the Church of the Subgenius and X-Day that

237
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,500
will calm them down.

238
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,000
Make them less volatile and reactive.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,540
The number to call is 216-687-3515.

240
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,340
And we have our first caller right now.

241
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,040
Well.

242
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,620
Hello, you're on the air.

243
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,660
And they hung up.

244
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,740
It could be Dave.

245
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,540
Yeah.

246
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,340
They hung up because they.

247
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,580
Whoever was hung up before, they could.

248
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,580
See, they can't take the full.

249
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:01,980
See, this is.

250
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,860
Let this be a lesson.

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,820
Fulguration of.

252
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,600
Let this be a lesson.

253
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,760
Lightning inspiration.

254
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,000
If you are waiting for the saucer to come and pick you up and you walk away too early,

255
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,880
that's it.

256
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
You're left behind.

257
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,940
You're like that old lady who didn't witness.

258
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,980
Yeah.

259
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:17,980


260
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:17,980


261
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:17,980


262
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:17,980


263
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,220
She hung up before she witnessed on that.

264
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
On Glenn Beck's radio.

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,480
Dave.

266
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,700
She's going to spend eternity in a hole.

267
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,920
Dave is calling.

268
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,460
Dave is calling.

269
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,260
He's calling the wrong number.

270
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,400
He's calling the wrong phone number.

271
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,780
Calling the damn wrong phone.

272
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,200
What's the point of this?

273
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,480
Somebody do something.

274
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,820
He's probably calling to say, I called and called and called and nobody picked it up.

275
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,660
If I know Dave.

276
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,100
Well.

277
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,360
Now, he still was calling the wrong number.

278
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,240
But.

279
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,820
Doesn't he.

280
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,580
We all surf the luck plane in different ways.

281
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,880
And Dave's just a little.

282
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:47,960
Yeah.

283
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,220
He's different.

284
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
And he's kind of special.

285
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,340
Bob is finished with Dave yet.

286
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,160
No.

287
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,200
Bob has more work for him.

288
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,300
The lesson to learn is that those who have bought their saucer tickets will be saved,

289
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,860
even if they dial the wrong number at first.

290
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
There will be a chance to dial the right number.

291
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,020
That's the thing.

292
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,860
Well, of course, you don't have to be with at any specific place.

293
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,120
You don't really have to be at Wisteria Campground where the cool people go for X day to await

294
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,640
the saucer.

295
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,920
This is how we lay in your.

296
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,040
This is how.

297
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,060
This is how you lay inside that garage apartment.

298
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,360
And of course, your escape vessel may, as a result, resemble that garage apartment for

299
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,680
eternity.

300
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,940
Are you that old lady who didn't witness?

301
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,520
See, this is how we know that the earth is actually.

302
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:32,880
Did you dial the recall Bob.

303
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,700
Flat.

304
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,580
But at the wrong number.

305
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,820
This is how we know the earth is not round.

306
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,180
Okay.

307
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,840
Recall them 13014.

308
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,560
Because we know that at 7 a.m. on July 5th, 1998, everyone will be able to look up in

309
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,140
the sky and see the pleasure saucers arrive.

310
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,660
And this is how we know.

311
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
Well, they're mighty big saucers.

312
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,060
You can only do that if the world is actually flat.

313
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,120
So this is how we know the earth is not in fact round.

314
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,260
But what if they have the quantum ubiquity, the ability to be in two places at once, owing

315
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,840
to their skill at tweaking.

316
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm not going to be the host, bring that globe and do my demonstration again.

317
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,080
Let's say, it's Dave.

318
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,080
It's Dave.

319
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,460
Dave's here.

320
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,500
Hello, you're on the air.

321
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,120
Hello, you're on the air.

322
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,100
Now you're here.

324
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,640
I told you it was here.

325
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:16,640


326
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:16,860
You're on the air.

327
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,060
I told you it was Dave.

328
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,040
I wasn't.

329
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,520
Always will be Dave.

330
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,340
Always will be.

331
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,560
We are a sloth.

332
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,160
I remember that guy.

333
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:31,440
The guy with the third nostril that was perforated so far that the ooze would come out.

334
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,020
Wasn't there a lawsuit based on that?

335
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah, there was a class action secret.

336
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,700
Take him to court.

337
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,940
My third nostril opened years ago, but I've had my finger in it ever since.

338
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,040
Digging away.

339
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,620
You can pick your nose and your foot.

340
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


341
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


342
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


343
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


344
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


345
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


346
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,620


347
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:46,820
I've got a lot of friends.

348
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Pick Bob, friends.

349
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,100
And that thing hanging, there's something hanging from your nose.

350
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
Yeah, do something about that.

351
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,260
It doesn't look cool.

352
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,480
A word to the wise.

353
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,480
Take care of that.

354
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,020
I'll just try to.

355
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,800
Yeah, whale sculpt.

356
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,880
Yeah, I found a whale sculpt.

357
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,560
It didn't need.

358
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,740
A whale stump, you say?

359
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,100
A waiter's stump is as good as a waitress's stump, if you're of the mind.

360
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,060
It takes them longer to get to the table, if there's a stump involved.

361
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,780
But there's more good sound effects on the way to getting your food.

362
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,160
I don't know.

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,160


364
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,600
It depends.

365
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,600


366
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,600


367
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,600


368
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,600


369
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,600


370
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,060
Well, while they're stumping over to the table, they could spill your vichyssoise.

371
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,760
We have the technology.

372
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,820
Well, at least it's cold.

373
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,760
At least it won't burn.

374
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,060
We can rebuild.

375
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,600
That's true.

376
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,040
Robocop was down to just four stumps, but look how he, well, he could do everything.

377
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,260
They fixed him up.

378
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,120
Four stumps in a bag of vichyssoise.

379
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,060
They can fix everybody.

380
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,700
Robocop versus Chappie.

381
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,420
You should have heard his stump speech when he was on the campaign trail.

382
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,520
Ed 209.

383
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,520
I thought he was little.

384
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,380
The stump jumper.

385
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,400
You're referring to Moose, I think.

386
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,680
Yeah, Moose is the Ed 209.

387
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:45,840
Moose.

388
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,180
He's based on Ed 209, but he's called Moose.

389
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,140
You know, Moose.

390
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,080
Moose was the Moose.

391
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,300
Well, you haven't even seen that movie yet, Dr. Howell.

392
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,080
No, I haven't.

393
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,000
I haven't seen Moose in the movie yet.

394
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,600
I've just seen Chappie.

395
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm worried about him.

396
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,380
But you know, they're going to make him fight Moose, though.

397
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,940
You know that.

398
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,540
You do know that.

399
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
Yeah, because I've read the Cinefax article.

400
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:04,840
Moose with the chocolate pudding stuff?

401
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,400
You know, the movie Robocop actually taught me the word something sucker that I can't

402
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,980
say on the radio.

403
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,300
Something sucker?

404
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,580
Yeah, something that starts with a C.

405
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:15,980
Oh.

406
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,580
And I thought, well, I'm going to have to do something.

407
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,720
And you know, I wonder why we even use that term as an insult, because if you're sucking

408
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,340
my, you know what, like, I'm probably going to like you.

409
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,020
Well, that's the thing.

410
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,400
All these things, they turn loving acts into epithets.

411
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,800
What kind of a world do we live in when a profoundly affectionate display is?

412
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,660
The supremacist courts of the United Snakes have ruled that all people, whether they're

413
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,780
a financial or a charitable organization, can conjoin successfully if they, you know,

414
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,560
choose to do something.

415
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,400
And so, and then as a so-called consequence from that, as a consequence from that, how

416
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,620
in the hell can you imagine that people would have to like each other to not like each other?

417
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,640
Well, now it's legal to marry your dog.

418
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,160
On Facebook, yeah.

419
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,860
You can just marry a dog now.

420
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,840
Yeah, it's legal to like each other.

421
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,680
Thanks, old Bobbo.

422
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,560
Why don't you go marry a dog now?

423
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,840
You're a fool.

424
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm mad.

425
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,940
I'm mad as hell.

426
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,840
I'm going to tell you anymore.

427
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,340
America has been destroyed.

428
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,560
Obama is destroyed.

429
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:16,780
America has been destroyed.

430
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,260
America.

431
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,080
I walked outside.

432
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,660
I went to the supermarket today and America was destroyed.

433
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,800
It was just totally destroyed.

434
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,400
People was walking around buying things, but it was destroyed.

435
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,360
These people exist, though, Hal.

436
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,400
You shouldn't pass such sound effects of dispersion, John, what Stan was saying there.

437
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:42,160
I'm only adumbrating and shading his musings with the appropriate sonic taffeta.

438
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,800
Yeah, but you're from San Francisco.

439
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,700
Yes.

440
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,380
And your ideas.

441
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,620
Your ideas of a sonic tapestry are different because you didn't think that that was really

442
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,900
true, what Stan was saying.

443
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,080
He's saying, Francisco, everybody's already married their dog.

444
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,420
Doesn't make a difference.

445
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,700
And they're such unpleasant dogs, too.

446
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,080
They're horrible little things with wet fur.

447
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:06,960
They look more like rats and tube tops with wet nose and wet fur around the mouth and

448
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,060
the eyes and just hideous little quivering, yapping things.

449
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,700
But the marriage is legal.

450
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,180
If he can marry just anybody.

451
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:16,700
Why?

452
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,880
Who's to just stop people from saying, well, I'm just going to get married for 24 hours.

453
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
Oh, I'm going to marry my wallet.

454
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,160
I'm going to marry.

455
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm just going to get married under Bob.

456
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,760
Isn't that what we do?

457
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,860
Conjoined with this little puppy dog and my wallet and my fishbowl and that girl over

458
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,260
there and all them boys.

459
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
And in the church of the subgenius.

460
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,920
And it won't be a sin because Bob says it's okay.

461
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,540
Because in the Supreme Court and Bobbo says it's okay.

462
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,660
Yes, that's for the people.

463
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,560
Might as well burn my flag and wipe my crevice with it.

464
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,620
That's all right, pops.

465
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,120
You go out and you do that.

466
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,900
And we're going to do this show.

467
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,100
America, America, love it or leave it.

468
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm leaving.

469
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,320
See, for those.

470
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,540
I don't love it anymore.

471
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm going to leave.

472
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,500
Don't you feel like eating Brazilian fare in a secret garden?

473
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,380
If they legalize that queer stuff, I'm going to burn myself up on fire.

474
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,460
I promise.

475
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,020
I swear.

476
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
For you regular listeners who are not quite as.

477
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,960
You've got some blistering on your arm going on there right now.

478
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,080
I think it's from the large antropodal beast.

479
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,140
Burn some gasoline.

480
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,240
I'm going to burn myself up in protest against you.

481
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,800
Because men can marry men and women marry women.

482
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,040
Dogs marry dogs.

483
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,440
Dogs marry cats.

484
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,400
That's what's coming next.

485
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,380
Dogs marrying cats.

486
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,940
Dogs and cats living together.

487
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,420
Cats marrying mice.

488
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,860
That's the nanny.

489
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,640
For those of you who don't know, dogs marry bowling balls.

490
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,280
That's what this world has come to.

491
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,920
Thanks, Obama.

492
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,660
The nanny McPhee.

493
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,080
For you regular listeners who are not quite as familiar.

494
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,000
With a chicken.

495
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,780
Yes, that's what you could eat it and drive it at the same time.

496
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,780
You don't want him to put that spider on you.

497
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,800
Here's what I need to remind listeners of.

498
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,020
Yeah, I see that.

499
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,200
There's a civil war coming.

500
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,880
We need to take a moment here to remind the listeners.

501
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,120
What you looking for?

502
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,080
Iraq news, right?

503
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,740
Something like that?

504
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,040
We need to take a moment here to remind the listeners.

505
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,700
This is when you have to fade Dave down.

506
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,060
Yeah, this is where we need to take a moment to remind the listeners.

507
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,620
This is us.

508
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,120
This is us.

509
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,340
This is us.

510
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm going to sin.

511
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,340
You know, I'll get the hint.

512
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,920
Views and opinions expressed on this program are not necessarily those of WCSB or Cleveland State University.

513
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,280
And for those of you who are less familiar with Bob Dobbs, you need to get right with him.

514
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
First of all, here's the thing.

515
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,460
All right.

516
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,940
If you're looking for forgiveness of sin, you're looking in the wrong place.

517
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,180
Okay.

518
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,240
Bob is not here to forgive your sins.

519
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,420
Bob is here to justify them.

520
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,920
And that, that, my friends, is what we're all looking for.

521
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,240
If you have a number you can call.

522
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,740
If you want to ask a few questions.

523
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,480
Or just contribute to the overall insanity that this program is.

524
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,260
Kill them all.

525
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,260
Let Bob sort them out.

526
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:52,880
That's what I say.

527
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,600
You see, Bob wants to justify your grins.

528
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,700
Isn't that right?

529
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,580
Your grins.

530
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,640
Your lust for grins.

531
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,920
We have a new caller here.

532
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,480
I'm very concerned about the end of the world.

533
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,060
Hold on.

534
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,280
Hold on.

535
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,540
Hold on.

536
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,480
Okay, you're concerned.

537
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,320
We have a new caller here.

538
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,260
Let's let this out.

539
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,760
A new caller?

540
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes, we have a new caller here.

541
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,640
Let's let this out.

542
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
He's concerned about the end of the world.

543
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,340
Can everybody just shut up for a second?

544
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,420
Concerned.

545
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:11,960
New caller.

546
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,820
New person.

547
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,440
Okay, new caller.

548
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,040
Go ahead.

549
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm pretty concerned.

550
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,220
I'm pretty concerned.

551
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
About the end of the world.

552
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,880
About the end of the world.

553
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,480
Yes.

554
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,240
Well, I'm also concerned.

555
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,880
Well, what are your concerns?

556
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,680
You know, it just, like, bothers me.

557
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,440
This show is concerned with the end of the world.

558
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,300
Why should it be?

559
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,160
Well, it's the end of their world, not the end of our world.

560
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,220
Well, you know, I tried lighting a couple of pastors on fire, and I got arrested.

561
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,400
Oh.

562
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,580
Well, you have to be aware that, you know, if you take the course of action,

563
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,080
you're going to be arrested.

564
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,800
Sometimes you're going to run into a few hemorrhoids, if you know what I'm saying.

565
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,100
Now, wait a minute.

566
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,720
You set some pastors on fire?

567
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,420
Yes, well, he needs it.

568
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,060
Not pastors.

569
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,080
Pastors?

570
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,160
He needs a big ball.

571
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,120
Men of the cloth?

572
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,340
No, no, they were pastors.

573
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,100
Obviously, they were not wearing as best for...

574
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,980
They were fields.

575
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,560
He set green pastures.

576
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,340
Fields and haycocks dry.

577
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes, he set them all aflame to show his difference, to shout his barbaric yawn.

578
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,440
But now he's a little bit worried.

579
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,480
About that oncoming end of the world.

580
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,340
He's concerned.

581
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,660
He's concerned.

582
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm concerned.

583
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,060
You know, it's nothing to take lightly.

584
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,000
At least he understands that he had to do a lot of work to create that fire,

585
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,640
especially in the weather we've been having lately in a pasture.

586
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,080
He used an accelerant.

587
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,660
He had to have all kinds of incendiary devices and what do they call those?

588
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,580
Starter uppers or accelerants.

589
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,920
And he gets a limited edition t-shirt also.

590
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,060
I got the accelerant.

591
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,080
While supplies last.

592
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:53,300
And the accelerant is good for starting small fires, which can give way to larger conflagrations.

593
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,140
Forest fires in America's national forests.

594
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,400
I like the fact that the route was so good, you know, because of the global warming.

595
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,540
You know, that was fun.

596
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,480
Well, this is just the end.

597
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,640
These are the signs of the end times.

598
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,580
Even in the Christian Bible, it said,

599
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,340
you know,

600
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,200
you don't need to worry about another flood, but the fire age is coming.

601
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:19,860
Yeah.

602
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,500
I mean, I'm looking for the horsemen, too.

603
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,620
Yes, the four horsemench of the apocalypse.

604
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,140
My little pony, my little phony, my little bony, and my little moany.

605
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,800
Well, actually,

606
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,240
The four horsemen are all bronies.

607
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,000
a form of extalibration.

608
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:43,820
The universe, as we commonly call it, is grating down by nickels and dimes into short little fuses

609
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,320
and misoperating the entire universe.

610
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,320


611
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,840
And the universe is in the middle of a fire operation on its way down.

612
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,060
But the main thing to remember, it's a kind of negative, negative, negative entropy.

613
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,260
It's like a double negative, but it's still a form of entropy.

614
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,720
And don't you ever dare forget it, or you'll be flagellated by tired chimpanzees who are

615
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,160
braiding their hairs with monkeys.

616
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,760
A negative times a negative is a positive.

617
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,900
And you see there, it's cheating.

618
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,120
It's sucking off some energy source.

619
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,220
It's taking away.

620
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,120
Some secret source of power.

621
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,080
Go ahead and say it.

622
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,320
It's satanic black magic.

623
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,220
All right.

624
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,100
Let's just acknowledge that.

625
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,280
After all, is anyone really shocked by that anymore?

626
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,600
Okay, we are evil.

627
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,000
It is satanic black magic.

628
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,160
But, you know, it no longer means what it once did.

629
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,600
And besides, let's remember, everyone who criticizes things like that is on the other side.

630
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,320
Everything you read about, about how these satanic ritual child sacrifices are not good,

631
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,320


632
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,460
are bad, you know, it's written by someone who opposes them.

633
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,300
Yeah, the children.

634
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,360
Of course they're going to hate being sacrificed.

635
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,020
But think of the satanists themselves.

636
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,860
They never know what's good for them.

637
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,220
That's why they're children.

638
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,040
They're not just children.

639
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,240
I mean, they use children.

640
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,000
Children just work better.

641
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,200
They have more energy.

642
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,100
They have those tiny hands that can reach into those spaces that grownups can't.

643
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,740
That's right.

644
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,780
And we might as well be a little bit realistic about this.

645
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,660
All tool makers are based upon that concept.

646
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,080
And I think that's the problem with society.

647
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,060
You don't have to give them workers' comp either when they get a boo-boo?

648
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,200
No, just give them some hot dog and they'll do anything.

649
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,640
Or a little Batman band-aid.

650
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,580
Now, this isn't a mandate, you understand.

651
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,100
But we do suggest that there is such a thing as a band-aid for life's problems.

652
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:38,920
Band-aid.

653
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:38,940
Yes.

654
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,300
Yeah, now you can date men.

655
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,160
A mandate.

656
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,460
It's a man dating men.

657
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,260
That's okay now.

658
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,920
Yes.

659
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,820
He can't help it.

660
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
He can't help it.

661
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,100
It's been since last week that he's been confused about all this transgender stuff.

662
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,080
And now he's finally popped his weasel.

663
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,240
He's like a...

664
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,840
Oh, now you can pop your weasel right in front of the supermarket.

665
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,700
Right in front of everybody.

666
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,600
Right on radio.

667
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,000
Yeah.

668
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,440
Now your gay lover can get Obamacare with you.

669
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,560
Right.

670
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,400
Obamacare, too.

671
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,760
What are you going to do about that?

672
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
You mean like smoking a pipe is just smoking a pipe?

673
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,880
Sorry, smoking is not permitted in the new world.

674
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,200
Well, that's a good point.

675
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,200


676
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


677
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


678
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


679
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,240


680
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,700
But why did this guy set a pasture on fire and assume that things have been real bad

681
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,860
so therefore he should join the Church of the Subgenius or he should stay away for next

682
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,740
day or I still don't understand the premise that we're trying to discon...

683
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,000
Do not light the pastures on fire, okay?

684
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,940
Leave that to the saucers, okay?

685
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,540
Yeah, the saucers will take care of that.

686
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,980
The exhaust from the saucers are going to burn all the pastures for you.

687
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,180
That's right.

688
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,960
Yeah, go burn your flag instead.

689
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,480
Leave it to the professionals.

690
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,700
Leave it to the professionals and...

691
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,560
Don't burn anything.

692
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,220
Don't smoke anything.

693
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,220


694
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,820
Don't smoke anything, okay?

695
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,420
Don't do this, Kevin.

696
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,300
The time has come...

697
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,880
I smoked my cannibals on the last one.

698
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,540
The time has come for us to jump into Bob's pipe and let him smoke us.

699
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,500
He said he smoked like a cannibal on the last one.

700
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,980
Don't look in the basement.

701
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,640
Don't go into the woods.

702
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,840
Don't answer the phone.

703
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,880
And let's scare Jessica today.

704
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,720
And certainly don't call us up at 216-687-3515.

705
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,980
That would be like a one-man Burning Man festival.

706
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah, the Larry Harvey does it by himself festival.

707
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:13,840
Yeah.

708
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,640
Where he has to drag that thing out there all by himself and light it and stand there

709
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,080
by himself.

710
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,880
You know, Larry and I have a lot in common, Larry Harvey and I do.

711
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,560
I finally met him that last time I was in San Francisco at that big hipster party.

712
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,340
He walked up and...

713
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,680
What was her name?

714
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,700
The Hempstress introduced us.

715
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,140
Sonia.

716
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,080
I mean, the Holy Hempstress.

717
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,620
We have a new caller here.

718
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,000
New caller?

719
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,500
Yes.

720
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,660
I could have shared some really crazy gossip, but that moment's gone.

721
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,680
No.

722
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:51,060
Well, I would have liked to hear it too, but instead we have to listen to some tweedly caller.

723
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,880
Hey, how come it's not going to the moon?

724
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry, what was that?

725
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,420
That's the government, don't worry.

726
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,280
All right.

727
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,540
Keep your government hands off my Obamacare.

728
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,640
I think maybe one more blast.

729
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,460
A blast, eh?

730
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:04,760
No.

731
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,140
Fashions by Bill Blast.

732
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,640
I guess that's it.

733
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,900
Bill lost the race last Tuesday.

734
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,560
Are you suggesting the anal vapors of Bob?

735
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,620
Now somebody's talking.

736
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,420
Banged up.

737
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,880
And smell my anal vapors.

738
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,940
That got my attention.

739
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,680
I wouldn't do that.

740
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,420
Your face is my toilet paper.

741
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,040
I had not heard that one before.

742
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
That's a Mentor's lyric.

743
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,540
Oh, okay.

744
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,020
I'm glad you told me, because I'd be copying him and not know I was doing it.

745
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,200
I think I was just copying you, see?

746
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,040
I know a guy who grew up in Mentor once.

747
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,800
Oh, yeah.

748
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,540
Yeah, I didn't understand what he was talking about.

749
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
I knew a guy who grew up in Mentor three times.

750
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


751
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


752
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


753
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


754
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


755
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


756
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


757
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


758
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:43,540


759
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,540
Mentor?

760
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,720
I hardly know her.

761
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,720
That's tricky.

762
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,240
Yak, yak, yak.

763
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,500
That's where the end times are going to occur.

764
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,040
Yeah.

765
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,880
All right.

766
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
Let's see the color of your money here.

767
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,920
Just put it down on the table.

768
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,440
You meant her.

769
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,960
You brought her.

770
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,860
That's a species learning curve.

771
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,900
I've never heard one.

772
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:10,080
Obviously, he has all the signs of flatulence, miscreants, any kind of other derogatory

773
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,420
denotation.

774
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,520
Diffuse is the word miscreants every single time.

775
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


776
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


777
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


778
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


779
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


780
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


781
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


782
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


783
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


784
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


785
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


786
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


787
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,260
I think you fixed the picture.

788
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,060
I think you should go to another or fresh.

789
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,440
He's special, man.

790
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,180
Whatever happens to the Smurfs?

791
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,860
The Smurfs?

792
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:27,100
Well, there was only one female, and when she died, that was the end of the line.

793
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,120
The Smurfette was supposed to bear...

794
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,080
They were all slowly suffocating.

795
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,520
That's why they were blue.

796
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,540
I think they were anally ambiguous.

797
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,740
No, she was the only female.

798
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,520
There was Papa Smurf, but only one Smurfette.

799
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:42,860
You see?

800
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,300
It's like an insect colony, where the females are responsible for eggs and reproductions,

801
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,280
and the males are just tireless toilers.

802
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,320
You ever seen a Smurf egg?

803
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,000
Perhaps they were incubating.

804
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,480
I have not.

805
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,620
Gargamel, in his wisdom, made them that way.

806
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,820
I like him over medium myself.

807
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,640
The great God Gargamel, who is actually, to us, is just a mad scientist.

808
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,120
Wait a minute.

809
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,700
You're saying Gargamel created the Smurfs?

810
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,560
Yeah, Gargamel created the Smurfs.

811
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,020
They were homunculi.

812
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,400
No wonder he's got it down on him.

813
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,840
They were little blue hens.

814
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,040
They were little, small, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little.

815
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,600
They were homunculi, just like so many of the guys in the Middle Ages, the alchemists and so forth.

816
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,100
They're called Schrumphs.

817
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,480
Schrumphs?

818
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,840
Do the Smurfs still go to Burning Man?

819
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,040
Probably.

820
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,780
I can't be everywhere in Burning Man.

821
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,480
I don't know if you went once.

822
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,100
Did this owl happen to remember the etymology of the, you ever heard of the Schmooze?

823
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,280
I think they were a flavoring company.

824
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,400
Of course I know the Schmooze.

825
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,600
I know the Schmooze.

826
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,600
Isn't that similar more in time?

827
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,700
I've heard of a Schmooze before too.

828
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,580
No.

829
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,720
They came from the mountains of the schmoon.

830
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,640
And they invaded Dogpatch, USA.

831
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,560
Yes.

832
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,780
But they were benevolent invaders.

833
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,180
They want you to eat them.

834
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,540
They want you to fry them up.

835
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,100
And they can...

836
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,440
No, not the shrooms.

837
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,780
Well, the shrooms, the schmoos like the shrooms.

838
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,940
But you didn't want to eat a shmoo while he was on shrooms.

839
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,140
Because it would like triple the effect.

840
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,900
So that was like one of those cultural secret things?

841
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,080
Like the subliminal...

842
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,920
At one time, everybody in America knew about this.

843
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,460
Everybody?

844
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,080
And they would argue about it over the breakfast table.

845
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,260
Actually, in that movie Slackers, there is a little rant about Smurfs

846
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,780
that is stolen from an old essay that I wrote.

847
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,260
And it's a dues-paying subgenius cop in the rant and saying it in that movie.

848
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,920
I just...

849
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,720
I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that.

850
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:42,820
Yes, because...

851
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,880
That when you see that movie and they're talking about the Smurfs and it sounds so clever,

852
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,520
I wrote that for some magazine for 25 bucks.

853
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,000
And at the end of the essay...

854
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,580
150 years ago.

855
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,300
At the end of the essay, Reverend Stang says that it's your duty to put your shoe down

856
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,140
and squash every squealing Smurf that you encounter.

857
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,600
Well, if I said that, then you better pick up on it.

858
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,460
It's called capitalism, my friend.

859
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,340
Don't you remember how your own essay ends?

860
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:07,940
It's called capitalism.

861
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,580
You squish the Smurfs.

862
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,180
Are you kidding?

863
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,580
I don't read that stuff again.

864
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,500
You say...

865
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,540
I saw the movie.

866
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,560
That you're supposed to squash every squealing Smurf with your shoe.

867
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,040
Yeah, that sounds good.

868
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,760
I used to be...

869
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,480
I used to say good things like that.

870
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,600
Poor Stang, in his dotage, can't even remember the finest productions of his flaming youth.

871
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,060
I was like 26 when I wrote that.

872
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,820
Actually, I'm 112 now.

873
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,460
Now you have to live with it.

874
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,140
Well, that is in dog years.

875
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,920
Taking small...

876
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,420
The quantities of turpentine is said to make your piss smell like flowers.

877
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,920
Well, that'll kill you.

878
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,120
And then you can be under the flowers.

879
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,800
It's destructive.

880
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:53,460
Well, turpentine has been proven to be a motivator when applied on the anus.

881
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,700
But you're not on a quest to give 100 free skateboards to Slavic village kids.

882
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,080
So, apparently, you're simply not...

883
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,440
The turpentine color Smurfs to that particular blue.

884
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes, the blue is a cyanide.

885
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,440
It's a cyanotic color from an unfortunate oxygen deprivation.

886
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,700
I really did see some people painted all blue as Smurfs at Burning Man.

887
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,340
Yes, you saw them sometimes.

888
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,980
You still see them, yes.

889
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,060
So, they really weren't there.

890
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,380
I wasn't hallucinating.

891
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,840
Including more than one female Smurf, but only at Burning Man.

892
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,920
He was a busy girl.

893
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,420
Right.

894
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,140
Smurfette.

895
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,820
Smurfette.

896
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,600
Oh, yeah.

897
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,860
That was a long time.

898
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,300
Just think of it in religious terms.

899
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,220
Like, Krista being blue and stuff because, like what Hal said, of lack of oxygenation.

900
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,520
And that would mean that since he wasn't breathing hard enough, that's why the world imploded.

901
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,480
There you know.

902
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,840
It's perfect.

903
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,020
Smurfette.

904
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,700
Smurfette.

905
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,800
He watches too much TV.

906
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,700
It is important to remember, we are speaking of devotional procedures here.

907
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,780
We are a religion.

908
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,800
And we want to tell you the precious and proper way.

909
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,200
To ordain and orient yourself.

910
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:19,760
So that your transition in the moments of apocalypse that are onrushing upon us will be as painless as possible.

911
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:28,760
And you may even get to come along with us if even at this last latter day moment you perform the needed ritual.

912
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,680
We can't tell you what it is on the radio.

913
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,520
You have to have been paying attention better than a lot of these clowns.

914
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,420
But if you have, then you shall be saved also.

915
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,180
You shall be washed as white as snow.

916
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,040
By all the virgin martyrs kissed.

917
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,240
You understand that the Smurfs interbred to become the Teletubbies.

918
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:52,740
Why?

919
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,840
I'm casting for air right now.

920
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,940
Yes, but then they created sexless sports like Tinky Winky.

921
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,720
That was in the Bible.

922
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,640
Capable of reproduction.

923
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:00,940
Turn back.

924
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:01,620
Reproduction.

925
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,380
And capable of even fishing.

926
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,100
Sexual budding.

927
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,500
Which so far.

928
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,160
So many creatures in our galaxy employ to perpetuate themselves.

929
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,400
In our culture, the land version.

930
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,160
Yes, as they say on Fomalhaut.

931
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,020
In budding time, in budding time.

932
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,940
Sweet, delightful budding.

933
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,460
What's the matter?

934
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,020
Whoa.

935
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,060
Were the Smurfs dyed with woad?

936
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,740
Oh yes, woad.

937
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,360
Most important.

938
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,300
That's it.

939
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,440
I can hardly understand.

940
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,060
I thought you were talking about Oaxaca and the great green.

941
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,800
No, woad.

942
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,120
You rub it on yourself.

943
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,660
First it's blue.

944
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,600
It's the Braveheart look.

945
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,900
Bring back White Castle.

946
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,600
Goodbye.

947
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,780
Watch the use of wearing braces, pants and hats and shoes with laces.

948
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,520
The easy things he buys in places down in Brompton Road.

949
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,400
Watch the use of shirts or cotton studs that always gets forgotten.

950
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,100
These affairs are simply rotten.

951
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,800
Better far is woad.

952
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,300
I told him not to give him that beer.

953
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,400
Woads the stuff to show men.

954
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,220
Woad to scare your foemen.

955
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,460
Boil it to a simply brilliant hue and rub it on your back and your abdomen.

956
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,360
Listen to him go.

957
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,120
One's too many and millions not enough.

958
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,300
Tramp up Snowdon with your woad on.

959
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,580
Never mind if you've a heavy load on.

960
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:32,180
And when the woad creates the woad, that's the woad that we all travel on.

961
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,940
You shan't have a heavy load on.

962
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,600
Go it, ancient peace.

963
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,400
I have a stopwatch here and I notice we've been sticking on the word woad.

964
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,620
Romans came across the China all decked out in tin and flannel.

965
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,940
Half a pint of woad per mannel clotheth us more than thee.

966
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,860
Romans keep your armours.

967
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,920
Saxons your pyjamas.

968
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,780
Hairy coats were made for goats.

969
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,360
Gorillas, yaks and tree for dogs and larmours.

970
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,320
Ancient Britons never hit on anything as good as woad to fit on.

971
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,120
Tis the best in all great Briton.

972
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,920
Sailors, you'll be blowed.

973
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,960
Well, when the band begins to bop, that's a stopwatch for the fog man.

974
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,760
Don't give him any more.

975
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,920
And the band begins to play.

976
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,340
Hey, what's going on?

977
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,040
Get your hands off me.

978
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:33,660
I'm fine.

979
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,360
Leave me alone.

980
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,360
I'm doing great.

981
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,940
Sky of blue.

982
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,420
Cut it out.

983
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,680
Sea of green.

984
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,060
Whew.

985
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,700
I am glad that's not just me.

986
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,060
Yeah, you see it too, huh?

987
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,600
Got another caller here.

988
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,320
216-687-3515.

989
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,120
All right.

990
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,040
I'll take on your caller.

991
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,500
Come here.

992
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,520
Let me have him.

993
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,900
They always say, you know what?

994
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


995
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


996
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


997
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


998
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


999
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


1000
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:55,900


1001
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,240
He hung up.

1002
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,720
He hung up.

1003
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,340
Well, that's really too bad.

1004
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,260
Do they call you up to insult you and hang up, or why do they do that?

1005
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,940
Oh, geez.

1006
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,340
Ow.

1007
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,360
Cut it out.

1008
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,000
How can he insult you?

1009
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,480
All right.

1010
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,880
It's kind of hard to insult me in ways I haven't insulted myself already.

1011
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,400
We're all friends here.

1012
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,240
Come now.

1013
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,840
I've been insulting myself many times this night.

1014
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,080
Let us reason together.

1015
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,380
You can insult me, or you can just let me do the show.

1016
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,340
Self abuse is nothing to Brian.

1017
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I mean, you might as well.

1018
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,820
I mean, what's the point of insulting me?

1019
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:25,900
You're a fucking idiot.

1020
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,720
You might as well just say the sun rises in the east.

1021
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,020
It does rise in the east.

1022
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,280
Yeah, but what's the point of saying that?

1023
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,780
You have read the notes.

1024
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,920
We already know this.

1025
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,980
You did get with the program.

1026
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,820
Hello, you're on the air.

1027
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,720
It passed through all the departments' heads.

1028
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,400
But that M-O-578.

1029
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,160
Hold on.

1030
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,000
New caller here.

1031
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,580
You're on the air?

1032
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,440
I'm on the air.

1033
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,100
Hello.

1034
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,600
You're on the air.

1035
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,440
Hello.

1036
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
Magellan, how'd the Kean landers make it tall?

1037
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,160
Yes, Magellan.

1038
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,600
The Magellan lander.

1039
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:55,900
The E.

1040
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,640
The, uh, special device?

1041
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,120
No, the guy that did, like, sail the seven seas.

1042
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,380
Oh, the Magellan lander.

1043
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,080
Oh, you're a regular Magellan.

1044
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,740
He didn't quite make it.

1045
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,560
Exactly.

1046
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,780
Ferd-nand.

1047
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,000
And that's the one that blew it up again.

1048
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,860
The Magellan lander.

1049
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,440
Are you right?

1050
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,340
The guy that's about to make big red bugs.

1051
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,300
And between these.

1052
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,180
They're the ones with the flagellum, you say?

1053
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,240
And the Magellan lander was a special probe.

1054
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:25,320
But that Tesla-like other probes that were emitted from the sphincter of this planet.

1055
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:25,900
I think that's what they were.

1056
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:25,900


1057
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:25,900


1058
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:25,900


1059
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:25,900


1060
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,440
The Magellan probes probe Magella.

1061
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,320
Planet sphincters have not been proven.

1062
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,740
It's not a fact.

1063
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,420
Did Magellan have flagella?

1064
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,940
What about documentary, huh?

1065
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,300
What about documentary, huh?

1066
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,580
Well, um.

1067
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,840
No, that's a black hole.

1068
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,520
That's not a planet sphincter.

1069
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,680
We've all got celia.

1070
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,040
Speak for yourself.

1071
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,420
Aren't, aren't celia a kind of flagellum?

1072
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,200
I believe they are.

1073
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,060
Well, then we all do have flagelli.

1074
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,000
How about that?

1075
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,300
And you know what?

1076
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,460
You've got them on your villi, also.

1077
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:55,880
I don't need flagellum.

1078
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:55,880


1079
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:55,880


1080
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:55,880


1081
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:55,880


1082
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,680
You've got flagelli on your villi.

1083
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,860
So shut up and leave me alone.

1084
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,080
But what is the Magellan monologue?

1085
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,440
Sail on, sail on, and on and on.

1086
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,120
A long, long list of cracked people.

1087
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:17,820
People who are just totally, completely, disjunctively out of focus.

1088
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,420
Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

1089
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,320
And how can that with the rest of society?

1090
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,220
Thanks for the note.

1091
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,860
You're saying that these people are sort of bat fumet, cuckoo.

1092
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:25,860


1093
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,140
Crazy.

1094
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,360
Is that what you're saying?

1095
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,140
Fumet.

1096
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,920
I have not heard that word in a very long time.

1097
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,540
Well, we're trying to be suitable for airplay here.

1098
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,120
But I've experienced this criticism.

1099
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:44,340
They simply claim that all we do can be boiled down to a reductive theory of our psychological

1100
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,060
instability.

1101
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,320
Well, if it were that easy to dismiss, we would have taken our toys and gone home a

1102
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,940
long time ago.

1103
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,860
No, you have to do more to discourage a subgenius.

1104
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:55,860


1105
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,680
That's what a pilot is, a Smurf.

1106
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,620
I mean, that's on, you can't even argue that.

1107
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,060
You need some little figure.

1108
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,460
It might as well be a Smurf.

1109
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:10,340
It has to be an Eidolon that represents yourself, because it's just too terrifying to picture

1110
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,380
yourself going through these adventures.

1111
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,700
And so you teleport a little Smurf in there to your mental state.

1112
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,220
Smurfs don't get terrified.

1113
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,560
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,680
I think that's what he's doing, Doctor.

1115
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,960
I think that's what he's doing, Doctor.

1116
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,600
You see, the Smurfs are not any way.

1117
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,220
There's no certification.

1118
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,080
They're not the way, Alizon.

1119
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,580
They are all Eiron.

1120
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,320
Unless you count.

1121
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,220
They are all the encounterers and protagonists.

1122
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,340
They are not those who they react against.

1123
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,160
That falls to the unhappy lot of Gargamel, who walks in his garden and regrets the creation

1124
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,300
of the Smurfs.

1125
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,280
Gargamel's overrated.

1126
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,840
Gargamel is a hipster.

1127
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,380
He's all that lies between you and a tidal wave of smothering Smurfs.

1128
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,160
Oh, yeah, bring them on.

1129
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,760
Yes, that's right.

1130
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,060
You're talking.

1131
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,440
We can badmouth Gargamel, but somebody's got to be there doing that job.

1132
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,200
I want to crawl across a landscape of dead Smurfs on my elbow.

1133
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,220
To give Gargamel a cigar.

1134
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,060
Wearing a Confederate flag the whole time.

1135
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,340
That's what I'm going to do because they go out, and I'm going to wear it on my face.

1136
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,400
All right.

1137
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,380
Now, look what you've done.

1138
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,060
You've got stars and bars on Stang's face.

1139
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,460
I hope you're happy.

1140
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,200
Oh, he hung up.

1141
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:20,800
There's that.

1142
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,020
I'm going to get them stars and bars tattooed on my nose.

1143
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,160
How big are they?

1144
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,960
How are they going to like that?

1145
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,620
It's like writing the Bible on the head of a pin.

1146
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,660
Or is it for a pinhead?

1147
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,260
I can't remember.

1148
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,520
Okay, well, let's figure it out.

1149
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,340
But now they're calling thick and fast.

1150
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,600
I think Elvis is still with us.

1151
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,680
Elvis you're now talking about?

1152
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,220
What is this, Publisher's Clearinghouse?

1153
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,500
I visited Memphis once.

1154
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,160
I saw his house.

1155
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,580
Oh, well, so did Lies.

1156
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,260
He went there.

1157
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,140
And while he was in Elvis's house, he heard someone say,

1158
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,460
Elvis is the next door flushing the toilet.

1159
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,060
You know, Elvis's house is not surrounded by a spacious pile.

1160
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,600
Elvis is an anagram.

1161
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,440
Elvis is an anagram for lives.

1162
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,140
Don't lie to us.

1163
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,380
Elvis is an anagram for?

1164
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,220
For lives.

1165
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,300
Lives, ah, yeah.

1166
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,680
Not dead, but liveth.

1167
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,020
The sign said Elvis slept here.

1168
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,880
You can argue with that.

1169
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,520
Or the slide.

1170
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,020
You can go to some lunatic's house and look at stuff in velvet paint.

1171
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,060
That's why he's so alive, because he lives.

1172
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,220
Elvis schlepped here.

1173
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,120
As a matter of fact, in the 19th century,

1174
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,060
in the 1983 book of the subgenius,

1175
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:34,940
it states quite clearly that J.R. Bob Dobbs got Elvis a new life

1176
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,860
as a taxi driver in Argentina.

1177
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,800
So none of this is news.

1178
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:48,420
This is old, old, old, painfully cliched news to a subgenius.

1179
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,440
Yes, the subs have heard all the news.

1180
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,880
...Tierra del Fuego, just like I'm going to do someday.

1181
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,200
Kodiak.

1182
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,360
Land of Fire.

1183
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,380
It wasn't that old.

1184
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,520
The ironically named Land of Fire.

1185
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,380
Yes, well.

1186
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:05,620
Elvis and John Fitzgerald Kennedy are both taxi, were both taxi drivers in Argentina,

1187
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,960
and they're both dead of natural causes now.

1188
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,740
So you can quit with your Elvis, Pobucker, Kennedy jokes.

1189
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:19,040
That's so, we did that for 20 years starting in 19...

1190
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,180
On the other hand, Mr. Natural was a cab driver in Afghanistan.

1191
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,440
They made copies of him is what happened.

1192
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,440
They made copies of him.

1193
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:25,620
No, no, no, it's a miracle.

1194
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,480
It's a trial.

1195
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,200
It's all that way.

1196
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,200
God, who performs all the weddings in Las Vegas?

1197
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,260
Those are the Elvis clones.

1198
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,660
Yes, they are Elvi.

1199
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,540
Well done, too.

1200
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,400
Very, very...

1201
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,380
I think it would be Elvies.

1202
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,120
...down to the left.

1203
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,500
They...

1204
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,100
The best day's wedding...

1205
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,660
Or Elvis's.

1206
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,120
I wonder what would be the point.

1207
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,080
The Elvis's.

1208
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,440
...the white, not the boys.

1209
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,260
That sounds like something out of Lord of the Rings.

1210
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,860
It's just like the name Avery.

1211
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,340
Its roots are in the word Elfish or Elvish.

1212
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,140
Mm-hmm, see?

1213
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:54,920
Lord of the Rings.

1214
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,420
I told you, it always comes back to that.

1215
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,260
Avery?

1216
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,200
Well, it's...

1217
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,080
Comets are Satan.

1218
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:04,340
Yes, Avery comes from Anglo-Saxon, Aelfric, meaning friend of elves.

1219
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,360
And Elvis is far closer to this cognate root.

1220
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:10,580
Oh, yeah.

1221
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,740
Yes, of course, you didn't think they were human, did you?

1222
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,240
No, they're of the Djinn.

1223
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:14,500
I've never heard of them.

1224
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,700
They're of the generations of Lilith.

1225
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,460
Now, you can recognize these changing spirits.

1226
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,420
These infrared humans.

1227
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,260
For one thing, they just don't have earlobes.

1228
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,880
They have little pointed ears, like Reverend Baby Bear.

1229
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:38,660
And in addition, they also have slanted eyes that seem to be looking at you slant and dickularly.

1230
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,460
And mocking your human preoccupations.

1231
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,260
That sounds kind of like Baby Bear, too.

1232
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,900
Yes, oh, she's definitely one of them.

1233
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,860
...not in years when Elvis has died.

1234
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,960
And we spend all our time mooning after Elvis.

1235
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,280
And others who are long gone, when in our midst are those who can easily replace them.

1236
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,540
And they have little stubby tails, like Baby Bear, too.

1237
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,740
And who are already long gone is Joan of Armitch.

1238
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,900
They can summon flocks of vultures.

1239
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:03,680
Oh, they plan on Calvary, see.

1240
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,600
Yes, that's right.

1241
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,180
...the kind of a citizen.

1242
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,640
But are you talking about the Arby's Stubs?

1243
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,380
Yes.

1244
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,460
No, Fidel Castro.

1245
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,640
He was the first promigatal of the Oriental Arc.

1246
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,840
The man is still alive.

1247
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,680
Oh, not like Charles Manson, anyway.

1248
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,420
Not, you know, without ladies' lingerie or something.

1249
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:20,860
Hmm.

1250
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:26,980
I, uh, I'm talking about Fidel, you know, and not, uh, Charlie Manson.

1251
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:35,080
I, uh, don't see that they belong in the same breath and, uh, much worse than neither are a subgenius.

1252
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:43,020
I read today that Ted Cruz's dad tried to join Fidel Castro's revolutionaries, and they wouldn't, they wouldn't take him.

1253
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,140
No, it was, uh, 4F.

1254
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,600
He was, yep, 4F, rejected.

1255
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,840
The problem was, was that the Bay of Pigs was...

1256
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:50,840


1257
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,540
...the Bay of Pigs was actually invaded by pigs.

1258
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,280
Yeah, it was...

1259
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,720
That's right, it was pig man.

1260
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,560
...and just...

1261
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,220
...pigs earlier with...

1262
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,280
Pig man led the invasion.

1263
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:58,660
...unlimited.

1264
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,980
And then, then, you know, how can you depend on the pigs?

1265
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,720
Well, you can't.

1266
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,800
That's the problem there.

1267
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,940
I think you can't make bacon out of it...

1268
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,880
...and other tasty, uh, products like pulled pork sandwiches and stuff like that.

1269
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,500
I think that's what people need to do right now...

1270
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:13,520
Exactly.

1271
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:13,520


1272
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,120
Now, pull the pork over your own eyes.

1273
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:15,420
...and take the dirt...

1274
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,620
Have you ever seen a bunch of cops swimming over an ocean?

1275
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,840
There's no Bay of Pigs.

1276
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,160
It was a, it was a fallacy.

1277
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,020
It was just like a landing on the moon.

1278
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,600
It didn't happen.

1279
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,660
I got an email from pig man.

1280
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:23,780
It was staged.

1281
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,560
Yeah, what about that?

1282
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,400
Pig man writes all the time.

1283
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:27,740
I got an email from pig man.

1284
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,060
Constantly.

1285
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:28,680
Wow.

1286
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,720
We hear from pig man.

1287
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,720
I got, I got a call from him a few weeks ago.

1288
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,240
Oh.

1289
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,440
Yeah, he said...

1290
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,580
Yeah, he, he said complimentary things to, to us on Facebook.

1291
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,460
Wow.

1292
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:37,980
Yeah.

1293
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:38,400
Sure.

1294
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,900
Pigs are, are benign.

1295
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,020
Well, he claimed to be pig man.

1296
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,480
I don't know if he's really a pig man.

1297
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,480
No, of course...

1298
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,780
I couldn't hear him, so I couldn't tell if it was really pig man.

1299
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,140
Of course, in prehistoric times, there were terrifying giant pigs, which, uh, you wouldn't

1300
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,740
have wanted to, to meet at any time, but these have died out.

1301
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,940
Let's be honest.

1302
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:55,860
Like the diadon.

1303
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,300
Can you imagine a bay full of them?

1304
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,980
Do you think they died out, or do you think that maybe the early humans, uh, made bacon

1305
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,860
out of them?

1306
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,780
Well, out of some of these...

1307
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,980
Or just gave them diseases or something, you know.

1308
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,600
They were like giant flesh-eating boars as large as bears.

1309
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,380
Oh, you mean like the hosts of the show?

1310
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,380
Well, that was...

1311
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,880
Giant flesh-eating boars.

1312
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,040
By the way, folks, it is, uh, it is...

1313
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,140
I'm sorry.

1314
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,200
It is time for us to pause for, uh, for station identification here, actually, here.

1315
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,440
Yes, it certainly is.

1316
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,060
So, uh, why don't, uh, we let pig man himself do it for us?

1317
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:33,220
You listen to the 50,000 pound monster in my pants.

1318
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:34,900
WCSB.

1319
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,320
Cleveland.

1320
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,120
That's right.

1321
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,600
That's the real pig man.

1322
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,780
That's the real pig man.

1323
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,540
Pigo, pigara, squealy, gruntum.

1324
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,060
And, uh, yeah...

1325
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,500
I'll get that corporatism out of the way.

1326
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,380
Okay, uh...

1327
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,400
Corporatism, right.

1328
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,640
We're, we're so corporate, it hurts.

1329
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,140
I'm sorry.

1330
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1331
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1332
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1333
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1334
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1335
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1336
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1337
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:50,140


1338
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,040
How do we represent corporatism?

1339
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,740
That, that hurts my iron, man, just to think of, of the very thought that the person would

1340
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,560
pick up the phone and call here and then accuse everyone hence of corporate deviance.

1341
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,320
I'm a hog for you, baby.

1342
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,400
Can't get enough of your love.

1343
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,200
Well, you try and explain your problems, the things that are bothering you...

1344
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,760
When I go to sleep at night, that's the only thing I'm dreaming of.

1345
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,940
Bob has never been opposed to corporatism.

1346
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,080
Bob has never been opposed to corporatism.

1347
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1348
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1349
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1350
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1351
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1352
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1353
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1354
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1355
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1356
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1357
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1358
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1359
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,120


1360
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,500
I'm sorry.

1361
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,940
I'm your host, Dr. Sinister.

1362
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,440
With me in the studio, we have our special guests here, Dr. Holland Owl, Princess Wee

1363
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,840
Ardo, and Reverend Ivan Stang.

1364
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,720
He got into my breeches once more.

1365
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,160
I might hear, too.

1366
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,100
And we also have Lonesome Cowboy Dave, the inimitable...

1367
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,620
It is so.

1368
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,520
We have we.

1369
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,500
We have we.

1370
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,180
Wee, wee, wee, on the way home.

1371
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,360
And it's been such a tiramisu of a show, so many layers of...

1372
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,040
That's true.

1373
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,740
Yeah, I can't understand any of it.

1374
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, it's, uh...

1375
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,740
Very easy.

1376
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,480
Just turn your script back a few pages and take it from the top of page 38...

1377
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,860
I thought the script was upside down.

1378
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,980
No wonder I couldn't hear it.

1379
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,160
Well, that's the thing.

1380
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,200
You've got to look at it.

1381
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,500
Of course, you can always wing it if you're just inspired.

1382
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,940
Try putting your glasses on.

1383
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,360
Sometimes you can hear better that way.

1384
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,160
My glasses.

1385
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,080
Oh, I can't see a thing without my glasses.

1386
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,660
I can hear a thing without my glasses.

1387
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,420
Yeah, they, uh...

1388
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,460
That's anesthesia for you.

1389
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,340
Yes, it is.

1390
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,360
Well, those glasses are pure...

1391
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,860
A very poor excuse for real...

1392
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:19,980
Oh, my God.

1393
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,500
...kind of goggles we need in the new century if we're gonna get off this planet.

1394
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,700
You know who had synesthesia, right?

1395
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,280
...kind of goggles and not only see the future in the past year...

1396
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,380
Many of the old-time greats.

1397
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,560
...Coloridge certainly did.

1398
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,760
...gobbles again.

1399
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,560
Really?

1400
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,340
Coloridge had, uh, synesthesia?

1401
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,220
He definitely did, and he often, in his poems, praises the stars for not making noise and...

1402
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,400
Like that when...

1403
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,420
You know, or icicles for not making noise for a change.

1404
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,080
...if you want.

1405
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,660
And normally, he hears all these sounds associated with their sights.

1406
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,640
Well, a woman has synesthesia.

1407
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,440
He also has some pretty good opium, doesn't he?

1408
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,760
Well, he had to...

1409
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,160
He had to take that for some other complications.

1410
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,140
...right, or that was Coleridge, or...

1411
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,100
That was Coleridge.

1412
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,600
...Matchmas?

1413
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,480
It was Coleridge.

1414
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,800
Well, I was just...

1415
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,520
I was just wondering if Dave was discussing glandular globulation.

1416
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,800
Oh, good Lord.

1417
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,880
Oh, I could discuss it freely for hours.

1418
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,680
More glad-gland-handing.

1419
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,660
Yeah.

1420
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,640
But what a way to say goodbye to the universe, we put it that way.

1421
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,980
Glandular globularization.

1422
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,980
What the hell is it anyway?

1423
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:29,640
The universe is just a great big smiling face, laughing and a giggling way out in outer space.

1424
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,480
Yeah, thanks a lot, Tim Leary.

1425
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,340
Okay, all right, all right.

1426
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:40,200
Let's get back down to solid Portland cement brick reality level.

1427
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,140
Now, real life is gritty and uncomfortable, and there's a good reason.

1428
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,940
I'm not even on electricity.

1429
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,360
And he giggled a lot.

1430
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,540
Not throughout the entire lecture.

1431
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,140
Who?

1432
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,560
Tim Leary?

1433
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,900
Ferro-whale oil is what we should go back to.

1434
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,720
Yes, and we're going to have to.

1435
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:57,740
Ferro-whale oil?

1436
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,260
Exactly.

1437
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,360
I'm going to ask the Republican Presidency to-

1438
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:01,880
Forget told.

1439
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,200
Don't be Republican on me.

1440
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,400
Right.

1441
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:04,860
Right.

1442
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:10,560
The Republican Presidency is absolutely theocratic, because I know that to be true, by the way-

1443
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,080
Well, that's because you're a newspaper reporter for the Marylode Morning Mungpie.

1444
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,340
And as the columnist in the book, I guess, I think you're saying that you're auyoric

1445
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,340


1446
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,340


1447
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:19,340


1448
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,980
Man, I'd just like to tell all you kids out there,

1449
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,400
please don't bring those big funguses into Dr. Meanypenny's office anymore

1450
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,560
because he's getting sick.

1451
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,200
Too late.

1452
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,860
He's getting sicker and sicker every day.

1453
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,800
Boys, raise giant mushrooms in your cellar.

1454
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,640
To bake a pie, you must leave it on a ledge for two hours.

1455
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,200
We left it in the oven, see?

1456
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,160
It's kind of cooking itself while we're cooking.

1457
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:47,020
Well, you know, if you're really interested in fungi,

1458
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,340
you could come to the Starwood Festival

1459
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,520
and listen to Eat More Toadstools talk about fungi.

1460
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,040
And what a fun guy he is.

1461
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,800
He is a fun guy.

1462
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,860
He's Radagast the Ridiculous.

1463
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,460
You know what I always thought would be a great name for a hippie jam band

1464
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,560
would be 4 and 20 Blackbirds.

1465
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,720
Yeah, baked until they cry.

1466
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,940
Winnipeg was open.

1467
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,080
When the burst began to sing, wasn't that a Danish dish to 2x4 the king?

1468
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,120
Canadian cities, I'm counting.

1469
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,320
We were in a malady shoot, I know.

1470
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,940
4 and 20.

1471
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,740
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye.

1472
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,540
You know, I heard he was a real oddball.

1473
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,400
Who was?

1474
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,220
Winnipeg is more of a village.

1475
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,680
Homer, the blind bard and seer?

1476
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,720
The blind bard, yes, of ancient Greece.

1477
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,440
The blind jaundiced bard of the Sympathians.

1478
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,580
He had to be led around by a little child.

1479
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,500
A little child led him by the hand.

1480
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,240
That wasn't his hand.

1481
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,880
That had nothing to do with the harpies or the earcrash.

1482
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,700
He didn't have harpies.

1483
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,420
Oh, I see what you mean.

1484
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,480
Well, uh...

1485
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:11,860
I wondered why a patch of skin on my arm turned yellow.

1486
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:14,680
I cast a jaundice delay at this whole affair.

1487
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,640
Uh, some people said,

1488
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,840
I must have bruised it.

1489
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,860
I don't know why.

1490
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,560
A portion of one's flesh should turn yellow.

1491
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,660
If you don't bruise it, you lose it.

1492
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,120
God appears, and God is light

1493
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,160
to those who dwell in realms of night.

1494
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,340
Uh, hello, am I on?

1495
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,780
Okay, let's go over that again.

1496
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,980
You say you saw some sort of monster.

1497
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,560
I swear to God, I wasn't drunk.

1498
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,300
I seen it.

1499
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,620
Well, you know, I'm sure you thought you saw

1500
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,160
what you said you saw, but, you know,

1501
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,440
uh, today, we've put a man on the moon.

1502
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,560
I mean, there just aren't any monsters anymore.

1503
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,200
The human mind is a strange thing.

1504
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:54,720
It can play a strange trick.

1505
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,800
What about the vampire squid?

1506
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,760
That is distressingly real.

1507
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,540
Yeah, what about that vampire?

1508
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,280
Vampyro toothus.

1509
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,820
No one was meant to see that thing.

1510
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:03,600
Infernalis.

1511
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,160
Yes, the vampire blood-sucking squid

1512
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,580
of the infernal regions.

1513
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,180
Hanna-Barbera tried to propagandize it

1514
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,860
with their squidly-diddly cartoons.

1515
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,640
But they didn't fool anyone.

1516
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,380
And, uh, in addition to that,

1517
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,440
there's not only the giant squid down there,

1518
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,780
but now there's the colossal squid.

1519
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:25,840
The kraken.

1520
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,760
Even larger, with a more bloated bulk.

1521
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,940
Well, the kraken was, uh,

1522
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,280
was larger still,

1523
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,080
according to Bishop Ponto-Pidan,

1524
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,120
who wrote of it in his, uh,

1525
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:37,820
uh,

1526
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,660
work on sea monsters.

1527
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,560
And Gesner also,

1528
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,980
in his Historia Gentibus Anima,

1529
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,280
the volume,

1530
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,760
describes how this huge beast

1531
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,080
rises up through the ocean,

1532
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:54,960
wraps its tentacules around a passing ship,

1533
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,000
and pulls the whole megilla down under the water.

1534
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,320
And the fishermen know that when he, the kraken, is rising,

1535
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,140
then the fishing is good,

1536
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,440
because he's displacing them all toward the top of the water.

1537
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,240
But he can get a little too close,

1538
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:13,100
if you catch my meaning,

1539
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,140
and I think you do.

1540
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,660
Then there are other sea-eye monsters.

1541
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,360
What's that monster that's so big that he looks like an island?

1542
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,880
Well, there are several.

1543
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,120
There is, of course, the Phastotokalon,

1544
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,600
the giant, uh, turtle, reported by all authorities.

1545
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,540
But then it was said of some of the larger species of

1546
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,480
pficeter, or spouting monster,

1547
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,360
that they too resembled an island.

1548
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,580
Milton, in Paradise Lost, writes of the Leviathan,

1549
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,820
which God, of all his works,

1550
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,620
created hugest that swim the ocean's stream.

1551
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,960
Him happily slumbering on the Norway foam,

1552
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,440
the pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,

1553
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,100
deeming some island oft as seaman tell,

1554
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,760
with fixed anchor in his scaly rind,

1555
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,820
moors by his side under the lee,

1556
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,920
while night invests the sea and wish-it-morn delays.

1557
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,000
Wow.

1558
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,760
For those of you who are, uh,

1559
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,720
wishing to get some answers to life's persistent questions,

1560
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,060
here, we'll now have a viewer from the Vistinia Skis,

1561
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,680
Novišta, 15 is the number to call.

1562
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,960
Hello, you're on the air.

1563
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:23,680
I guess the study of sea monsters can be a profitable one,

1564
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,880
and, uh, actually illuminates one of the major scientific controversies of our time.

1565
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,780
Hello, you're on the air for the last edition of Synesthesia Ever,

1566
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,520
because the saucers are coming next week.

1567
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:38,080
Well, um, I have another controversial question

1568
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,040
for your, uh, subgeni, uh, guest.

1569
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,720
Oh, yeah.

1570
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,700
All right, uh, hold on.

1571
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,700
Let's hear it.

1572
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,880
The doctors are in the house, man.

1573
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,440
Shout-out.

1574
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,760
Okay, so...

1575
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,780
And ready to operate without warning.

1576
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,020
So, we have, uh, been, uh, informed that, uh,

1577
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,060
this conspiracy has messed with the calendar, so, um...

1578
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,980
Yes.

1579
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,820
You know, we can't be sure, uh,

1580
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,340
if this July 5th is gonna be THE July 5th.

1581
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,720
I'm just wondering, um, how do we know what, uh,

1582
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,020
calendar system Bob was using when he, uh, made his prediction?

1583
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,820
I mean, there's so many different calendars that people don't know anything about,

1584
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,860
I mean, or, uh, there are only obscure uses.

1585
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,540
Um, how do we know that Bob was using some sort of, um,

1586
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,180
obscure or maybe even extraterrestrial calendar system

1587
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,860
that, uh, is unknown to anyone but Bob himself?

1588
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,040
Referring to...

1589
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,720
I guess we don't.

1590
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,580
...year 8,661?

1591
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,440
The...

1592
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,200
When the saucers come, you can zero your, uh, timer right then.

1593
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,100
Yeah, then you can set your watch and your calendar and everything.

1594
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:48,560
Right now, it's, there's pointless, it's pointless to twiddle that dial.

1595
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,360
Look, we don't really even know what planet this is.

1596
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,100
How do you know this is Earth?

1597
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,720
Sure, they call it Earth.

1598
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,660
Have you, are you sure it's the third one from the Sun?

1599
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,940
Has it always been the third one from the Sun?

1600
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,200
Does it matter?

1601
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,780
And what about Vulcan?

1602
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,360
How, how do we not know that every morning we wake up,

1603
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,420
it's the same, like, tunnel under the world?

1604
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,940
It's the same, same thing.

1605
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,020
It's like, we've got these...

1606
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,540
They were asking that in caves.

1607
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,560
...the ground hollows.

1608
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,900
Ancient Greece, come on.

1609
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,260
Well, that's a logical fallacy, though.

1610
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,420
What if every time we say it, it just shatters?

1611
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,560
Because, you see, it's impossible that we could evolve differently

1612
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,880
than to apprehend our immediate environment.

1613
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,820
So any philosophical sophistry about,

1614
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,780
oh, well, we can never tell what's really there, is quite wrong.

1615
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,860
That's the one thing that we can do,

1616
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:41,740
because otherwise, we'd be dead.

1617
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,780
Dead, dead.

1618
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,740
And furthermore, okay, if you want to argue that we can never know anything at all,

1619
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,240
then why have any discussions about anything at all, ever?

1620
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,660
Yeah, stop wasting my time.

1621
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,020
Shut up.

1622
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,480
If you're going to tell me that I can't know anything at all,

1623
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,920
why, I kind of resemble that remark.

1624
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,440
I think it's ridiculous to assume that we know what we thought we already knew,

1625
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,760
that we didn't know, that we didn't, just what you just said.

1626
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,920
Oh, yes, friends, and we have been listening to the Hour of Slack,

1627
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,760
but really, it's been Radio Synesthesia

1628
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,160
from about three weeks ago, just before X Day,

1629
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:20,220
taken from Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB Cleveland.

1630
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:26,780
We'll be back to normal Hours of Slack whenever Hour of Slack becomes normal.

1631
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,920
In the meantime, you can check out subgenius.com

1632
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,020
or simply praise Bob.

1633
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:35,120
Thank you.
