1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,420
Look! I know who it is! I know who it is that doesn't belong among us! I swear I know who it is!

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,100
It's...

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,300
The Self Genius Hour of Swag!

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,640
Oh, that's not true!

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,700
Something was missing. It was my pills.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,680
I wonder if that guy bombed or something.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,000
I guess I better...

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,400
Run over there.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,060
Doug! Doug!

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,080
Oh yeah, okay, what?

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,680
Down here.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,720
Oh, okay.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,580
Where are we going?

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,500
The Dark River.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,280
Where are we going?

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,820
Tunnel ride.

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,700
Don't worry.

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,720
Just, like, hand the guy a cordial.

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,900
That guy took all my pills.

20
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,040
Yeah, well, don't worry about those pills.

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,680
You don't need those pills anymore.

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,900
Okay, well, I still got my tape recorder and my camera.

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,580
You don't need those anymore either.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,300
Give them to me.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,100
Come on.

26
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,420
Whoa, look out!

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,980
Whoa!

28
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,540
Whoa, Doug!

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,420
Look out, Doug!

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,080
Doug Wellman and Paul Mavridis at Disneyland.

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,960
And this is the Disneyland of the diseased mind.

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,960
Diseased-ny-land.

33
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,600
So, get ready.

34
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,440
Turn your tape decks on.

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,500
Or whatever.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Because, uh...

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,660
28 minutes...

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:36,960
28 minutes of this show is Reverend Susie the Floozy's special Rush Limbaugh episode

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,300
of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

40
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:47,300
So, be ready to overdose on slack, friends, on Susie's fantastic skill at the casting

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,340
out of false prophets.

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,280
Your mortal enemy is on the radio!

43
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,080
The way things ought to be.

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,960
By me, Rush H. Limbaugh III.

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,920
I decided to make this recording to tell a little bit about myself and my radio show

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,660
and one of the people who unknowingly provided me with the guidance and inspiration to better myself.

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,240
You went the surprise of your life.

48
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,960
Take one of these pills.

49
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,100
My beliefs are my heart and soul, the essence of my being.

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,880
And I never betray them or misrepresent them in the pursuit of narcotics.

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,080
But if you must...

52
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,540
You must.

53
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,960
You must.

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,360
You must.

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


59
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,360


62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,240
I know why I'm on the radio.

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,640
Excellent.

64
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,380
Otherwise, we wouldn't know of this enlightened and marvelous way of turning on.

65
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,540
Incredible!

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,340
Now, this is staggering.

67
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh...

68
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,980
Did I tell you?

69
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,700
Give the watch and this bottle a million dollars!

70
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,260
A million!

71
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,680
A million!

72
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,040
Oh!

73
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,640
I like that so much, I've stolen it from them.

74
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,620
I now use it myself.

75
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,380
Oh!

76
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,400
Oh!

77
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,060
This could be a problem.

78
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,680
Don't worry. He's taking a million of these capsules.

79
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,900
Yeah, I see.

80
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Well, I acquired it legally. You can be sure of that.

81
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,260
Doesn't add up.

82
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,520
Doesn't add up.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,160
You figure it out.

84
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,980
When you multiply my dangerous vices by one and a half million times,

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,700
and then multiply that figure by my 20 years on the radio,

86
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,260
you get a stunning number.

87
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,020
30 million.

88
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,040
I will admit to you that if they legalize the country's heroin that runs my corrupt empire,

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,600
I will wither away, just like the communist empire did.

90
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,000
The truth about this whole sordid man's life will eventually find its way into the mainstream press.

91
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,240
And when it does, you who have supported and believed me will be embarrassed and shocked.

92
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,740
Mark my words.

93
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,440
Seems to be wandering aimlessly.

94
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,280
To the contrary. For it is they you see, because...

95
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,900
What?

96
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,360
That's what they do.

97
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,620
Come on.

98
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,340
As I was preparing this production, I encountered a recurring problem.

99
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,600
Nope.

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Again, no.

101
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,660
Wrong O.

102
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,480
Telephone.

103
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,520
Yes.

104
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,120
Rock, how are ya?

105
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,620
I want country heroin.

106
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,580
Oh, yeah. That'd be great.

107
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,580
And I got something really fantastic to show you.

108
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,360
Drugs?

109
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,320
Yeah, no, we'll expect you this Saturday.

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,360
To the contrary.

111
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,020
Real efforts will do a lot more than false compassion.

112
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,100
I'll make a deal with you. I'll make a deal.

113
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,920
The nerve.

114
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,520
I look for a deal every day, not just every Christmas.

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,580
If you be patient, then we'll take you away any place you want to go.

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,900
Nuts.

117
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,560
I have one word for such defeatism.

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,560


119
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,560


120
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,560


121
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,900
Nonsense.

122
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,260
I'm right in the middle of a very important experiment right now.

123
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,900
Give me a minute.

124
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,440
Uh...

125
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,880
But anything that we've talked about is just between you and I, okay?

126
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,740
Is no big deal to me.

127
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,460
Now...

128
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,820
You take this, and you try and get some sleep.

129
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,340
Okay? Did it go down?

130
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,220
Uh...

131
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,860
Now you just try and get some sleep, and I'll be back in a while.

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,760
Thank you, and may God bless you.

133
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,180
You're distrusted?

134
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,420
You've got to relax. The man is my best friend.

135
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,300
I went to college with him.

136
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,440
There was absolutely no problem with him.

137
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,220
So there it was, this unique blend of cocaine and heroin that I thought would make me popular.

138
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,420
I wanted to be noticed and liked.

139
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,860
I just thought I had to do great shows.

140
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,080
I was wrong.

141
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,680
Wow, that was a great show.

142
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,020
I never thought about why, and in truth, I was afraid of finding out.

143
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,840
My fear was that the discovery would cause me to become a caricature of myself.

144
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,260
You're well known, sir, for your lenient stance on crime.

145
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,420
But suppose for a second that your house was ransacked by thugs,

146
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,680
your family tied up in the basement with socks in their mouths,

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,180
you try to open the door, but there's too much blood on the knob.

148
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,100
What is your question?

149
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,220
My question's about the budget, sir.

150
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,800
I don't know about you, but I like to have fun.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,060
I like drug abuse, especially country heroin.

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
Wow, that was a great buzz.

153
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh. Oh.

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,060
You know, he only has the mentality of about an eight-year-old.

155
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,860
Oh, really?

156
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,040
He'd suffered irreparable brain damage from lack of oxygen.

157
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Wow, that was a great rush.

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,020
Oh, I will admit to you that I like to rob and kill mentally unbalanced hookers.

159
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,460
I like really drugging radical feminist sisters, especially the elderly,

160
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,140
after hours in the privacy of their own homes.

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

162
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,820
Oh?

163
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,040
Ooh, don't steal a shopping cart from the supermarket,

164
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,800
but if you do, make sure nobody sees you.

165
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,780
A little Indian lingo there.

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,500
Oh, I am at one with the tree.

167
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,340
The woman was so hopeless.

168
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,880
Hell, we may as well go all the way into the trash dumpster.

169
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,560
Oh, boy, jerk!

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,700
Ooh.

171
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,860
Oh, shit!

172
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,300
Oh, dumpster dining.

173
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,520
Why wouldn't you do that if I were you?

174
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Well, we could.

175
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,640
Turn out the lights, sit down with an adult beverage, and just...

176
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,880
Look at that frog.

177
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,480
This demonstration...

178
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,480


179
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,620
...incorporates what should not be eaten out of trash dumpsters.

180
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,000
You see, the dumpster toads secrete a hallucinogenic substance near the back of its head

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that can get you high if you lick it.

182
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,540
Maybe I should pick it up and lick it.

183
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
Oh, I hadn't licked that frog.

184
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,280
I'm going to.

185
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,340
Wow, that was great fun.

186
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,820
Ooh.

187
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,880
Well, nobody put that woman in the dumpster.

188
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,720
She climbed in herself.

189
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,740
You sleep in a trash dumpster, you run the risk of being crushed by a dumpster truck.

190
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,860
An adult male toad was observed during amplexus with an adult female toad.

191
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,460
At least three factors appeared quite unique about this situation.

192
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,140
First, the female was dead and had been for some time.

193
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,680
It appeared as if she had fallen victim to a car.

194
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,860
The limbs were already stuck.

195
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,060
The abdomen greatly distended and the smell of putrefaction about her.

196
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,840
Secondly, of course, it appears strange that the male should be so intent as to fail to observe the female's condition.

197
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
Thirdly, the time and place we encountered this pair was unusual.

198
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,820
It was at 1400 hours on a sunny afternoon, but even more interesting was the location.

199
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,420
The middle of the road.

200
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,140
We better start the autopsy right now.

201
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,400
Well, guess what?

202
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,860
A couple of days later after the autopsy, it is learned that the person was drinking alcohol.

203
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,440
The woman was drinking a cheap brand of wine called Free Hookers.

204
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,120
I was appalled. I was shocked.

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
I was fuming. I was livid.

206
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,220
I was in awe.

207
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,640
Upon returning to my program the following Monday, I walk into the studios and sit down behind that golden microphone.

208
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,380
All movies on.

209
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:49,900
My critics are such dim-witted fools who feel it necessary to spoon-feed the public with the proper version and details of events, all the while denying that they do it.

210
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,660
So long as something makes them look good, to heck with the facts.

211
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,980
And with anyone who dares to defy them by exposing those facts.

212
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,620
Point is that standards of right and wrong and basic decency must be established and must be maintained.

213
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:13,160
If they are not, our one individual action multiplied many times can corrode the entire moral fiber of the country.

214
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,220
Consider drug abuse.

215
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,340
A lot of people say we should legalize cocaine and heroin.

216
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,880
But the fact that people are going to do it, it is not a good thing.

217
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,240
The fact that people are going to ignore and break laws is not a valid argument for decriminalization.

218
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,460
It's easy for people to say that if they shoot up on heroin, the only people they're hurting are themselves.

219
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,840
But that's not true.

220
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:41,900
If someone becomes an irresponsible human being and a worthless citizen, he is directly or indirectly affecting everyone else who is willing to live up to the responsibilities of citizenship.

221
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,560
Drug abusers destroy their families.

222
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,860
If we legalize these vices, we erode the societal support for prohibition.

223
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,640
We are not legalizing criminal relations against crimes such as murder.

224
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,940
Those who are drug or alcohol abusers are evil.

225
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,380
They couldn't be considered normal.

226
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,300
I'm talking about using tough love here.

227
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,500
It might be a start at forcing them to confront the misery caused largely by their own behavior.

228
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,460
People are going to have to start accepting responsibility for their actions.

229
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,260
And I think it is incumbent upon all of us to be concerned about the values we transfer to succeeding generations.

230
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:25,100
When we take actions that cheapen life, we're contributing to an overall decline in our society's moral values.

231
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,780
Now tell me, who would do that kind of thing?

232
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,100
I don't need to improve much in this area, but admit it, many of you people do.

233
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm proud, extremely proud of my accomplishments.

234
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,320
They are significant.

235
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,260
But you know, people often confuse the role callers play in a great talk show.

236
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,100
The primary purpose of callers on my show is to make me look good.

237
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Here, finally, was someone on the radio saying what they felt, what they said to their friends and family.

238
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,320
Hey, Rog, I don't want to get into a discussion of ethics with you about all of this.

239
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,460
Mm-hmm, I'll pick word to say the least, intransigent.

240
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,180
But you do have another problem.

241
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,460
Now you mentioned some woes there.

242
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,100
Don't you understand what it is I'm trying to do?

243
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,260
Nope.

244
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,940
Come on.

245
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm collecting money.

246
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,260
Money?

247
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:16,840
What's up?

248
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,580
I was incredulous.

249
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,480
The nerve.

250
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,300
I don't let considerations of money dictate the level or manner of my performance.

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,840
Oh, honey, come on.

252
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,520
I don't say things on the air.

253
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,480
You taking those pills?

254
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,220
I gave you some pills.

255
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,560
Tranquilizers.

256
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
To the contrary, part of showbiz...

257
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,540
Don't you understand what money is?

258
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,100
...is no big deal to me.

259
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,740
We have a $400 debt.

260
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,040
With the money I've spent on drugs since the 1960s,

261
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,360
I could have bought the entire assets of every Fortune 500 company,

262
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,940
and still Rush wants more.

263
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,400
You know it.

264
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,120
I know it.

265
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,740
And more importantly, they know it.

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,160
Oh, you did what?

267
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,380
Oh, man.

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,140
Now, my friends, isn't this just typical?

269
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,100
Another intelligent conservative here, railroaded by our liberal justice system,

270
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,020
just like Colonel Oliver North, Officer Stacy B.

271
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,000
Coon, and cartoon smokesperson Joe Camel.

272
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,920
Well, I've had it.

273
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,080
Oh.

274
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,220
Got a hangover?

275
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,980
Ha-ha!

276
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,720
Many of you take things way too seriously in most cases,

277
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,300
so come on.

278
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,080
We should all laugh at yourselves.

279
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,660
And if you can't laugh at yourself, laugh at me.

280
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,100
They were rejoicing, to be blunt about it.

281
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,420
I'm going to get you!

282
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,860
Damn you!

283
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,060
But that wasn't all.

284
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,120
The audience thought this was some of the best entertainment they had heard on radio

285
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,700
in a long time, particularly from a conservative.

286
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,720
You should go on that radio station and let him have it.

287
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,520
Good idea.

288
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,500
People were going crazy over my latest lunacies.

289
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,300
It's a monster!

290
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,340
Kill it!

291
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,520
I copy!

292
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,540
Kill it!

293
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,120
As it turns out, I had underestimated just how liberal many people could be.

294
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,800
That's good.

295
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,140
It's gone!

296
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,880
It's gone!

297
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,360
It's gone!

298
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,000
It's gone!

299
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000


300
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,420
Find him!

301
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,140
Find him!

302
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,720
Find him!

303
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Man, they must have been brewing some of that Jekyll and Hyde joy juice in here.

304
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,940
Well, at least we haven't found any more bodies.

305
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,020
There's nobody in the house.

306
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,460
Sheriff, I've got a quick little thing.

307
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:30,820
Come on.

308
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,420
Oh, let's go.

309
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,080
I'll lead off with the hounds.

310
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,440
Now, if anybody sees it, don't go taking off after them by yourself,

311
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,620
let the rest of us know about it.

312
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,040
You got that?

313
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,120
Right.

314
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,560
OK, let's go.

315
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
Who could help beat that big?

316
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,720
Offhand, there's only one person I know of.

317
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,320
Yeah, but he ain't never hurt nobody.

318
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,340
No.

319
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,300
We've got to find Roger before he discovers June, or we'll go back on it.

320
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,760
It's just without morphine, the pain is just gonna really...

321
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,300
Zing!

322
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,080
You know we're gonna have to destroy him.

323
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,580
Why are you on that much?

324
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,040
The best thing is to get rid of him, get a big stick, and hit him with it.

325
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,840
Practice of going out and getting one of these things and putting them into a billy, boiling it down and eating the residue, I think is absolutely repulsive.

326
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,220
Meanwhile...

327
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,740
If seen, notify your nearest local law enforcement agency immediately.

328
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,420
He is male, Caucasian, weight 560 pounds.

329
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,540
He is extremely dangerous and may be armed.

330
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,200
When I return, you do show.

331
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,880
A friend fixed up the radio.

332
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm amused when opponents refer to me as the most dangerous man in America.

333
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,280
Why am I dangerous?

334
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,020
Simple.

335
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:05,580
Because I am convinced that the rumor mongering against me was an 11th hour attempt to ruin my life.

336
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,260
And I've never witnessed anything so despicable.

337
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,780
Irrespective of the truth of the allegations that I sexually harassed Clarence Thomas,

338
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,220
his reputation...

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,880
and career have been incurably degraded.

340
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,800
And Clarence will test positive for an airborne phenomenon spread by conservative broadcasting.

341
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,860
It's a win-win situation.

342
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,980
Now you figure it out.

343
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,300
I don't know about you, but I will abandon my principles for money.

344
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,780
Sorry, but to be a prostitute is no big deal to me.

345
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,420
Because I'm having fun being stupid.

346
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,320
Hell, we may as well go all the way and then take a junket to some exotic Caribbean island with some lobbyists.

347
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,500
Call communications immediately.

348
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,460
I was impressed with how quickly you got here.

349
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,500
Y'all, see this cancelled all the way down the line.

350
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,320
The people say we don't have enough beds for hookers. Well, we could...

351
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,060
Yes, ma'am, we stopped and we got in just under the wire.

352
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,760
Excellent.

353
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,160
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...

354
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,980
The people say we don't have enough beds for hookers. Well, we could...

355
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,340
Not a bad hideout.

356
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,220
Sometimes I think you even have brains.

357
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,480
Sometimes I think you even have brains.

358
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,480


359
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,240
Sometimes I think you even have brains.

360
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,480
Low pain threshold, eh?

361
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,380
Probably normal.

362
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,220
He'll get better.

363
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,720
Time for a booster!

364
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,880
Have you heard of frog licking?

365
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,420
No!

366
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,360
I told you to stop asking me all those stupid questions. Otherwise, you're never going to eat, right?

367
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,720
Right? Okay. Let's go find something to eat. I'm hungry, imbecile.

368
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,980
Ooh, look at that frog!

369
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,680
You haven't switched from liquor to dope by any chance, have you?

370
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,960
Again, drugs? You figure it out.

371
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,140
I mean, you gotta give these women a hand.

372
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,520
To me, this illustrates what the polls have conclusively shown.

373
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,700
The vast majority of American women didn't think sexual harassment is the most important issue of our time.

374
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,280
Plus, they also think they can handle the situation themselves.

375
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,480
Wrong-o.

376
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,320
Whatever they got you.

377
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,440
You're in for the gold.

378
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,960
There he is!

379
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,960
It's a monster! Kill it!

380
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,040
Let's look at some of the things that happened after the hearings ended.

381
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,960
Well, the young woman brought forward

382
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,340
competitively.

383
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,720
She's got a compelling testimony on what happened.

384
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,420
Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice.

385
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,140
It took 75 federal marshals to bring him down.

386
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,940
Now let's never speak of him again.

387
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,520
Let the record show that the witness may be...

388
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
No shit.

389
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,820
Now, as a conservative, I'm sick and tired of being accused of being heartless and cruel.

390
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,880
I mean, if she were honest, she would admit that what she really wants is me in the womb.

391
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,340
Let the record show that the witness may be...

392
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,240
This may be...

393
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,380
Oh, God.

394
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,280
What?

395
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Tsk, tsk.

396
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,840
You figure it out.

397
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,520
Now look at it in another, and admittedly more provocative way.

398
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,380
What if a man claimed the right to rape,

399
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,780
using the same principle found in the theory that it's his body he has the right to choose?

400
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
On my award-winning Thrill Pack program,

401
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,220
the feminists have gotten the shaft.

402
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,720
And I'll...

403
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,240
Assuming that it has no direct bearing on your problem.

404
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,000
Are you embarrassed?

405
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,380
Talking about your subversive activities?

406
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,560
I was incredulous.

407
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,940
I'm just a harmless, lovable little fuzzball.

408
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,500
Quiet, you awful man!

409
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,800
Y'all laugh like that's a new one.

410
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,760
I am a political prisoner.

411
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,500
I can be arranged.

412
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,100
I think we've got a problem.

413
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,240
I have no idea what's going on.

414
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,240


415
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,940
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

416
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,700
And he hung up.

417
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,640
Meanwhile...

418
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,280
Telephone!

419
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,120
Telephone!

420
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:55,600
Yeah.

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,320
Do it!

422
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,160
Get it done!

423
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,800
Oh.

424
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,380
I said don't ask me how to do it.

425
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,020
I don't wanna be no part of no conspiracy.

426
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,460
Yeah, I see.

427
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,960
But however you do it, do it and get it done now.

428
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,540
If it don't get done, then I'll move on it.

429
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:07,940
Right.

430
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,560
Goodbye.

431
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,180
What'd it say?

432
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
Buckle your seat belts, hang on, and...

433
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,260
take notes, listen with your mind, as well as your heart.

434
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,760
Something's gotta pop!

435
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,860
No, no, no.

436
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,540
Bob!

437
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,600
Bob, come in!

438
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,340
What?

439
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:20,680
What?

440
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,380
Bob!

441
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,560
A fine mohawk to you all.

442
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,620
Our friend Bob!

443
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,680
Oh my God!

444
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,740
Okay!

445
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,360
God, I've been misinformed.

446
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,840
I need to get out of here.

447
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,120
Take it easy if I will you.

448
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,160
Could be the boss would do a little skull massaging himself.

449
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,800
If he knew what happened.

450
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,300
Maybe you just better forget about it.

451
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,760
I don't know the whole thing.

452
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,860
If you're smart.

453
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,680
You know it, I know it.

454
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,400
And more importantly, they know it.

455
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,160
I don't know.

456
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,540
You figure it out.

457
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,560
Mix up the F!

458
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,720
Mix up the F!

459
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,140
Mix up the abusing tongue!

460
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,160
Yeah, we're mix up the F!

461
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Mix up the F!

462
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,740
Mix up the abusing tongue!

463
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,860
Yeah, we're, yeah!

464
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,900
Oh, by God, I'll tell you something, friend.

465
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I have never been so strong.

466
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,020
In my life.

467
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,940
Except on heroin.

468
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,880
Wow, that was a great high.

469
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,600
Well, I was, you know, in this day and time, you can't even get something.

470
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,880
Oh, by God, I'll tell you something, friend.

471
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,560
I have three different sources of junk.

472
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,060
Wrong-o.

473
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,360
I've stolen it from you.

474
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,220
I'm gonna break your damn neck, you son of a bitch.

475
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,680
No!

476
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,760
And it's damaging to myself.

477
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,420
And to my doctor.

478
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,420
And for a booster!

479
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,420
Boom!

480
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,260
No more treatments.

481
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,840
No more pain.

482
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,960
I know what it's like to be on the bottom.

483
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,600
Oh.

484
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,480
Gorilla?

485
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,860
There is no such thing as that gorilla.

486
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,980
It's an hallucination.

487
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,940
The nerve.

488
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,400
Why forget?

489
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,280
Forget the whole thing.

490
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,980
Oh, I am at one with the tree.

491
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,100
You have to promise me that this isn't gonna happen this time.

492
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,460
To do drugs?

493
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,300
No.

494
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,720
Not according to the law.

495
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,200
Most people I know wouldn't lick a frog, even if it did give them a buzz.

496
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,060
I agree.

497
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,540
Oh, Christ.

498
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,640
Thank you, and may God bless you.

499
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,480
So naive.

500
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,900
Poor Ruby, son.

501
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,620
Woo!

502
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,220
And Ruby.

503
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,640
Simple.

504
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,660
Because I am convinced that the most important thing is to just take drugs one and a half

505
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,540
million times.

506
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,340
People say we don't have enough country heroin for them.

507
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,160
So what we need to do is eliminate laws, get rid of the police.

508
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,280
That way, there will be no paranoia, schizophrenia, or deep depression.

509
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,640
That means I can be myself.

510
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,900
Well, he's even better.

511
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,740
I agree.

512
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,680
I like the human touch.

513
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,920
Is there anything to that story about that two-headed man stuff?

514
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,220
Sometimes, too much imagination can destroy man, deputy.

515
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:04,380
It's incredible how many things we seem to hide.

516
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,340
All the real things we can't admit to.

517
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,880
And these are all lies.

518
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


519
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


520
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


521
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


522
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


523
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


524
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


525
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


526
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


527
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


528
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


529
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


530
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,880


531
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
Because of pride

532
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,160
We never could say we cared

533
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,640
No matter how much we shared

534
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,440
Too many times

535
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,380
The thunder calls the rain

536
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,560
It's incredible

537
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,320
How much we really are

538
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:53,360
Well, that's nonsense. The American people did that.

539
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,140
I just helped amplify their drug abuse.

540
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,400
Ladies and gentlemen, Rush Limbaugh!

541
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,520
They say that I'm sleaze and elitist

542
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,980
You please, everybody disagrees with my rap

543
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,700
I'm horrendous, I'm appalling

544
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,640
My ratings now are falling

545
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,320
Cause I'm so full of bull, so full of crap

546
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,860
With condescending crimes, making money, selling lies

547
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,640
You might say everybody hates my guts

548
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm offensive, I'm a bigot, I'm a fraud

549
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,240
Can you dick it? I'm a sexist, racist, homophobic, fat, pathetic

550
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,820
I'm a Nazi

551
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
That's right, I really am

552
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,440
Cause I'm a Nazi

553
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,140
That's right, you're being scammed

554
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,100
I'm a Nazi

555
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,600
I don't care about the middle class

556
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,660
Cause I'm a fat conservative butthead

557
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,420
With a face of a horse's ass

558
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,360
He's a fat conservative butthead

559
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,960
With a face of a horse's ass

560
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,540
I have a subhuman figure, a huge rear end

561
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,340
My brain? That's another story

562
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,500
It's quite another story

563
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,540
I have a face the size of a washtub!

564
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,620
And my ass is as big as Missouri

565
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,320
Yes!

566
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,620
This bastard is sick, he's a fat mob

567
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,740
It's big and his ass is as big as Missouri

568
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,580
Yes, sirree Bob!

569
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,400
Manipulating statements exaggerates the truth

570
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,160
I can't believe the hate my show inspires

571
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,420
The hate my show inspires

572
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,000
It's not just because I'm stupid

573
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,880
It's not just because I'm scum

574
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,640
It's just because Republicans are liars

575
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,820
Those dirty, filthy liars

576
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,880
I am heartless, I am vain, insensitive, insane

577
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,800
They say that I'm a national disgrace

578
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,880
Disgrace

579
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
I am nasty, insulting, basically revolting

580
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,160
I'm a concentrated pile of human waste

581
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
He's human waste

582
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,940
Cause I'm a Nazi

583
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
He's a Nazi

584
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,320
Shit!

585
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,500
How I really am

586
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,640
Cause I'm a Nazi

587
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,540
He's a Nazi

588
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,380
That's right, you're being scammed

589
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,320
I'm a Nazi

590
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,160
He's a Nazi

591
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,880
I don't care about the middle class

592
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,980
Cause I'm a sick Republican sleazeball

593
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,660
With a face of a horse's ass

594
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,620
He's a sick Republican sleazeball

595
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,240
With a face of a horse's ass

596
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,080
They say that this is not about my vanity

597
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
They doubt my sanity

598
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,660
They think I'm nuts

599
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,560
So nuts

600
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,340
I am a cyst on the ass of humanity

601
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,300
Ew!

602
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,920
New Republican slogan, read my tuts

603
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,100
Read his tuts

604
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,520
From the bowels of a baseball taker

605
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,900
Comes the voice of Rush Limbaugh

606
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,660
Heh heh

607
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,420
In closing, let me say

608
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,260
That each and every day

609
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,860
I'm an evil rotten pig

610
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,280
An evil rotten egotistical snob

611
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,000
Evil rotten

612
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,100
I'm the coppo

613
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,000
The coppo

614
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
Joe McCarthy like Gestapo

615
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,920
The right wing foam at the mouth

616
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,460
Jack booted slob

617
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,340
The democratic trash it

618
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,060
Years of liberal bashing

619
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,980
With the equivalent compassion of a grommet

620
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,740
Oh a grommet

621
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,400
With the IQ of a fig

622
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,240
I'm a fat obnoxious pig

623
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,100
And the truth of the matter is

624
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
I'm vomit

625
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,840
He's vomit

626
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,920
Cause I'm a Nazi

627
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,820
He's a Nazi

628
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,200
Shit!

629
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,400
How I really am

630
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,540
Cause I'm a Nazi

631
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,420
He's a Nazi

632
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:01,700
Shit!

633
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:01,840
I'm a Nazi

634
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,840


635
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,840


636
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,840


637
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,840


638
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,840


639
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,200
I'm a Nazi

640
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
He's a Nazi

641
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,760
I don't care about the middle class

642
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,420
Those on the fearmongerings

643
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,900
Come back

644
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,500
With the face of a horse's ass

645
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,820
He's a fat conservative

646
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,460
Buckhead

647
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,580
He's a fat conservative

648
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,320
Republican swizzball

649
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,680
Fear mongerings

650
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,180
Come back

651
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,700
Egotistical ass

652
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,260
My ass

653
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Mean-spirited

654
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,200
Bum-wallering

655
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,860
Fat conservative

656
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,480
Pots

657
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
With the face

658
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,100
Of a horse's ass

659
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,800
Heh heh heh

660
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,400
Make a dildo's Rush

661
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,400


662
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,400


663
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,400


664
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,400


665
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:28,420
Ha ha ha

666
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:28,840
Ha ha ha

667
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,220
Mega dildo's Rush

668
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,820
Rush Limbaugh

669
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,300
As I bring this recording to a close, I would like to leave you with a request.

670
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
And that is, are we really gullible enough to believe my words?

671
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,180
Thank you, and may God bless you.

672
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,420
Wrong again, liberal media.

673
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,200
The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money.

674
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,960
The Way Things Ought to Be was written and read by Rush Limbaugh III.

675
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,460
It was abridged for audio, produced and directed by Susan...

676
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,240
It's Reverend Susie the Floozy to my friend.

677
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,940
Oh, and there's a song by the queers in there, too.

678
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:22,460
You may have guessed that the theme of tonight's episode of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse is celebrities behaving badly.

679
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,700
Oh, that one was all contrived by little moi, but...

680
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,340
Oh, a lot of the other ones tonight are tried and true, dyed in the wool celebrity badness.

681
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,580
So are you ready for a little drunk John Wayne?

682
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
I think you can handle it.

683
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,780
My name is William Wayne.

684
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,160
I don't know, this is so unimportant.

685
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,680
I want to...

686
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:05,740
I want to add anything that I can add to what he said about the fact that you guys are just...

687
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,440
On the American side, geez, I don't know how...

688
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,680
You know, it's so terrible that you don't know how to...

689
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:25,440
There is no way to be a leader in Americana except you guys.

690
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,120
You've got to control it.

691
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,140
We haven't...

692
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,040
We haven't any chance.

693
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,620
You...

694
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:47,700
Naturally, things happen, like at the Columbia University and at the other mother colleges.

695
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,400
No, it really, it's...

696
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:58,340
When I went to school, I went to school at the University of Southern California.

697
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,500
Let me explain something to you.

698
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:11,440
When I went there, I went there when there was a fella in control of the college.

699
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,680
I mean, I mean, he was the boss man there.

700
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:27,860
If anybody had walked into his office and torn down a picture and...

701
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Did excrement in his...

702
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:42,340
Known as the waste paper baskets or had written lewd words on his...

703
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,260
The pictures of his family.

704
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:57,240
We, as members of the college, would have kicked the goddamn hell out of this...

705
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,960
Bar.

706
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:57,960


707
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,660
Bar.

708
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


709
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


710
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


711
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


712
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


713
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


714
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


715
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


716
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


717
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


718
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


719
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


720
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


721
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


722
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


723
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


724
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:58,660


725
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,440
Organization.

726
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:08,840
I can't understand how it can happen in the United States of America that this can happen

727
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,400
and there aren't enough guys of your age to go up.

728
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,460
I don't give a shit if you go to the school or not.

729
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,520
You can't stand to have this happen.

730
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,120
Oh, Christ.

731
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,900
I'm not...

732
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,540
I'm not...

733
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,740
I'm not trying to talk for clapping.

734
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,660
I'm trying...

735
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,080
trying to talk for you guys, you better start thinking.

736
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,120
It's getting to be goddamnediculous.

737
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:41,200
If you guys don't start thinking as men,

738
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,820
we're going to have a lousy country.

739
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,700
Jesus, I have had the chance to be with guys

740
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,340
who are with things and against things.

741
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:04,280
And you know, Christ, you try as I try as a human being

742
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,400
to listen to both sides of everything.

743
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,580
But there's no both sides anymore.

744
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,500
They're just trying to wreck our goddamned country.

745
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,060
It's time for you younger guys to take over.

746
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,480
I don't know what the hell to do.

747
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,460
Each special pedal, Maverick and Mustang Sprint

748
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,780
has red, white, and blue accents.

749
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,260
The hood stripes, the upholstery, the carpeting,

750
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,580
the place where you put your woo-woo and the gear shift.

751
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,260
Scene 5A, take four.

752
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,920
Strong hands for a poetic boy.

753
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,100
Each special pedal, Maverick and Mustang Sprint

754
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,420
has red, white, and blue accents.

755
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,980
The hood stripes, the carpeting, the upholstery,

756
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,460
the backseat where you can push, push a lot

757
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,100
with a long girl with a big wonger on her.

758
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,560
She's bump đumb had a bitch

759
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,980
Nanita- Sir does not speak Americanened.

760
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,060
Mr 옛날 l对 Shopkeeper

761
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:20,700
I guess you can't sell those things.

762
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
You know that?

763
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,980
Oops.

764
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,680
Was it good up until then?

765
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,320
Custer's hoofbeats.

766
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,680
Little bighorn.

767
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,120
Nothing little about it.

768
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,560
It's a bighorn, a son of a...

769
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,740
I'll never forget the size of that squaw

770
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,800
that came out that day

771
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,320
and lifted up the dying brave and ate him.

772
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,820
It was a sparse winter.

773
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,880
Cattle were lowing in the fields

774
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,620
and a giant eagle came down

775
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,980
and shit all over the wigwam.

776
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,120
First time I ever got disgusted

777
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,160
with my national emblem.

778
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
Proud I was. Proud, though.

779
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,940
Proud that it was an eagle shit

780
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,960
instead of some greasy Mexican eagle.

781
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,560
Your American eagle shit stinks, all right,

782
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,540
but it's got an American smell to it.

783
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,940
It's got a smell of new-mown hay,

784
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,440
a smell of dog flop in the streets

785
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,800
in New York City in August.

786
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,880
Got the smell of an old,

787
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,900
old wino tossing his cookies

788
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,060
there on Third Avenue.

789
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,040
It's got the smell of America.

790
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,120
Hear it, America.

791
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,260
Hear it running through

792
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,580
the coursing of her veins.

793
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,060
Your heartbeat pulses with it.

794
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,700
Carl Sandburg wrote of it.

795
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,720
Did he capture his essence?

796
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,040
No, because he wrote the entire story

797
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,920
with his wee-wee.

798
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,140
Kidney trouble.

799
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Wrote 14 volumes of urine.

800
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,340
Come on.

801
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Hold on.

802
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,400
Boo!

803
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,860
Deep in my heart,

804
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,440
in the bowels of a good person,

805
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,060
my bowels are snow-white

806
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,340
as the lily-white froth

807
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,040
that run from the mouth

808
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,100
of an 80-year-old pervert.

809
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,040
Take four.

810
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

811
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,260
John Wayne.

812
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,800
Well, it wasn't really John Wayne.

813
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,740
It was really Bob Ridgely,

814
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,600
the Dallas character actor.

815
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,880
But before that was the real John Wayne,

816
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,420
drunk.

817
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,160
And that was preceded by Rush,

818
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,800
an editing Tower DeForsy

819
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,160
by Reverend Susie the Floozy

820
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,380
from her show on the gorgeous

821
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,740
WREK in Atlanta.

822
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,380
How about that flooz?

823
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,080
Who said those things weren't brains?

824
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,280
I suspect that they might be.

825
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,560
Friends, now,

826
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,620
how about some balance?

827
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,380
Yes, some beautiful balance.

828
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,960
By the way, this music in the background,

829
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,100
is Automatic Robot Fish,

830
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,080
Reverend Angry Larry.

831
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,940
Friends, for balance,

832
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,640
here is Terrence McKenna,

833
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,980
remixed and musicized

834
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,340
by Norell Preff.

835
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,200
All culture

836
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,420
is being destroyed.

837
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,380
All culture

838
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,980
is being sold

839
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,680
down the river

840
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,540
by the sorts of people

841
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,480
who want to turn the entire planet

842
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,340
into an international airport,

843
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:21,960
a rocket,

844
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,060
a rival concourse.

845
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,440
And that's not the victory

846
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,660
of somebody's culture

847
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,540
over somebody else's culture.

848
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,020
Nobody ever had a culture like that.

849
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,280
That's just the victory

850
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,700
of schlockmeisterism and crapola

851
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,820
over good taste and good sense.

852
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,880
Dissolve the conceptual boundary

853
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,560
of ordinary...

854
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,000
We are somehow told

855
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,300
we are infantilized.

856
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,580
We're told, you know,

857
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,800
you can wander around within the

858
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,580
sanctioned playpen

859
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,060
of ordinary consciousness.

860
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,580
And we have some intoxicants over here

861
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,820
if you want to mess yourself up.

862
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,540
We've got some scotch here

863
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,780
and some tobacco and red meat

864
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,860
and some sugar and a little TV

865
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,740
and so forth and so on.

866
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,280
But these boundary-dissolving

867
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,180
hallucinogens that give you

868
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,280
a sense of unity

869
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,520
with your fellow man and nature

870
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,220
are somehow forbidden.

871
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,440
This is an outrage.

872
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,480
It's a sign of cultural immaturity.

873
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,020
And the fact that we tolerate it

874
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,260
is a sign that we are living in a society

875
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,620
as oppressed as any society in the past.

876
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,540
Nobody's in charge.

877
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,380
Not the IMF, the Pope,

878
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,060
the Communist Party, the Jews.

879
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,200
No, no, no.

880
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,360
Nobody has their finger

881
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,300
on what's going on.

882
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,940
So then why hope?

883
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,100
Isn't it just a runaway train

884
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,620
out of control?

885
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,200
I don't think so.

886
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,620
I think the out-of-controlness

887
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,480
is the most hopeful thing about it.

888
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,780
After all, whose control is it out of?

889
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,180
Someone said,

890
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,340
what's so progressive about media?

891
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,900
It's the spreading of darkness

892
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,080
at the speed of light.

893
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,780
It can be.

894
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,380
It can be.

895
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,980
Is there any permission to hope?

896
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,360
More specifically,

897
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,820
is there any permission

898
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,280
for smart people to hope?

899
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,460
I mean, it's easy to hope

900
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,900
if you're stupid, but

901
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,200
is there any basis

902
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,180
for intelligent people to hope?

903
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,840
You know, if you placed your bets

904
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,780
on male-dominated institutions

905
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,180
based on consumer fetishism,

906
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,140
propaganda, classism,

907
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,240
and materialism,

908
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,080
then God help you,

909
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,420
you should call your broker.

910
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,760
My attitude was always,

911
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,140
if it's real,

912
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,220
it can take the pressure.

913
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,340
You know, you don't have to

914
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,700
pussyfoot around the real thing.

915
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,920
If they're telling you, you know,

916
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,880
oh, you must lower your voice

917
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,400
and avert your gaze,

918
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,480
then you're probably in the presence of crap.

919
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,680
Because the real thing

920
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,580
is real.

921
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,440
It doesn't demand that you adjust

922
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,080
your opinion to suit it.

923
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,160
It's real.

924
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,060
That means it is preeminent.

925
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,080
That means it sets the agenda.

926
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,780
And I studied yoga.

927
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,080
I wandered around in the East.

928
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,580
I was fast shuffled by beady-eyed little men

929
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,640
in dhoti's.

930
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,200
I know the whole spiritual supermarket

931
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,260
and rigamarole.

932
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,360
And I find nothing there

933
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,100
to interest me.

934
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,740
We have to stop consuming

935
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,720
our culture.

936
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,840
We have to create culture.

937
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,980
Don't watch TV.

938
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,260
Don't read magazines.

939
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,760
Don't even listen to NPR.

940
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,240
Create your own roadshow.

941
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,580
The nexus of space and time

942
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,700
where you are now

943
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,520
is the most immediate sector

944
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,920
of your universe.

945
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,920
And if you're worrying about

946
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,540
Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton

947
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,700
or somebody else,

948
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,580
then you are disempowered.

949
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,000
You're giving it all away to icons.

950
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,460
Icons which are maintained

951
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,220
by an electronic media

952
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,400
so that you want to dress like X

953
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,060
or have lips like Y or something.

954
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,160
This is shit-brained,

955
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,560
this kind of thinking.

956
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,920
That is all cultural diversion.

957
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,740
And what is real is you

958
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,380
and your friends

959
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,080
and your associations,

960
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,380
your highs, your orgasms,

961
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,160
your hopes, your plans, your fears.

962
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,980
And we're told,

963
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,080
no, we're unimportant.

964
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,300
We're peripheral.

965
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,540
Get a degree.

966
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,700
Get a job.

967
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,660
Get a this.

968
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,340
Get a that.

969
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,820
And then you're a player.

970
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,180
You don't even want to play in that game.

971
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,200
You want to reclaim your mind

972
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,080
and get it out of the hands

973
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,380
of the cultural engineers

974
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,840
who want to turn you into

975
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,920
a half-baked moron

976
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,200
consuming all this trash

977
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,880
that's being manufactured

978
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,320
out of the bones of a dying world.

979
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,680
Where is that at?

980
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,340
The paralyzing and toxic artifacts

981
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,700
of the late evolving

982
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,740
machine-workshipping,

983
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,680
monotheistic, linear,

984
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,500
fanatic, alphabet, tight-ass,

985
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
straight culture

986
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,380
that we are a part of.

987
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,460
You don't go on bend knee

988
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,340
to petition the official culture

989
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,980
for your rights.

990
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,400
You have to take them.

991
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,100
And people ask me,

992
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,760
you know,

993
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,920
how can you stand up

994
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,700
and say the things you do?

995
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,800
Why don't they take you away?

996
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,480
They don't take me away

997
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,380
because they're more chicken shit

998
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,240
than you think.

999
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,360
They don't take me away

1000
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,360


1001
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,520
because they're more chicken shit

1002
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:33,520


1003
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,580
They're more off balance

1004
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,700
than you think.

1005
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,660
They're more uncertain of themselves

1006
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,220
than you think.

1007
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,260
Dissolve the conceptual boundary

1008
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,580
of ordinary expectation.

1009
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,520
It's the mad cow disease.

1010
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,560
That's what it is.

1011
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,360
You've got prions up in your brain.

1012
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,240
The prions are prying.

1013
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,600
You know, I'm not that weirded out

1014
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,760
about mad cows,

1015
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,800
but I suspect that we've been

1016
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,480
exposed to missed cows.

1017
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,220
Or missed cow disease,

1018
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,400
or at least some sort of

1019
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,260
irritated cow.

1020
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,700
Mildly annoyed cow.

1021
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,360
Whatever happened

1022
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,120
to happy cow disease?

1023
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,780
Well,

1024
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,860
once upon a time,

1025
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,060
there was a little farm...

1026
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,280
Yeah, it was a fairy tale.

1027
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,320
There never were any happy cows.

1028
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,400
They're just cows.

1029
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,340
The Borden's glue

1030
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,540
label lied.

1031
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,140
They just like to chew their cud.

1032
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,800
They were screaming

1033
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,040
because their feet had been chopped off

1034
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,720
to be used in the Borden's glue bottle.

1035
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,440
Actually,

1036
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,100
the real reason they use the

1037
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,220
cow on Elmer's glue

1038
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,080
is because the old glue

1039
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,240
was made from milk protein.

1040
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,400
It was made from casein.

1041
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,420
Oh.

1042
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,780
I always assumed that that was

1043
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,540
for gelatin.

1044
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,900
That's right.

1045
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,120
That's why vegetarians can't eat

1046
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,200
regular cereal.

1047
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,200
Because it has gelatin.

1048
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,780
You know, a conspiracy cereal has gelatin in it.

1049
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,640
Conspiracy cereals have all kinds of weird things in them.

1050
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,160
Bambi's feet

1051
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,100
are in them

1052
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,040
frosted flakes.

1053
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,600
You can really put your foot in your mouth then.

1054
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:27,660
Now,

1055
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,260
the mad cow disease

1056
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,920
takes such a long time

1057
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,920
to incubate.

1058
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,660
I've actually heard conspiracy theory

1059
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,620
types that suggested

1060
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,480
that Alzheimer's

1061
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,960
is not Alzheimer's at all,

1062
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,520
but simply mad cow

1063
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:43,760
gradually

1064
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,540
showing up.

1065
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,280
Finally kicking in

1066
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,460
in our generation.

1067
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,480
Well, here's something that could very well

1068
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,020
have to do with that.

1069
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,540
Well, first of all,

1070
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,220
there are some cases where mad cow

1071
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,580
has an extremely short incubation.

1072
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,340
In England, they saw people

1073
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,380
in their 20s getting it.

1074
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,280
But,

1075
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,720
Dr. Alzheimer,

1076
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,660
after whom the disease was named,

1077
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,080
he had two students named Kreutzfeld

1078
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,220
and Jakob.

1079
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,780
Kreutzfeld and Jakob

1080
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,320
later went on to discover

1081
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,380
mad cow disease in humans,

1082
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,420
or, you know,

1083
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,200
those spongiform

1084
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,520
encephalopathies,

1085
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:26,700
the

1086
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,520
degenerative ones. Those are called

1087
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,120
Kreutzfeld-Jakob disease, if it's caused by

1088
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
mad cow prions

1089
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,280
in cows. They have

1090
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,200
identical symptoms, actually, or

1091
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,400
near-identical symptoms.

1092
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,540
And people just kind of assume that it's Alzheimer's

1093
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,860
if it's an old person has it.

1094
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,180
And they assume that it's mad cow

1095
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,280
if a young person has it.

1096
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,260
But they've been feeding dead cows to other

1097
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,220
cows for quite some time

1098
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,480
now.

1099
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,200
Oh, God. Soylent cow food is

1100
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,180
cows! Yeah, you know, I mean,

1101
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,440
they've been doing it here. I mean, they no longer

1102
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,200
serve... Soylent grain is cows!

1103
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,240
Oh, yeah. They no longer

1104
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,160
serve, like, regular ground-up

1105
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,200
cow parts, but they will serve rendered

1106
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,320
protein. Of course, the rendering

1107
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,140
process does not destroy the prion,

1108
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,900
so it remains infectious.

1109
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,300
But it's out

1110
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:17,540
there.

1111
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,000
Some

1112
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,320
radio

1113
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,780
synesthesia from WCSB

1114
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,380
Cleveland.

1115
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,200
Thanks and lots of

1116
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,380
Connie juice there to Dr. Sinister

1117
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:32,860
for letting Bob

1118
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,160
use his show to glorify

1119
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,300
or shame his sweet name

1120
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,340
by way of our blabbering.

1121
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,320
And we've been blabbering for a long,

1122
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,200
long time, as heard

1123
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,240
in this 1979 tape

1124
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,660
by Dr. Philo

1125
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,100
Drummond from

1126
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,360
his series On the Road.

1127
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,280
And another thing I want

1128
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,400
to tell you about tonight,

1129
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,620
we've had some calamitous

1130
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,700
times in Malaysia.

1131
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,740
You might have heard about all the

1132
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,820
rains we had. Yes, dear

1133
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,640
friends, it was flooding over

1134
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,320
here, but, oh, Bob,

1135
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,700
oh, good old Bob knew that when it

1136
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,420
flooded in Malaysia, you better build

1137
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,140
your houses on stilts.

1138
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,580
So all our houses are built on

1139
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,180
stilts over here, dear friends.

1140
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,480
We knew a long

1141
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,720
time ago that when those floodwaters

1142
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,460
came, we better be sitting

1143
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,520
pretty, sitting high, so

1144
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,880
nobody could come by.

1145
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,100
And speaking of sitting high,

1146
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,760
we need something over here

1147
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,160
in Malaysia. Yes,

1148
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,700
our whole drug cabinet was washed

1149
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,780
away, and after

1150
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,520
a flood, you know, we need

1151
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,580
some drugs. We need some drugs

1152
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,100
that can help the people out here.

1153
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,080
So what I want you all to do, dear friends...

1154
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,540
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah,

1155
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,260
oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

1156
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,340
My wife and I have adopted

1157
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,500
that as a kind of a little mantra. If

1158
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:56,420
we're doing some tedious work, like moving

1159
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,620
furniture, you start getting

1160
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,460
a little bit out of breath, we'll start panting,

1161
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:00,820
and then we'll be...

1162
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,780
kind of rhythmically like a...

1163
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,620
kind of like Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

1164
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,980
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

1165
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,680
What's that?

1166
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,740
Is that Japanese?

1167
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,900
No, I believe it's Korean.

1168
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,220
It's a chant that's part of a Korean religion.

1169
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,120
A kind of Korean

1170
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,160
cult, actually, whereby

1171
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,480
if you chant this phrase over and

1172
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,320
over again, everything will

1173
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,660
come true. There was an American

1174
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,200
similar cult, or

1175
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,060
British maybe, in which you say,

1176
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,500
day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and better.

1177
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,720
Day by day, in every way, I'm getting better and better.

1178
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,640
Day by day, and you just smutter that

1179
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,060
to yourself under your breath, and

1180
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,420
my goodness gracious, if

1181
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,340
every day, day by day, you didn't get

1182
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,200
better and better.

1183
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,380
I've heard of that before.

1184
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,620
Oh, there's another one where they

1185
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,820
go, Hare Krishna, Hare Ram,

1186
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,240
and it's a kind of...

1187
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,420
In subgenius,

1188
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,620
you know, we just simply

1189
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,480
put a laundry

1190
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,600
bag over their head and say, just wear

1191
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,760
this for a while. And you get the same

1192
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,820
impression, kind of a

1193
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,820
lack of oxygen.

1194
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:08,220
Hyperventilation.

1195
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,140
The high of hyperventilation.

1196
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,540
Which I'm

1197
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,680
just too old for that now. I can't

1198
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,660
afford the brain cells that go sputtering out

1199
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,660
when I hyperventilate.

1200
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,500
You don't hear me doing that preacher cadence

1201
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,780
anymore, where you go,

1202
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,320
and Bob came down

1203
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,200
and gave him a

1204
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,400
slack. That way they

1205
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,480
kind of get a little buzz every

1206
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,680
couple of words.

1207
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,760
Oh yeah, that is the...

1208
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,480
You get in the spirit,

1209
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,400
and that's another reason for pulpits.

1210
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,480
Preachers have to have something to hang

1211
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,640
on to. Because they would collapse.

1212
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah. They're out there saying,

1213
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,600
and the leper was walking down

1214
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,040
that dusty road.

1215
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,480
And Jesus came along, and he

1216
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,520
healed that leper, so thank God Jesus came

1217
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,740
along so he could heal that leper.

1218
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,640
And thank God the leper was walking

1219
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,480
on that road, and thank God for

1220
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,500
leprosy, so the leper had something to be

1221
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,620
cured of. Well, see, the preacher gets

1222
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,460
high, and that helps the audience

1223
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,500
get high, and they feed off of each other

1224
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,460
in a loop of suggestion.

1225
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,560
Mass suggestion, and the

1226
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,060
next thing you know, God

1227
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,620
walks right into the

1228
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,340
room, wearing the

1229
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,480
latest fancy shoes

1230
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,100
and trendy outfit,

1231
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,580
haircut, looking like a movie star,

1232
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,340
and they all feel the spirit.

1233
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,260
And I,

1234
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,680
you know, I'm envious

1235
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,520
sometimes of people who can

1236
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,680
do that every single week.

1237
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,180
But, uh,

1238
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,200
that doesn't happen in subgenius

1239
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
land every single week, I don't think.

1240
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,200
Nope.

1241
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,040
We still got too many

1242
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,060
brain cells, but we can change that.

1243
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:49,960
That's right.

1244
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,480
We can change that.

1245
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,140
It doesn't have to be that way.

1246
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,260
Nobody ever held a gun to your head

1247
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,080
and forced you to stick those

1248
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,940
brain cells in there?

1249
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,680
Nobody forced you to keep them.

1250
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,800
There's a million ways to get around that.

1251
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,920
And that's what the

1252
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,720
church of the subgenius is here to prove.

1253
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,160
You don't need them

1254
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:10,680
brain cells.

1255
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,760
When was the last time that being smart

1256
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,940
ever got you laid?

1257
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,300
That's right.

1258
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,520
I rest my case. Case closed.

1259
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,500
Depressing, isn't it?

1260
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,460
Oh.

1261
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,180
It's kind of how things are supposed to look.

1262
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,580
Somewhere there's a hideous genius

1263
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,880
with a giant head

1264
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,520
whose brain really can get him laid.

1265
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,580
He can control other people's thoughts

1266
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,020
like in a cartoon or something

1267
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,460
with his mighty brain power.

1268
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,060
But there's probably only one or two

1269
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,860
in any given generation.

1270
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,260
None of them.

1271
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,120
Most of those go crazy.

1272
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,260
Join Bob and then go nuts.

1273
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,600
I've seen a lot of them

1274
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,440
fall by the white side

1275
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,720
going, oh yeah, oh yeah,

1276
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,520
oh yeah, oh slack,

1277
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,540
oh slack, oh slack,

1278
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,140
same thing.

1279
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,600
Beating off or beating their head again.

1280
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,220
It's the wall.

1281
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,820
Same thing. They both feel great.

1282
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,120
Yeah. Whatever happened to

1283
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,980
plain old all-American things

1284
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,120
like hop and

1285
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,840
what do they call it?

1286
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,400
Grass or

1287
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:16,240
opium, that kind of thing.

1288
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,920
Whatever happened to the old values?

1289
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,940
You, you, you,

1290
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,260
you, you,

1291
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,400
you, you,

1292
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,120
you, you,

1293
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:23,480
you, you,

1294
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,360
you, you,

1295
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,320
Is, is it, is it, is it,

1296
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,500
Is it, is it.

1297
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,340
Here you have it.

1298
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,680
Ere clarification one 둘三

1299
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:41,680


1300
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:41,740
you

1301
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,740
you

1302
00:53:42,740 --> 00:54:00,340
you is it is it is it is it Is it, is it,けれ,

1303
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,340
There you have it.

1304
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,000
Erects, erupts.

1305
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,120
Whatever.

1306
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,620
It was, it was, it was, it was.

1307
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,620
It was, it was, it was.

1308
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,440
A small head rush by Noel Preff.

1309
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,040
And now, back to another borrowed show, friends.

1310
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:08,460
Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia on the WCSB, where callers are caught like a deer in the headlights.

1311
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,460
Banjo Bob, you there?

1312
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,520
Headlights stuck in deer.

1313
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,340
Phineas is still here.

1314
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,760
Yeah, Phineas is still here.

1315
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,140
Yes, I'm still here.

1316
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:18,940
All right.

1317
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:28,200
Phineas, you said earlier on the IRC that your name was Phineas Narco because you were always on some kind of drug.

1318
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,080
That's right.

1319
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,720
I'm on five.

1320
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,220
Which five?

1321
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,560
I can't say.

1322
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,380
It's a secret.

1323
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:39,900
My problem is, okay, I'm on this drug that destroys your memory.

1324
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:46,220
So every now and then, I have to, like, drink some counteragent, like in this case coffee,

1325
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,420
so that I can remember.

1326
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,220
Whether I took some other drug that I wanted to take.

1327
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,340
Oh, then you'll have to.

1328
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,580
Because if you don't want to take too much, you'll die.

1329
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,180
But you're constantly having to balance between the two.

1330
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,920
And it's like, there's nothing worse for, and this affects froppers more than anything.

1331
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:11,960
There's nothing worse than forgetting, you know, finding out later that you forgot to take a drug you were planning to take.

1332
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,740
Then you'll have to.

1333
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,760
Because of the one you were already on, it makes you forget everything.

1334
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,760
Then you'll have to tattoo, you know.

1335
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,220
Messages on your body.

1336
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:20,780
Right.

1337
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,600
And as we know, that doesn't work.

1338
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,200
You know, it's like, no matter how good your system is, there's always going to be a flaw in it.

1339
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,800
And you'll end up exploiting it yourself.

1340
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,400
That's right.

1341
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,040
Did we already have this conversation on this show?

1342
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,420
You're hoisted by your own petard.

1343
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:45,720
Did we already have this conversation, or am I having a deja vu about having a conversation about memory on college radio phone calls?

1344
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,180
Well, if you're having deja vu, I'm having jamais vu.

1345
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:48,600
Because?

1346
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:48,920
Because?

1347
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:48,940


1348
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,960
I could play back the tape, I suppose.

1349
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,220
If you're having deja vu, I'm having jamais vu.

1350
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,360
What is that?

1351
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,600
Deja vu means already seen in French.

1352
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,800
Jamais vu means never seen.

1353
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,480
So, yeah.

1354
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:06,960
You're really out of it, dude.

1355
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,660
Never heard of this.

1356
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,200
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1357
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:10,340
This might be a tape.

1358
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,600
I was not here.

1359
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,320
You did not see me.

1360
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,020
I certainly have not seen you.

1361
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,740
Well, I was just saying that.

1362
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,320
As an example, I wasn't really trying to hypnotize you just then.

1363
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:23,500
Yeah.

1364
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,260
Believe me, I wouldn't try to do that over the radio, because you have to see.

1365
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:33,980
They think that it's the swinging thing that hypnotizes you, the glowing watch or whatnot that the hypnotist uses.

1366
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,740
It's really the bushy eyebrows.

1367
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,440
Yeah.

1368
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,420
That's why I just gave away a big trade secret.

1369
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,520
Or the pointy goatee.

1370
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,320
That's another thing.

1371
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:46,560
Well, why do you think I have this particular outfit, this look that I have?

1372
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,040
The rest is three from F15.

1373
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,440
F15.

1374
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,460
We're going to take another call here.

1375
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,460
You're on the air.

1376
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,920
Oh, Stan Jobop calling back.

1377
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:53,360
Oh, good.

1378
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,160
You're fucked.

1379
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,100
Gazing to my pointed goatee.

1380
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,280
We thought we lost you.

1381
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,340
Hey, remember?

1382
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,780
Stang, remember when I called in and talked to him about alien sex?

1383
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,220
Yeah, and they cut you off.

1384
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:04,760
That was cool.

1385
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:06,900
I said, oh, I'm going to call back.

1386
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,060
Stang's talking about all this stuff.

1387
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,660
Makes me think of that movie.

1388
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,160
What was that?

1389
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,020
Bad Films.

1390
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,960
And Memory Problems.

1391
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,380
See?

1392
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,960
Yeah, that Memory Problem.

1393
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,420
Yeah.

1394
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:17,900
What was that?

1395
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,100
The memory about the memory problem?

1396
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,160
What was that?

1397
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,620
About the guy with the memory problem.

1398
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,980
Was that about Stang?

1399
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,940
I thought it was until I remembered Leonard Shelby.

1400
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,140
Is it forgetfulness?

1401
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,080
Or is it man-cow disease?

1402
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,020
It was, uh, it was remember, that was the name of the movie.

1403
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,580
Remember Steve Tobolowsky.

1404
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,280
That was it.

1405
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:39,940
No.

1406
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,180
Try to remember the, and I forget the rest of the lyrics.

1407
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:44,860
Oh, well.

1408
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,940
Well, here's an interesting fact for you.

1409
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,820
I was just thinking, is it forgetfulness, or is it Alzheimer's, or is it mad cow disease?

1410
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,260
We did have this conversation.

1411
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,100
I read it.

1412
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,060
I just didn't make any note.

1413
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:05,320
There was a Yale study where they, uh, they actually did a little biopsy or autopsy on

1414
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,900
these dead people.

1415
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,500
People who had died from complications related to Alzheimer's and all that stuff, you know.

1416
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,500
And, uh, as it turns out, 10% of the...

1417
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,840
13% of the people in this one study actually, who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, actually

1418
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,660
had mad cow disease.

1419
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,980
Banjo-Bob cow disease.

1420
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,280
Yeah, Banjo-Bob cow disease.

1421
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,100
We got a new caller here.

1422
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,200
It's not quite like being mad.

1423
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:28,800
It's not quite like being mad.

1424
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,120
You know, people are eating them, and they're all, like, going insane.

1425
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:33,120
It's not quite like retardation.

1426
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,080
I've seen people eat cow brains before.

1427
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,940
Wait till they find out about the mad cow brain disease.

1428
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,740
Hey, your mental illness fell into my mental retardation.

1429
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,480
Your mental illness fell into my mental retardation.

1430
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,680
Yeah, I've been in a little retardation for a little while now.

1431
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:54,160
Oh, but while we're at it, why don't I give out the contact info for Subgenius Productions?

1432
00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:01,100
Yes, if you'd like some information on the Church of the Subgenius and all the insanity

1433
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,780
that it encompasses, why don't you drop a line to Bob?

1434
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:14,460
The Church of the Subgenius at Post Office Box 204-207.

1435
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,360
616-Austin, Texas 78720.

1436
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:29,000
And have a good night, Seekers, if you can, after absorbing this.

1437
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,460
Oh, and good night, Al.

1438
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:44,360
Ah, yes, and Suzy the Floozy's show, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse,

1439
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,720
can be heard on the internet, archived or live,

1440
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:55,080
c-w-r-e-k dot org.

1441
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,060
That's w-w-w-w-r-e-k dot org.

1442
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,180
And thanks to Angry Larry and Automatic Robot Fish for the background music.

1443
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,400
As I bring this recording to a close, I would like to leave you with a request.

1444
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,780
And that is, go ahead and lick that frog.

1445
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:23,000
Have the principal and the school nurse demonstrate to every couple how to lick frogs,

1446
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,820
and then observe them to ensure they do it right.

1447
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,700
Hell, we may as well go all the way.

1448
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:31,160
In fact, what they ought to do is find diseased hookers and bring them in.

1449
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,980
Teach a little supply and demand.

1450
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,100
Thank you, and may God bless you.

1451
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,740
Ho, ho, ho!

1452
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,900
And around the river and nice and Mr. Dunstan.

1453
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,420
He's the leader of the wagon train.

1454
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,720
And Walter Brennan is Cookie.

1455
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,140
It's one of those nights when just things are hanging up in the sky.

1456
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,120
And an old breeze is stirring.

1457
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,380
And off in the distance you hear...

1458
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,020
And then you hear a stirring.

1459
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,920
Who is that?

1460
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:07,520
Who's going there?

1461
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,400
Take it easy, Cookie. It's only me.

1462
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:11,820
Uh-huh.

1463
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,760
Oh, Mr. Dunstan.

1464
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,640
Give me a stat.

1465
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,160
I didn't know you could even tell it.

1466
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:16,660
Man, I can't...

1467
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,300
The sagebrush.

1468
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,240
We shouldn't have camped so close.

1469
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,340
And Patchy's just outside there, you know.

1470
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,640
All right, Cookie.

1471
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,080
Just settle down.

1472
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,140
I'm just wandering around, musing to myself.

1473
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,860
Wondering what it all means.

1474
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:32,140
Sometimes I look up there and said there's a big scheme for us.

1475
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,720
If I could only find the key to it.

1476
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,060
Hey, don't think so hard.

1477
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,760
Makes you break out if you think too hard, you silly old fuck.

1478
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,200
Oh, Cookie, I...

1479
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,740
I know we're been both...

1480
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:45,160
buddies for an eye on to 45 years, but...

1481
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,200
don't you ever say fuck to me again.

1482
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,460
Because I'll kick your right in your 90-year-old body and make it collapse like an old pig bladder.

1483
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,240
Okay.

1484
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,420
You just have to tell me once you're going to threaten me.

1485
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,360
You know nothing.

1486
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,000
Especially not in front of the men.

1487
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:00,740
Well, the men aren't here.

1488
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,280
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

1489
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:04,940
Oh, Cookie.

1490
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:06,760
Now, listen.

1491
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,140
I've been on this job on the cattle trail and...

1492
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,820
and, you know, there's no sheep hereabouts.

1493
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,280
And...

1494
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,420
and, of course, we have no other offices to...

1495
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:17,920
to release ourselves in, so...

1496
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:18,560
why...

1497
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,860
No, for God's sake.

1498
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,340
Now, Duke, I told you once.

1499
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,300
I'm too old.

1500
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,580
I used to fuck your light when...

1501
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,060
when...

1502
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,380
when we were back in your cowpokes.

1503
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,800
We were on the trail and...

1504
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,900
I understand when you get honey and everything, but...

1505
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,720
for God's sake, you're not going to put it in me now.
