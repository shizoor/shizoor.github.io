1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Test, uh, thanks Fred. Is everything working? I'm having trouble with, uh, with this tape deck here. Test.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,060
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:23,700
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the so genius power of slack!

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,500
Yeah, I'm still Fred.

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,300
So we're back again.

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:44,760
And I tell ya, I was sorely, sorely tempted, my friends, to just do a re-re-run this week.

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:52,160
But nay, we'll go ahead and try to crank out a show, you know.

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,500
Another day.

9
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,900
Um, horrible show.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,800
And I wish I was doing this in a radio station.

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,100
This little area that I'm working in is just, it's too cramped.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,000
Ahimsa.

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,500
Ahimsa.

14
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:15,260
Um, before we, uh, go on into the tapes, dear friends, I have, uh, some, some quick news.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,600
Actually, we have tons of news.

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,640
We have news of the weird coming up.

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,960
I haven't done that in a while.

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,520
And, um, it's pretty weird.

19
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,120
This time.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,720
Ahimsa.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:35,420
Um, I should mention, for you, uh, diehard subgeniuses out there, uh, we now have a 1-800 number.

22
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,220
I think I mentioned this last show.

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:48,420
But, uh, if you have business with, with Jesus, you can call our new 1-800 number, which actually is not, excuse me, the construction equipment's getting loud in the background there.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,380
Um, the, uh, it's, uh, that number is.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,440
It's a 1-888 number, actually.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,280
It's still toll free.

27
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,740
1-888-669-2323.

28
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,420
Uh, whoa.

29
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,720
There's a scariness in the background.

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,920
Yeah, uh, 1-888-669-2323.

31
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,080
That's for real.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
That's an actual living number.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:23,000
Uh, with, uh, but if you want to call Jesus just to chat with the Lord, uh, he's available.

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,480
Also.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,820
Also at, uh, for men, this ain't, oh, excuse me.

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,920
It's a temple beat here in the background, and they're not bad.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,460
But, uh, but they're from Italy.

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,620
And they sound too much like, well, listen to this.

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,700
The music is good.

40
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,080
But the guy sounds too much like, uh, all those other singers, you know.

41
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,140
Uh.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,900
Uh.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,760
Well, yeah, I don't know.

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,340
It's, uh, it sounds too much like all them other ones.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,740
All right.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
Let's just start from scratch.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,980
We'll just do that all over again.

48
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,120
What is wrong with me today?

49
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:15,980
Okay.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,880
Uh, let's, one, one more time.

51
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,120
Friends, you can call Jesus.

52
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,080
You can talk to Jesus right here in Dallas, Texas by calling, uh, got that pencil ready

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,340
now?

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:36,720
Area code, uh, 214-324-0993.

55
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,980
There, I think we finally got that right.

56
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,320
Uh, that's, uh, yeah, 214-324-0993.

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,880
For Jesus at the Subgenius Foundation.

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,120
Or, uh, email is, uh, slack at metronet.com.

59
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,840
My email is i.stang at metronet.com.

60
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,780
And, friends, I should mention, even if you do not have, uh, a computer and no interest

61
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,800
at all in the World Wide Web, go to a friend's house or one of those bars where you can do

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,780
this kind of thing and, um, look at, at the Subgenius website.

63
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,000
There is nothing like it on this planet, I must say.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,100
I am extremely proud of the World Wide Web.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,400
Uh, there's a lot of work, uh, that has gone into that, uh, by myself and by the many, many

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,560
artists and, and writers that have contributed to that thing and audio stuff.

67
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,200
You know, you can hear this radio show off of that website.

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,420
It doesn't sound great, but by gobs, you can hear it in, um, in France or Germany or Japan

69
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,360
or China.

70
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,100
Um, you can hear it anywhere in the world that, that you get a, get you a dang modem

71
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,680
hookup.

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,100
And, uh, in fact, I don't know.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,840
You know, this show, Hour of Slack is now on and it's on, we're sending out 20 copies

74
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,900
every week, uh, 15 stations and five individual subscribers.

75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,900
And, you know, that's more cities than Howard Stern is in.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:15,100
Of course, we only get $6 a show and he gets $6 million a show, but, uh, you know, hey,

77
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,940
you can't hear Howard Stern in China, but you can if you check out, uh, you can, you

78
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
can hear us again and again.

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,720
At will.

80
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,980
Old shows, uh, new shows, and you even have a fast forward button on the internet.

81
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,100
So check out the Subgenius website.

82
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,340
The art that's in there is beautiful.

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,180
It's, uh, the address is, it's not www.subgenius.com.

84
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Uh, we own that name, but we can't use it yet for technical reasons.

85
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,740
So the URL for that booger is sunsight.com.

86
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,220
U-N-C dot E-V-U slash subgenius.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,920
Now, for those of you who think that sounds like gibberish, what it means is that, that,

88
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,420
uh, the University of North Carolina, uh, uh, a college, there is a machine called SunSight,

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,780
which happens to have a little file on it called Subgenius.

90
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:20,320
So what you type there in your open up command, uh, on the web is SunSight, S-U-N-S-I-T-E

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,060
dot U-N-C.

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,900
U-N-C dot E-D-U slash, uh, Subgenius.

93
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,800
And Subgenius does not have an O in it.

94
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,260
And all of that address is in lower case.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,920
Okay?

96
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,820
Enough of that.

97
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,940
Every month or two, I, I give the, the website, uh, address like that, even though it's, uh,

98
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,520
clumsy.

99
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Cause I have to.

100
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,200
I have to for, for Bob.

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,440
Bob told me to do it.

102
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,180
He tells, you know, Bob speaks to me.

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,840
Friends.

104
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,740
And he told me that there is also going to be a Subgenius Devival in, uh, Columbus, Ohio

105
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,920
on October 26th and 27th.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,700
And if you seriously want to go to that, uh, well write us.

107
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,060
And we'll be giving that post office box number at the end of the broadcast.

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,180
Now, is that all I had to deal with?

109
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, I think so friends, because we have a lot of news here to read.

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,260
Actually, this is from News of the Weird.

111
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,820
Uh, I don't know.

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:20,820


113
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:20,820


114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,720
It's a Chuck Shepherd's column, which, uh, you may see in your local, uh, News Weekly,

115
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,380
but, uh, maybe not.

116
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:39,320
Number one in the news, in May, near Stigtomta, Sweden, about 2,000 environmentalists protested

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:47,180
by mass outdoor urination, protested the dying ecosystem of Halbo Lake.

118
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,880
Poor Halbo Lake.

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,820
Which now has had, uh, a massive flood.

120
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:50,820


121
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:57,780
Uh, 2,000 environmentalists, uh, uh, contributing to the loveliness of it.

122
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,640
The yellow lake of Sweden, I guess they call it.

123
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,700
In May, well, we've already done this one on our Slack.

124
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:12,020
In May, Valentin Grimaldo, 40, was bitten by a poisonous coral snake near Encino, Texas.

125
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:19,660
Survived by biting off the snake's head, slitting its body lengthwise, and using the skin for

126
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,360
a tourniquet.

127
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,280
Until help arrived.

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,440
Praise the great subgenius, Valentin Grimaldo.

129
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,620
Um, that's a, that's a real man when you can bite the head off a snake, a coral snake.

130
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:43,040
And now, in Ogden, Utah, a self-described ugly person, Lynn Romer, a recently formed

131
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,720
the Pinocchio Plot, a support group to combat looksism.

132
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,760
Uh, I don't know.

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,340
I don't know.

134
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,640
You know, it's just so unfair the way people judge other people by their looks.

135
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,320
In my particular case, I probably should contribute to that support group.

136
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Although, I don't know.

137
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,980
I don't really look that bad from behind.

138
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,320
I've had people try to pick me up when they couldn't see my face.

139
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,300
Okay, in May, a court in Sweden rejected an appeal by Elizabeth Holland and her husband,

140
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,340
who had been fined about $1,000 for giving men a penis.

141
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,340


142
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,880
The court ruled that the woman had been given an unauthorized name.

143
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,920
The five-year-old is called Albin, but his formal name consists of 38 consonants followed

144
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,200
by five numbers.

145
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,760
A name Holland said is, quote, a pregnant expressionistic development that we see as

146
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,960
an artistic creation.

147
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah, well, my parents named my brother Pinkney.

148
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,320
And I don't think they really care about my penis.

149
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,320


150
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,320


151
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,320


152
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,520
I don't think he spoke to anybody for the first 25 years of his life.

153
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,080
All right, and further down here, news of the weird.

154
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,120
Latest religious messages.

155
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,120
I love these kind, my friends.

156
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Carlos Santiago was arrested in San Francisco, California in May and charged with assault.

157
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,600
Police said he stabbed his wife more than a dozen times because she refused his orders

158
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,040
to read the Bible.

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,720
These uppity women.

160
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,540
I can't believe it.

161
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,760
You know?

162
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,880
The guy hands the Bible to her, tells her to read it.

163
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,540
She doesn't read it.

164
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
What else you gonna do?

165
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,140
You know, stab her a dozen times.

166
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,440
That's the way we do it around here, I'll tell you.

167
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,300
Some more religious news here.

168
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:39,460
In May, Reverend Jim Dillon started the Church of Kurt Cobain in Portland, Oregon.

169
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,820
Now I thought that was a joke when I first heard about it, but apparently these idiots

170
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,400
are serious.

171
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,380
Honoring the late singer-songwriter and challenging parishioners MTV.

172
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:49,740


173
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,920
And these guys were more than just taxing the Tim Rothschilds the following year.

174
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,300
About Ahhh ...

175
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,760
Say.

176
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:04,380
emphasizing Bernard開心 the automatic

177
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,380


178
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,680
Love.

179
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:16,360
probably the approximate commercials for Ya layers are maybe.

180
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,740
If you're low, you might

181
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:28,480
The Divine in 1988 posted the King's 31 Commandments at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania

182
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,960
as part of the school's Elvis Week.

183
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,160
Among the church's tenets, eat six meals a day, face Las Vegas once a day, make a pilgrimage

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,700
to Graceland, and fight the anti-Elvis, Michael Jackson.

185
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,740
A news here from the weirdo American community.

186
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:56,180
In April, Nevada County, California, judicial candidate Robert Litchfield, attempting to

187
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,280
rectify his low standing among local lawyers, I guess this guy wanted to be a judge and

188
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,340
the other lawyers didn't like him, he offered to kneel and wash the feet of any lawyer in

189
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,260
the county as a gesture of his desire to serve them.

190
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,680
Said Litchfield.

191
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,920
What I offered was an act of faith and I don't think that's something a news reporter can

192
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,420
understand.

193
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:28,680
At the scheduled foot washing, Litchfield showed up with a basin and towel, but no lawyer came

194
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,140
forth.

195
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,800
Real estate news.

196
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:42,680
In May, New York Times columnist Dan Barry reported a run on $7 St. Louis, New York.

197
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:42,680


198
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:42,680


199
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:42,680


200
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:42,680


201
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:42,680


202
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:51,960
He also stated that over $2 million of the New York Post $2 million total

203
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,900
was taken from a business.

204
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:04,360
Bang, bang!

205
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,940
Should 13.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,080
commented.

207
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:22,140
oil or an asteroid will pick your house to land on. One or the other. Oh, here's a, here's a,

208
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,780
many kind of, friends, these are the end times. In March, security guards at the Mall of America

209
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:37,060
in Bloomington, Minneapolis, I've been there, along with local police and a helpful eyewitness

210
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,140
apprehended a man who had grabbed a $1,400 gold chain from the neck of another man. Police

211
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,760
arrested the suspect, then arrested the witness when a computer check revealed that he had

212
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,320
several outstanding warrants, then arrested the victim when they found crack cocaine in

213
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,860
his pocket. Uh, yes. In February, police in Tuscaloosa, Alabama charged Felicia Scott,

214
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,860
29,

215
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:16,020
with shooting to death her nine-month pregnant girlfriend, Carathia Curry, 17, then cutting open

216
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:24,620
Curry's belly and stealing the baby because Scott herself was unable to get pregnant. The baby

217
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:34,480
survived. And during, uh, December and January, after four years of preparation, four years,

218
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,040
friends, um, Maria Fernandez,

219
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,920
and Amanda Cardoso brought her flea circus to the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Among the tricks?

220
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,520
Fleas walking tightropes, popping out of cannons, diving into thimbles of water, dueling with foil

221
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,480
swords. Cardoso brought the, bought the fleas in bulk for 10 cents each and occasionally awarded

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:06,960
prizes of blood for tricks well done. She admits to a flea obsession, in part because they have

223
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,120
37 land designs .

224
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,760
éd

225
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,300
And, uh, this is the Xbox?

226
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,340
D谄

227
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,060
I don't think you can tell.

228
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,800
Are you transgressing after that one I'm trying not to laugh in the ball?

229
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm trying to lie.

230
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,440
No, use plain water.

231
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
Yeah, I am.

232
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,040


233
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,040


234
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,040
Okay.

235
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,280
of the 14th century.

236
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,580
Cool.

237
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,440
Okay.

238
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,840
Well, actually, I'm sure you're tired of me

239
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,000
and my voice and my news,

240
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,040
and so we'll go to someone even more obsessive

241
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,560
and obnoxious, in this case,

242
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,420
the good Dr. Howell from the KPFA,

243
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,000
Berkeley Puzzling Evidence subgenius-type show.

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,300
So Dr. Howell, once again,

245
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,760
expounding upon the mighty kingdom Dinosauria,

246
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,980
which I probably said that wrong,

247
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,040
and he hit me if he heard this.

248
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,740
Thank you.

249
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,460
Ahimsa.

250
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,860
And I forgot to mention the background music there

251
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,500
was by Doctors for Bob and D.K. Jones.

252
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
I started with a Doctors for Bob instrumental,

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,120
then did a D.K. Jones instrumental,

254
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,840
then Doctors for Bob.

255
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,660
Ahimsa.

256
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,080
Yes, millions of years ago,

257
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,420
these gigantic beasts actually roamed the Earth.

258
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:50,820
Ah!

259
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,140
Gigantosaurus had a pocket calculator in his hips,

260
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,140
which enabled him to do small sums.

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,920
And the H-bomb will win off.

262
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,220
Around and around the giant reptiles ran,

263
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,500
around and around the rugged rocks,

264
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,100
in the struggle for survival that's lasted for millions of years.

265
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,680
Somehow, the electromagnetic field of the Earth itself changed.

266
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,600
Ice ages came, and continents formed new patterns.

267
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,820
Ahimsa.

268
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,220
Ahimsa.

269
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,700
Ahimsa.

270
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:34,980
Ahimsa.

271
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


272
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


273
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


274
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


275
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


276
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


277
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


278
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


279
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:34,980


280
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,280
Ahimsa.

281
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,340
Why I can see it now.

282
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,100
Don't be trampled by these behemoths.

283
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
You see, the ceratosaurus is attempting

284
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,840
to turn atlantasaurus immanus

285
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,760
over and expose its soft underbelly.

286
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,120
Getai.

K p, f A. 94.1 F-m on your radio dial with Magdi hemen health.

290
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:04,980


291
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:04,980


292
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:04,980


293
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:04,980


294
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:04,980


295
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:12,040
with KPFB in Berkeley and KFCF in the fungus-shrouded prehistoric valley of Fresno, California.

296
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:23,680
The time is 4 o'clock, and you're comfortable listening to a recreation of the prehistoric world of the secondary era.

297
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,380
What's that?

298
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Just imagine yourself chewing a huge wad of gum that lasts forever,

299
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,060
and you can imagine what it would be like to be an enormous sauropod,

300
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,580
gourmandizing on the fronds of the prehistoric forest.

301
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,980
You know, most Americans aren't taught in school as a part of their education

302
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:57,020
that before the age of giant reptiles, there was an age of giant insects,

303
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,480
when hideous, scuttling things ruined the earth.

304
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,640
They roamed.

305
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,400
The earth.

306
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,880
Well, some of them roamed, others stayed in their own backyard.

307
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,240
But they were unbelievably horrible.

308
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,920
And if, like me, you have a slight, uh, uh, willies feeling,

309
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,720
I mean, if they kind of give you the willies, if they kind of make you twitch and wince and whimper,

310
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,680
just to think of giant spiders as big as bushel baskets, or bigger, rustling under the leaves and so forth,

311
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,460
well, uh...

312
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,960
As big as theaters.

313
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,400
Well, I don't know if they ever got that big.

314
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

315
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,240
Uh, uh, that information has not come to me.

316
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,380
Although, according to some...

317
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,360
Well, I think it's coming in now, though. You might want to check the...

318
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,180
According to some ancient legends, there were once creatures the size of islands

319
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,520
who fought millennial battles in remote corners of the Earth's surface,

320
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,520
and, uh, actually scarred and, uh, and disfigured our planet

321
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,460
into some of the familiar configurations we see today.

322
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,940
A piece of galactic debris...

323
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,200
Uh, yeah.

324
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,100
...in the shape of an enormous six-legged lizard, uh, once landed on the Earth

325
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,600
and quickly crawled across its surface, uh, like a centipede landing on a peach.

326
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,280
But, uh, it created enormous destruction and the extinction of many species.

327
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,160
Created, uh, tidal waves and, uh...

328
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,060
You're sick.

329
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,820
...giant sweeping walls of earth and rock which buried entire countries and submerged continents.

330
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,660
Finally, it hopped off into space again.

331
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,940
But it might return at any time.

332
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,920
And destroy the world of questing man who does not realize by how thin a thread

333
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:47,360
he hangs before that velvet hall of eternal blackness they call glory.

334
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,680
Bingo! I'm in.

335
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:57,320
Yes, bingo. A game of cosmic bingo that we all are forced willy-nilly, uh, inadvertently to play.

336
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,060
And one never knows when one's number will pop up.

337
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,880
So, uh, beware.

338
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,800
You never know when the master cometh, as it says in the old moldy book.

339
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,520
Bingo, bingo.

340
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,080
Well, you've been very patient listening to the...

341
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,360
Oh!

342
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,760
Listening to the, uh, uh...

343
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,040
Oh, I better get that one. That seems like a high priority, uh...

344
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,100
Below 20 degrees, limbs will...

345
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,820
...step upon.

346
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,940
Below zero, lungs will burn.

347
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,780
We're having a little bit of decompression, uh, here in the radio cubicle, uh...

348
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,840
Come on clear. Good.

349
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,760
It might be a breach in our hull, or it might be that...

350
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,420
The breathing tube is stuck.

351
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,880
It just might be puzzling evidence messing with our heads again, you know.

352
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,340
It could be perfectly all right. You never know until it would be too late in this case.

353
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
...the breathing tube.

354
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,900
...and 90 degrees.

355
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,980
You know, as we broadcast, and as I attempt to, as always, to swim upstream against the sluggish tide of flood,

356
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,640
the, uh, the compilers are working on the book of the subgenius volume two, the...

357
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,420
Bob Apocryphon, uh, Revelation X, uh, and Ivan Stang and Lies are...

358
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,580
...stirrin' up, uh, some, uh, trouble in their giant, uh, cauldron, uh...

359
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:19,280
Oh, well, I'm being drowned out by a piece of propaganda here, uh, beamed from our central office.

360
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
...worry free...

361
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,420
What the hell is going on?

362
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,680
What the hell is going on here?

363
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,440
The hell is going on here?

364
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:44,220
You know, now that I play that tape for you, it occurs to me that, uh, I heard that show while I was in San Francisco working on Revelation X.

365
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:56,720
At four or five in the morning, uh, Palmer Vredes and I were sitting there trying to finish the last page of the last chapter and listening to Dr. Howell, who had left our side.

366
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,620
He was very involved in the, um, assemblage of that.

367
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,560
And, uh, he had to leave and go do the radio show.

368
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,780
And we got very excited, I remember, when we heard him mention the book and that we were working on it and so forth.

369
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:19,880
And we got very mad when puzzling evidence, uh, drowned him out.

370
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:30,180
So as to, uh, uh, uh, to hide the naked glory of our work.

371
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,620
...uh...

372
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,040
From the questing eyes of others.

373
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,600
Well, here we are at the end of Skit Row.

374
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,540
You can see bad puns lying around everywhere, jokes no one, no one got in a bun dance.

375
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,820
Plots at the bottom dropped out of in cranes.

376
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,600
It's good to see things other than they really are.

377
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,400
Makes you appreciate the good bits, like this one.

378
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,500
...

379
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:55,640
...

380
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,680
...

381
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,060
...

382
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,060


383
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,080
...

384
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,200
...

385
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,080
...

386
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,180
Now that's twice you coughed in the last half hour in this confessional, son.

387
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,580
I know father hit me.

388
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,540
This the second coughing.

389
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,460
It's these damn cigarettes.

390
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,280
Well, my lad, if you're in a hurry to meet your maker, well, ss...

391
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,660
Well, cigarettes will help you see him faster.

392
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,620
But there's a lot of false prophets on cigarettes out there.

393
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,000
When you die, you don't want to go to hack, do you?

394
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,500
It's smoky enough here in this life.

395
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,200
That's right, father.

396
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,440
No.

397
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,840
You want to come up, come up all the way up to that cool taste of heaven.

398
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,620
That's why if you smoke, you should inhale Pope John Paul Maul's.

399
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,480
So you do not... don't end up in a hail with old nicotine.

400
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,640
Pope John Paul Maul's have an absolute taste.

401
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:48,440
Divine aroma and our revelation in smoothness, plus extra tar and nicotine.

402
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,600
They come in straights and filter kings of king size.

403
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,220
You see, the tobacco for Pope John Paul Maul's was grown on hallowed ground somewhere in Rome,

404
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,180
which makes Pope John Paul Maul's the consecrated of his smoke in this world.

405
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:01,720
What next?

406
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,840
Next time you're laying on your hands or laying on of hands or laying on your hands on a pack...

407
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,220
Lay your hands...

408
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,120
Wait a minute.

409
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,240
Lay your hands on a pack of Pope John Paul Maul's.

410
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,900
Collect the redemption miles on the back of packs for absolution points.

411
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,000
Make your last breath of drag on Pope John Paul Maul's.

412
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,920
The cigarette will help you meet your maker that much faster.

413
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,940
Smoke this!

414
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,840
Hello?

415
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:36,900
Hi, this is 18-T. Mildred Monday is at a pay phone and wishes to make a call and bill it to your number. Is that alright?

416
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,380
Mildred Monday? I'm Mildred Monday.

417
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,680
No, you're not. Mildred's at the pay phone.

418
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,040
I said I am Mildred Monday.

419
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,360
And I told you Mildred's at the pay phone.

420
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,500
Well, who wants to make the call?

421
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,120
Mildred's making the call from the pay phone.

422
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,600
She's making a call to New Zealand.

423
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,660
And wants to bill the phone call to your house.

424
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,960
Oh, no. Uh-uh.

425
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,140
Yeah, that's what she's doing.

426
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:02,820
No.

427
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,400
And she wants verification from you to make sure it's alright.

428
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,080
No. I don't know no Mildred Monday.

429
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
You don't know Mildred Monday?

430
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,360
No, sir.

431
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,360
Are you saying this could be a fraudulent call?

432
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,580
It could be because I am Mildred Monday and I'm in bed in my own home.

433
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,100
Oh, my... Let me let you... I better get my supervisor. Do you want to talk to my supervisor?

434
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,200
I don't want to make no call to no New Zealand.

435
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,100
Yeah, we better get this taken care of. Let me put you through to the supervisor.

436
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,500
Okay, just a minute, ma'am. I'll just be a second.

437
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,180
All right.

438
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,180
Yes, this is Tim. How may I help you?

439
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:51,620
Well, they just called here and said a Mildred Monday was at a pay phone and wanted to make a long-distance call to New Zealand.

440
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,780
Yes, that's correct, ma'am.

441
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,060
And I am Mildred Monday.

442
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,140
No.

443
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,400
And I'm in my own home.

444
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,820
Are you saying that... What are you trying to say?

445
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:15,200
Because, see, we have a Mildred Monday on the other line that says that she lives at your address and gave us your phone number and wanted to charge them and make the charges to your house.

446
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,300
No, indeedy.

447
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,040
No, indeedy?

448
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,800
I am Mildred Monday and I live here and I don't want no long-distance call on that phone.

449
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,420
You don't?

450
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:22,960
No.

451
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,580
Your name... You're Mildred Monday?

452
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,220
I am Mildred Monday.

453
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,700
I bet you can't say that five times fast.

454
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,180
Hello, I have a collect call from John Cravens. Will you accept the charges?

455
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,560
I am John Cravens.

456
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,100
No, no, you don't understand. John Cravens is calling you. This is 18T Operator.

457
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,840
I am John Cravens.

458
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,480
Will you accept the charges from John Cravens? John?

459
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,480
Okay.

460
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,200
Okay, you'll accept the charges?

461
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:51,720
Yeah.

462
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,820
Okay, let me put the call through.

463
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:55,960
Hello?

464
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:56,600
Hello?

465
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,100
Hello, this is John.

466
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,060
Yeah?

467
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,660
Who is this?

468
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,500
John.

469
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,160
Yes, I would like to know what you're doing in my house.

470
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,720
Ah, dang if I know. Sleeping with your wife.

471
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,020
You're sleeping with my wife?

472
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,500
Yeah.

473
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,480
What are you sleeping with my wife for?

474
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,820
Somebody asked to.

475
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,600
Is she good?

476
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,540
Of course.

477
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:18,940
I...

478
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:18,980
I...

479
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,480
I...

480
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,700
I...

481
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


482
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


483
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


484
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


485
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


486
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


487
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


488
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


489
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:21,700


490
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,720
This is 18T. Are you through with your call? Hello?

491
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,360
Hello?

492
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,800
Are you through with your call, sir?

493
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,840
Hell if I know.

494
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,260
Excuse me?

495
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
I don't know what's going on.

496
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,940
Don't swear at me. I'm 18T. I'll just continue your service in the heartbeat.

497
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,720
See ya.

498
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,280
Goodbye. And don't expect any...

499
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:51,680
A man wearing a carpenter's belt walks down a busy city street, making his way to the

500
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


501
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


502
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


503
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


504
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


505
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


506
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


507
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


508
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


509
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:51,680


510
00:28:51,680 --> 00:29:00,820
particular street corner he lowers to his knees. He draws his hammer from its holster

511
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:09,840
and a large nail from his pouch. The man carefully positions the nail and drives it into the

512
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:21,660
sidewalk pavement. Slowly at first, and then more rapidly, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,

513
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:36,060
begins to gush from the open wound. A crowd of alarmed onlookers forms. Soon an ambulance

514
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:48,600
arrives, but the medics are unable to stop the bleeding. 30 minutes after the injury,

515
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,480
the city has lost power.

516
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,660
The police are on the move.

517
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:07,740
10 minutes later, telephones are dead and traffic is at a standstill. The hemorrhaging

518
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:19,660
continues until downtown is flooded with milk. Rolling to the waterfront, the milk spills

519
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,660
into the sea, stained with blood.

520
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,460
The smorgasbord justAGES the city of Houston.

521
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,640
The lavabat starts to surge from a pungent beat肔.

522
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


523
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


524
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:41,480


525
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:51,660
The carpenter denies having any involvement with the incident.

526
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:51,660


527
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:51,660


528
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,760
Yes dear friends

529
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,000
Well what we were just hearing

530
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,060
On the other side

531
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,600
Of show

532
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,840
Was

533
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,000
That the thing about the carpenter

534
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,540
Was from Head and Leg

535
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,340
A CD that's distributed

536
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,120
By the Negative Land

537
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,640
Folks

538
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,180
Keep your eyes out for that Head and Leg CD

539
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,220
I've been playing little bits and pieces of it

540
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,780
Also we heard some prank calls

541
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,420
From Phone Losers

542
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,200
Of America

543
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,740
And oh how I wish

544
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,320
There was another engineer

545
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,020
Here to control the volumes

546
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,280
Rather than me

547
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,200
Poor lonely Reverend Stang

548
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,260
Like a little militia nut

549
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,820
Sitting in his

550
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,520
Cave

551
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,000
Cranking out

552
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,340
Shows and uh

553
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,200
Uh

554
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,780
Hymns

555
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,000
Hey I thought that music was about to poop out and didn't

556
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,340
Oh well

557
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,740
More news of the weird

558
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,240
According to police in St. Louis, Missouri

559
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,040
Burglary suspects

560
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,420
Ronald L. Egan

561
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,280
And Roy Mullen

562
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,020
Couldn't have been more eager to please

563
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,340
When they were arrested

564
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,420
In April

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,980
The first cop on the scene spotted me

566
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,520
And asked what he was doing there

567
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,360
Mullen replied

568
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,360
Oh a burglary I guess

569
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,860
The second cop

570
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,240
Spotted Egan

571
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,820
Emerging from around back with a vacuum cleaner

572
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,240
And asked him the same question

573
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,900
Egan allegedly replied

574
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,960
Oh we're just burglarizing the place

575
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,340
The Sacramento Bee

576
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,980
Reported in May that rapists use of condoms is up substantially in St. Louis

577
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,440
In several cities

578
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,880
But that it is not clear whether that is due primarily to fear of AIDS

579
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,960
Or fear of leaving valuable DNA evidence on the victim's body

580
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,480
Many rapists who use condoms are apparently ignorant of DNA identification

581
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,360
In that they will leave a semen filled condom at the scene

582
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,280
Which is like gift wrapping the evidence

583
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,880
For investigators

584
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,420
Construction worker Thomas W. Passmore, 32

585
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:24,440
Filed a lawsuit in April for $3.35 million

586
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
Against Sentara Norfolk General Hospital

587
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,540
And four doctors over the loss of his hand

588
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,900
Passmore admits to having cut off his own hand

589
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,460
Because he believed it to be possessed by the devil

590
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,780
And twice refused to allow doctors to reattach it

591
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,680
However he claims the hospital was negligent

592
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,400
In not asking his family to help him

593
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,400


594
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,240
To overrule his poor decision

595
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,120
Well what's he going to do next?

596
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,860
Sue God?

597
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,100
Or the devil?

598
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,980
That's who he ought to be suing is the devil

599
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,660
The devil was the one that possessed his hand

600
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,700
I bet I know what that hand was doing

601
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,260
I bet you do too

602
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,020
Only the devil would be responsible

603
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,360
No human individual could be held responsible

604
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,420
For the sin of onanism

605
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,940
Really?

606
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,740
They should sue the devil

607
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,900
When is that going to happen?

608
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,180
Among the grossest problems created by Washington DC's financial crisis

609
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,260
Is the condition of the city morgue

610
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,280
The Washington Post reported in May

611
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,400
That 74 bodies were stockpiled

612
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,640
Because the crematorium

613
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,520
The only affordable disposal method

614
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,360
Is broken

615
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,820
And that the city is backlogged

616
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,620
With more than two million people

617
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,960
200 autopsies

618
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,700
And 400 toxicology analyses

619
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,720
But furthermore

620
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,060
In the autopsy room

621
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,940
The air conditioning is broken

622
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,220
Cockroaches run free on autopsy tables

623
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,320
The floor is sticky

624
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,320
With blood and other bodily fluids

625
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,660
Because drains are clogged

626
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,460
And corpses are exposed

627
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,000
In torn body bags

628
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,640
And of course there's the stench

629
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,120
Oh, lovely Washington DC

630
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,020
I was born there

631
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
In May

632
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,840
Matthew Simmons, 21

633
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,120
Had just been found guilty in London, England

634
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,620
Of threatening French soccer star Eric Cantona

635
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,440
Okay, he'd been found guilty in

636
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,340
He's in the court

637
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,740
He'd just been found guilty of threatening a soccer star

638
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,860
He leaped over the bench

639
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,460
Grabbed the prosecutor in a headlock

640
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,700
And tried to punch him

641
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,180
Yelling all the while

642
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,100
I am innocent

643
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
I promise

644
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,700
I swear on the Bible

645
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,120
The Wall Street Journal reported in March

646
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,140
That New York City photographer

647
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,980
And former Electrolux vacuum cleaner salesman

648
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,720
Eugene Calamari Jr.

649
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,960
Is a part-time performance artist

650
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,740
Who lies on the floor

651
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,040
And lets people vacuum him

652
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,400
With an upright vacuum cleaner

653
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,540
After which he asks the vacuumers

654
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,340
To write down their feelings

655
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,320
Calamari says

656
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,880
A lot of people use each other

657
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,500
And step on each other's rights

658
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,780
And says his theme is

659
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,060
I won't let anyone do this to me

660
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,180
Man, the art world is so beautiful

661
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,040
So beautiful

662
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,840
And to think

663
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,980
You know, those are the characters that get the grants

664
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,280
The cartoonists

665
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,180
The people who can actually draw

666
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,640
Shunted off to the gutters of the art world

667
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,340
Yes

668
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,120
Happy birthday Palmer

669
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,660
Even if we're a little late

670
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,020
USA Today reported in April

671
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,880
On the problems caused by aging zoo animals

672
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,760
At the Phoenix, Arizona Zoo

673
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,040
Orangutan Billy, age 35

674
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,920
Gets laxatives and also cortisone

675
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,100
For his aching back

676
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,880
A cancerous growth was removed

677
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,740
From the mouth of a rattlesnake

678
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,580
A zebra gets ibuprofen for various pains

679
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:27,540
And a 33-year-old donkey wears orthopedic shoes

680
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,580
More news here from the weirdo American community

681
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:37,140
In March, Preston Litt, 47

682
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,040
Was arrested as the suspected stalker

683
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,080
Of Philadelphia news anchor Steve Litt

684
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,080


685
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,460
Allegedly, Litt followed Litt around

686
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,220
On assignments for three years

687
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,700
And sent him what Litt called

688
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,120
Special gifts

689
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,320
Such as car parts

690
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,120
And mail stolen from other people

691
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,260
Litt once congratulated Litt

692
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,740
On his ability to control the weather

693
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:08,120
And I can sort of sympathize with Steve Litt

694
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,160
The stalked news anchor

695
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,060
Because there are people probably listening to this

696
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,580
Show right now

697
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,780
That send crazy stuff to us, friends

698
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,440
You know, this is the church of the subgenius

699
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,180
It is a home and a forum

700
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,460
For the weirdo community of the world

701
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,060
But some of them are weirder

702
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,420
Than my comprehension can grasp

703
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,840
We do get things in the mail

704
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,760
That don't make a damn lick of sense at all

705
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,360
I guess it's

706
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,460
And it's not an artistic statement they're making

707
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,200
I don't think

708
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,580
I think that they find these old beat-up pieces of garbage

709
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,680
And trash, old books and things somehow meaningful

710
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,700
And they want to share it with us

711
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,380
Because they know the secret is hidden somewhere in there

712
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,340
And it probably is

713
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,060
Because you know the subgenius

714
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,820
As it says in Book of the Subgenius

715
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,140
The subgenius can see the future

716
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,280
In comic books and wine bottles

717
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,820
On the other hand

718
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,020
There are schizophrenic subgeniuses out there

719
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,480
And we do get

720
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
We have gotten

721
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,200
In case you ever wondered

722
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,880
We have indeed gotten vials of bodily fluid in the mail

723
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
People send us their hair

724
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,300
Fingernail clippings

725
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,960
Things like that

726
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,980
What they expect us to do with them

727
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,360
We just

728
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,460
We put it in the Dobbs Museum

729
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,300
Out in the entryway of the office

730
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,100
And so that you know

731
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,820
Those who come by can actually glimpse these senseless items

732
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,220
In April

733
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,980
The Foothill Leader newspaper in California profiled local man

734
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,240
Ludovic van Man

735
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,380
Salka

736
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,080
77

737
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:16,400
Prominent for having waged a 28 year war against his neighbors

738
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,360
Who he says manufactured drugs in their houses

739
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,000
In the beginning he would call the police

740
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,040
But after they repeatedly found no evidence of drugs in any of the homes

741
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,260
They started arresting Salka

742
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,040
Nowadays Salka is on his own

743
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,480
Screeching at neighbors at all hour of the day and night

744
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,440
He must yell

745
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,580
To be heard over the roar of a dozen industrial fans on his property

746
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,940
Which he says are necessary to blow away the drug fumes

747
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:54,380
Well I guess our old friend Bob Black and him can hang out together

748
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,040
And call the cops about all the drugs everywhere

749
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:04,880
The drugs being manufactured by their evil enemies

750
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,660
Their enemies who really are

751
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,700
Everywhere

752
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,580
Despite appeals by their more mainstream leaders

753
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:18,720
About 4,000 Shiite Muslims in Nabatiyah Lebanon

754
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,140
Slashed their heads with swords and razors in May

755
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:30,360
In the annual self-flagellation celebration of the revered 17th century Saint Hussein

756
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,240
The grandson of the prophet Muhammad

757
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,640
You know and isn't that something we should know

758
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,820
And should remember dear friends

759
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,240
As crazy as the religious nuts are in this country

760
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,240
We're actually getting by pretty easy

761
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,720
Okay in April

762
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,260
Well and here this is another example of just how easy we have it here

763
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,500
In the good old U.S. of A

764
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,760
In April a court in Hebei province in China

765
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,080
Found night watchman Qi Mingyan 61

766
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,560
Guilty of making 180 long distance calls on his employer's telephone

767
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,000
And sentenced him to life in prison

768
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Life in prison for unauthorized long distance phone calls friends

769
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,680
I can sort of see that

770
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,040
I was in China for about six weeks several years ago

771
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,180
And I got to see a Chinese phone book

772
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,220
They have one phone book for the entire country

773
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,800
Of one billion people

774
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:49,060
The phone book for all of China is about the size of a small suburban American phone book

775
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
Plano, Texas or Richardson, Texas

776
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:02,480
Has more telephones than the vast sleeping giant that is China

777
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,740
It's a

778
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:11,340
Public phone with a white autistic son

779
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,180
unit

780
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,640
If you um

781
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:25,660
If you don't know who I am

782
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,600
And if in this instance what happens

783
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,800
It didn't make a lot of money

784
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:28,820
Okay

785
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,160
One of the national přih Government facilities

786
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,860
Good guys being enslaved.

787
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,960
As long as it's your enemies that have at it.

788
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,900
Here's some more Middle Eastern obsessions.

789
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,640
According to the new Judith Miller book, God Has 99 Names,

790
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:02,460
Muammar Gaddafi seriously pined for Bush administration State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.

791
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,540
That could explain a lot.

792
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,440
Gaddafi had a thing for Tutwiler.

793
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,520
London's Sunday Telegraph reported that Syria's defense minister,

794
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,720
Lieutenant General Mustafa Tulas, continues to bombard Princess Diana with love letters.

795
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,680
His library is said to be decorated with pictures of her

796
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,600
and to contain the world's largest collection of books about her.

797
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,740
Well, now she is free.

798
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,260
Lieutenant General Tulas, now she is free.

799
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,240
You can go get your true yeti mate, your dream girl, Princess Di.

800
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,640
I don't know, she's not a princess anymore though, is she?

801
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,600
Okay, two girls at the Mount St. Mary Academy in Little Rock, Arkansas

802
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,480
were not permitted to attend their graduation ceremony in May

803
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,660
because of a school ruling barring pregnant students.

804
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,440
Girls who have had abortions,

805
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,400
abortions are not banned from the ceremony.

806
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,520
Yes, my friends, this is such a weird, weird world we live in.

807
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:21,360
And it seems sometimes to me, you know, sure, we're subgeniuses, we're weirdos.

808
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,140
But in some ways, aren't the normals all the weirder?

809
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,280
Are they not truly weirder than us in their strange acceptance?

810
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,440
Of that selfsame normality?

811
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:44,040
Yes, and that reminds me of a little song I should play here by Bill T. Miller.

812
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,880
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.

813
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,320
Any abnormal sound?

814
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,140
No!

815
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,420
Ah!

816
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,880
Happily, delightfully, comfortingly normal!

817
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,420
Easy to remove.

818
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,660
Maybe normality the norm.

819
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,320
Normal!

820
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,960
Well!

821
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,720
Happily, delightfully, comfortingly normal!

822
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,660
The conspiracy made him want to be normal.

823
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,240
You fueled me, Doctor!

824
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,360
Impatible.

825
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,460
Absolutely impatible.

826
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:32,440
Absolutely impatible.

827
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,840
Mind over matter.

828
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,940
The whole of this is mind over matter.

829
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,860
Totally and absolutely mind over matter.

830
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,680
Mind over matter.

831
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,220
Normal!

832
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,240
Normal!

833
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,620
Why do you want to be normal?

834
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,220
Think about it, normals!

835
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,080
Normal!

836
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,920
Make more noise!

837
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,160
Come on, let's hear it.

838
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,580
Come on, let's hear it.

839
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,540
Am I getting the best way to ride?

840
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,280
Resist it.

841
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:08,760
Run.

842
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,200
Run.

843
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,820
Rumble.

844
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:16,920
Rumble.

845
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:18,880
Rumble.

846
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:20,960
Rumble.

847
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,980
Rumble.

848
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,060
Rumble.

849
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,040
Rumble.

850
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,320
Rumble.

851
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,100
Rumble.

852
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,680
Rumble.

853
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,560
Rumble.

854
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,380
Make more noise.

855
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
Let's hear it.

856
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,060
Come on, let's hear it.

857
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,600
Rumble.

858
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,820
Rumble.

859
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,600
And there's mine coming up here.

860
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,940
Rumble.

861
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:50,880


862
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,560
We're all going for it.

863
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:54,920
More.

864
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,640
Incredible.

865
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,460
Absolutely incredible.

866
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:00,900
Mind-blowing.

867
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,300
Mind-over-matter.

868
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,400
Mind-over-matter.

869
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,500
Have you ever had any fun?

870
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,200
Yes, it's helpful.

871
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,660
I think you've developed some kind of obsession here.

872
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,520
I think you need some help.

873
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,300
Incredible.

874
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,040
Absolutely incredible.

875
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,320
Why do you want to be normal?

876
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,520
You know?

877
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,260
It's more fun not to be.

878
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,900
Absolutely incredible.

879
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:46,920
Good stuff.

880
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,980
I didn't expect you to be this kind of just one kind of gentleman in the image now.

881
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:54,180
She's not something that you think is good enough.

882
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,040
Is that enough for them to do?

883
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,440
Tell them, let's be, let's just be professionals.

884
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,320
She's this kind of person that will get a little bit out of it.

885
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:58,320


886
00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,400
gustado?

887
00:48:59,580 --> 00:48:59,580


888
00:48:59,640 --> 00:48:59,660
This other thing you yogurt on was ridiculous.

889
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,280
Hey guys, everybody knows how this shit works, right.

890
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:00,800
Do you like yogurto?

891
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:00,900


892
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,320
The conspiracy may be and ought to be normal.

893
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,260
Normal.

894
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,160
Normal.

895
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,280
Normal.

896
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,040
Happily, delightfully, comfortingly normal.

897
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,980
These occurrences are pure pigments of imagination.

898
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,620
It's not normal.

899
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,180
Make more noise.

900
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,380
Let's hear it.

901
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,940
Come on, let's hear it.

902
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,500
Normal.

903
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,620
Normal.

904
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,860
Normal.

905
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,600
Normal.

906
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,500
Normal.

907
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,420
Normal.

908
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:00,500
Normal.

909
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:02,940
Whoa.

910
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:09,860
Yeah, friends, that's Bill T. Miller from his CD, Open Your Ears,

911
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,580
which incidentally is one of the three CDs that are distributed by the Subgenius Foundation.

912
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:29,300
You can also get information about Bill Miller's CDs by calling him at 1-617-LICK-OB.

913
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,640
1-617-LICK-OBE

914
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,720
and I should

915
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,800
probably should mention the other couple of CDs

916
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,640
that we sell besides Bill Miller's Open Your Ears

917
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,840
which by the way all the songs

918
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,060
on that thing are as dense as that one

919
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,880
it's pretty amazing

920
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,860
there's a CD of

921
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,640
Subgenius DeVival

922
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,740
that is now out

923
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,000
called DeVival Then Fire

924
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,720
conspiracy says no connection

925
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,800
but it's true we did

926
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,300
do a DeVival in Madison, Wisconsin

927
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,720
at a little club

928
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,820
and several bad things happened

929
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,000
for one thing the club lied to us about how many people

930
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,600
they could get in there and somebody stole

931
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,340
one of our bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

932
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,460
replicas

933
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:33,220
and some transvestite tried to pick up Dr. Legume

934
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,940
which wasn't that big of a deal except that the

935
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,820
guy wouldn't quit

936
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,560
and three days after we left

937
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,040
the club burned to the ground

938
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,160
we also carry a very rare

939
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,020
German CD although you wouldn't think it was German

940
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,860
to listen to it it's sung in English

941
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:57,020
by the Klingons

942
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,240
a CD called Time Control

943
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,600
I know I'm not really supposed to advertise

944
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,460
but you know I mean

945
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,480
this is a church man

946
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,320
we gotta help the children

947
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,620
in fact I think

948
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,780
what I'll do for the rest of this show

949
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,660
is just play some excerpts from those CDs

950
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,440
so we'll be hearing the Klingons

951
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,220
and Dr. Legume

952
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,480
and in the meantime

953
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,980
I think it important

954
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,060
deathly important

955
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,060
that you know

956
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,680
the subgenius post office box number

957
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,780
which of course

958
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,560
as you probably know

959
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,100
but maybe you haven't done it yet

960
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,580
you can write to Bob

961
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,200
or somebody

962
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,100
whoever opens the mail here

963
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,620
usually me or Jesus

964
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,180
for free information

965
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,020
and that's

966
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,380
Bob

967
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,040
and Bob

968
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,580
it's fairly easy to spell

969
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,040
and that's Bob

970
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,040


971
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,040


972
00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:00,000
it is spelled B-O-B

973
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,980
for you very sub subgeniuses out there

974
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,520
and the address is of course

975
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,680
post office box

976
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,200
140306

977
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,080
140306

978
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,780
in lovely

979
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,660
oh so lovely

980
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,000
Dallas, Texas

981
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
75214

982
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,040
and I'll see you next time

983
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,040


984
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,040


985
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:27,780
and uh

986
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,300
Dallas actually

987
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,040
you know it's actually

988
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,060
figure of speech friends

989
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,680
Dallas is not very lovely

990
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,240
it's uh

991
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:35,980
sits

992
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:36,660
uh

993
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,040
uselessly

994
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,860
uh

995
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:40,820
in the middle of the prairie

996
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,720
with not much to look at

997
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,280
but scrubby little trees

998
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,240
and scrubby prairie plains

999
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,320
grassland

1000
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:50,700
and

1001
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,780
the conspiracy

1002
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,480
Dallas really is the home

1003
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,460
of the conspiracy

1004
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,040
well anyway

1005
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,260
uh

1006
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,700
let's get back into uh

1007
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,180
I'll quit being bitter

1008
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,100
and griping

1009
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:01,360
and

1010
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:01,960
bitching

1011
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,440
and uh

1012
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,820
we'll just hear what there is

1013
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,480
available

1014
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,240

1015
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,540

thank you

1022
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,580
brothers and sisters

1023
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,280
what time is it

1024
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,560
what time is it

1025
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,040
what time is it

1026
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:27,880
what time is it

1027
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,980
what time is it

1028
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,300
what time is it

1029
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:34,300


1030
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:34,540
no really

1031
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,000
what time is it

1032
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,800
does anybody know what time it is

1033
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,180
1230

1034
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,700
1230

1035
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,640
is it 1230

1036
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,960
is it 1230

1037
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,580
yeah

1038
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,240
well I disagree

1039
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,540
I don't believe it's 1230

1040
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,560
when everyone knows that it's not 1230

1041
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,240
it's the end times

1042
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,960
that's right brothers and sisters

1043
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,380
it's the end times

1044
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:21,840
and we at the church of the subgenius are here to give you a message

1045
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,060
a message which may save your lives

1046
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,040
I'd like to invite you to join us for a little bit of a talk

1047
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,040


1048
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:33,520
I'd like to tell you a little story about a man who joined the church of the subgenius a few years ago

1049
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,900
I'm not going to name any names

1050
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,020
when he first started out he was kind of an outcast

1051
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,560
nobody really wanted anything to do with him

1052
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,260
they all thought he was a weirdo or a freak

1053
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,900
people wouldn't talk to him

1054
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,020
he could be the last man in the bar at 2am

1055
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,920
and he still could never get any p***y

1056
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,120
well

1057
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,900
one day he found a subgenius pamphlet laying down on the ground

1058
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,100
and he read it and he said wow

1059
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,920
you know these people are just like me

1060
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,800
these people are outcasts just like me

1061
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,360
so he wrote into the address and he bought himself a membership in the church of the subgenius

1062
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,620
pardon me a minute

1063
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,460
I hear you all talking in the back

1064
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,120
yeah keep talking I can hear you back there

1065
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,220
you won't be talking after July 5th 1998 though

1066
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,460
you'll be screaming in p***y pain

1067
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,420
well as I was saying this poor pathetic little loser

1068
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,380
he couldn't do nothing right

1069
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,880
but he went out and he sent his money into the church of the subgenius

1070
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,760
he got himself a membership

1071
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,300
became an ordained preacher for Bob

1072
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,540
he went and bought himself some Bob t-shirts

1073
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,200
and wore them until they rotted out

1074
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,800
and he took them off his back

1075
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,800
he bought all the subgenius books

1076
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,880
and memorized them cover to cover

1077
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,720
you can ask him what's on page 369 of revelation X

1078
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,580
and he'd say there is no page 369 of revelation X

1079
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,580
you could say what's on page 69 of the book of the subgenius

1080
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:14,440
and he would tell you what's on page 69 of the book of the subgenius

1081
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,500
word for word

1082
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,540
in other words he was a sickening Bobby

1083
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,280
he got to meet all the other subgeniuses

1084
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:31,100
but since he kept blabbing on and on and on about all this meaningless bobs without ever catching on to the truth,

1085
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:38,920
he just irritated them, and the outcasts cast him out, and he still did never get any pussy.

1086
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,220
Well, eventually, the subgeniuses, they just didn't want to hang around with him anymore,

1087
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,300
and nobody else wanted to hang around with him either because he was still a pathetic loser.

1088
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,500
And finally, his parents didn't want anything to do with him, and they threw him out of his basement where he was living.

1089
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:05,920
And he didn't have a job or anything, so he just ended up becoming a drunk and sleeping out in the gutters.

1090
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,900
You know, he was cuddling up in the cardboard boxes back in the alleys, dumpster diving and all this.

1091
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,960
And one day, a group of people came up, and they told him about Jesus.

1092
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,700
That's right. They told him about Jesus.

1093
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,260
And they took him, and they gave him.

1094
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,180
They gave him a job, and they gave him a place to stay,

1095
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,400
and they introduced him to a nice Christian girl.

1096
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,500
And he thought that everything was pretty good.

1097
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:41,840
You know, he ended up getting married, having some kids, a house with a white picket fence and a dog in the yard.

1098
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,780
He hated the church of the subgenius.

1099
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,000
He felt that he'd been shafted by them.

1100
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,260
He felt that the devil had come into his life.

1101
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,660
And tried to steer him down this false path.

1102
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,600
He hated the church of the subgenius.

1103
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,920
He hated the subgenius mythology.

1104
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,320
He hated the belief system.

1105
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,720
He hated Bob.

1106
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,780
He hated Bob.

1107
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,460
I know, most of you can't imagine what it would be like to hate Bob.

1108
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,420
Maybe.

1109
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,020
He hated Bob.

1110
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:22,220
He denied that there would be an exodus invasion on July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

1111
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,180
He cursed Reverend Stang.

1112
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,100
He denied Dr. Lagune three times in one day.

1113
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,980
He spit on Jane or Hyperclete.

1114
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,720
But then who has him?

1115
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:44,980
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heretic on July 5th, 1998?

1116
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:50,080
Would anyone like to take a guess what's going to happen to this heretic when the saucers come?

1117
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,340
He will die.

1118
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,880
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

1119
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,500
He will be on those saucers with the sex goddesses.

1120
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:05,100
Because he paid his $30 subgenius membership fee.

1121
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,960
He had his membership card in the church.

1122
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,300
And even if you were to go out today and turn your back on Bob, forget that you ever heard any of this.

1123
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,460
Even if you were to go out tomorrow and get a job.

1124
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:21,160
Maybe even as president of the United States or a cop somewhere ripping apart people's cars.

1125
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:21,960
Searching for dope.

1126
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,460
You would still be able to get on the pleasure saucers.

1127
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,200
As long as you had that subgenius membership card.

1128
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:31,820
As long as you paid for that subgenius membership card.

1129
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,220
Can you say the same?

1130
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:39,100
Can you say that you're going to be on those escape vessels on July 5th?

1131
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,640
Do you think you're going to squeak by just because you're cool?

1132
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,460
Do you think coolness is going to get you onto those space vessels?

1133
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:51,320
Well, what are you going to do on X-Day?

1134
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:58,280
When suddenly all your paid in full subgenius buddies disappear?

1135
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,780
Little bird brain, sneaky kind of smile.

1136
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,260
Great big body reptile style.

1137
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,220
Where did you go?

1138
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,160
Nobody knows.

1139
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:36,180
Just a change of climate or UFOs.

1140
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,380
Then did the duck bill dance.

1141
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,400
Some were living off lands.

1142
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,100
Stegosaurus strobe.

1143
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,460
Do the pterodactyl roll.

1144
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,460
Some were living off lands.

1145
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,160
Some were living off lands.

1146
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,020
Some were living off lands.

1147
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,580
Some were living off lands.

1148
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,080
Scientists speculate.

1149
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,900
Governing the dark.

1150
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,680
Natural selection all too big for Noah's ark.

1151
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,260
Fossils and stones.

1152
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,180
And great big bones.

1153
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,320
Just pieces of a puzzle.

1154
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,080
And they, they still don't know.

1155
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,620
They can't make the Earth shake.
