1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240
Bar.

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,380
There.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello.

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,660
My name is Bobby J. Dobbs.

6
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,020
Jude.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,640
Hello.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,580
B-Rock-O-Boner Pillows.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,280
Hello.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,220
Hey, Bob.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,900
We're all going to the creek tonight.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,000
It's gonna be a gas.

13
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,300
You're coming, right?

14
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,400
I can't, guys.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,400
Have a The Self Genius Hour of Sweat.

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,980
Anyone who is listening now,

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,660
if you have keys to the sound booth,

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,920
that would be helpful,

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,420
but we'd also like to have flashlights

20
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,720
and headlights pointed at the stage.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,560
It's not dark because we want it to be dark.

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,480
It's dark because we are locked out of the power supply.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,840
I can't hear anything.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,900
Anyway, we need more light.

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,980
Anybody has flashlights or cars that have lights?

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,880
That would be nice.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm gonna eventually run out of gas in my car.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,400
That's our only source of light right now.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,720
Right, Bob?

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,480
Right, Bob?

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,000
Who are these people?

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,160
Hey, what do you want?

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,040
People, yeah.

34
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,960
People, yeah.

35
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,580
People, sure.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,060
People.

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,700
With this.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,020
Is Reverend Og Combiner here?

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,560
Oh, by the way, I just heard from Reverend Pease.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,180
He's lost.

41
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,240
He's on the ground in Ohio, and he's lost.

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,300
He called me and said,

43
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,300
I can't, there's no Pomeroy, Ohio.

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,840
There's a Pomeroy, Michigan.

45
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,760
Pomeroy, Alaska.

46
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm heading there.

47
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,640
And I said, no, no, it's Pomeroy, Ohio.

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,660
He'll...

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,820
And then he screamed and there was a crash sound,

50
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,440
and I didn't hear anything else after that.

51
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,860
You know, for lack of anything else, when there's nothing,

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,580
no other song going on, it's always possible to do.

53
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,260
Well, in fact, it's impossible not to do the song that refused to die.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,240
And now that I've said it,

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,060
uh, guess what?

56
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,020
It's not going to die.

57
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,020
It's not that great of a song or anything.

58
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,800
In fact, it'll get worse and worse and worse.

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,180
Then it'll get real good.

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,560
It'll sound great for a little while.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,960
Then lightning will strike, and it'll sound bad again.

62
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,040
It's, uh, it's not a catchy song, exactly.

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,380
But yet it refuses to die.

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,440
It is a song that refused to die.

65
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,360
It could, it could die.

66
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,380
It may want, it, well, if it wanted to die, I suppose it might.

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,540
But it refuses to die.

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,040
You can pray for the song to die.

69
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,480
You can, I wouldn't recommend that,

70
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
because you never know who's going to be listening.

71
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,860
Uh, you could, uh, you could, you could politely ask the song to die or go away.

72
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,340
That's not going to happen.

73
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,700
Uh, you could...

74
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,640
You could, uh, probably pay the song to at least be quiet for a little while.

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,080
But it's just going to blow up in your face.

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Just when you're going nodding off to sleep, suddenly, wham, the song comes back.

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,620
The song, it refused to die.

78
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,180
The last time I escaped from it, I had been experiencing it for like four hours.

79
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,880
And that was 20 years ago.

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,200
But...

81
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,540
Obviously, it's not dead.

82
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,300
Just listen.

83
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,600
The damnable thing.

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
It refuses to die.

85
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,780
Like an unholy, uh, check done by Satanist.

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,900
But it's not Satanist or subgenius's fault or nobody's fault.

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,860
The song is independent of, uh, you or me or anybody else.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Even if the electricity went off, the song would continue on.

89
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,320
It refuses to die.

90
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,540
It might take different...

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,160
It might take different forms.

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,480
Right now, you're lucky.

93
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,580
It sounds pretty good.

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,760
But, um, it could sound like a car wreck.

95
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,640
It could sound like a power line falling over and electrocating everybody.

96
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,220
It could sound like knives in your ears.

97
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,560
It might actually be knives in your ears.

98
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,860
You'll notice that even when I quit talking about the song that refused to die,

99
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,140
you'll still hear something.

100
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,120
Well, that's...

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,800
That's it.

102
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,600
That's the song just waiting to sneak up on you again.

103
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
It's a bastard, that song is.

104
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,120
Or something.

105
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,840
We don't know what sex it is.

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
I suppose songs don't actually have to have a...

107
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,260
a sex.

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,300
I hope to God it can't reproduce.

109
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,880
Man, that would be horrible.

110
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,640
Think of more than one song that refused to die.

111
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,020
On the other hand, where there's one song that refused to die,

112
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,340
that usually means somewhere there's a mommy song that refused to die

113
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,100
and a daddy song that refused to die.

114
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,100


115
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,420
Luckily, I'm half deaf, so I can only hear half of the song that refused to die.

116
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,040
Lucky me.

117
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,920
That just means it's an unbalanced song that refuses to die.

118
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,880
There's one thing about the song that refused to die.

119
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,100
Usually it means Bob is somewhere around.

120
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,080
Because he's a baby.

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,080


122
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,520
You can kind of feel that Bob energy.

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Hey, something just popped in my ear here.

124
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,000
I said Bob, and it popped in my ear.

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
I can hear again.

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,180
Say baby.

127
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Baby.

128
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,800
I can hear again.

129
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,500
Oh wait, that was the ear that could already hear.

130
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:24,980
Shit.

131
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,020
I was wondering...

132
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,640
No, no.

133
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,080
No.

134
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,960
No.

135
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:28,980


136
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,700
The song killed my right ear, friends.

137
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,060
There's some bad sounds out there.

138
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,740
The sound of Christians talking bad about Bob.

139
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,580
Think of that.

140
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,040
The thing of atheists talking bad about Bob.

141
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,520
Pagans talking bad on Bob.

142
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,720
Subgeniuses talking bad on Bob.

143
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,020
Bad on Bob.

144
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,080
The only thing that's going to stop me from listening is this.

145
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


146
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


147
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


148
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


149
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


150
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


151
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


152
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


154
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


155
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


156
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


157
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,080


159
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:14,640
I got it. I take it. It's a B. I said O. I got B. And I stay O.

160
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,520
B-I-I-O-B. B-I-I-O-B.

161
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,460
Oh, finally something different.

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh, shit. It came back again.

163
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,920
See? Let's try to get off that subject.

164
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,700
Let's try to think of something good with lyrics.

165
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,220
Leo box 1, 8, 1, 4, 1, 7.

166
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,440
Oh.

167
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, yes.

168
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,400
Ah, now I feel it.

169
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,320
I'm starting to feel the spirit.

170
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,820
Something great is happening.

171
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,340
Something great is happening here.

172
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,820
I said A.

173
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,740
B-O.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,060
B-O.

175
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,200
B-O-B.

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,900
B-O-B.

177
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,960
B-O-B.

178
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,660
B-O-B.

179
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,280
B-O-B.

180
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,560
B-O.

181
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,560


182
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,280
B-O-B.

183
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:24,840


184
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,120
B-O-B.

185
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,580
B-O-B.

186
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,560
B-O-B.

187
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:26,700
B-O-B.

188
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,700


189
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,700


190
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,700


191
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,700


192
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:26,720
B-O-B.

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,820
Why won't you come back, Bob?

194
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,880
You were here last year.

195
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,440
Or was that the year before?

196
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,440
Oh, yeah.

197
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,180
That's right.

198
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,760
We tried to hunt him down and kill him.

199
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,520
And why?

200
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,300
Just because he murdered a few assholes and some bobbies.

201
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,600
Nobody needed.

202
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,460
He went off.

203
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,840
Come on back, old Bob.

204
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,620
Come on back, old Bob.

205
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,160
Old Bobby, come on.

206
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,240
Come on, come on, give us some slack.

207
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,020
Oh, shouldn't have said that.

208
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,300
Ask Bob to give you some slack.

209
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,280
He takes it right away.

210
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,620
Whatever you do, don't ask a sub-genius to do what you want.

211
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,620


212
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,620


213
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,780
You want it to do.

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Demand it to do the opposite of what you wanted it to do and it might get done.

215
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,820
I've heard more about bears this next day than ever in my life.

216
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
What does that have to do with anything?

217
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,380
Oh, yes.

218
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,420
Yes, yes.

219
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,920
Yes.

220
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I have old Bob.

221
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,260
B-O-B.

222
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,420
Bob on the brain.

223
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,060
Yes.

224
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:44,640


225
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,740
Big old brother is watching you.

226
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,540
B-O-B.

227
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
1-3-0.

228
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,300
1-3 spells Bob.

229
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,320
It don't make no sense, does it?

230
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,380
Well, that's because monsters like a demand would be around thee all about and the door

231
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,880
that should be locked will be open.

232
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,620
There will be signs in the heavens and signs in the heavens.

233
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,860
There will be signs in the earth.

234
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,600
Blood bounces from the earth.

235
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:27,260
The lights in the sky rebuke thee and science, thy sciences shall bring thee nought but devils.

236
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,220
See, it refuses to die.

237
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,200
It's started to die.

238
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,520
We thought it was going to die.

239
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,960
We were about to let it die.

240
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,400
We withdrew life support.

241
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,420
We un-plugged it.

242
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:54,680
We beat on it, we hit it, we thrashed it, we tried ignoring it, but it came back.

243
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,980
It refuses to die, it's on, it refuses to die.

244
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,320
It lives on, walks and trudges on, shuffling like a mummy.

245
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,340
We're one of those walkers in that show, Walkers for Trump.

246
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh God.

247
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,960
I knew about the damn Heliopters for the broke frat.

248
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,160
I knew about little the broke frat.

249
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,860
I knew about the Screamers.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,380
But I didn't, they didn't warn me about the song that refused to die.

251
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,240
No, no, no.

252
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,800
Put a stake through the heart mill, how about if you cut off its head and stuck garlic in its head's mouth

253
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,200
and pull its heart out.

254
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,740
Would silver bullets stop the song?

255
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,460
Could you electrify the song?

256
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,800
Could you use the oxygen remover that they used to kill Godzilla that first time?

257
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,080
Could the Cloverfield monster destroy the song?

258
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,320
Good luck on that, it's part of it.

259
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,260
What are we gonna do about the song that refused to die?

260
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,100
What are we gonna do about the bleeding man of world power for that great matter?

261
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,680
Hey, I know we can hit the drummer.

262
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,740
Yeah, hit the drummer.

263
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,640
That's a great idea, we'll use the drummer for a drum.

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,700
But then his screams would be part of the song that refused to die.

265
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,020
How about pills?

266
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,320
How about pills?

267
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,220
Maybe we can slow the song down with pills.

268
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,540
Anybody got any thoracy?

269
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,380
Wouldn't that slow it down?

270
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,620
No, that'd probably just get it excited.

271
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,260
It'd probably get behind the wheel of a car and start driving after down the highway.

272
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,360
That probably would happen to Pete.

273
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,920
Friends, when that song comes along, you're stunned, eh?

274
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,420
Because it refuses to die.

275
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,300
In fact, I bet my tightness that it refuses to die, so I'm gonna go up there and check it.

276
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,200
Thank you!

277
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
I have a saying, everybody.

278
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,180
I have a saying.

279
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,600
Never have a plot, please.

280
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,400
You'll also accept T-Bag and others who make love to you.

281
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,400


282
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,400


283
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,400


284
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,400


285
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,400


286
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,400


287
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,360
T-Bag and others who make love to you, you still can't tell me!

288
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,120
Woo!

289
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,460
Raise my hand!

290
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,560
Raise my hand!

291
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,200
Raise my hand!

292
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,280


293
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,960
Raise my hand!

294
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,320
Hey, say hi to the viewers.

295
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,500
Hello viewers of X-Ray number 4.

296
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,520
Hello viewers of X-Ray number 4.

297
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,560
Hello viewers of X-Ray number 4.

298
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,740
Bert?

299
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,380
Yes? Point the gun away from me.

300
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I'm not reading your scripted apology.

301
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,220
I'm not reading your scripted apology.

302
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,980
You're supposed to read signs.

303
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,520
I have a little thing called Principal.

304
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,700
I have a little thing called Principal.

305
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,800
You might want to try it sometime!

306
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
Where do you buy that at?

307
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,000
Where do you buy that at?

308
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,860
Fan number 1, unplug yourself.

309
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,140
Fan number 1, unplug yourself.

310
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,540
If you are our number 1 fan,

311
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:31,780
If you are our number 1 fan,

312
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,120
please unplug yourself now.

313
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,440
Are we waiting for Doug or are we just gonna fucking go?

314
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,380
Are we waiting for Doug or are we just gonna fucking go?

315
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,280
not going yet. I mean, we're good

316
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,880
when we go. No, show's cancelled.

317
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,600
Alright, everybody.

318
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,140
X Day's over.

319
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,740
You're all

320
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,320
effing fired. You're all free to

321
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,580
leave.

322
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,360
Except for you.

323
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,860
Except for Ivan Stang,

324
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,440
who has to account for his crime

325
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,780
here on

326
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,260
Let's Judge Your

327
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,460
Crimes, a copyright feature

328
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,880
of Thor's Euron Incorporated.

329
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,700
Please fire me!

330
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,100
You're fired!

331
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,220
Where's Donald Trump when I need him?

332
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Please fire me!

333
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,520
Oh, he'll be here and then we'll

334
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,960
all want to be fired.

335
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,320
You'll find a sliver in the locker room.

336
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,960
It's the color pink.

337
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,440
I think they're trying to tell us

338
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,160
something. You know what else is pink, animal?

339
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,000
They're trying to tell us something.

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
Hey, hey, you know what else

341
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,140
is pink? You know

342
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,020
what else is pink?

343
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
Drink it.

344
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,460
I'll tell you what's pink.

345
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,060
All the motherfuckers we're gonna kill

346
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,740
in a number... No, animal.

347
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,860
See, it was family friendly after all.

348
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,380
Well, as far as

349
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,600
UFO genocide

350
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,860
against the entire human race

351
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,620
can be, I suppose that's a

352
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,500
genocide. That's just quibbling.

353
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,100
At that point, you're really just kinda...

354
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,840
You've killed a lot of people and it's not gonna get better.

355
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,840
And it doesn't matter

356
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,260
what fancy words you put on it.

357
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
You're a damn ass murder.

358
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,660
You know, some people,

359
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,240
some people have arguably done worse.

360
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,620
What are they trying to tell us?

361
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,020
Some people are gonna vote for Donald Trump.

362
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,720
What are they trying to tell us?

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,020
Oh, but yeah, what's pink?

364
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,700
I just want to know what they're

365
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,800
trying to tell me!

366
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,600
Well, you shouldn't be wearing

367
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,020
the fucking, uh, the

368
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,040
aluminum helmets then.

369
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,180
You're blocking out all the brainwaves.

370
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,340
How are you gonna get...

371
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,680
Once again, pointed towards the keyboard.

372
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,640
You can just turn that away a bit.

373
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,340
Like so?

374
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,720
This is great for the folks

375
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,060
at home.

376
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,700
If you are our number one fan,

377
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,720
please demote yourself to

378
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,740
number seven.

379
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,760
No, number two.

380
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,800
You know who you are.

381
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,920
One last call

382
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,500
for fucking Frank

383
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,620
Flanagan

384
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,680
of Nevada.

385
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,740
I didn't want it to come

386
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,900
to this, peas,

387
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,340
but your dilettantesis

388
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,960
and absenteeism

389
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,320
and truancy

390
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,840
is not really working right now.

391
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,940
Oh, fuck, peas.

392
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,380
We know you like to show up

393
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,560
late and cause the best moments

394
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,160
of the party.

395
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,200
I don't care

396
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,560
about your daughter's

397
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,520
husband and child and if she has

398
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,700
to be back there.

399
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,660
They'll be there

400
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,220
tomorrow.

401
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,960
Hello, Reverend Peas!

402
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,640
You don't know me because

403
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,320
you've never met me before.

404
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,540
That's because I'm dead now.

405
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,020
Can we get a little more monitor?

406
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,520
When you were in third grade

407
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,020
and your mommy was driving you

408
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,520
to the peasatorium,

409
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,240
you said,

410
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,400
hey, look, an ice cream truck.

411
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,460
And that's when your mom

412
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,580
ran me over.

413
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,580
I just wanted to let you know

414
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,900
it's okay.

415
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,540
It's okay.

416
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,460
I was going to tell you

417
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,080
after X-Day, but I didn't.

418
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,640
We like ambient music.

419
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:10,860
Ambient.

420
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,880
Ambient.

421
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,100
Make it more ambient!

422
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,360
Yeah, it's a little in the moment right now.

423
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,840
I require ambience!

424
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,380
And I require it now!

425
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,520
Ambient?

426
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,120
No, ambient.

427
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,740
Oh!

428
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,520
Ambulance.

429
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,260
Ambulance.

430
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,120
Take an ice nap.

431
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,040
You're all drinking?

432
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,680
Yes.

433
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,620
You've got a perfectly good microphone

434
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,540
in front of your face, and no!

435
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,520
You choose the bottle.

436
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,620
You're recording this, right?

437
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,640
I mean, you're recording?

438
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,940
This is 2016,

439
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,920
the year of Zuckerberg.

440
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,760
I just assume everything is recorded.

441
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,840
Everything is on the editing floor.

442
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,260
We've got an obligation to these people

443
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,040
that are stupid enough to sit out here

444
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
and listen to us.

445
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,420
Well, there's a bunch over there that aren't,

446
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,180
but they can still hear us,

447
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,240
and we have an obligation to annoy them even further,

448
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,300
because they're not here!

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,860
This show goes out to everybody

450
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,940
who's not sitting in front of us,

451
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,180
because we're going to deal with you

452
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,280
with noise.

453
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,420
Of Scooby?

454
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,880
Of comedy noise.

455
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,860
I'm singing something less abstract.

456
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,700
That's because Scrappy was asking you.

457
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,180
Closer.

458
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Because there's no child left behind

459
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,160
happened right about the time.

460
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,520
And a little bit of music.

461
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,480
On top of that, yeah.

462
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,540
What's wearing pants?

463
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,200
You asked for a single scoop of...

464
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm going to throw one on top, on the house.

465
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,440
Donald Duck never wore pants either.

466
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Is everybody in a good mood tonight?

467
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,420
I think they're miserable, Sid,

468
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,380
and good riddance.

469
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,600
They came out to see Thor's In Urine,

470
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,320
and they should know what they're getting themselves into.

471
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,320
100 episodes of pure misery.

472
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,340
A pinky ring.

473
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,580
Always a pinky ring.

474
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,980
Who rented this audience?

475
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,400
As long as you have a pinky ring, you are fully dressed.

476
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,080
We need to go with another audience rental company next time.

477
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,800
Sorry, guys, I outsourced the Costco.

478
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,440
I was thinking the buy-and-buy would save us money.

479
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,920
Were you guys doing anything over there the whole time?

480
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,740
We were doing our thing.

481
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,060
What thing?

482
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,640
You apologized for that sound you made

483
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,400
with your machine body, young man.

484
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,060
Stay confused.

485
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,880
You're doing it again?

486
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,180
What is this shit?

487
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,940
I don't know what's going on.

488
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,560
Do you?

489
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,400
I can't hear anything.

490
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,480
It sounds like a computer working its way up

491
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,300
to a really expensive orgasm.

492
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,300
Maybe we should switch seats

493
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,020
so you can see me and I can hear you.

494
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,480
Anna!

495
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,380
Anna!

496
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,060
Help!

497
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,380
Oh, shit.

498
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,220
Ladies and gentlemen,

499
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,180
the sound of a touch-tone telephone

500
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,100
having an orgasm.

501
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,660
Oh, no.

502
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,560
You heard it here.

503
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,140
Did I?

504
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,300
Did I?

505
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,500
Did I?

506
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,160
Oh, my.

507
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,820
Viewers at home back in television land,

508
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,960
look away, children.

509
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,100
There's about to be some...

510
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,220
some of that.

511
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,480
As you can see,

512
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,580
the traditional X-Day mating dance

513
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,540
continues on as it does every year before,

514
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,420
so I've been told.

515
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,600
Is that a gluten-free

516
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,980
physical exchange?

517
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,220
Because...

518
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,620
I'm not sure.

519
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,860
Come on!

520
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,340
Sibilants!

521
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,140
Sibilants!

522
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,320
Sibilants!

523
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,460
It's called cellular mitosis.

524
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,460
That's just the first stage.

525
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,720
You're making that up.

526
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,120
Backwards bob on the...

527
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,860
Those aren't even...

528
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,940
Science is a lie!

529
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,460
Where's AML?

530
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,300
What?

531
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
Yeah, what are you doing?

532
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,040
Bam!

533
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,400
You sick clown!

534
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,100
Yeah!

535
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:22,840
All right.

536
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,440
Okay.

537
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,520
Um...

538
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,000
When you come to Wisteria to use the Wi-Fi,

539
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,280
you have to...

540
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,400
I think you have to pay ten bucks.

541
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,280
And you...

542
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,500
This is a...

543
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:33,500


544
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:33,520
This is a...

545
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,280
This is not made clear in the forehead to some of us.

546
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:36,900
You get a ticket, right?

547
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,580
You get a ticket with a code number

548
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,120
that allows you to use the Wi-Fi.

549
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,100
Like at a motel.

550
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,020
If you stay at a motel, same kind of thing.

551
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,540
Well, my code number, the first...

552
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,680
I had...

553
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,600
Actually, I had to get three tickets,

554
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
so I had three devices.

555
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,320
But the first one I got had the number

556
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,300
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

557
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,380
and then dash...

558
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,240
one, three, two, one, three.

559
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,660
That was the little ticket I got.

560
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,320
One, three, two, one, three.

561
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,060
Did you put it on your tongue, that ticket?

562
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,080
Now, you know, if it was one, three, oh, one, three,

563
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,960
it would spell Bob.

564
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,400
As it is, it spells Batuba.

565
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,740
Or something.

566
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,180
If a worm's way becomes bees,

567
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,580
then it's Batuba.

568
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,880
But it's close.

569
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,520
It's like X-Day itself, so close.

570
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,560
And yet, so far away.

571
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,700
But so close.

572
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,260
I got a ticket!

573
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,500
Death looms every second.

574
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,520
I love this earth.

575
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,760
Did you have a ticket?

576
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,020
Yeah, but it should have a sacred number.

577
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,900
I don't know!

578
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,400
The other one's like that one.

579
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,160
47418.

580
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,000
That's almost our P.O. box.

581
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,720
Or our zip code or something.

582
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,540
I don't know.

583
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,300
I really haven't looked at it much yet.

584
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:50,780
What are you doing?

585
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
It's numerologically significant.

586
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,440
What did you do here?

587
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,680
Yeah, it's 66666, right?

588
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,420
Right.

589
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,260
What a coincidence.

590
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,380
99999.

591
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,660
That's almost 10.

592
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:11,780
1301303010...

593
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,880
Numbers can be magic.

594
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,140
Yes.

595
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,620
I don't believe that, actually.

596
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,880
But it's really fun to get a ticket that spells Bob in numerals.

597
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,620
Numbers can be fun.

598
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,680
I used to say, you know, Reverend 80 is only two-thirds of the man that I know.

599
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


600
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


601
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


602
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


603
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


604
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


605
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


606
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


607
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


608
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


609
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,680


610
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,500
But it depends on how much of a math freak you are.

611
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,520
Well, Doc Kosmak pointed out that actually if you do the math, he's less than one-tenth

612
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,260
of the man that Reverend 808 is, if you do 80 to 808.

613
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,280
So, you know, I was overestimating Reverend 80, apparently.

614
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,900
I was giving too much credit.

615
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,980
I was giving him two-thirds of Reverend 808.

616
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,800
Kosmak knocked him back all that much further.

617
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,660
That's a good point.

618
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:02,660


619
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:02,660


620
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,460
One is the loneliest number.

621
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,240
80 is 80 times more popular than one.

622
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,100
That's not really a question.

623
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,060
808, well, his name kind of spells Bob.

624
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:14,960
Kind of.

625
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,460
Is it 808 or 808?

626
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,640
If I was to ask...

627
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,500
Well, you know what?

628
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,760
I mean, I don't know that.

629
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,660
It could be either one.

630
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,440
And I've had to fill out part of his marriage license.

631
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,380
808 or 808.

632
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,960
Man, you know, if I did it wrong...

633
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,640
If I did it wrong...

634
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,820
If I drew that O and meant the wrong O...

635
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,440
Oh my God.

636
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,300
Or zero, that means they're still living in sin.

637
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,520
Giggle Puss and 808 are not really legally married.

638
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,500
And that's like...

639
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,740
I think we've got some work to do, Reverend Seng.

640
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,240
This looks like a job for Reverend Ivan Seng.

641
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,060
33278.

642
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,940
That doesn't...

643
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,720
It's...

644
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,540
It's got the 27 at 273.

645
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,520
Yeah, it does have 273.

646
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
That's a sacred bond.

647
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,840
That's the...

648
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,140
You know how the Discordians think 23 is so important?

649
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,480
Oh man, you're going to find a 23 every 23 things.

650
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,500
It's a lot harder to find a 273.

651
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,020
That's a really special number.

652
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,340
Yeah.

653
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,760
By the way, I should give credit to St. Byron Warner for identifying that number as

654
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,600
the number.

655
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,640
You see, it has 327 in it, which is almost the same number as the number in the original

656
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,640


657
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,640


658
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,640


659
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,640


660
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,640


661
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,180
book.

662
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,560
I mean, it's the number that's the number.

663
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:34,560


664
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,020
You see, it's there.

665
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:36,980
Right.

666
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,180
It's like the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

667
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,040
Because it's so random, that's why it's so important.

668
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,040
The stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.

669
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,000
Which, that would make me really important.

670
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,440
The stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.

671
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,380
How is he there?

672
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,460
How's Mary on the tank?

673
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,160
How's Mary on the tank?

674
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,480
No, I'm not a stupider.

675
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,560
I am a real important because I'm so stupid.

676
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:14,540
Well, look at the presidential election, Stan, we've been just a caveman and not the

677
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:26,340
Neanderthal, just a cave cromaggon, a weakling compared to the mighty Neanderthal or more

678
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,500
popular than Neanderthal.

679
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,760
Mm, yeah.

680
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,820
You've got to get it right.

681
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,660
My God!

682
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,140
All right.

683
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,140


684
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,140


685
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

686
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,080
As we listen to the lilting strains

687
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,880
of Reverend Jimmy Ryan's melodic piece.

688
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,720
Called Almighty.

689
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,060
I'll give you some credits.

690
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,120
I'll give you credit for putting up with this show for this long.

691
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,880
Let's see.

692
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,100
The band that was playing in the background

693
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,400
on the song that refused to die at 19X Day.

694
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,960
I think that was Lord Ferg on bass.

695
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,940
Reverend Hazel of the Windmills on guitar.

696
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,380
Joe Goth might have been on guitar.

697
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,820
And I'm guessing that was Reverend Cosmack on keyboards.

698
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,380
Now, when it turned into this,

699
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,700
The Yelling People,

700
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,780
that was Thorazine Urine Podcrust,

701
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,220
which is a podcrust of sorts.

702
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,440
And here they are in the background again.

703
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,660
It's the X-Day band playing.

704
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,640
The podcrust that night,

705
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,900
I think it was Saturday night,

706
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,140
at 8 p.m.,

707
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,140


708
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,140


709
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,140
was Reverend Fid Schooley,

710
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,640
Reverend Anna Maul,

711
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,080
Dr. Shoggoth,

712
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,340
A.P. O'Stacey Fnord,

713
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,940
Reverend Baby Bear,

714
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,100
Reverend Cosmack,

715
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,980
and I don't know who all else.

716
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,940
This material is all from the early days

717
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,740
in the festival

718
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,120
before Reverend Angry Larry got here.

719
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,420
Lovely.

720
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,140
The books of excrement,

721
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,840
leviation, mumbles, and dermatology

722
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,600
summarize Bob's deliverance from boredom

723
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,580
and his 40-year stay in the wilderness.

724
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,580
Bob rebelled and sought frop

725
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,260
to make his mind explode.

726
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,880
But then the evil anti-Bob

727
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,040
destroyed the frop crops

728
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,620
and Bob was sad.

729
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,040
Bob endured and forgave the evil.

730
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:14,440
anti-Bob who had kidnapped Connie and was busy with her until her poor behind was

731
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,000
sore. Bob enlisted the help of the Yeti Bob, the underwater Bob, and Bob from

732
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,000
another time to help him attack the evil anti-Bob's domain and free the captive

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,020
Connie. When the Bobs, the various Bobs, managed to disrupt the attention of the

734
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:39,420
anti-Bob and wrench Connie from his grasp, they escaped in the magic giant

735
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:46,460
pea pod loaned to them by the wizard Bob. Because of this, Maleklips the Younger

736
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:53,080
was told by Bob to, from now on, number all the males in Karma Land according to

737
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,860
the Discordium system of fives. And the total

738
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,020
of these was six hundred and three thousand five hundred fifty men over the

739
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:09,280
age of puberty. The Leviators are numbered by themselves, every male from a

740
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,960
month old and upward. And thou, Hercules, shall appoint the Leviators over the

741
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,300
Mormon Tabernacle Choir and over the vessels thereof, and all things that

742
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:26,400
pertain to it, and shall encamp round about the Tabernacle.

743
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:26,840
And the rest shall be in the camp of the Tabernacle, and shall be in the camp of the Tabernacle.

744
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:34,180
And they shall sing and dance with the Tabernacle for forty years. And Bob spoke to Hercules,

745
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,500
saying, Take the Leviators instead of all the firstborn among all the children of Karma

746
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,860
Land, and the cattle of the Leviators, which means priests, instead of Karma Land's cattle,

747
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:54,200
and the Leviators shall be mine. The total number of Leviators was twenty-two thousand,

748
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,820
and there were more of the firstborn among all the children of Karma Land. And the total number of

749
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,060
Leviator's allowed for the fourth generation of the Macedonians.

750
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,640
And they were,"

751
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,460
Andeki quite Tes ringing too dry a month his hips, the mixing-room was around the

752
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,420
I Pear got 십

753
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,640
over.

754
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,820
Here there were no I and Hercules, lips Feuling rose and a cross fell on смог

755
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,520
a broken mouth, as in the image of creation.

756
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,800
These signify a kick in what was the táaku, the before funcioning conception.

757
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,560
Divide by 1,000 and add 2.

758
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:37,420
Calculate your income from line 6 of your tax return and add 20%.

759
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,660
Whichever amount is higher is your amount claimable for a tax credit.

760
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:52,000
Imagine you're on a train going 500 miles an hour and another train heading in the same direction at 650 miles per hour.

761
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,820
Which train will arrive at the preconceived destination first?

762
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:04,240
Sparky and Hercules shook their heads and answered nay, for both trains will collide and be destroyed.

763
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:11,320
Therefore, your tax credit return will be in indirect proportion to the amount of insurance money you receive from the government.

764
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,500
And of course, this was correct.

765
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:21,320
Bob knew he could not fool his two most trusted apostles, so Bob spoke to Hercules and Sparky saying,

766
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,840
Take a table and spread upon it beaver skins.

767
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,800
And then,

768
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:32,180
Put upon that the dishes, spoons, bowls, and spread them on a cloth of violet.

769
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:51,340
Cover the cloth with candlesticks, incense, bowls of soup, hashish and hash pipes, sacred frop, jugs of wine, pornography, and foodstuffs like, um, curries and rice and tasty bread and Peking duck and you know, stuff like that.

770
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,660
And then invite over a whole bunch of subgenii.

771
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,000
And the discordians alike.

772
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,940
And get a good band, like the scrotal twang machine or something.

773
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,920
And have a big party.

774
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,580
And get really messed up and like have a big orgy or something.

775
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,400
And they did.

776
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,880
They had a most excellent party and towards the end, Bob appeared to them with pip in hand.

777
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,940
I think that's probably meant to say pipe.

778
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,420
In hand and spoke to the congregation.

779
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:24,640
The law of the subgenius and discordianism alike has made us free from law and power of the anti-pip.

780
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,960
Yeah, so stubbornly had to provide the

781
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,060
rust�지 and the

782
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,240
and it could've been just a conversation with a little voice like.

783
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,360
aыш

784
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,360


785
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
And Kay

786
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,300
So I'm going to begin with my Yeshua.

787
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,300


788
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:44,260
The derfuch war is up there and everything just Dor geschwe.

789
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:01,660
The end. Bob the Slackness is coming back to redeem, receive his purchased possession.

790
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,440
Are you one?

791
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,340
And friends, I didn't really expect to read that whole thing.

792
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,060
But the blinky light didn't blink.

793
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
There has been no blinky light of Dave.

794
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,120
The funny thing is this was in a zine I found in a box in our garage.

795
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:33,840
A box of stuff I had not sorted in 1994 when this box accumulated.

796
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:39,100
And apparently this was written by Pope Armikurit III.

797
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:47,200
And it's in a zine called The Discordian Life and Reality Examiner No. 1.

798
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,380
Which is a fad.

799
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,980
A free thing.

800
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,220
And Dave is a free man, finally.

801
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,260
Who's a free man?

802
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,560
You. You're free of not being on the phone with this radio station.

803
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,380
I'm free of not being on the phone?

804
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,540
Well, that does make sense in a rather oblique way.

805
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,220
Do you mind if I use a semi-big word?

806
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,900
It's not the same as obstruction, which we all have in our bowel movements.

807
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,380
Obliquity?

808
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,180
Yeah, that's obliquely.

809
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,380
Obliquely?

810
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,140
Obligato, senor.

811
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,280
Obliquity.

812
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,780
Obliquity clack.

813
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:23,760
A-ha.

814
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,400
A-ha.

815
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:24,960
A-ha.

816
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,520
So I was just noticing what interesting times we live in.

817
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,020
Yeah, I was noticing that curse, too.

818
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,720
It's very sad.

819
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,440
It is very sad.

820
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,040
In fact, tonight is the end of an era, Dave, in the city of DNA level C.

821
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,460
There will be no more Barking Spider Tavern.

822
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,820
It has closed.

823
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,740
The Barking Spider closed?

824
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,320
Yes, it has closed.

825
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,620
It was a very sad, very sad thing.

826
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,500
Well, these eateries and bars do close.

827
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,260
Remember, the Euclid Tavern went down.

828
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,720
Everybody thought, there goes the Euclid Tavern.

829
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,180
They're one of the places that would let us play.

830
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,200
Yeah.

831
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,560
Oh, there's lots of places that would let us play.

832
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,660
They beg us to play, but man.

833
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,180
They spelled after the gig.

834
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,420
The day I do another, the day I set up another one of those things, you'll know that I've run out of money.

835
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,460
Or that you've lost your mind completely.

836
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,100
Right.

837
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
Well, that wouldn't.

838
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,160
Much easier, I would think.

839
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:33,800
Well, I don't know.

840
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,300
You can go broke or go insane quickly.

841
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,120
Why not both?

842
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
Why not both?

843
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,320
Yeah, and that would be real uncomfortable.

844
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,900
That would be more uncomfortable than having packed stools and arguments with your neighbors.

845
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,160
Just think of.

846
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:55,780
You wouldn't even know you no longer had any money, and yet you would try to interact as a person normally would.

847
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,560
And you'd be disemboweled by everyone.

848
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,460
Wow.

849
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,260
Dave.

850
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,540
Did you hear what Dave's voice did just then?

851
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,460
How did he do that?

852
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,460
I think he disappeared.

853
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,780
He transmogrified, it sounded like.

854
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:08,900
To what?

855
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:09,780
Oh, no.

856
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,140
He's back again.

857
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:11,860
Your voice.

858
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,680
It just digitized out.

859
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,720
When I send you the CD, you'll hear it.

860
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,500
You'll hear it.

861
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:17,720
You'll hear it.

862
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:17,940
You'll hear it.

863
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,140
You'll hear it.

864
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,140


865
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,140


866
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,140


867
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,140


868
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,140


869
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,260
I know.

870
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,560
I lost and vanished.

871
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,600
Kind of like that.

872
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,920
I love when that happens, when you digitize.

873
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,320
What do they call that?

874
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,200
Bad humbugs?

875
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,320
Satellite bounce back.

876
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't know.

877
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,680
Satellite bounce.

878
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,280
Yeah.

879
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,180
That's the name I remember.

880
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,840
These modern times are much scarier for some people than they are for others.

881
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,080
I just read the saddest article about a little old man, but two years younger than I am,

882
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:55,800
who won't go to Walmart for his diet soda pop and his cigarettes unless he's carrying an automatic weapon with him.

883
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:02,660
Because he's so certain that terrorists will attack a place with a lot of crowds.

884
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,640
Like a Walmart.

885
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:07,020
Like his little town Walmart.

886
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:16,060
And they specifically have all the thousands of little town Walmarts will notice that he's the one who's carrying the gun and waiting for them.

887
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:22,240
Well, what was so sad about it, his wife thought he was nuts, but kind of put up with it.

888
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,800
And everybody in town thought he was nuts.

889
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,360
Of course, the police had been called in every time he went to Walmart with his gun.

890
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,680
But that's not illegal.

891
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,700
It just bothered everyone.

892
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
Here's the really sad part.

893
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,520
This guy was perfectly normal.

894
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,120
And not afraid.

895
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,940
Until a bunch of bad things happened to him.

896
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,980
Didn't have anything to do with terrorists or crime.

897
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:55,520
It was that he had told his wife she could quit her job and he could support her with his trucking job.

898
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,880
But then they fired him.

899
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:04,280
And then his cigarette smoking got to him and he suddenly had bills, bills, bills.

900
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,360
And he filed for bankruptcy three times and had to move into a crappier neighborhood.

901
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,620
And in the course of...

902
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,760
And he got to where he couldn't...

903
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,640
Hardly walk.

904
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:24,440
He had to use one of those little carts when he went shopping for soda and cigarettes at Walmart with his gun.

905
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,200
They call it a urinary caveat.

906
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:33,240
It means that you might have to actually extricate yourself as you're waiting by the pharmacy.

907
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:45,220
Well, the sad thing is, is that obviously what made this guy become terrified of terrorists suddenly attacking him because Walmart is a crowded place.

908
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,880
And that really started when his personal luck went south.

909
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,760
His smoking and drinking and bad planning and bad luck kind of caught up with him.

910
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:06,000
And that was what made him decide he had to have more control over his life.

911
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:15,020
And the need for control took the form of terror of the others coming to Walmart.

912
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,820
And...

913
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,040
And...

914
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,700
Having weapons in there and using them.

915
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,640
So...

916
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,000
I think it's part of all very symptomatic of an overall release.

917
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,180
A negative thing that's going on in the country.

918
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,240
I don't know if anybody's ever read the thesis.

919
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,460
It was turned into a book called Wisconsin Death Trip.

920
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:46,020
When Bill and me age a period of time in American history in the 1890s or early 1900s when certain parts of the country appeared to just completely go berserk.

921
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,020


922
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,640
crazy. But I know in my job, I occasionally look at police blotters. And there was a man

923
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,560
at one of these restaurants. Should I say the name? I'm not. I shouldn't say the name.

924
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,940
Apple Boners or something like that. And they got into a political argument about Donald

925
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:11,540
Trump and Becky Wisewell, whatever her name is. Mrs. Cloutier. That's her name. Betty,

926
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:21,880
you know, the killer, the killer robot, the robot and the Trumpster. And he showed that

927
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:27,320
he was, quote unquote, packing. He was going to apparently shoot a person who was in a

928
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,780
political district. And you know which side he was thinking that that was going to make

929
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,720
the world better by shooting some liberal that disagreed with him.

930
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,300
Maybe our Second Amendment people know what to do about that. They ought to just disarm

931
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,320
her. Secret.

932
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,640
We'll see what happens.

933
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,240
But it seems like a cataclysmic orifice. It seems like it's just so prevalent in our nation

934
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,480
today that these people, their lives go south and they blame it on the people like the radio

935
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,660
tells them to blame it on.

936
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,520
Right. Exactly.

937
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,700
Jays.

938
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,200
Yeah. Yep. It's all everybody else's fault. And it's funny, you know, because they'll

939
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,240
say over and over again, you stupid libtards can't do anything but lie and insult people

940
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,220
with stupid insults.

941
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,560
And why?

942
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,300
And why?

943
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:22,500
And you lie. And meanwhile, if you look into the things they're saying about the evil

944
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,860
robot, it turns out none of it is actually true. And when you look into the things about

945
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:33,880
the evil orangutan, it turns out all of it's true. And in fact, there's a lot more worse

946
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,920
stuff bubbling under the surface.

947
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,700
It's strange, isn't it?

948
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,520
Yes, it is a little strange. But again, I have to say, I don't think it's a good thing.

949
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,940
I have to say, the difference between everybody going crazy in 1870 and people going crazy

950
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:56,820
in 2017 is that the internet. It's contagious insanity. They can supplement each other's

951
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:03,700
fairytale existence. Now, this is true of any person. You know, a libtard can live in

952
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:11,500
a libtard bubble. I happen to spend more time in the right wing bubble because when I was

953
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,100
I'm always interested.

954
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,340
It never ceases to amaze me.

955
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,200
Well, it's kind of like when I used to study cults.

956
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,560
It's amazing what people will want to believe.

957
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:30,040
My dad used to say, I believe what I need to believe.

958
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,300
And I'm like, wow, that's pretty serious and honest.

959
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,760
That's the human condition.

960
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,040
We all do that.

961
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:57,020
But some people are more afraid and need to believe in some sort of power of their gun and some other big man, be it Howard Stern or Donald Trump or some preacher like Reverend Ivan Stang that's going to tell them what to do.

962
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,320
It's because they screwed up.

963
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,460
They picked the wrong path in life.

964
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,700
They had chose bad lifestyles.

965
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,460
Working crappy jobs.

966
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,100
Not educating themselves.

967
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,580
Not exercising.

968
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,840
Poisoning themselves because it tastes better.

969
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:28,580
And now they're mad at everybody who doesn't look obese and smell like an ashtray and fly a great big flag.

970
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:35,360
Because anybody who doesn't fly a great big flag and carry a gun must be anti-American.

971
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,320
They can't.

972
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,140
They're not just unpatriotic.

973
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,940
They're evil.

974
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:40,720
Communist.

975
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,400
Museline.

976
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,280
Nazi.

977
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,360
Deplorables.

978
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,520
Oh, no, no, we're not.

979
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,340
We're not the deplorables.

980
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,680
We're the admirables.

981
00:45:48,960 --> 00:46:00,440
I always wondered, you know, I've seen these people wander into the office of the place where I work and stuff and go through these Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde changes over the liberal media.

982
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,460
They'll start laughing.

983
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,160
And then they'll get real mad like they're going to kill.

984
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,480
They'll kill everybody and stuff like that.

985
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,600
Like in their faces get red and they freak out.

986
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,320
And it's usually people that they appear to be like in their early 70s.

987
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:22,460
And by liberal media, they mean the ordinary, everyday, normal news shows that actually carry some level of news.

988
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,900
Yeah, which tries to be or at least have a reputation of being fair.

989
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:34,180
Nobody wants to be branded as a liberal or conservative media except for those few places who are making an awful lot of money by saying that.

990
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,720
Right.

991
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:45,840
And it is a good way to make money is to just tell people what they most want to hear and deny them the stuff that might make them uncomfortable.

992
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:46,960
Yeah.

993
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:54,360
We've had numerous times just recently where like the people at the front desk go, should I push the panic button?

994
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,300
The panic button means it goes directly to the police and says, come on over quick.

995
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,020
There's one of these weirdos here and stuff.

996
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,740
Oh, you mean at your office?

997
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:03,880
Yes.

998
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,220
Because it's part of the media.

999
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,640
Yes.

1000
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,140
Evidently, heroin has become a really big, bad problem again all over everywhere.

1001
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,040
Well, no, it's a much bigger problem among the poor.

1002
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,260
And the miserable.

1003
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,720
And there's a lot.

1004
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:52,440
Actually, there aren't more of them, but they're more empowered to feel like life is unfair and therefore they should take heroin, listen to Rush, take more of Rush's heroin and vote for Donald Trump.

1005
00:47:52,580 --> 00:48:02,940
Because that gives them the feeling of power that they lost when they sat on their butts for most of their lives and lost the ability to.

1006
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:12,080
Get a job, walk all the way into Walmart and across the store and back to their car without a little motorized cart.

1007
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,560
And I don't know, man.

1008
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,220
I just see.

1009
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,460
You see the death of a civilization, if you want to call it.

1010
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,360
To me, it's from laziness.

1011
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,680
They're dying of laziness.

1012
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:31,700
They're dying of the unwillingness to improve their own lot by educating themselves.

1013
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,700
By maybe looking at the stuff that makes them uncomfortable.

1014
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,540
Well, you must remember that the medium, the media, the various different mediums, the media.

1015
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,080
Yeah, like we're on now.

1016
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,820
Like we're on now.

1017
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,140
Like you get paid by.

1018
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:52,420
Some of the stuff that is true about neo-McCloughanism, I know you like to bash McLoughan over the skull.

1019
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,180
I don't care about McLoughan.

1020
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,920
Like with other religious cults, it's his followers that bother me.

1021
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:01,660
Well, what?

1022
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:06,700
What's commonly believed now in communications is neo-McCloughanism.

1023
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,420
There's all kinds of neo stuff there and everything like that.

1024
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:16,760
But basically, the idea is that there are hot mediums, warm mediums, cold mediums and cool mediums.

1025
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,360
And they all have a different function in making people believe stuff.

1026
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,820
Hot medium of AM radio makes people very angry.

1027
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,680
The cool medium of television co-ops reality in such a way that you see something on television.

1028
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,280
And you believe that somehow you were there when it happened and you are an eyewitness.

1029
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,200
Even though it's just a bunch of footage that some idiot probably made up.

1030
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,880
Right.

1031
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,920
Yeah.

1032
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,680
On television, it goes by fast and you can't stop and think about what you're reading because you're not reading.

1033
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,480
That's why I don't watch TV news.

1034
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:59,180
I probably mispronounce a lot of names of places because I only read it.

1035
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,680
Because that gives my...

1036
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:07,720
It gives my brain time to say, is this an opinion or a fact being stated?

1037
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,120
And didn't they just leave a word out of that sentence?

1038
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,240
You know?

1039
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:13,600
Yeah.

1040
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:22,440
But how many people are really going to be that inclined to use their brain to analyze everything that they're reading?

1041
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,920
Most of them aren't reading.

1042
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,440
You don't have to lately, you know?

1043
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,700
You don't really have to.

1044
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,040
All you have to do is just like reach into your pocket and grab your app, your phone.

1045
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,460
Or whatever and stuff.

1046
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:35,400
And instead of researching something that's going to make you smarter,

1047
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,180
they can go and talk to some other idiots like themselves who want to kill everybody.

1048
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,720
Well, now see, I spend a lot of my time reading the websites of the people who want to kill me.

1049
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,520
I spend a lot of time reading what I would call the opposition.

1050
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,360
Probably a lot more...

1051
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,320
You get this, Dave.

1052
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,820
I've never watched The Daily Show.

1053
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,900
Not once.

1054
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,680
I've never seen a Steve...

1055
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,820
Even Colbert show.

1056
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,360
I've never watched MSNBC for very long.

1057
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,760
But I look at Breitbart and Drudge Report every day.

1058
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,080
And I've been interested...

1059
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,400
It's been very interesting to see what they don't even talk about on those things.

1060
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:20,740
Right.

1061
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,180
As opposed to what they...

1062
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,800
What they don't talk about.

1063
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,040
Right.

1064
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,680
As opposed to what they hammer and hammer and hammer at.

1065
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,620
Which largely appears to me like paranoid.

1066
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,820
Paranoid fairy tales.

1067
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,900
Except that around half of the people in the country love paranoid fairy tales now.

1068
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:47,980
Now, I happen to be one of those lucky people that has a life.

1069
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:50,660
I'm actually a pretty happy guy.

1070
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,200
I'm not afraid.

1071
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,560
If things go bad for me, I can change my situation.

1072
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,980
But not everybody feels that way.

1073
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,460
Well, you can't necessarily blame them for feeling that way.

1074
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:11,980
They no longer have the opportunity to know how to embolden them.

1075
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,280
To engender.

1076
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,780
To, you know, make things happen for themselves.

1077
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,340
Right.

1078
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,060
They've been working that assembly line job or that trucking job their whole lives.

1079
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,600
And they can't imagine learning to do anything else.

1080
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,140
I wouldn't blame it on that.

1081
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,900
I would blame it on the media itself as an evil tool of avarice and vice.

1082
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,600
And a bunch of other...

1083
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,460
Nasty words.

1084
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,540
Well, it's half advertising.

1085
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,780
So, duh.

1086
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,680
Yeah.

1087
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:45,360
Somebody asked me how come the subgenius stuff on the internet isn't monetized.

1088
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,340
You can watch our videos for free.

1089
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,180
You can listen to the Hour of Slack for free.

1090
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,860
Anytime you want.

1091
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,800
Anywhere in the world.

1092
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,340
If you've got the little machine.

1093
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:59,320
And they said, why aren't you running ads and monetizing this?

1094
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,940
And my simple answer was...

1095
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,160
I hate ads.

1096
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,920
I used to make ads.

1097
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,720
I used to be a film guy that made TV commercials.

1098
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,600
Me too.

1099
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,220
And I know how all of that stuff works.

1100
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,440
I've worked in the media.

1101
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,080
I'm in the free media right now.

1102
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,820
Praise college radio.

1103
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,260
Praise college radio.

1104
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,120
It's the only real radio left.

1105
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,000
Everything else is practically...

1106
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,300
It's either that monopoly of right-wing AM talk shows.

1107
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,240
Or...

1108
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,460
In the liberal control media.

1109
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,240
Isn't that funny?

1110
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,600
And yet all the talk shows are conservative.

1111
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,380
Go figure.

1112
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,780
Yeah, you can just go from one end to the other.

1113
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,880
Big stations.

1114
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,040
Obviously not...

1115
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,620
Again, college stations.

1116
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,600
We're not beholden to anyone.

1117
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,340
Or onto anything.

1118
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,180
And we don't have a lot of money.

1119
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,860
So we have to be careful about cussing.

1120
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,240
Even cussing.

1121
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,240
Yep.

1122
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,580
And just because...

1123
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,820
Cussing is the main thing.

1124
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,360
You could cuss like a sea dog

1125
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,080
on a regular one of those big AM or FM stations and everything.

1126
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,900
Because you know why?

1127
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:09,740
They got lawyers.

1128
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,700
Because your legal staff...

1129
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:10,960
Yeah.

1130
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,360
Yeah.

1131
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,520
Your legal staff has the wherewithal

1132
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,460
to...

1133
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,820
We'll pay this fine and we'll...

1134
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,280
You know, commit fellatio on the FCC...

1135
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,180
Or on the FAA...

1136
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:21,540
Or on the...

1137
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,040
You know...

1138
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,300
Right.

1139
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,140
That's like...

1140
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,560
Yeah.

1141
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,620
And whereas, you know, a small station...

1142
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,740
I said poo-poo on the air and all of a sudden...

1143
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,520
Well...

1144
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,200
Well...

1145
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,440
Well...

1146
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:37,440


1147
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:37,440


1148
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,020
I remember when they used to even...

1149
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,740
They used to orchestrate these little old lady...

1150
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,360
These little old lady letters.

1151
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,340
And many of these little old ladies didn't exist.

1152
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,760
Can you imagine what a corrupt society we live in?

1153
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,180
They want to get somebody off the air.

1154
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,680
They invent some little old ladies.

1155
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,640
So-and-so is definitely a so-and-so.

1156
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,900
And we don't need people like that on our airwaves.

1157
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,720
So we have...

1158
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,560
File concept.

1159
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,160
We had that problem in Dallas on the old station K-N-O-N.

1160
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,540
There were these religious people that really wanted that airwave bad.

1161
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,440
And they would...

1162
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,280
Well, they didn't really have to make up stories.

1163
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,220
But they did anyway.

1164
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:16,280
Yeah.

1165
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,860
Religious people are so honest.

1166
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,440
That's funny.

1167
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,340
A guy at K-N-O-N in Dallas recently told me...

1168
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,040
He used to...

1169
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,080
He was one of the...

1170
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,100
He's been with the station forever.

1171
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,640
Apparently, he used to...

1172
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,940
Tape the hour of slack.

1173
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,020
Now, this is back in the 80s, okay?

1174
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:40,800
And he just copied all of his tapes of old hours of slack onto MP3s

1175
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,200
and sent them to me on a thumb drive.

1176
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,720
Now, we had better copies of most of that stuff already online,

1177
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,560
but there's some that hasn't been copied.

1178
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,520
Anyway, the weird thing is, the guy said,

1179
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,940
well, if you're going to be in Texas a lot, which we are,

1180
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,380
he said, you could actually have your show back at K-N-O-N.

1181
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:58,860
Yeah.

1182
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,700
Wouldn't that be strange?

1183
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,940
That would be strange.

1184
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:02,300


1185
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,020
But I would have to drive to Dallas from Stangsville,

1186
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,680
which is like an hour and a half,

1187
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,620
every Sunday night.

1188
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,720
Or whenever.

1189
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,880
The funny thing is, at K-N-O-N, we were on a Sunday night at 9,

1190
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,580
and it was also 89.3.

1191
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,680
That was synchronistically spooky right there.

1192
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,220
Yeah, but then they changed hands and they kicked me

1193
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,000
and everybody else of a certain type.

1194
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,700
A certain type.

1195
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,480
Off of the station.

1196
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,940
And then that guy got fired, but it never got back to normal.

1197
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,120
And this hasn't been a very funny hour of slack, has it?

1198
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,660
No, I'm sorry.

1199
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,960
I complained so hardly.

1200
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:46,580
No, we're both worried about the zeitgeist.

1201
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,020
Well, the common device geist.

1202
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,040
I mean, the zeitgeist.

1203
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,460
And today, although it's outmoded in our technical time frame,

1204
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:00,700
there's a lot of people who are worried about the zeitgeist.

1205
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,980
There's many so-called suicidal terrorist acts.

1206
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,040
Act 3, Scene 5 was one of the worst.

1207
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,940
And I guess next we're going to be attacking Russian bases or something.

1208
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:15,580
I don't know.

1209
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:21,060
It seems like even the higher-ups, who are pretty lowbrow,

1210
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,900
pretty small-brained, have gone crazy, too.

1211
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,240
It's a bummer, man.

1212
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,520
It is a bummer.

1213
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,420
Bob said,

1214
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,200
It's going to be a bummer.

1215
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,440
True words were never...

1216
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,160
Well, true words actually have been spoken,

1217
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,480
but that's still very true.

1218
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,480
It's either true or it's untrue,

1219
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:46,020
but I love to hear myself say it's very true.

1220
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,800
Yes, that Bobby's so prophetic.

1221
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,840
Well, friends, this unfunny show has been hour of slack number 1,580.

1222
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,920
The show that refused to die.

1223
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,580
A retort.

1224
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,560
We're done September 18th of the year.

1225
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,760
The conspiracy likes to believe it's 2016,

1226
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,620
but we know it ain't even 1998 yet.

1227
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,060
Wish I knew when it was.

1228
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,040
Yeah, it seems each year it's not.

1229
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:28,060
So, anyway, for those who wonder about this Bob Dobbs subgenius church cult thing,

1230
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,780
Oh, oh, oh.

1231
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,760
It's subgenius.com.

1232
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,440
And all you have to do is know how to spell subgenius.

1233
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,780
It doesn't have an O in it.

1234
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,440
Believe it or not.

1235
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,680
But it smells like it does sometimes.

1236
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,420
It's better to fabricate the truth, you know?

1237
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:53,920
Then let's say, well, it's really spelled subgenio or something like that.

1238
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,820
It would be subgenious.

1239
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,400
It's not subgenious.

1240
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,820
It's subgenious.

1241
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,200
Subgenious.

1242
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,680
It's subgenious.

1243
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,420
Subgenious is.

1244
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:06,540
And now, Dave, I'm going to pot you down and pot you out because it's...

1245
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,340
Pot me up, man.

1246
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,420
It's the news.

1247
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,060
From PR News in Washington, I'm a lot tighter with certain customers in a green jumpsuit,

1248
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,780
