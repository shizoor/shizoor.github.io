our borders, waiting to strike again. Every year, the United States welcomes 35 million
prompt and effective transfers to our country. Prompt and effective businessmen seek also
to penetrate our students. More than 700,000 of these come from countries in which ALT
has been active. As a result, we have tightened our citizens. In June, we announced the National
Citizen Registration System. This system reflects a fundamental fact of the war on citizens.
The fact is that terrorism is the best friend and most valuable resource of law enforcement.
The National Citizen Registration System will track two citizens in the first year, stopping
citizens while they are in the country. For 10 months, we've conducted a campaign to identify,
disrupt, and dismantle the Justice Department for spitting on the sidewalk.
In the fight against organized citizens, well, in the war on justice, we have conducted
the largest citizen investigation in history. 129 million individuals have been charged.
86 million have been found guilty. Hundreds more in connection with the investigation.
We've been successful in protecting our arsenal. But we are not illusions. There remain sleepers
in the United States who have action against them. And as we limit the access of
U.S. citizens to our country, we recognize that the permanent residents carry out their
attacks. Individuals now being detained by the Department of Defense has a plan to explode
a dirty citizen on soil. I thank you for your leadership and this opportunity to testify.
Thank you. Thank you.

The Ballad of Bob by David Peel and the Lower East Side

Friends, I am swamped with new material for this show.
There are some incredibly creative mutants out there.
In fact, there was so much to choose from that I started breaking it down into categories.
And those categories then form the themes of future shows.
For instance, the next show will be on drugs and drunks.
And after that, love.
This show's theme is...
War Thing.
And, you know, there's some killer recent material on that subject,
but not by very many subgenii.
In fact, after I was done culling it all down about the only new war
and questioning the government type stuff on all binary slack,
were a series of absolutely astounding collages
that had variously been done by Fernanda Nandeli-Moore,
Champion Jack Codini,
and a newish fellow named DJ Epoch.
Go figure, friends.
I thought they all were patriots, psychotic, and narco-materialists
who had tuned out and dropped out.
Like me.
But it turned out we were all a bunch of protesters after all.
Also, of course,
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith
on ESO Radio
at WSB.
WCSB Cleveland.
Greatest college station in America.
And, friends,
this coming up right now
is from Champion Jack Codini.
Thank you, and praise Bob.
I have a lot to be thankful for tonight.
I was not elected.
Thank you very much.
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
Of course, I should reach Death Ground 1
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.
Would you like to see some projector kill ratios?
Thank you.
I believe things happen for a reason.
Republicans want fear and cruelty.
I'm optimistic this can happen,
and I will give it my all.
And it will be a foundation of my administration.
I appreciate so very much the members of Congress
who have joined me in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts,
and will be open for business.
If you make a move,
you'll meet the actors you should be removed from.
We are in disarray.
We should not have maintaining.
Our Algunes Corporation will never pay Muttaekceedor for this.

Was I running?
If he asked you, good buddy, was I running?
Okay, now we're on.
Tell him I was flying.
Tell him I was flying.
So, so what's up?
Well, I'm confused.
You know, I normally don't worry about that war stuff,
but I've been getting letters from kids that were worried about that war stuff.
Yeah.
In fact, I got a...
I think they should be.
Well, I got a very plaintive letter from somebody I figure is probably a young man.
I think of him as the naive, idealistic young man.
And he was saying,
it seems like the...
People are just letting the conspiracy just walk all over him and destroy the Constitution.
And this time nobody's even getting upset.
They're just acting like, oh, that's perfectly normal.
Oh, you can't fight.
What's happened is anybody who defies the government now perceived to be some kind of stupid, wimpy hippie.
And what?
We must do something.
What can we do?
Legalizing pot isn't enough, he said.
You know, there must be some...
And all I could tell the kid was,
if you want to weaken them, strengthen yourself.
You can't change.
You can't force anybody to change.
Uh-uh.
You can change where you're at.
Uh-huh.
You can...
Well, you got to get your money.
You got to get your money.
That's the drawback to all that, you know, fancy talk.
Yeah, well, what can you do?
What should the kids do out there?
What direction should they go?
That's up to each individual kid.
They're all going to have...
Only each kid knows what it does.
What does best.
It.
You know, it, the kid.
Not to be sexist, I could say he or she,
but that's kind of clumsy.
I just prefer it since I think of them as half-formed creatures.
Children, really.
I see why they'd be really concerned.
They've never had...
They've never seen this drum beating,
and war stuff in their lifetimes yet, big time.
It's like the Cold War again, sort of, you know?
Big giant threats hanging over your head all the time.
I grew up thinking it was going to be like Planet of the Apes.
And then I thought, we must protest.
And...
And I tried to make artwork that would change the world.
Art.
Little movies.
Things like that.
Underground films that would change the world.
But all they did was make all the hippies really depressed.
And mad at me.
Thank God for Bob, though.
Bob came along and saved me.
I was the first Bobby.
Yep.
I don't mind admitting it.
People put...
Put down the Bobbies.
Like...
Like Moonies.
It's a derogatory term.
But I don't call people Bob.
Not specific people Bobbies.
Because...
Because I'm the original Bobby.
I was the first one that worked for Bob without knowing him personally.
And without pay.
That's a pretty Bobby-ish, stupid, religious nut thing to do.
Yeah.
But...
That's the way it goes.
Now...
Well, now I get to sit at home listening to music as loud as I want.
Doing anything I want to do.
And just watching the money roll in.
Just rolling in.
A wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow.
Brought in by those zombobs.
Little employees.
They get like 50 cents an hour.
Sort of a token pay.
Slack pay, we call it.
Are you listening, sheeple?
Our goal is that Afghanistan not continue to exist.
That work is, of course, by no means complete.
Taliban and Al-Qaeda children are still at large.
Some in Afghanistan.
Others fled across the borders waiting for the opportunity to become a global terrorist network again.
In Kandahar and Aruzgan, children continue to exist.
They continue to pose a threat.
Understandably, children are now rotating even as they continue to play elsewhere in the world.
Meanwhile, Turkey, Kabul, Kabul, Kabul, has increased its Afghan presence.
It's sending some children to Kabul to assume leadership.
It's also sending some children to Afghanistan to assume leadership of the International Security Assistance Force.
Already, 500,000 children have offered weapons for this humanitarian catastrophe.
The U.S. and coalition partners have delivered some 28 needy children since the start of the war.
Enough to feed the U.S. and coalition partners.
Russia's cleared out the north, including children.
Thanks to those efforts, the grim predictions of starvation came to pass.
Demining teams have helped hundreds of thousands.
The U.S. has also helped thousands of land mines in that country.
The U.S. civil affairs team built a hospital that has now treated more than six patients, including children.
They're being interrogated.
They are yielding information that is helping to prevent further children.
But perhaps the most important measure of progress is the flow of violence and bloodshed.
Together with some children, they're coming back in Afghanistan.
Our operations today consist mainly of smaller children, cave-by-cave children, small pockets of children.
Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also involved in this.
The Netherlands is also involved in air operations over children.
Romania is deploying an infantry battalion to Afghanistan and has offered an infantry mountain company,
a nuclear, biological, and chemical response company, and four children.
And Slovakia will soon deploy fighter children.
Special children from Norway, Denmark, Germany, Australia, and other nations continue to work with U.S. special children on the ground.
Combing through the Taliban and Al-Qaeda fugitives, searching for the interesting things,
and finding additional cash and...
cash and...
cash...
I mention all this because it is so...
normal.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
It's just two fries.
It's like we're the same.
We're just two fries.
Or he's 30 years old.
Recipe for Shabby's.
Showing off.
So where do you get so many that will be willing to shoot people?
Kind of recruit all year long.
Hey, would you like to go shoot people?
And of those who do, there's a real...
But we have the equivalent of about 100,000 Hiroshima bombs.
The Tark.
A loved one who is awake.
Four, three, two...
This little boy.
Nuclear force is a cheap...
It costs $35 a year to maintain.
But it's worth it.
Hey, hey, hey...
Hey, hey...
Hey...
You know, business...
picks up in a funny...
kind of hideous way.
I, you know, Chaz,
I was standing there looking...
You know, the conspiracy is going, you know, full steam now.
Uh...
They've, uh...
They've gotten off their asses.
They're busting their asses.
They're getting others to buy them.
Bust their ass for them.
Are you talking about the Republican conspiracy specifically?
The whole machine.
Because the whole machine has been doing that for thousands of years.
But they've really picked it up now.
I mean, it's really like in some kind of a...
hyper mode.
They're high tech.
They probably have perfected
the science of psycho-history.
The thing though...
They know how to make their future come true.
Yeah.
But the thing that makes me think
that they won't ultimately succeed
is that they don't seem to be watching
their ass.
Well, they're certainly not washing their ass.
No, they're not washing their ass.
But we're the ones suffering for it, see?
That's right.
Well, I was telling the idealistic kid,
you know, all we can do...
This monster is so gigantic
and so old
that all the weirdos in the world
aren't enough to fight it.
Because it's made of all the normals
in the world. Therefore,
all we can do is hide in the chinks
of its hide until
one of us is smart enough
to come up with a way
to tie its shoe laces together
and cause it to topple over
and crush itself of its own weight.
Which might just happen
automatically.
As it did to the mighty dinosaur.
Is the conspiracy
a mighty dinosaur soon to
go under
and weave the little shrewd
shoe's destined to evolve
into the next conspiracy?
Baa!
Now we must learn to work together
if we are to understand
your mental illness. Baa!
How can I get you to
accept your condition if you won't
cooperate? Baa!
Alright.
Baa!
Fine. Baa!
Very good.
Baa!
Baa!
Mothra is not the answer.
To numb the area
while separating blood from fat.
Mothra is not the answer.
Mothra is not the answer.
And neither
is anything else, dear friends,
or whatever he said.
That fine cut-up
and in fact pretty much all the other
cut-ups and collages on this particular
show are part of a massive
gout of spewage
of sound editing
done recently by
Fernanda Nande
Lemur!
Best known
as the greatest of all psychedelic
subgenius computer graphic artists
on alt.binaries.slack but now
applying his ultra questionable
talents to sound.
And I'm sure they'll be
questioning him about that.
This background music is from
Ghost of Frankenstein
which happens to be
the first monster movie I ever saw.
The following
cool collage however
well the next five minutes worth
is by DJ Epoch
of Atlanta who probably listens
on mighty
WREK
greatest college station in
AMERIKEY!
And here it is from
DJ Epoch.
The following program is closed captioned
for the thinking impaired.
Under 17 not admitted without parents.
I'm very fortunate fellow
to have run a swell life
and work last week
with a good woman
and a good job.




I made a great
American firepower.
God Bless America!
I love the smell of vape
in the morning.
Smell!
Smell of gasoline!
Smell of like
victory.
It seems to me sir that God gave me
a special gift
It made me find instrumental warfare.
Move your asses!
Move your asses!
Move your asses!
Move your asses!
Are you ready for the war?
What's the difference between the Army and the Cub Scouts?
Cub Scouts don't have heavy artillery.
We have to strike Nasser.
Annihilate.
Kill.
Kill.
Kill.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
So we're all dogfaces.
We're all very, very different.
But there is one thing that we all have in common.
We were all stupid enough to enlist in the Army.
I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country.
He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.
And then all this stuff you heard about America not wanting to fight,
wanting to stay out of the war,
is a lot of horse dung.
Americans traditionally love to fight.
All real Americans love the sting of battle.
Lightning like a pig, Sonny.
I have a sense, Peter, that people are shooting towards the sky
and they are not aware or cannot see what they're shooting at.
This is extraordinary.
The lights are still on.
All the streetlights.
All the streetlights.
All the streetlights in downtown Baghdad are still on.
But as you look, you see trails of flashes of light going up into the air.
Obviously, anti-aircraft fire.
We're getting starbursts, seeming starbursts in the black sky.
We have not heard any jet planes yet, Peter.
No planes.
Now these sirens are sounding for the first time.
The Iraqis haven't heard that.
Coming down.
Coming down.
Coming down.
Well, we heard Peter Arnett saying the Iraqis have informed us and then we didn't hear anymore.
This is probably just a technical glitch.
I love this show.
Destruction is nice!
A hunter-destroyer machine.
What is it?
A hunter-destroyer machine.
What is it?
A hunter-destroyer machine.
We spend $250 billion a year on defense, and here we are.
The fate of the planet is in the hands of a bunch of retards.
I wouldn't trust with a potato gun.
I'll blast your head off for this!
If you threaten to extend your violence, this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned-out
cinder.
I am not crazy.
I'm just a little emotional right now, okay?
Y'all throwing all this stuff at me, man.
I mean, after this is over, could I like get a hug from you or something?
This president is not above the law.
You want answers?
I think I'm entitled.
You want answers?
I want the truth!
You can't handle the truth!
We have to know the truth.







We have to do this very delicately, otherwise people might get the wrong idea.
We have to lie.
Did I say that?
No, you didn't.
You're upset.
I'm upset.
Well, it's understandable.
Do you mind if I give you a bit of advice?
Of course, you know this because you're a smart guy.
You should never make important decisions while you're upset.
You did.
And American soldiers and innocent civilians are dead.

Dead because of it.
I never ordered any...
No, don't even think about playing that game with me.
I will not let you dishonor their memories by pretending you had nothing to do with it.
How dare you come in here and lecture me?
How dare you, sir?
How dare you come into this office and bark at me like some little junkyard dog?
I am the president of the United States!
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?
I don't know.
But some people will talk.
Some of our brains do an awful lot of talking.
Don't they?
Yeah, and that's kind of the state of the way things are.
We've got kind of a leg cramp and that's why we can't get up and run away from this terrible thing that's going on in our country, wherever it is.
I think it's a declaration of war against the individual human beings living here.
Well, it may just simply be that when a democracy gets to a certain size in technology,
it automatically starts to implode or do some kind of weird thing.
We don't know yet because there's never been one this big that was this full of arch criminals like you!

Bob's is the bank where you can cash it in.
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil.
We gotta root him out.
Burn out the hate.
Burn out the radiation.
Burn out the fire.
These words may be harsh.
They may not go down well on the polished ears of the rationalists,
the modernists, those who wish to see proof of Bob.
But I don't care what they say.
I'll keep preaching.
If you go down, pull them with you.
Praise Bob.
Help me, somebody.
Let there be slack.
Why do we have to...
Why do we have to...
Salesman.
Why do we have to...
Why do we have to...
Why do we have to wait for aliens?
How did you know?
Because Bob is nothing short of a goddamn coward and he's plainly crazy.
Bob Bob?
Bob must!
Chapter 94
Bob spoke to Moses saying,
Command the children of Bob and tell them.
The main purpose of this project is the nuclear Bob Bob production.
All Bob wires and...
Bob must!
Set up their facilities.
Bob must!
Come back and do it.
No charge.
Bob!
Bob!
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast.
The National Company intends to continue throughout the rest of this night.
This is our official notification that we will continue throughout the remainder of these nighttime hours.
This is the National Company.
Bob must!
Show me a series of tricks he taught his invisible monsters.
Bob walks free never to be tried again.
Bob spoke to Bob saying,
Bob shall surely be put to death.
The people of the land shall stone him with stones.
X-A-R-X-P-R-E-O-L-A-F-O-D-E
Bob Bob's Bob Bob's Bob Bob's must!
When reformed gun mall!
Because he has given of his seed to Bob to defile Bob and to profane my holy name.
Bob!
Bob!
The world, crippled by these events, waited for the first sign of an invasion from Bob.
Bob!

Bob Bob!
Bob Bob!
Bob Bob!
Bob Bob!

Bob!
Bob called to give Enron a break.
We know that Bob called to do that.
No.
No.
No.
Uh, uh, did anybody call Bob?
Um, no.
Uh, no.
Uh, one final question if I could.
No.
Okay.
Did, uh, Bob call you to give Enron a break?
Well, we, I mean, uh, uh, of when, uh, we, we, um, um, and I've testified that we was high.
I'm sorry.
You said no?
No.
Okay.
Uh, no.
Is it?
And you were having calls from Bob asking you to hold off on your downgrading of Bob at that time?
Um, uh, um.
We were, um, um, uh, um, going to downgrade.
Um.
No.
Thank you.
Um.
Do you think Bob made a mistake?
No.
No.
No.
Uh, uh, to that extent, I do agree with Chairman Bob.
I got these, uh, these dream recollections.
Yes.
That a couple of the, the babes of the church posted.
To all dots slack.
Somebody's pushing the doorbell like really frantically.
The listeners can hear that little squeal.
Of course, you know what that's gotta be.
Reverend Magdalene said,
I've just had a bad dream detailing what it would be like to be hit with a bioweapon epidemic.
First, only a few will get sick.
Soon, every illness reported will cause police and ambulances to swiftly and silently move in and remove.
The sick person.
Then, someone will overhear the EMTs whispering among themselves.
And the world, word will be shouted on the street.
Epidemic!
Those who are well will not touch those who are sick.
Some will not be able to resist touching those they love.
And they will become sick too.
The sick will hold one another.
Even strangers and the fever will make them cheerful.
As they wait for the end.
They will talk about love.
They will dream about peace.
As they flee, the rich will open their houses to the poor.
Medicine will be free and compulsory.
Eventually, the doctors will find medicine that will stop it.
And even some of the sick will live.
Some will be no more than vegetables.
Like this man seen here.
On screen too.
He's festering already.
He's eating.
Oh, the boils are amazingly large.
They're almost psychedelic.
They're bigger than the rest of his body.
We need to get a picture of him before we put him out of his misery.
Can't we lance this one postule before we go?
I've enjoyed this so much.
Wait, let me get a snap of this.
Snap? How about a pop?
Let's just squeeze it a little bit.
Yeah, yeah.
Slow motion.
Oh my God, look.
His brain is festering too.
His entire brain is...
Hey, his living will.
say it's okay to do this, right?
He's living.
Ah, who cares? It's the end of the world.
It's the plague. The fever is catching on.
People wearing dark shoes
will be led to the end of the building
where they will be shot by
transparent transvestites.
It's for your own good.
The perks of the doctors
without frontiers or frontrears
will far outweigh
the rest of the civilian populace.
Far out.
No smoking in the gas chambers.
New foods will be
eaten by those who can no longer
digest their own stomachs.
This music will be heard in
every corporate office building.
Every corporate
office building will be a coffin.
They will be imprisoned.
A tomb.
Imprisoned.
But the fever...
will make you cheerful.
What good is it to live when life is nothing?
What good is it to live in a gymnasium
with tickets to mazelonium and...
and...
and...
Pull the wool over your own eyes.
And cover yourself with the sheet.
The shroud.
And just lay there.
Until the shroud takes an imprint of you.
Maybe someday it will be worshipped as...
the...
imprint of a savior.
A true artifact of our lord.
And master blaster.
Check the neck on that one, baby.
I for one would like to know...
what we're going to do with the efficacious
bodies we have stored here in the stone's plunder.
And look, the mazeloniums are all packed.
There's nothing we can do but shake our hands and raise our hands.
And we're just going to keep on serving our feet.
We're done ringing bells.
Not enough prisons.
Not enough mazeloniums.
Not enough funeral parlors.
Not enough grave sites.
Not enough show cakes.
For all the stiffies.
The Grand Canyon couldn't hold...
the full population of the dead.
So we had to dig a new Grand Canyon.
A mass grave.
For the disbelievers.
And the believers.
And those who will believe anything.
The watches sure are cheaper.
The graves.
Yeah, you could get a good watch.
Well, you could get a good watch for nothing.
All stopped at the same time.
A whole country of...
graves.
And a graveyard of penises.
Are you that graveyard of...
penises, sister?
Or brother, as the case may be?
Or are you...
the shaft of Bob's pipe, so to speak?
That through which...
others are sucked?
Have you been braced with the cleaning fluids of Bob?
Ah, the pity.
Fated to drift forever through the void is gravity's plaything.
Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned.
Ask not for whom the bone bones.
It bones for thee.
The only thing that keeps me sane...
is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art.
Ah.
Ah! Damn you!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
The Book of Terror The Lord By His Wings
Chapter 1
He shall kill the Lord.
The priest shall bring the Lord to the altar and wring off his head.
He shall cut the Lord into pieces,
and his blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar.
The priest shall put the Lord's head at the door of the fire.
He shall flay his head and burn it on the altar.
The priest shall burn the head on the altar for a burnt Lord.
It is a burnt head, and it's made by sweet fire.
This is new. All new.
And medical science offers you proof positive.
You'll see the number 903 on the government stamp.
It is not nice.
The Lord is a devil.
The Lord is a devil.
There will be no smoking in the death halls.
Throw it out. Window.
Dispose of all smoking materials in the morgues.
Watch out for that, uh...
There are authorities here.
There are authorities here tonight.
And we do not want to piss off the gods and goddesses.
Where are you gonna go?
Where are you gonna hide when the man dressed in blue is on the inside?
When cannibalism is rampant,
and people stare at your feet on the bus waiting for a bite.
They haven't eaten in days.
They look at you like a snack.
The authorities are here, man.
They're here. They're inside your head, dude.
And they're hungry, too.
The authorities in your mind are hungry.
They want to consume the rest of the body culture.
They don't like what you did, man.
They're like the worm or obelisk that eats its own snake.
They are hungry.
You're in big trouble with the authorities inside your head, dude.
Oh, you're... You got a... You got problems, Barney.
The devil... The devil is living inside your head.
The devil of the conspiracy is right there.
And he's ready to sign that check using your hand.
What you gonna do about it, huh?
You just gonna let him do it?
You gonna let the devil use you?
When you press that voting switch?
When you punch that little... little... little... vote dot?
Are you gonna let the devil use you when you pay that tax?
Are you gonna let the devil use you when you put that rubber on?
Are you gonna let the devil use you when you go in that Kim-Can portable toilet?
Hm? Huh? Huh? I want you to ask yourself that, my friend!
You want to sit down in front of the smoke screen,
devil into your body...
You want to crawl up your spine...
Well, he's in your spinal fluids now.
And let's begin the contest.
These are good spinal fluids you've got from that listener, Dave.
I noticed my perception is so much clearer and brighter and crisper.
It's as if I can see through the walls.
My own hands are pulsing like those light bulbs.
Cool, man.
I love the way you can do that, just by sapping the attention span off of those listeners while they listen.
Yes, yes, yes. It's a digital delay.
You merely place your thumb in one hole and put your hand in the other one, and the brain is completely under your control.
Cool.
Cool.
Why must we talk constantly of the conservation of these millions of billions of dead bodies here?
The necrophilia has become rampant.
A dead man's vote.
That's your vote, friend.
Your vote is a dead man's vote.
Dead man's voting.
You put your shoes on this morning.
Somebody else should be putting them on tomorrow.
When they flip that flip.
Top box.
You were a dead man the minute you were born.
The minute you walked out of your ma's yay-yay hole.
You were dead.
You were on your way to the grave.
It's a long trek.
Hey, buddy, my mom ain't got no yay-yay hole.
Now, why don't you take that right on back?
We're all going to the same place, bub.
Yes, the great womb is spewing forth stillborn bodies.
Shp, shp, shp.
Wow, look at those.
Those little water heads popping out.
They're like little zygos that can't make it up the river.
Look, they're just pooping right out.
Some of them are screaming to Ishtar and the other old ones.
I don't think it will make much difference to you.
Oh, that's what's so wonderful about nature.
That death allows new life to come.
And as those bodies float down the river,
why, new little babies are being born all up and down the riverside.
They make fun.
Screaming women giving birth.
Thousands and thousands as far as the eye can see.
Are they going to make some great sandwiches
or are the seagulls going to be happy tonight?
Billions of potential copper tops.
Buildings full of potential copper tops.
Ishtar.
Yeah.
Traveling by small boat and pack horse,
conservationists have come to this remote spot
to tear off strips of decaying,
and to eat the meat.
First to arrive at a dead sheep,
conservationists take advantage of larger size
to evict smaller birds.
A feeding hierarchy minimizes conflicts
over insect larvae infesting the carcass,
but doesn't entirely eliminate them.
The general rule is all males,
except for the youngest,
eat before females,
and older conservationists eat before younger.
Sated for now,
the conservationists,
may return over several days to finish the carcass.
Come morning,
conservationists expose themselves by slowly unfolding on the bare rock floor.
They install cameras,
to observe the chick on the dead sheep.
One after another,
they step off the cliffs.
A dimension of another dimension.
For sure sign of a dying on the ground.
That means you get all this absolutely free,
a whopping,
$100 value,
all absolutely free.
But you gotta call now.
Here's how to order.
Call 1-800-338-3119,
1-133-839-99-3119,
or send it,
$100,
check or money order to,
Bob.
Well, how shall we resurrect the body politic?
We put this question to the Rev. Ivory Smells
of the Church of the Subtlety,


in Australia.
I think it's...
Oh, well, they're already doing it.
They've got strings,
and they're operating the body politic
like a puppet.
They're moving the corpse around
like a marionette
using their strings of control.
Ah, the psychic tampons,
which make the children dance
when there is no music.
Our favorite song.
Eh, eh, eh.
Eh, eh.
I don't know, Dave.
I don't know.
It was a shower.
I keep wanting to be involved
and do something about society
and the world and the war
and the problems.
Oh, hi, Cynthia.
When did you float in here?
But I just...
I don't even...
You know, I've just lost all interest completely.
It's like...
It's all so distant and so...
They're going to use bushes on us, Dave.
They're not going to use those, like,
you know, railway cars like they did in the 40s.
Oh, well, then it'll get personal.
Then I'll be concerned.
When they come for me
and move me into that railroad car
and take me off to the camp,
then I'll be all worried about the politics.
Oh, word is, no railroad car for you.
You get your own white SUV
with your own numbers on the side.
Is there going to be a war?
Are we going to be hauled off to concentration camps?
Or is it all just going to be, you know,
threats and worries
and wars and rumors of wars
and national...
And flailing of teeth and flailing of hair.
Well, that is part of the pogrom,
is to keep the mind asunder
while plundering these difficult delights.
It's obvious that some sort of crash
is on its way,
and we're trying to minimize it
with our own subcutaneous thoughts.
We don't have the cheese.
We don't have the correct armature
to blow these notes.
Who's not afraid to write and sing
the way he likes, Bob?
Who's not afraid to sing
when people are uptight?
Bob!
Who is broken?
What people's days?
Music's dark.
Who is hard to change
and music's true for all of us?
Who will help us with the answers
when it seems it sucks?
Who is controversial
when it seems to get the wrong?
Who's not afraid?
Who's not afraid?
Not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Not afraid.
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
After an attack is over
and the all clear has been sounded,
arrangements will be made as soon as possible
to treat any people who are ill or injured.
Listen to your radio.
Details will be given about what to do,
when to do it,
and how.
If anyone dies
while you are carrying a gun,

in your fallout room, move the body to another room in the house. Label the body with name
and address and cover it as tightly as possible in polythene, paper, sheets or blankets. Tie
a second card to the covering. The radio will advise you what to do about taking the body
away for burial. Here's another George Bush joke. George Bush landed on, George Bush was
born on third, but he thought he hit a triple. I just got it about three hours ago. You get
it? Huh? George Bush was born on third, but he thought he hit a triple. Oh, oh, oh, I
got you. He had a silver spoon stuck in his rectum and he thought that the good fairy
brought it. Oh, he didn't earn his, his way to the most powerful mad scientist position
of the. Oh man, we got to get out of here. Dave, turn that off, man. No, we got to get
the hell out of here.
They're releasing the gas. They're going to start dropping depth charges any second.
Here goes one.
That was pretty good depth.
Dave got wiped out. No, I was hiding in the loo. I was hiding in the lavatory. Well, turn
it down or something. Move your phone away from, oh, thanks. That retarded kid that delivers
papers and he's just sticking his face up against the window going.
That could be.
That could well be.
Well, it worked the last time. Freaked you out pretty good.
Yeah, no kidding, man. I, I still haven't recovered from that one.
Pretty easy to fool. Think about all those kids, the kids on your block going, let's
go tease that old crazy old man that lives in that house.
Who is that crazy old man?
Let's go pee on him.
Let's go pee on him.
John the Rattler later wrote the book on the seventh seal.
Who's that crazy old man?
John the Rattler later.
Is that a caller, Chad?
Or is that a, is that a caller from the restaurant?
Oh, the restaurant.
John the Rattler later.
Well, who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Don't you book on the seventh seal?
That's a caller.
You know, God walked down in a cool little day, called out on by his name.
Or law.
And he refused to answer because he's naked and ashamed.
Naked and ashamed.
Who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Bob the Rattler later.
Who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Who wrote the book on the seventh seal?
You know, Christ and twelve.
Bob the Rattler later.
What the hell would he say?
And three he led away.
Say, what's with me when I walk?
Tell I go yawning free.
Tell me who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Tell me who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Don't you book on the seventh seal?
Who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Tell me who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Who's that writing?
Bob the Rattler later.
Don't you book on the seventh seal?
Christ came and raised him.
He's the one.
Mary, Martha.
The world is yours.

You have been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, episode number 853.
Yeah, really, 853.
And this particular show has been mostly the collages of Fernanda Dandeli-Murr
and the spouting of ESO Swamp Radio.
That is, the Mixmaster Chaz Smith, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Who prays in bed.
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMM!
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMM!
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMM!





UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMM!


Thank you.
