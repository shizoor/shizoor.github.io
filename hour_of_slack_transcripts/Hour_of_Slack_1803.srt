1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Sound impossible?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,560
Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,560
Oh, well, then.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,520
You take the pinch of salt, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,400
walk with your shoes around a burning, decapitated child's head,

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,480
and then jump into the grave and say,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,600
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb,

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,980
this is a problem I must overcome.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,260
Throw in a dead cat, or a live cat that's not feeling well.

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,060
Then cover with the sod,

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,740
and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Micklemas,

12
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,820
take a large dill pickle and insert it in the tumulus.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,860
Insert it in the tumulus, the heap, the shambling mound over the grave.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,500
And this time you will experience a divine regurgitation,

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,780
somewhat like unto the immaculation of J.R. Mockadob,

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,640
the slain and martyred epop of the Church of the Subdivide.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,220
I believe it's something God puts in us.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,140
It's something somebody put in us.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Fusion.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,100
The help.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,520
Hydrogen fusion.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,560
Hydrogen fusion?

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,600
Hmm.

24
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,640
Well, it's...

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,780
Hydrogen fusion.

26
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,720
Join the Church of the Subdivide.

27
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,660
Hydrogen fusion, hyper-confusion.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,440
This material contains information affecting the national defense of the United States

29
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,060
within the meaning of the espionage law,

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,200
Cital 18, U.S.C. sections 7098 and 74,

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,100
a transmission or revelation of which in any manner to an unauthorized person

32
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,000
is indefinitely prohibited by law.

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,280
This material does not derive them without second feelings.

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,280


35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,660
Hang in that perfect place where one could hear the concerns and remarks of thousands of

36
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:45,660


37
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:45,660


38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:45,660


39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,780
A beginning is a very delicate time.

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:11,920
Shut up.

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,400
Shut up.

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,660
Shut up.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,660
That's it.

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,240
Look out, guys.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:41,280
No way.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,280
No way.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,700
A beginning.

48
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,640
A beginning.

49
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,760
is a very delicate time.

50
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,860
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

51
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,700
And there, we're centered on...

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,900
Oh, okay, we're on lock.

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, okay, we're on lock.

54
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,580
You are interested in the unknown,

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,740
the mysterious, the unexplainable.

56
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,780
That is why you are here.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
We are controlling transmission.

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,700
No trouble.

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,220
Just get set and get going.

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,900
Hey, man.

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,420
Recording.

62
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,640
Everything's going fine.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,600
No trouble.

64
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,480
Wait a minute.

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:06,820
Wait.

66
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,660
That's this switch here.

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,460
Okay, I think we're ready to go.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,200
Let's go!

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,820
Hey!

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,180
Welcome, dear friends,

71
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,960
to the subgenius hour of...

72
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:26,860
What?

73
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,380
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

74
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,620
Ah, it's so nice out here in the little studio.

75
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,100
Welcome, Dear tokast at the fautique magazine.

76
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,480
Welcome over to the Prophet Club.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,880
I would like you to likebeast calm.

78
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:01,880


79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:01,880


80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:01,880


81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,860
how to to make Aaa fir eад a O 48.

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,900
Well, that is it.

83
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:15,580


84
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:15,620
let's prepare ourselves

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,200
Central Services

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,420
We do the work, you do the pleasure

87
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,740
Hi there. I want to talk to you about ducts.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,260
Do your ducts seem old-fashioned?

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,720
Out of date?

90
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,440
Central Services' new duct designs

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,400
are now available in hundreds of different colours

92
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,080
to suit your individual taste.

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,360
Hurry now, while stocks last

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,460
to your nearest Central Services showroom.

95
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,040
Designer colours to suit your demanding taste.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,100
The rumour became reality.

97
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,480
Another satanic cult.

98
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,840
Yes, just another evil cult that was supposed to be a good one.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
This is how the war gets on the radio.

100
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,080
I think a lot of subgeniuses originally believed

101
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,260
they were doing something good by joining the church.

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,060
That wheel and chain set up makes the sound of moving artillery.

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,900
Sounds like a real battle.

104
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,100
Well, it's nothing compared to what it takes to move this show.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,240
Don't be alarmed.

106
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,240
It's a lot more work than saving souls, believe me.

107
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,680
That punch didn't connect.

108
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,380
The sound was faked.

109
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,160
Although, Stang suffered a real blow

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,260
from an infuriated Gabofran.

111
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,600
Oh, that was a great blow.

112
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,420
Yes, the mallet on a grapefruit gave the sound of that blow.

113
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,200
Curiously refreshing.

114
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,580
It was a lot of fun, too.

115
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,240
But here they come, there.

116
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,300
The guard is forming to march the guilty offender away.

117
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,220
Yes, those who believe...

118
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,220
...the wrong lies in the book of the subgenius

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,440
taken into the stadium near Dobstown

120
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,140
and all the Malaysians pour into the little wooden seats.

121
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,500
For the clumsy child with the hard-to-fit shoe size,

122
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,700
Cap Bigfoot, our 31st season.

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,800
Boys and girls, 6 to 18, 10D to 15, EEEEEE.

124
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,420
Our patient understanding staff has had outstanding success

125
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,360
with the clumsy, uncoordinated child.

126
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,420
Our unique patented method starts your child from scratch,

127
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,560
from crawling to early walking,

128
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,580
to full walking, trotting and running,

129
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,800
until he is actually strutting, dancing and doing gymnastics.

130
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,520
Many of our graduates are now prominent in ballet and jazz tag.

131
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,100
Write to George Trefeld, Camp Bigfoot, Peppermill, Oregon, 65201.

132
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,500
We like you and should ignore you.

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,140
But instead, we...

134
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:08,380
Oh!

135
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,280
Oh!

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,300
Jedi.

137
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,220
Jedi.

138
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,240
Nya!

139
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,780
Nya!

140
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,940
Nya!

141
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,040
Nya!

142
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
Nya!

143
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Nya!

144
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,580
Nya!

145
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,740
Nya!

146
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:42,960
Nya!

147
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,240


148
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Nya!

149
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,060
Nya!

150
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,400
Nya!

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


153
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


155
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,560
I sure do hope y'all are listening in headphones.

158
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,840
This is a real headphone show, so please do take the time.

159
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,920
A beginning is a very delicate thing.

160
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,400
A beginning is a very delicate time.

161
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,240
Here and there, clowns and ballerinas everywhere.

162
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,280
Bob?

163
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,140
Hey.

164
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,640
What?

165
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,120
Hey.

166
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

167
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,340
This is the VT, a Chinese subgenius.

168
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,680
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

169
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,300
Remember, Bob is a comrade of all people.

170
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,080
He is a channel, just like in America.

171
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,580
And people need slack.

172
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,120
That's a lot of fun.

173
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,180
In Chinese, we call slack le ting tang.

174
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
That's a lot of fun.

175
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,020
It must be true slack, not the bad slack of our conspiracy.

176
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,100
Boy, will you look at that guy's slack.

177
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,980
Help me somebody.

178
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,040
Help me somebody.

179
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,400
Thank you, Lily Jing.

180
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,260
Yes?

181
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,260
My friends, we have the great Ivan Stang here tonight.

182
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,500
Ivan Stang himself, the grand auditor and chief inquisitor of the subgenius faith,

183
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,240
who has every subgenius's name on his special basement computer,

184
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,160
and he's here tonight to make the hour and a half of slack seem like, well, like forever.

185
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,820
Ivan Stang.

186
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,880
That's Stang, you stangs.

187
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,960
Sibley.

188
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,180
He's stoner of rank.

189
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,640
Of Serlo's claws and Jeter's fangs.

190
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,640
When the peaks are upon us,

191
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,260
when its day finally is on us,

192
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,640
the peaks will roil, but not in zona.

193
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,480
Nature and man will stand aside.

194
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,160
The jaws of doom shall open wide,

195
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,940
while Ivan Stang shall perch in Zod.

196
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,840
Where from?

197
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:04,940


198
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:14,800
Godlessness and pitiless dwells, false prophets from their citadels, he topples down to nether hells.

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:24,940
He judges pigs and guinea-paws, and renders into visit-blobs those who profane the name of dogs.

200
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:35,900
He rules the vast subgenial host, evens his lags on the coast, a flage from his name as from a ghost.

201
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:46,100
Where can we go? Where can we find? No place in all this world so wide shall escape the dire subgenial tide.

202
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:54,480
The jaders howl, the sternoes plead, Bohemondus rises from the sea, no hiding place.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,920
No hiding place.

204
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,660
For you indeed.

205
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,040
What future does our doom procure us?

206
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,720
Empty earth indeed endure us.

207
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,340
Let the damn wolf dogs it lure us.

208
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,700
A rancorous fangarack, the gangster of the gang of gangs.

209
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,820
Let us now welcome Ivan Stang.

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,140
Ivan Stang.

211
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,880
Ivan Stang.

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
Get out there, you jaders.

213
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:24,920
Get out there, you jaders.

214
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,660
Get out there, you jaders.

215
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:26,840
Alright, here we go.

216
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,440
Hey, guys.

217
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,440


218
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:30,600
Integral bait.

219
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,060
Integral bait.

220
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,900
Integral bait.

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,420
All right.

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,260
Blend them together, men and unit.

223
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,260


224
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,260


225
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,260


226
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:43,520
Dmitri!

227
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
All right.

228
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:46,980


229
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,860
Be sure to stick around.

230
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,040
We're ready, Ivan.

231
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,040
Unplugged.

232
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,040


233
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,080
Unplugged.

234
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,080


235
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,480
Unplugged.

236
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,360
Unplugged.

237
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,600
Unplugged.

238
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,260
One.

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,860
Unplugged.

240
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,040
This hideous, hideous place.

241
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,660
Bob lives, friends.

242
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,900
Bob lives.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,380
Don't let him tell you otherwise.

244
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,140
He ain't dead.

245
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,200
Oh, what is this?

246
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,120
I should know.

247
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm the guy that has to read sooner or later all the mail that comes to that P.O. box

248
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,020
that you probably thought was just made up.

249
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,820
The opinions expressed by Ivan Stang do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the staff

250
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,540
and management of this radio station.

251
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,940
The other staff, the relations and spouses of the staff and management,

252
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,840
or the staff of this staff and staff.

253
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,800
That's really true, Hal, but he doesn't know that there's all over the place these days.

254
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Bob's body dragged out of the Victoria Theater with these eyes.

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,340
These deadlights looked on Bob and the light was drifting from them forever.

256
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,220
There's saint of sale corpses dotting the landscape.

257
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,520
All the way up to the top.

258
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,420
All the way from Little Rock to Berkeley here.

259
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,120
I don't know what the big deal is.

260
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,520
I mean, just because there's a Dobbs corpse there doesn't necessarily...

261
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,140
I mean, can Bob really die?

262
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,600
I don't know.

263
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:45,580
I just couldn't be bothered to believe Bob's body was real.

264
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,580


265
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,580


266
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,580


267
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,580


268
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,580


269
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,580


270
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,480
uer!

271
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,880
The second.

272
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,120
The third.

273
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,240
The fourth.

274
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,340
When it blows its stacks

275
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:24,380
When it blows its stacks

276
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,080
He ain't nowhere to be found

277
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,400
When the wolves crawl

278
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,000
While we're down

279
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,400
The billow box out

280
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,460
Now we're around

281
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,820
Hide all them women in town

282
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,220
Hide

283
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,160
Hide all them women in town

284
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,240
When it blows its stacks

285
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,140
When it blows its stacks

286
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,320
When the dolphins avow

287
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,520
When thebandw avow

288
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,500
Before we go wild

289
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,840
When we blow our dicks

290
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:32,840


291
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,320
When we blow our scavens

292
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:33,520
Down on homes

293
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,520


294
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,520


295
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,980
When we cut theitive

296
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,540
Ten stank vulc on her bunlar

297
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:38,780
Oh!

298
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,640
He takes them out, out on the nice mud.

299
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,900
Count them a-blomping, so y'all see around.

300
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,980
When he's straightened up, they all bend down.

301
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,920
He don't bow to bad water, he don't push it around.

302
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,000
Well, it blows the stacks.

303
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,600
Well, it blows the stacks.

304
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,700
Well, it blows.

305
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,880
Oh, the stacks.

306
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
Well, it blows the stacks, the angels.

307
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,840
No well to be around.

308
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,680
No well to be gone.

309
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,480
No.

310
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,240
existence.

311
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,120
Ah, ah.

312
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,120


313
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,120


314
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:06,420
Oh, ah.

315
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,400
Yeah.

316
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,560
No, no, nope.

317
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,320
No.

318
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:26,420
you gals out there. We haven't gotten any more entries in the win a date with Cleve

319
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:33,460
Duncan contest. I mean, I'm not even going to go into, if you don't know who Cleve Duncan

320
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:41,460
is, then you probably don't deserve the date. But if you do, go ahead and try. Go ahead

321
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,280
and try. It's important. Very important.

322
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
What?

323
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,460
what?

324
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,140
Stop it!

325
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
You're always right.

326
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,240
bateuc

327
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,740
I don't like that name.

328
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,760
Woof, woof, go!

329
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,220

Heave-ho!

333
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
Slag faster, make it down faster

334
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,500
They've made it out of the smoke through the bone

335
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,680
He's the one I got, shake it off your behind

336
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,540
If you wanna know the truth, then that's a fact

337
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,120
Somebody scream, give me more slag, give me more slag

338
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,220
Do you like slag?

339
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,260
I like it

340
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,740
I say, I love slag

341
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,400
I love it

342
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,840
Do you want slag?

343
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,920
I want it

344
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,140
Do you need slag?

345
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,980
I need it

346
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,840
You like me?

347
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,700
No

348
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,520
How about I need me?

349
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:31,900
No

350
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,220
What about you?

351
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,580
No

352
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,220
No

353
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,800
Look at me, I'm a dismal

354
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,340
No

355
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,660
Get down to program

356
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,380
No

357
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,320
Ride, ride, you hobo boy

358
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,640
No

359
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Feel like Trinitraline

360
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,820
No

361
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,800
Got the motion

362
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:43,940
No

363
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,880
Yeah, he's been hopping to the barbershop with more slag

364
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,960
I gotta have my slag

365
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,940
Give it to me

366
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,060
Yeah, praise Bob

367
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,340
Hey

368
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,800
Stay down on that, stay down on that

369
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,840
Stay down on that

370
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,340
Stay down on that

371
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,760
Boy, I mean, slack is better than red beans and rice.

372
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,560
On top of a snow key

373
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,740
All covered with sand

374
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,280
I shot my poor teacher

375
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,200
With a red rubber band

376
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,220
I shot her with pleasure

377
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,760
I shot her with please

378
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,060
I couldn't help miss her

379
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,640
She was forty feet wide

380
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,760
I went to her funeral

381
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,700
I went to her grave

382
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,120
Everybody threw flowers

383
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,540
But I threw a grenade

384
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,360
The police came and got me

385
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,020
And put me in jail

386
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,740
But I brought a best friend

387
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,440
To go and shot him to H-E-L-L

388
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,220
Oh, thank you, Tevis.

389
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,920
That was a beautiful rendition of a classic, classic childhood song.

390
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,360
And there'll be more from the tiniest subgenius prophet coming up.

391
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,420
But friends, you know, we've been griping about those who didn't pay their pledge.

392
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,080
But we haven't really thanked those who had.

393
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,300
And...

394
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,640
Well, the Willa Dobbs and I got to looking at this board in here.

395
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
This poster that they've put up

396
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,000
that keeps track of what shows are ahead

397
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,280
and what shows are behind on the pledge drive.

398
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:53,980
And, uh...

399
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,460
Friends, I could scarcely believe it,

400
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,740
but the Hour of Slack

401
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,540
is number five among all K-N-O-N shows

402
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,900
as far as paid pledges go.

403
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,560
And the other, the four shows,

404
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,540
out of 80...

405
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,900
What, 81 shows, I think?

406
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,080
Yeah, 81 shows.

407
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,700
Out of 81 shows, the four shows that made more money

408
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,420
during that pledge drive than the Hour of Slack

409
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,720
were all on for, like, 10 hours a day.

410
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,960
They're on every day.

411
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,980
We did better in Pajama Party, better than anybody.

412
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,360
Now, the gospel shows, they got as much pledges as the subgenius show,

413
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,780
but strangely, only 8% paid.

414
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,080
Wonder what that means.

415
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,700
Well, anyway, 50% of you subgeniuses have paid, I think.

416
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,200
By now, probably 50%.

417
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,140
And those who haven't, if you haven't gotten the calls already,

418
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,440
you will.

419
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,000
You'll get that call.

420
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,460
And it's all being recorded,

421
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,960
not only on magnetic media here in this century,

422
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,860
but on the Akashic records,

423
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,460
the records of all things that have ever occurred,

424
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,880
even inside your brain.

425
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
That's all recorded,

426
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,580
and we have access to those through our guru.

427
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,820
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

428
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,160
And friends, we're going to continue with the show.

429
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,560
I hope you're, once again, I hope you're in headphones.

430
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,980
This is a real headphone show.

431
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,500
We'll be right back.

432
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,120
How do we know you're not being tied, Bob?

433
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,060
Okay.

434
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,880
Good God.

435
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,400
You'll never tell them we don't see anything.

436
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:39,680
Screaming.

437
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,320
What's up, Dean?

438
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,400
What's the world coming to?

439
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,600
Don't listen to him.

440
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,600
Don't listen to him.

441
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,480
There are, yes, you can find help.

442
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,740
You can be deprogrammed.

443
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,100
You can find out the truth.

444
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,000
They beat me up today.

445
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,620
It's a hell of an imp.

446
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,920
I know you're a dumbass.

447
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,300
They force you to sleep on four.

448
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,240
But it's not fast.

449
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,500
It came fast.

450
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,800
They're weak.

451
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,720
They're going to.

452
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,100
Is that all right?

453
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,720
Is that all right?

454
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:07,840
Is that all right?

455
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,440
Is that all right?

456
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,440
Some geniuses came in.

457
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:19,180
They took all my furniture and sold it to buy me this neck brace that I can't take off now.

458
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,320
They said it was a living being.

459
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,120
Bring the upper lip down below the upper teeth.

460
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,200
Be sure to keep it down until the fingers are in position.

461
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,940
At each corner of the mouth, insert a thumb under the upper lip.

462
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Now slide the thumbs along the inside of the upper lip until they are positioned just below and to the side of each nostril.

463
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,700
The results are thrilling.

464
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,820
Everywhere these messages are heard, souls are being saved and sick bodies are being healed.

465
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:09,380
I, too, refuse to send money to the Church of the Sub-G.

466
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,380
I, too, refuse to send money to the Church of the Sub-G.

467
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:11,380


468
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,660
And I, too, fail under the power of the e.

469
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,580
And I, too, fail under the power of the e.

470
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,320
And I, too, fail under the power of the e.

471
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,420
Stop right there.

472
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,760
Sorry for keeping you in, doctors.

473
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:23,660
Go on.

474
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,040
Go on.

475
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,340
Don't leave me here.

476
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,000
You've got to leave me here.

477
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,340
They made me say.

478
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,800
Don't leave me here.

479
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,560
They tortured me.

480
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,360
They make me save things.

481
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,760
Don't leave me here.

482
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,620
They torture me.

483
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,960
Don't leave me here.

484
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,440
Don't leave me here.

485
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,320
They make me save things.

486
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
Don't leave me here.

487
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,860
I understand.

488
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,900
I'm sorry.

489
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,180
Don't let them kill me.

490
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,140
Torture me.

491
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,060
I understand.

492
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,100
They torture me.

493
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,900
I understand.

494
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,720
Don't let them kill me.

495
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,620
What could be saying this?

496
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,560
Don't let them kill me.

497
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,440
Don't let them kill me.

498
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,060
It's been the subgenius, parrot, and parakeet training.

499
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,040
They torture.

500
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,240
I hate this place.

501
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,260
It's been the subgenius, parrot, and parakeet training.

502
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,140
Don't let them kill me.

503
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,740
Don't let them kill me.

504
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,300
I hate this place.

505
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,220
I'm calling my names, but...

506
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,460
Yee-haw!

507
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,880
Let the sons of God and man be a witness.

508
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,200
Even in the belly of the Thunderbird,

509
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,700
I've been casting out the false prophets.

510
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,060
I'm busting the gut and blowing my o-ring.

511
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,020
No!

512
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,720
No!

513
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:07,740
No!

514
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:09,900
No!

515
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,180
No!

516
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,980
No!

517
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,580
No!

518
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,820
No!

519
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,200
No!

520
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,500
No!

521
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:19,880


522
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:19,880


523
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,140


524
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:20,880


525
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:23,920
No!

526
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:23,920


527
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:23,920


528
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:23,920


529
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:23,920


530
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,020
No!

531
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,500
No!

532
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


533
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


534
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


535
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


536
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


537
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


538
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


539
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


540
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


541
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


542
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


543
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


544
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


545
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,500


546
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,540
Please.

547
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,860
We have a witness from the Ministry of Information.

548
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,100
Deputy Minister, Eugene Hellman.

549
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,520
Good evening, David.

550
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,460
What do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorism?

551
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:48,260
bombings, bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good

552
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:55,620
old-fashioned virtue. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just

553
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,900
play the game, they'd get a lot more out of life. Nevertheless, Mr. Helper, there are those who

554
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,800
maintain that the Ministry of Information has become too large and unwieldy. David, in a free

555
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,480
society, information's the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.

556
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:19,640
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister, 7% of the gross national product. I understand this

557
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,140
concern on behalf of the taxpayer. People want value for money. That's why we always insist on

558
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:34,700
the principle of information retrieval charges. It's absolutely right, sir, that those found

559
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,340
guilty should pay for their periods of detention.

560
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,520
And for the information retrieval procedures used in their interrogation. Do you believe that the

561
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,840
government is winning the battle against terrorists? Oh, yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs.

562
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,340
We're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them

563
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,900
for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.

564
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:18,220
One law-abiding citizen has to subsidize criminals. But Mr. Helper, the bombing campaign

565
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:26,280
is now in its 13th year. Beginner's luck. Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

566
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,360
Thank you, David. And a very Merry Christmas to you all.

567
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,420
Know then that it is the year 10,000.

568
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,480
1991.

569
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,580
There have always been Bobs. There has never been a world without a Bob.

570
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:53,660
Just as there's never been a Bob without a Dick, his corresponding evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs.

571
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,340
After a mental mutation.

572
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,400
The demons you may see during the initial hallucinations are not real.

573
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,000
Get him away from me.

574
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,360
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

575
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,300
Jack.

576
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,620
So always resurface from the hypgnosis slowly, dear friends.

577
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,380
Excuse me.

578
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Yadda yadda yadda.

579
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,780
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

580
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,100
Hoo!

581
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,660
Oh, yeah, I wanna...

582
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,600
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

583
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,080
Hoo!

584
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,440
I wanna... that's not right, Gary. That should be a...

585
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,580
Hoo! Hoo!

586
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,060
Hoo!

587
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,920
Okay, that's good.

588
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,500
Hoo! Hoo!

589
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,880
Well, yes, I was gonna make serious funny noises.

590
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,520
Because we all know that Bob is the man that makes all the ladies go...

591
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,400
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

592
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,940
It is the man that makes all the men go...

593
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,560
Well, please take a little rest.

594
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,040
It ain't an om-chanting laid-back universe, dear friends.

595
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,180
It's a...

596
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,520
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

597
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,140
...universe.

598
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,720
Shhh!

599
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,160
An action-packed universe.

600
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,440
Oh, yeah.

601
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,260
Hello, what's this?

602
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,100
Yes?

603
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
Hmm. A boring and...

604
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,360
A virulating and putrescent biologically active universe.

605
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,960
...the holes between their shoelaces.

606
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,260
Just because.

607
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,080
Enormous bioplasm that stretches throughout infinity.

608
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,360
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

609
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,220
Oh, did you get some of that, too?

610
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,820
Yes, it was delicious.

611
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,260
And then he forced me to eat this big, ugly piece of meat.

612
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,700
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

613
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,880
He was a little, short, chubby guy, and that's where Bob got the idea.

614
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,680
They say he came in with checkered pants on, but I just don't remember.

615
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,560
He was allowed to eat all he wanted.

616
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,580
challenging, anything she wanted.

617
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,180
Bob's big boy

618
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,640
was a real person.

619
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,400
That's true, for there was

620
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,780
a real Bob.

621
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,440
And this parable

622
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,340
goes to show that there is indeed

623
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,840
always a real Bob.

624
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,980
There has to be a Bob, dear friend.

625
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,780
Even the things which you cannot possibly

626
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,720
believe in, Bob's big boy

627
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,820
indeed, turn out to be an actual

628
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,980
historic person. And as it is

629
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,020
with Bob's big boy, surely

630
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,900
it is with the far more impressive

631
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,760
and major deity we know

632
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,160
as the Avatar of All Slack.

633
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,020
That's how

634
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,340
we know him. Others

635
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,620
call him Pimp or Mongo.

636
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,060
Others call him a demon

637
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,220
or your mama.

638
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,820
Indeed. And the children of Bob are

639
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,980
everywhere. Bob lives on in his

640
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,760
millions and millions, literally

641
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,620
millions of illegitimate children.

642
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,760
All of them pressing lawsuits

643
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,980
against me

644
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,760
personally. Well,

645
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,740
doctor, I'm sure you're used to it by now.

646
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,480
Well, when I took on the job as

647
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,080
sacred scribe at the church,

648
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,940
I had no idea what I was

649
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,420
going to be getting into. We had 500

650
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,920
employees in 1980.

651
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Now it's just me and someone else.

652
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,800
Well, that's just the

653
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,220
Reagan-esque spirit

654
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,180
that's been infusing us together

655
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,480
for its own sake. And yet they

656
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,420
say that Bob doesn't even exist.

657
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,540
There are some who say that there

658
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,660
is no Bob. If there's no Bob,

659
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,500
then where did all of those dead

660
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,680
bodies come from?

661
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,480
What about all those ads in the 50s

662
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,680
that he posed for?

663
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,540
Right here, the body store.

664
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,940
Dead Bobs for any occasion.

665
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,660
Oh, put that away. That's not impressing anyone.

666
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,640
No Bob too small, no Bob too big.

667
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,500
No, really, guys, all kidding aside,

668
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,600
all kidding aside,

669
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,300
at least

670
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,360
the official Father Church,

671
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,920
the subgenius foundation,

672
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,780
which we don't expect any of you

673
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,360
to accept the stinking Bob.

674
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,620
To cling to.

675
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,800
Nevertheless, we have the only

676
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,900
true word of Bob,

677
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,240
the original apostles.

678
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,360
And as far as I'm concerned,

679
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,740
this whole thing about Bob

680
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,720
being dead is a ruse.

681
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,780
Bob staged that whole thing

682
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,060
himself. It was fashionable

683
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,060
in the 60s.

684
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,740
It's the same frontwards and back, friends.

685
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,600
And there's a reason there's an O in

686
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:03,960
the middle.

687
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,560
A hole in the middle between those two

688
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,600
Bs. It's symbolic, friends.

689
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,680
You can look through that

690
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,660
the center of that

691
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,240
O in Bob's name

692
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,640
and see the future and the past.

693
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
The spice

694
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,100
must flow.

695
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,140
Mr. Chron

696
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,140


697
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,200
guardian takes him along way to

698
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,200


699
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,220
Once you get to홓

700
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,540
H flagteş

701
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:22,020
A woman, age 93, was killed in a merry-go-round when she and her wheelchair were thrown from the thing in Sherman's amusement park.

702
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,640
The woman was killed in a merry-go-round when she and her wheelchair were thrown from the thing in Sherman's amusement park.

703
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:18,840
The woman was killed in a merry-go-round when she and her wheelchair were thrown from the thing in Sherman's amusement park.

704
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:40,980
You have reached the correct number. However, your call has already been analyzed and rejected.

705
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,900
This matter is out of our hands.

706
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:51,860
As soon as we are able to transcend the time problems inherent in life on Earth and gain control of the situation,

707
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,660
we will return you to your previously scheduled conversation.

708
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:02,740
If this had been an actual phone call, you would have been instructed to leave your name, number, time,

709
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,520
and number of the person you are calling.

710
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,140
You will receive a message when you hear the tone. Thank you.

711
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,420
Ah, Reverend Stein, praise Bob. This is Robert Anton Wilson,

712
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:21,240
and about my appearance for the church of the subgenius Jeff Rosenbaum, who arranges the tours,

713
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:27,540
we'll be calling you about that because he's the one who has all the flight plans and the airline tickets and his controls,

714
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,520
and he'll be the one who arranges the dates with you when I'll be there,

715
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,160
and I better shut up because I'm running out of time. Praise Bob!

716
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,740
Praise Bob.

717
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Well, yeah, that's right. That was Robert Anton Wilson, and about ten of you listeners probably know who he is.

718
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:52,040
We have the chance of setting up a lecture and or show or whatever with Robert Anton Wilson.

719
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:59,140
He's going to be coming through Texas to do shows, at least in Austin, at the Book People's bookstore.

720
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,500
I know about that one, but we could set one up here in Dallas.

721
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:14,780
But we need like about $450 or $500 front money, see, to get him in, and that's just the cost of the show, basically.

722
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,320
So we also need a place to do it.

723
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,560
And if anybody is wild and crazy about Robert Anton Wilson and wants to get real involved in bringing him to Dallas,

724
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,420
then let us know.

725
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,360
For those of you who don't know, he's the author of Illuminatus and Schrodinger's Cat and several other cosmic science fiction,

726
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,340
books that, well, you just have to check them out.

727
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:54,060
But write us here at the station or write to Bob at EO Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

728
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
So we're going to continue here.

729
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,420
Oh, my dear negative land.

730
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,980
We have a swimming pool.

731
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,940
Well, as you can hear, Dr.

732
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,440
Paul Robbins and Gary Gabroga,

733
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,180
I guess,

734
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,580
put them in several movie soundtracks.

735
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,420
That's what we're doing is movie soundtracks.

736
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,000
You're hearing the soundtrack of Brazil in stereo.

737
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,120
That's why I insist on the headphones.

738
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:26,360
Brazil, Big Trouble in Little China, and Dune are our favorite sound effects horrors for tonight.

739
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:26,720
So.

740
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,260
Doug, this is Steve.

741
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,160
I'm going to be in town on time.

742
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,860
What are you talking about, man?

743
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,420
But hurry.

744
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,360
But hurry.

745
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,280
But hurry.

746
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,020
But hurry.

747
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,820
Alright, it's Nick.

748
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,540
Give me a call.

749
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,000
Well, too bad we missed you.

750
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,460
This is Mike and Pam in Chicago.

751
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,860
Um.

752
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,160
We didn't know if you had caught.

753
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,500
Pee Wee's Playhouse this morning,

754
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,460
but Bob was prominently displayed on the bulletin board.

755
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,300
If you didn't get it, let me know,

756
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,640
and I'll send you off a copy.

757
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,060
Have a good one. Bye.

758
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,820
How long have you been in the U.S. of A?

759
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,760
Fremont.

760
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,320
Where from?

761
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,500
Hong Kong.

762
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,640
What happens?

763
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,600
You stay here a while?

764
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,100
Old girls leave, new girls come in?

765
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,200
Maybe.

766
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,740
Take your tie off, please.

767
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,260
Yeah, I know what you mean.

768
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,280
My wife gave it to me for Christmas.

769
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
I'm going home anyway.

770
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm trying to start a new business.

771
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,000


772
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,000


773
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,180
He said he's in the other conquered countries.

774
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:25,660
I'll run along again.

775
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:25,660


776
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:25,660


777
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:25,680


778
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:25,680


779
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:25,820
You've seen a lot of memory.

780
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,160
in Europe

781
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,160


782
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:29,700
Mm-hmm.

783
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,500
Good anyone.

784
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,120
No!

785
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,540
No!

786
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,480
No!

787
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,640
Explosions.

788
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,660
People flying in and out.

789
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,740
That was not real.

790
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,060
I want to talk to the cops.

791
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,520
I want my truck back.

792
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,720
Now, where the hell am I?

793
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:27,880
I want my truck back.

794
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:58,320
I want my truck back.

795
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,480
I want my truck back.

796
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,980
I want my truck back.

797
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:11,240
I want my truck back.

798
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:59,640
I want my truck back.

799
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:16,980
I want my truck back.

800
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:59,640
I want my truck back.

801
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:10,580
I want my truck back.

802
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:44,320
I want my truck back.

803
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,740
I want my truck back.

804
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,380
I want my truck back.

805
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,100
I want my truck back.

806
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,620
I want my truck back.

807
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,680
I want my truck back.

808
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,960
That's right.

809
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,860
You're lucky to live in the end time.

810
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,520
Here's my money, bud.

811
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,900
Wise up.

812
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,380
They're out to get you.

813
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,800
Moving podium.

814
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:02,500
Prod.

815
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,420
And having once prodded, moves on.

816
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:07,900
I'm not moving.

817
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:15,120
You know, the subgenius is not just below a genius, whatever that may be.

818
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,320
The subgenius does not pretend to superknowledge, but to subknowledge.

819
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,580
Knowledge of the underthings, the underwear lurking beneath the clothing of existence.

820
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,360
The foundation garment, if you will.

821
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,500
The underlying reality.

822
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,380
You see, the subgenius is a strange beast indeed.

823
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,620
Give me a can of sound effects while you're at it, would you?

824
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,720
Oh, yeah, and some show stretchers.

825
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,140
And listen to him.

826
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,960
I need some show stretchers back.

827
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:00,860
Yes, friends.

828
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,620
How about something to eat?

829
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:06,460
Little did many of you know, but this isn't the only subgenius show.

830
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:20,700
In fact, there's six weekly subgenius shows now in New York, Beijing, New Jersey, Richmond, Virginia, St. Louis, Dallas.

831
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,740
Come on, hurry now.

832
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,600
We have to catch the last dog's home.

833
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,420
I get it, I get it.

834
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:26,920
I get it, I get it.

835
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,880
Virgin, a high protein.

836
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,700
I'm a protein tassel wash.

837
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,720
I'm a bacteriological weapon.

838
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,960
I'm armed and I'm loaded.

839
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,760
I'm a fission reactor.

840
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,360
I fight plutonium.

841
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,980
Power plants are fueled by the sweat from my brow.

842
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,280
When they plug me in, the lights go out in Hong Kong.

843
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,320
I weigh 666 pounds with zero gravity.

844
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,700
Come and get me.

845
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,220
Come on.

846
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,720
Come on.

847
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:57,860
Come on.

848
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


849
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


850
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


851
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


852
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


853
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:57,860


854
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,300
eagerly soars through space,

855
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,300


856
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,300


857
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,300


858
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,300


859
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,300


860
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,300


861
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,440
a supreme

862
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,700
soon they'll begin to fold space

863
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:24,700


864
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,740
soon they'll begin to fold space far off in the control rooms of spice gas.

865
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,580
traveling without moving.

866
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,600
Ivan Stang, 15, shows scars after being attacked by an alligator

867
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,560
near West Palm Beach, Florida, Monday.

868
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,340
Ivan and a friend were swimming in the lake

869
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,240
when suddenly he was grabbed by the head

870
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,500
and pulled underwater by a giant sharp-toothed saurian.

871
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,380
I couldn't see anything but teeth and didn't know what had hold of me

872
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,920
until the gator let loose and swam away, said Ivan,

873
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,060
who suffered wounds requiring 41 stitches.

874
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,240
This is supposed to be a religious show.

875
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,540
Now what is the interpretation of this parable, my friends?

876
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,080
The alligator is the worldly mob, the rabble,

877
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,580
who always seek to devour and assimilate the holy men of the Church of the Subgenius.

878
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,180
The lone swimmer, buoyed up by the fluid element,

879
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,480
represents, upon the other hand,

880
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,360
the subgenius.

881
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,960
The striving outward force of the Church of the Subgenius,

882
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,780
which requires 41 stitches,

883
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,240
the same number as the number of bullet holes in Bob's bullet-reddled body.

884
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,900
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.

885
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,220
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

886
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,840
What are we going to do?

887
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,220
Wouldn't you like revenge on these mediocrities?

888
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,260
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

889
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,280
These pink boys, these box-dwelling Barbies and Kens,

890
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,760
these normals who have made normality the norm?

891
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,360
Well, no, I wouldn't like revenge on those people.

892
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,800
I'd like revenge on you, Ivan, because you've taken one too many $20 check from me.

893
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,740
I've never gotten...

894
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,140
I want my slack!

895
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,120
Let's see your subgenius membership card, hmm?

896
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,560
Now let's not get...

897
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,680
I mean, say the end times came a little bit soon, Gary.

898
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,800
Do you think you'd make it on the escape saucers of the sex goddesses

899
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,600
without your little subgenius membership card?

900
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,500
I'd sure try.

901
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,280
Ah, this is...

902
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,460
Great example you're setting for the people out here.

903
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:22,920
That old party pleasure.

904
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,360
I've got my Bob a miracle. I've got my Bob a miracle.

905
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,620
I've got my Bob a miracle.

906
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:24,800
Oh, it's a magic card here.

907
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,500
It says that I'm paid up to...

908
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,700
Eighteen ninety...seven?

909
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,880
You see, Gary is the Rasputin of the Church of the Subgenius,

910
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,360
often sought for, but rarely encountered.

911
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,380
And it is this self-same learning for slack which separates us from him.

912
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,000
The human may live out his entire life in a grinding cycle of slacklessness.

913
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,560
Yet he never feels cheated.

914
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,120
He thinks it's natural.

915
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,420
He thinks it's fine.

916
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,440
Who cares?

917
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,620
Well, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Sangh, and we've been getting some calls tonight

918
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,140
from people who apparently never heard of the Church of the Subgenius before, don't

919
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:09,400
know anything about it, don't know that there's acres and acres of reading material available,

920
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:16,840
which is up at least to the level of the incredible mixing you're hearing on this show.

921
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,980
And you can write for information.

922
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:26,040
That's all we can tell you on this station, for very good reason, because you need to

923
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,680
send your money to the station.

924
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,520
But you can send your letters of your questions, send your questions to Bob.

925
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:42,140
That's JRBobDobbs, and friends, that address is coming up as you stay tuned for Ron Lindsay's

926
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:42,840
Soul Oldies.

927
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,760
Have that pencil ready by now?

928
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,300
Well, you need to write to Bob at P.O.

929
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:48,840
Box.

930
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,960
807-722-4222.

931
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,740
That's 807-722-4222.

932
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,620
So friends, your hour of slack is coming to an end.

933
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:03,480
But be ready for more slack, more slack dripping and leaking all over you from Ron Lindsay's

934
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,460
Soul Oldies.

935
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:16,020
There are nothing but half-witted cattle racing each other to be first to the slaughterhouse

936
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,520
and stampeding you along with them.

937
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,680
But what do you care?

938
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,020
You've got slack.

939
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,560
Slack.

940
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:21,980
Yeah.

941
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,820
Anybody want to get down to slack?

942
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:24,200


943
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:24,800
That's him.

944
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,520
Oh, get along, little bobbies.

945
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,440
Go head on down to the Dobbs Town.

946
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:34,280
Get on in that Dobbs Town crowd, you little bobbies.

947
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,760
Hey, hey.

948
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,160
Oh, there's a nice fat one.

949
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:48,860
Yes, you'll be a good trading commodity come the bargaining session with the X-ists.

950
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,180
Huh.

951
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:49,180


952
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,200


953
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,200


954
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,280
It's just some cheap stuff.

955
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


956
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


957
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


958
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


959
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


960
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


961
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


962
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,280


963
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:49,660
Oh, that's a nice fat one.

964
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,120
First off, I noticed y'all don't talk about religion much.

965
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,420
I guess it's real hip out here in California.

966
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,020
It's more of a humanistic approach.

967
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,260
No, we believe in just letting the holy benediction of Bob

968
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:05,860
flow out like pus and mustard.

969
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,060
Just don't understand the true power of the show.

970
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,220
It's very fashionable to say Bob is a good man.

971
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,800
He was a prophet, but the son of Jehovah.

972
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,160
I don't know what superstition is.

973
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,620
It's very fashionable.

974
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,420
It happens.

975
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,340
It's not his.

976
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,580
It's not his.

977
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,440
It's not his.

978
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,280
But silently, my spirit leads my spirit back to Bob.

979
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,360
In humble trust, my violent spirit.

980
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,800
In reverential resignation.

981
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:43,980
No.

982
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:48,460
We should describe to no thought expressed only a sense of suffocation.

983
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,600
With the groove I only got, we shall all be moved.

984
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,920
Ready or not, here we come.

985
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,580
Getting down on the one which we believe in.

986
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,020
Can I get it on my foot?

987
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,220
Good God!

988
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,460
Oh, turn my gas down!

989
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,080
One night, we will all be moved.

990
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,040
So take and shut us down.

991
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah.

992
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,380
Don't tell me now.

993
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,320
Don't tell me now.
