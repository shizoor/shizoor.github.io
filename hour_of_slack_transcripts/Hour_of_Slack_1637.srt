1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina...

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
Zilch! China kept calling Alameda!

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,840
Zilch, never mind for the more that pleases non-defense...

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,200
It is my opinion that the people are intending...

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,100
It isn't my opinion that the people are intending.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,260
It isn't my opinion that the people are intending.

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,980
We don't have no time for that.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,080
All we want is

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:01:04,660
is an hour of slack. Do you know where it's at? All you need is an hour of slack. Everyone needs a strained jacket. Hold it tight, let's all slack it. Everyone needs a strained jacket. Hold on tight, let's all slack it.

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,800
Don't run away! I gotta bob in my pants.

11
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,880
Oh, they all run away. I need help.

12
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:23,700
I gotta bob in my pants.

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
Will somebody help him?

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,760
Come on, ma'am.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,960
I need to squat my bob.

16
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,700
I gotta squat my bob.

17
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,320
You tell me squat my bob...

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,800
...is right here.

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,680
He won't take it but a minute, Joel.

20
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,480
I gotta bob in my designer jeans.

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,580
I gotta bob in my pants.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,020
It's clean bob.

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,360
I gotta bob in my shorts.

24
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,620
Don't smell.

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,560
I've trained it.

26
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,740
It's on really high.

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,400
I got a vibe in my shirt.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,040
I'm going to get this vibe out of my pants.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
I got to get this vibe.

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:24,980
I got to get this vibe.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,400
I got to get this vibe.

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,320
Your time has come.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:21,100
Your time has come to claim the quarters, raid the port, seize the flag, storm the ramparts, cross the waters, steal the guns.

34
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,500
Your time has come.

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,860
Open and wishing and praying for a clean escape.

36
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,720
From the worn out, torn out, burned out, same old ways.

37
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,780
Your time has come to kill the giant.

38
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,060
Feed my old bum.

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,660
Your time has come.

40
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,020
Show me your GPA.

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,880
And run root group, band.

42
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,520
Know if you're ready push, now and best.

43
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,520


44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,520


45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,520


46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,340
I never really had to do anything.

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,360


48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,360


49
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,340
J X.

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,580
Your time has come

51
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,540
To rock the ages

52
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,200
One child run

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,320
Your time has come

54
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,840
Your time has come

55
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,440
Your time has come

56
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,420
Your time has come

57
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:43,380
Your time has come

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,300
Nothing I do

59
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,680
Is gonna fail

60
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm wearing the t-shirt

61
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,960
That Bob Dog sent me

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,700
That came me in the mail

63
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,120
And when I'm wearing the t-shirt

64
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,420
That Bob Dog sent me

65
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,800
That Bob Dog sent me

66
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,160
I know I'll never land in jail

67
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,300
I'm wearing the t-shirt

68
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,820
That Bob Dog sent me

69
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,340
It came to me in the mail

70
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,420
When I'm wearing the t-shirt

71
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,420
That Bob Dog sent me

72
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Me, me, me

73
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,640
Said it to me

74
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,940
Nothing that I do can fail

75
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,740
When I'm wearing the t-shirt

76
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,300
That Bob Dog sent me

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,840
I feel so goddamn cool

78
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,780
When I'm wearing the t-shirt

79
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,420
That Bob Dog sent me

80
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,760
When I'm wearing the t-shirt

81
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,180
That Bob Dog sent me

82
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,500
Nobody's gonna accuse me

83
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,080
Of being a fool

84
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm wearing the t-shirt

85
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,000
That Bob Dog sent me

86
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,820
You guys ready for a song?

87
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,940
Yeah!

88
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,900
Alright.

89
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes, sir!

90
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,360
Yes, sir!

91
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:57,680
Yes, sir!

92
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,820
As an intellectual, it is my duty to perform.

93
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,740
There's a responsibility to which I must inform.

94
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,720
All the people of the world wake up, you're asleep.

95
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,960
You're being land slaughtered like mindless sheep.

96
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,780
Aliens did 9-11, FEMA is taking our guns.

97
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,280
There's no go inside the pyramid, the earth does not read.

98
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,660
Follow the round the sun!

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,880
Yes, sir!

100
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,700
False flag attack!

101
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,640
Yes, sir!

102
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,600
False flag attack!

103
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,420
Yes, sir!

104
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,700
False flag attack!

105
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,440
Yes, sir!

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,440
False flag attack!

107
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,200
Cause you see, the police are really lizards.

108
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,920
The moon is owned by Jews.

109
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,280
The Freemasons will run Monsanto and there's fluoride in our booze.

110
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,860
We got chemtrails in the air, we got GPS in our shoes.

111
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,700
But trust me, because you know I care, what have you got to lose?

112
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,700
Yes, sir!

113
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
False flag attack!

114
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,640
Yes, sir!

115
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,460
False flag attack!

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,520
Yes, sir!

117
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,420
False flag attack!

118
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
Yes, sir!

119
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,580
False flag attack!

120
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:28,580


121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,040
False flag...

122
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,240
Winter day and the beach is cloudy

123
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,160
Just blame heart

124
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,140
When your team loses the game

125
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,160
Just blame heart

126
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,120
When you get locked out of your house

127
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,040
Just blame heart

128
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,820
When you hear disinformation

129
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,740
Just blame

130
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,220
The loser's face plus the king top

131
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,340
Has become one person

132
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,060
That insidiously plans your inevitable devil

133
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,920
Only to declare a long-relieved labor

134
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,120
Forced a broken spirit

135
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
Homo sapiens

136
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Hit the

137
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,660
Pop flag attack

138
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
Hit the

139
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,700
Pop flag attack

140
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,340
Hit the

141
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,020
Pop flag attack

142
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,220
Don't worry

143
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,660
I guess you're back

144
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm an American

145
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,860
My heart pumps blood

146
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,940
I like to eat meat

147
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,780
I like to make love

148
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm talking about the water

149
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,720
They put

150
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,420
That turns the freaking frogs gay

151
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Don't take my children away from me

152
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
Ah, yes, dear friends

153
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,460
Waiting

154
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,100
Waiting is coming

155
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,100


156
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,100


157
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,420
We're playing this old and new music

158
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,480
That was new

159
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,060
That song was that was Dr. Argus fox,

160
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,420
and the right angles.

161
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,020
Recorded live in Florida, I think, earlier this year.

162
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,980
The song before that, the T-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me,

163
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,680
that was Glass Madness,

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,460
and he probably recorded that on a cassette recorder in 1981 or 82.

165
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,780
Wow.

166
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,080
He was a very early contributor and cranked out dozens of Bob songs.

167
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,360
I've been going into my older archives.

168
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,560
That song, Your Time Has Come,

169
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,860
was the Rainmakers from, I think, a 2014 album called Monster Movie

170
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,580
that wasn't on my radar, strangely enough, until just last week.

171
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,120
Full of great stuff.

172
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
There'll be more.

173
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,500
There'll be more Rainmakers playing soon.

174
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,620
Bob in My Pants, that was also Glass Madness,

175
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,340
with me overdubbing, I think.

176
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,960
Our title song, Slack It,

177
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,740
is by the Exposed Foreheads,

178
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,280
who are going to be playing the next song.

179
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,160
And that very beginning thing, Bob Dobbelina,

180
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,420
that was the monkeys.

181
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,540
The monkeys.

182
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,740
Yes, indeed.

183
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:45,900
Indeed.

184
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,780
And coming up soon, well, there'll be another Rainmakers song.

185
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,000
They're easy to spot because they're twangy.

186
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:03,780
And we're going to play a song spoken by G. Gordon Gordon,

187
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,740
hit man for Bob.

188
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,420
He really was a hit man for Bob,

189
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,500
and that's also the name of the song.

190
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,540
Unfortunately, the guy playing guitar on it,

191
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,900
which is really good,

192
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,300
is, I think, in prison for murder.

193
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,360
Aw.

194
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,140
Yeah.

195
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,100
But what we're going to play right now

196
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,600
is Exposed Foreheads.

197
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,480
Alles ist verboten.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,400
Bakery Children'sesterday.

199
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:44,820
A show by prior commentators.

200
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,860
energy

201
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,920
happiness

202
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,660
enthusiasm

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,020
fun time

204
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,820
no

205
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,500
ice is forbidden

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,900
warm feeling

207
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,900
dancing

208
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,540
pleasure

209
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,020
good time

210
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
no

211
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,980
ice is forbidden

212
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,560

222
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:44,800


223
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,300
i got a house in new york

224
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,020
i'm an international assassin

225
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,700
i get into my work

226
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,940

227
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,860

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,800
but if i don't do it

229
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,500
you know someone else will

230
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,220
i'm a hitman baby

231
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,300
i'm a hitman baby

232
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,740
i'm a hitman baby

233
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:14,800
i'm a hitman baby

234
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,260
i got a license to kill

235
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,000
i press this burner in mayhem

236
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,120
but i believe in free will

237
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,940
i'm a hitman baby

238
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,800
i'm a hitman baby

239
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,760
I don't lie.

240
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,200
I don't steal.

241
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,600
I don't rob.

242
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm a double-naught doctor.

243
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,020
I'm a killer for bars.

244
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,760
The enemy is the general.

245
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,840
He's a cat named Gordon.

246
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,480
Me!

247
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,880
If I go down, I'm gonna go down swinging.

248
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,860
If I grow old, it won't be gracefully.

249
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm gonna trip and fall and pass it off as dancing.

250
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,540
I'm gonna croak and moan, say it's a new kind of singing.

251
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,420
I'm gonna go down swinging.

252
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,620
If I go blind.

253
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,400
Still have my sense of touch.

254
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,860
I'll just feel your body that much better.

255
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,740
If I go deaf, I'll blame Leo Fender.

256
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,560
Don't ask for who the bell tolls.

257
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,920
I can't hear it ringing.

258
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,980
I'm gonna go down swinging.

259
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,880
I'm gonna go down swinging.

260
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm gonna go down swinging.

261
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,220
It'll lose my sight.

262
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,100
I plan to keep on playing.

263
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,040
Sometimes you can see more with less information.

264
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,800
Just ask, take all.

265
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,440
Case, order, and wall.

266
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,360
On the day he died.

267
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,480
He said, I think I'm finally learning something

268
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,620
Gotta go down thumping

269
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,160
If I go down

270
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm going down to the country

271
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,820
Just a little farm shack

272
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,920
For my baby and me

273
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,380
And a couple old dogs

274
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,980
And no air conditioning

275
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,160
Chickens and a garden

276
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,140
And all that we can hear the guitar twanging

277
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,020
We're gonna go down swinging

278
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,800
If I go down

279
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm gonna go down laughing

280
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,140
At all the cosmic change

281
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,360
Jokes that've been told to me

282
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,280
Watch the lines between

283
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,560
Profound and pointless

284
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,900
Just remember one thing

285
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,520
You can't forget about me

286
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,700
I'm swinging

287
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,940
Just remember me

288
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,520
Just remember me

289
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,380
I'm swinging

290
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,320
Just remember me

291
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,320


292
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,320


293
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,320


294
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,320


295
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,340
Just remember me

296
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,040
Well, how's the weather, Dave?

297
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,640
It sucks. How do you think it is?

298
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,120
Right. That's what I asked.

299
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,760
I just wanted to remind you of something depressing.

300
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,340
Actually, it was really hot here.

301
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,780
I mean, really hot.

302
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,560
We, we...

303
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
I had hoped to have a good time.

304
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,040
To avoid that part.

305
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,320
But we didn't.

306
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,580
It's still kind of hot.

307
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,880
We did get to see the grass turn overnight

308
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,180
from green to yellow

309
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,040
and become like glass.

310
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,700
It's like one minute,

311
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,740
all this grass out here is just...

312
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,020
It's full of chiggers

313
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,200
and knee-high.

314
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,280
And then suddenly it becomes just dead.

315
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,680
Dead, dead, dead.

316
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,360
And cracked.

317
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,720
Weird.

318
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,140
Yes, the grass becomes like glass.

319
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,220
When you step on it, it shatters.

320
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,520
That's when it's super hot.

321
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,860
I remember the only time I was in Tahash

322
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,000
in my entire life

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,540
and tumbleweeds.

324
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
I actually went out in front of the road

325
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,720
and trained me.

326
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,280
Yeah.

327
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,520
My wife reminded me that they're just tumbleweeds,

328
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,700
you cowboy type person.

329
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,400
I went, ooh, yo, ooh, ooh.

330
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,520
You're some cowboy.

331
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,920
Yeah, really.

332
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,020
We saw a Rudd Runner yesterday.

333
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:33,720
Yes.

334
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,160
Actual Rudd Runner.

335
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,500
They behave kind of like the cartoon Rudd Runner.

336
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,120
That's why they chose it.

337
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,060
I saw one day run across,

338
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,340
damn it, the hound dog sleeping back,

339
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,680
then do a back flip and shake his tail at him

340
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,600
and stick his tongue out and go boop, boop

341
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,820
and run off again.

342
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,260
I swear it's true.

343
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
They're so beautiful.

344
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,320
Their markings are really beautiful.

345
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,560
What about those bunny...

346
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,980
Oh, yeah.

347
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,700
And jackalopes.

348
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,880
The jackalopes...

349
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,120
Well, actually, they're a pest

350
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
because, you know, they're insectivores

351
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,720
and they...

352
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,140
They're...

353
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


354
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,140


355
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,360
They use their little antlers

356
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,220
to dig holes in your lawn.

357
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,040
We had a jackalope living under the porch.

358
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,640
My grandson saw it scamper off one day

359
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,600
and you saw...

360
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,940
You saw damn it chasing that jackalope.

361
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,020
Yes, I thought damn it caught the jackalope.

362
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,740
But I think he lets him go

363
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,800
so he can chase him again.

364
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,480
I think so, too.

365
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,500
You know, he could break its neck.

366
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,360
It's not any bigger than a rabbit.

367
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,100
Is that the dog's name is damn it?

368
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,820
Damn it spelled with an E.

369
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,620
D-A-M-M-E-T-T.

370
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,420
Damn it.

371
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,560
Ah.

372
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,800
Although it sounds the same as if you're...

373
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,480
Only with...

374
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,280
It's like D-Ham-it for Dashiell Hammett.

375
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,700
Yes, it's like Dashiell Hammett.

376
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,320
Damn it.

377
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,300
And he discovers various crimes

378
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,500
while he's a private...

379
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,020
This dog is kind of like that.

380
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,840
He's out to solve crimes

381
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,540
and stop them before they happen.

382
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,360
The crimes of pharma...

383
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,220
Do you have a pretty red-haired secretary?

384
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,640
That's true.

385
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,700
Yeah, it's great being able to have a big old dog.

386
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,480
It really is.

387
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,400
It makes you feel safe when you go for a walk.

388
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
And that's the least thing you are,

389
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,100
is safe when you take a walk.

390
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,580
Well, we're surrounded by deadly snakes,

391
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,640
all kinds of venomous reptiles.

392
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,880
You know, Texas horned lizards.

393
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,400
Those things spit poison blood into your eye.

394
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,120
You know that, right?

395
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
Horned toady lizards?

396
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,760
Actually, those guys have been driven out

397
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,500
all the way.

398
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,700
Out to West Texas by the fire ants

399
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,040
who came in and ate all of their diet

400
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,180
or competed with the red ants,

401
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,680
which are the main diet of horny toads.

402
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:00,040
And I spared the life of a huge red harvester ant hive

403
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,060
in our yard because I decided

404
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,080
I'd rather have them than the fire ants.

405
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,960
And I don't want to get in on the bad side

406
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,340
of the red harvester ants.

407
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,540
You don't want to...

408
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah.

409
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,520
You don't want them to...

410
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,400
to pinpoint you as an enemy.

411
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,940
They will eat your entire body.

412
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,580
Isn't that true?

413
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,700
Well, if you lay there still enough, they can, I suppose.

414
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,020
It might take a while.

415
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,320
It would be a bad way to commit suicide, Dave.

416
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,940
If that's how you're planning to commit suicide,

417
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,760
I'd think of something else.

418
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,560
Yeah.

419
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,560
Death by slow consumption by harvester ants.

420
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,800
That doesn't sound good.

421
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,540
No.

422
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
It would take a lot of discipline.

423
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,200
To be one of the ants?

424
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,660
No.

425
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,440
They're victim because it would take weeks.

426
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,600
Oh, you'd have to be very serious about being...

427
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,120
Yeah.

428
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,900
Yeah.

429
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,380
Now, I was going to ask you another Western question,

430
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,120
if I may.

431
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,840
What were these bunny-like things

432
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,520
only with real long bunny ears?

433
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,580
Much longer than Ohio bunny ears?

434
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,060
They're real long.

435
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,140
Those are jackalope.

436
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,040
That's the jackalope.

437
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,140
No, jackrabbits.

438
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,100
I was driving in the Great Basin area of Nevada,

439
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,500
a place where, like, gas stations are 100 miles an hour.

440
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,260
It was quite beautiful, but it was nighttime and it was moonlit.

441
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,680
And I thought I saw one of these, like, bunny rabbits

442
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,640
with the real, real super long ears.

443
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,960
And then I saw a bunch more, and I tried to swerve,

444
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,520
but suddenly I think I wiped out about, like, 10 of them.

445
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,100
I hear, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

446
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,340
Oh, no, Dave.

447
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,060
And hundreds of them were crossing the road

448
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,260
without, you know, without any semblance of understanding

449
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,560
that a car was nearby.

450
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,880
Sorry, yeah.

451
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,180
Yeah.

452
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,320
By the time I would have stopped.

453
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,760
But what are they just, like, regular bunny?

454
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,100
They're not bunny rabbits.

455
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,900
What are they?

456
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,200
They're jackrabbits.

457
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,100
They're lemmings, Dave.

458
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Those are the deadly long-eared lemming.

459
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,900
And it's a good thing that you ran over so many of them

460
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,660
because they're more venomous than lemurs.

461
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,320
And they would have followed me to my own death

462
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,500
by making me be the last person to jump off the cliff.

463
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,620
I know how they think.

464
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,520
They're like Republicans.

465
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,420
Or not.

466
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,840
I didn't mean that word.

467
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,160
You know what I'm saying.

468
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,640
I'm sure you don't.

469
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,300
Well, I have witnessed a migration of box turtles,

470
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,820
and that's across a highway,

471
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,680
and that's why there aren't many box turtles around anymore.

472
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,240
In fact, the guys, the boss man I was riding with

473
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,320
was deliberately hitting them.

474
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,980
It sickens me when I think of that.

475
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,360
And on X Day,

476
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:40,960
He'd do it.

477
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,480
He'd do it.

478
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,480


479
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:41,480


480
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,660
He was a nice guy generally,

481
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,680
but I'm going to have to turn him into a box turtle on X Day

482
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,980
and run over him a few times.

483
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,260
Yeah, I'm afraid he didn't.

484
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,060
That'd be juicy.

485
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,140
It's very important that we maintain a somber degree of funniness.

486
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,900
This comedy is very serious.

487
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,840
This board was working.

488
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,640
These mics were working through this board earlier.

489
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,300
Yeah, they are.

490
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,660
Do you have amazingly long fingers?

491
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,240
No, I don't.

492
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,920
Okay, but they seem that way.

493
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,800
Okay, well, I guess they do.

494
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,700
No, I have tiny hands, please.

495
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,020
Trump-like.

496
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,460
Whoa.

497
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,940
Today is your lucky day.

498
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,140
They seem slender like a young girl's.

499
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,120
What's this movie?

500
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
What movie is that?

501
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,920
I saw him whipping out his...

502
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,840
He was looking at...

503
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,900
Maybe this is some of those early Suzy flicks.

504
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,820
That would be something, dude.

505
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,000
Do you think that's what it is?

506
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,960
Oh, yeah, it's definitely Suzy porn from the 70s.

507
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,040
That's right.

508
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,600
What else could it be, peeps?

509
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,660
The depravity.

510
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,740
She was a dime.

511
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,580
TV and had equipment?

512
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,780
Argus probably has something.

513
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,580
I could watch this.

514
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,820
It's probably got something.

515
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,780
Cosmic probably has like a portable computer from the 80s.

516
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,800
Yeah, Cosmic designed one.

517
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,200
Yeah, they didn't make those anymore, so I designed one from a Pringles can and some duct tape.

518
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,280
So I made my own reel-to-reel projector with it.

519
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:07,760
Whoo!

520
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,980
Not letting shit stop me.

521
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,060
Fucking man.

522
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,300
And we're not letting Dave stop us, neither.

523
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,660
Nope.

524
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,360
Nope.

525
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,400
Nope.

526
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,980
Oh, there he is.

527
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,780
There's our Dave.

528
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,320
Mm-hmm.

529
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,340
Can you hear me or am I speaking Espanol, senor?

530
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Very clear.

531
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,420
Oh, very clearly.

532
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,080
I can't hear you.

533
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,520
Yes.

534
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,300
Well, I think there's some spasmodic movements going on, especially since the centrifuge is returning.

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,460
What about a centrifuge?

536
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:52,920
I built a centrifuge recently made out of spittle and Cosmic wax and little pieces of old lunch cakes and vitamin C.

537
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,020
And what prompted you?

538
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm not saying I enjoyed it.

539
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:05,360
I'm just saying that it's been quite a lugubrious experience.

540
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,120
Yes, Dave.

541
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,940
What was the impetus for your building of the centrifuge?

542
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,440
Are you making fun of me?

543
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,300
I am impetus.

544
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,140
Yeah, he's impetus.

545
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,500
I am not making fun of your impetus.

546
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,860
He has trouble with impetency.

547
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,300
I am, I am.

548
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,760
No, we were asking your motivation.

549
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,560
Why did you build a centrifuge?

550
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,700
Just to make yourself dizzy?

551
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,400
There's cheaper ways to do that.

552
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,780
Yeah, I was just going to say I'm already dizzy quite enough as it is.

553
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:38,680
Now, this is more to destabilize the subdominant, not sub-G's, but definitely subdominant.

554
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,280
Sub-dominant.

555
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,800
Hey, man, called that unofficial风, yo.

556
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:55,460
You created an en Eles toy, anderon, anderon.

557
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,460


558
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,100
In those days of crisis, kid, some people go gory on TV, maybe己 tea time on TV.

559
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,260
Ah.

560
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,640
Wally.

561
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,040
There's only through потch, that sort of thing.

562
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,980
While some people talk, but we don't know who's talking why.

563
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,880
Kriszmar?

564
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:10,900


565
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,220
No.

566
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:11,420
Just a little bit more.

567
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,420


568
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,420


569
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,060
And the most part of the elite system.

570
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,500
Yeah.

571
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:21,360
And since they're mostly on the side of the rich, then, I mean, I, well, but that's what you do.

572
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,560
Whatever you are that's bad, you say that's what the other guy is.

573
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,240
Well, I remember you just telling me recently over the last weekend from your beautiful home,

574
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:37,420
when your dog comes up and rests by your feet when you're up there working and stuff like that.

575
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:38,860
Yeah.

576
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,680
Yeah.

577
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,900
Oh, man, I had this great connective thing with dogs and people and everything.

578
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,640
I forget what the hell I was doing.

579
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,940
Yeah, I could tell you forgot.

580
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,380
What did you say?

581
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm sorry.

582
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,620
I said, whatever I said, you better pick up on it.

583
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,960
And I did, and I dropped it like a soap bucket.

584
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,740
Never mind, I quit.

585
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,560
It was slippery from the soap.

586
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,360
That's why you dropped it.

587
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,520
Yeah, soap.

588
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,160
Soapy.

589
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,420
Soapy sails.

590
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,380
At least I didn't bend over in the shower to collect my wits.

591
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,540
A slippery character, that lonesome cowboy, Dave.

592
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,740
Yes, he is.

593
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,680
Oh, you asked me while I was building a centrifuge, and I remember now.

594
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,760
I was going to take care of all my enemies.

595
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,260
Are you going to spin them to death?

596
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,600
Yeah, I'm going to make them dizzy.

597
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,040
Separate the liquids from the solids.

598
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,080
Yep.

599
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,500
Just like in the bathroom.

600
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,280
Oh, you know what?

601
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,880
No, that's what Dr. Hammond does his foul work.

602
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:52,780
I have an interesting religioscientific factoid that could break the hearts of many people, were they to believe me.

603
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,840
But it's true.

604
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,560
Or if they had hearts.

605
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,900
Well, the Air Force uses centrifuges, right, to train pilots.

606
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,260
Right.

607
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,420
So for incredible g-force of takeoff.

608
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,660
The Air Force has learned that they can induce a classic near-death...

609
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:09,660


610
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:18,700
out-of-body experience simply by spinning a person so fast that all the blood goes to the back of their head.

611
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,560
Isn't that interesting?

612
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:34,680
It's the exact same that people, these pilots who undergo this, report exactly the same sensations as people who have experienced what they call near-death experiences.

613
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,420
People who believe they have died and gone to the other side just long enough.

614
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,320
They don't have to see what it's like.

615
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:48,760
Well, they may be doing that, but they may also be seeing what it's like to have the blood flow in their brain altered.

616
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,320
I personally believe that.

617
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:59,900
And I think anybody who's listening right now should Google or otherwise search for Neighbor World, the book that I was doing.

618
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
There's a good change of subject.

619
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,240
I've got a copy.

620
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,400
I was tying in the subject, but now I'm having a hard time once again.

621
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,260
Remember what the connective...

622
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,660
Oh, yes.

623
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:23,280
The drug inducement as produced by centrifuges on the facial area, like when you're gyrating in a spoon gasm and stuff and listening to Jamaican music and your face starts going...

624
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,680
Like that.

625
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:31,080
And they do take selfies of it, but your face is all blurred out from the G-forces and stuff like that.

626
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:38,660
But people would just quite easily just stare at some light pattern for a short period of time and their minds would be changed.

627
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,360
And I think that's the key to the problem.

628
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,360


629
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,200
I'll show up now.

630
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,540
I'm sorry.

631
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:48,080
Dave, I have a copy of Neighbor World, and we were calling this the final proof.

632
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,400
But, Princess, we noticed something.

633
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,140
Noticed another mistake that you didn't notice and I didn't.

634
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,920
And it's on the back cover.

635
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,600
Your last name is spelled wrong again.

636
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,300
Oh.

637
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,920
It's spelled with a capital L on the front.

638
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,740
And on the inside...

639
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,240
In fact, Princess, we found...

640
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,920
Oh, no, I did.

641
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,520
I found that the copyright...

642
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,920
Your name was misspelled on the copyright thing, even though I had corrected your name right under it on the art credits.

643
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,100
Oh, shit.

644
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,280
So now, in theory, I guess what I have to do is go back and change the cover.

645
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,420
And then it'll be published for sure.

646
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,740
But I think if I do that...

647
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,860
Then we can go ahead and call it done.

648
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,600
And I'm hoping that by next week...

649
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,700
Well, actually, by the time the internet listeners hear this...

650
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,740
Not the Cleveland listeners, but the internet listeners in a few days...

651
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,660
In a few days...

652
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:02,660
You should be able to get on Amazon.com or CreateSpace or SubGenius.com

653
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,380
in the book part of the catalog and order Neighbor World by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

654
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,260
And it's okay for me to say that because I'm not making any money off of it.

655
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,900
I will off of future books that we publish.

656
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,700
But...

657
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,360
But that means it's okay to talk about it on this public-supported radio station.

658
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
Oh, that was a good excuse.

659
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,720
And a guy...

660
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,240
You'll like this, Dave.

661
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,580
A subgenius who lives in Mexico.

662
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,140
And is a Mexican citizen.

663
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,940
Requested that I read more Neighbor World on Hour of Slack.

664
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,500
Because he said he really enjoyed it.

665
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,020
Listening to it on the bus.

666
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,100
Going to...

667
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,540
Cuernavaca or someplace.

668
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, someplace.

669
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,680
This guy lives in...

670
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,420
Calexico or Mexicali.

671
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,660
One of those two towns.

672
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,380
Oh, so he's a Norteño type of dude.

673
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,400
Huh?

674
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,100
Oh, wait.

675
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,540
Is that a Norteño type of dude?

676
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,500
Or is that a...

677
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,680
He's a Mexican subgenius.

678
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,320
But I wonder where that state is.

679
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,340
It's...

680
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,940
Oh, I've almost been there.

681
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,600
It's a...

682
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,300
The very...

683
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,600
Like the León type area?

684
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,220
No.

685
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,560
It's right on the other side of the border.

686
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,540
South of the Salton Sea.

687
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,080
Yes, now it rings a belly button.

688
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,820
Calexico is a little California town.

689
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,300
Yes, I agree.

690
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,080
South of the bizarre Salton Sea.

691
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,540
And right across the border from that is...

692
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,480
Mexicali.

693
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,860
I may have those names reversed.

694
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,920
The one in the States is a wretched...

695
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,000
No, Mexicali is a place.

696
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,940
The one on the American side is a wretched, toxic place.

697
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,520
Indeed.

698
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,540
Well, people there are getting sick because the Salton Sea is just...

699
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,280
The government has quit trying to deal with it.

700
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:07,080
And it's just going to dry up and turn into a giant dust bowl of toxic, toxic crap.

701
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,660
It's making people very...

702
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,160
Very sick.

703
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,760
In that area.

704
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,180
Can I ask you a question right now?

705
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:19,560
Did we have a dream one time that we wrote the script, you and I, that was called Salton Sea?

706
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,180
Or did somebody already do that?

707
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,900
And it was like there's people, you know, living out their lives, living near the Salton Sea,

708
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,100
knowing that it's killing them, but it's so cheap to live there.

709
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:37,440
And they're just using this strange white, real bright white light and dark images from that Salton Sea area.

710
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,520
Did we do that?

711
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:38,720
Did we do that?

712
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,740
Or did somebody else do it?

713
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,120
I think somebody else did.

714
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,120
Okay.

715
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,420
I'm fascinated with that area.

716
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,600
Princess Wee and I got to drive through there and creep around the ruins.

717
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,280
Yes.

718
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,700
And take a lot of pictures.

719
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,560
There are still people living there and you can get a house for about 10 bucks.

720
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,440
But keep in mind that the temperatures reach 130 degrees in the summertime.

721
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:03,840
Yeah.

722
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,660
Yeah.

723
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,140
I thought that would be brilliant, you know.

724
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,700
Put down...

725
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,380
I think David Lynch is to shame dealing with an environment like that.

726
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,280
And the people who've escaped there because they want to get away from the law

727
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,860
or somehow they want to become Norwegians and they can't ice skate or anything like that.

728
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,380
You know, like the special chimpanzees with brassieres.

729
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,820
Oh, you can do stuff that no Norwegian can do.

730
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,680
At the Salton Sea, you can almost walk on the water.

731
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,720
It's like syrup.

732
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,660
It's beautiful looking, smells like dead fish.

733
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,680
And the beach is literally complete.

734
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,700
It's composed of fish bones, not sand.

735
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,440
Fish bones and bird bones.

736
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,520
Looks like syrup with a layer of cake on top.

737
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,700
Oh, boy.

738
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,740
Yes.

739
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,440
You know, wouldn't that be disturbing if you were to live in such a...

740
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,660
Well, it takes a special person to live there.

741
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,920
There's a couple of documentary movies about it that are fun.

742
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,920
Great name, too.

743
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,180
Salton Sea, period.

744
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,460
That's the name of the series.

745
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,140
And it's every bit darker than Lynch's Graveyard Spumatumies and Axel Spumatis.

746
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,980
Oh, it's like a cross between...

747
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:26,100
Living in Salton City or Bombay Beach would be like living in a David Lynch movie

748
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,120
directed by David Cronenberg.

749
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,420
It's auto-surrealism.

750
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,160
It's very surreal.

751
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,080
It's a very surreal environment.

752
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:47,980
And the fact that all of the buildings, almost all the buildings are in ruins and covered with graffiti.

753
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,800
Yes.

754
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,180
Man, it's a really...

755
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,940
I mean, I'd love to go back there more.

756
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,020
But that's why I happen to know about Mexicali and Calexico.

757
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:00,840
Yes.

758
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,940
Yeah, boy, do you have a great memory?

759
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:08,160
You just brought that all the way back to Calexico, which is also a great industrial byproduct.

760
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,920
At least when I...

761
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,540
Okay, there was...

762
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,120
First, there was my uncle, Pornicato.

763
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,900
Then my cousin, Desistin.

764
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,200
And then my other cousin, Fermano.

765
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:23,320
And they together decided to form a union of independent socialist states, you know?

766
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,260
But instead, they were overcome by grief and angst and nausea

767
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,220
and had to commit themselves into the middle institution

768
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,300
that we're also very proud of.

769
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,980
And we're glad that this industrial strength type of outlook towards everything,

770
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,580
is curing the addiction problem we have here in the United States.

771
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,680
Dave, did you have a nephew named Fromaggio?

772
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,620
No, I just made that up, but I was...

773
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,100
Oh, okay.

774
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
He said Pornicato.

775
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,640
Oh, Pornicato.

776
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,280
Okay, okay, sorry.

777
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,220
They're Italians.

778
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,060
Oh, don't worry.

779
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,080
You don't have to cry about that.

780
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,380
I just wanted to make sure that I didn't get stuck under the, you know, the falls, so to speak.

781
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,520
Well, here I found...

782
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,940
I can read a bit of Neighbor World for our friend

783
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,100
that describes, that sounds like it's talking about the Salton Sea towns.

784
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,820
It says here, these are screen directions,

785
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,660
Car Town, New Neighbors, Series of Shots, All Angles.

786
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,120
The first shot showed a scene of the Car Town family

787
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,160
that was so deformed by change,

788
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,280
Jerry-era tox mutations,

789
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,940
that you had to angle the source left

790
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,880
to VU them face-to-face.

791
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,100
This amazing genetic offering knew about guzzlers,

792
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,620
how to maintain them and keep them running,

793
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,600
even restored them to their original condition.

794
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,180
Well, that sounds like Reverend Angry Larry.

795
00:41:59,560 --> 00:41:59,940
Yeah.

796
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,280
No, it's Reverend Angry Dave, which...

797
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,100
Ah, not cabbage rolls, which...

798
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,780
You know who I'm talking about.

799
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,680
Well, we should have X Day at the Salton Sea.

800
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,120
That would be even more deadly than having a Stein Ranch.

801
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,060
That would be really bizarre, man.

802
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,240
That's definitely...

803
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,760
You should do that online.

804
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,660
Well, actually, it's nice in the winter.

805
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,220
Photoshopping stuff and create a reality

806
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,300
that a bunch of fake newsers will love.

807
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,760
Oh, thanks for doing that.

808
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,300
I wish I was online right now, so I would do it.

809
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,720
Well, you know, we have to have a sec.

810
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,340
We have to have two X Days now,

811
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,040
according to the Beacon Project

812
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,160
and all the other stuff.

813
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,080
We've learned from that locker.

814
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,420
And the Salton Sea does look like the end of the world.

815
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,700
It looks like everything's over.

816
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,080
Yeah, if you do it during the wintertime,

817
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,980
it's actually kind of pleasant.

818
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,540
It's in the 70s in the middle of January

819
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,560
in the Salton Sea and Stein Ranch.

820
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,840
But...

821
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh, by the way,

822
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,880
we've been thinking about our friends

823
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,180
in Houston, Austin, and San Marcos

824
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,340
and that whole part of Texas.

825
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,480
But people don't need to worry about us.

826
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,700
For one thing, we're not there.

827
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,180
And even if we were in Texas,

828
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,060
we'd be so far away from the coast,

829
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,940
it wouldn't matter.

830
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,460
Stanksville is not affected

831
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,340
because it's two states away from the coast.

832
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,540
Two normal-sized states.

833
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,400
So, yeah.

834
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Well, I'm glad you brought up the abnormality

835
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,880
of the state of Texas

836
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,680
because we've wanted to know about

837
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,080
the little secret.

838
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,140
Oh, yeah.

839
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,780
The greatest little whorehouse in Texas

840
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,220
that you...

841
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,140
Hey, a mouse is eating my phone.

842
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,580
I hear it.

843
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,020
It does sound kind of like a mouse.

844
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,920
It sounds like he's chewing on the lawn.

845
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:52,400
Yeah.

846
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,720
Holy crap.

847
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,860
Throw him some cheese.

848
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,380
Throw him some cheese, Dave.

849
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,780
I'll try to find some cheese.

850
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,320
Wait, hang on.

851
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,520
Let's...

852
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:04,920
We can...

853
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,360
Now, Dave used to have the buzz.

854
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,560
Yes.

855
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,180
And we're not hearing the buzz,

856
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,960
but we're hearing...

857
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,540
You know, he's talking on a...

858
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,820
One of those old, old, old telephones

859
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,080
that have a wire going into it.

860
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,380
Uh-huh.

861
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,500
And it has a dial that goes around

862
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,600
and around and around.

863
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,860
I don't know about that,

864
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,420
but I know it's so ancient

865
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,100
that it's a landline.

866
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,460
And the line itself is cheesy.

867
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,520
And mice love cheese.

868
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,740
They like your name.

869
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,120
Can I call you back on my cell phone?

870
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,920
Uh, sure.

871
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,080
Sure.

872
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,680
Now it's stopped because I said that.

873
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:44,920
Right.

874
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,440
That's right.

875
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,340
Yeah, it's not...

876
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,740
You should have said that sooner.

877
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,900
As long as you don't move,

878
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,220
you have to hold completely stock still,

879
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,100
paralyzed,

880
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,680
not move.

881
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,820
Don't even move your tongue.

882
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,980
I'm doing that right now.

883
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,520
I'm totally immobile.

884
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,560
I'm totally immobile.

885
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:08,940
You sound immobile.

886
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,380
I do.

887
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,680
Oh, mini, mini mobile.

888
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,500
Yeah, it's not making much difference.

889
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
I'm going to have to call you back on my cell.

890
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:16,860
Is that all right?

891
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,240
Uh, yeah, sure.

892
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,780
Okay, I'll talk to you in a few seconds.

893
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,160
Okay, I'm going to drop you.

894
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,260
All right.

895
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,940
He's dropped.

896
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,900
He dropped you like a hot potato.

897
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,620
I'm monster hunting.

898
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,700
With this music.

899
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,040
Well, yeah, that is...

900
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,940
Music from my favorite video game, Monster Hunter,

901
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,200
which I don't get to play much

902
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,460
because I'm working so hard for Bob.

903
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,660
Actually, I'm working for myself,

904
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,920
but that also happens to have...

905
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,100
Well, my job is being a preacher for Church of the Subgenius

906
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:07,380
and office boy and janitor and carpenter and lawn...

907
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,460
Boy.

908
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,760
Oh, here's lawn manager.

909
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,520
And light bulb replacement person.

910
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:13,820
Ja.

911
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,500
You're Swedish over here, too.

912
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,140
Can you read me?

913
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,320
I can read you.

914
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,760
Well, sort of.

915
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,860
Can you read me loud and clear?

916
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,040
I can read you in this book neighbor world, but it's...

917
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,100
I don't always...

918
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,700
Well, there's been a couple of parts I didn't understand.

919
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,920
A couple of conversations between the characters where I'm thinking,

920
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,160
Dave must experience other people in a different manner than I do.

921
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,120
Because it was...

922
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,860
You're talking about parts that seem like they might be interior dialogue

923
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:54,560
and yet they're in the same paragraph with an actual retort?

924
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,880
No, no.

925
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,520
Oh.

926
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,860
I've never...

927
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,680
I mean, those characters work a job sort of like your real life job.

928
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,940
And I never had that real life job.

929
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,520
So I never had to deal with no-go-bo-go.

930
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,040
Or jerks.

931
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:08,120
Or jerks.

932
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:08,460
Like that.

933
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,900
I had to deal with completely different kinds of jerks.

934
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:11,780
Right.

935
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,640
But there's still many jerks in the whole field of endeavors.

936
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,220
Well, actually, I was in the field of documentary movie making.

937
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,100
So in that respect, I was pointing sources.

938
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,020
Actually, I'm working on the documentary now.

939
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,460
In fact, I'm working frenziedly on it.

940
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,080
Because those ladies making the subgenius documentary,

941
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,060
need a lot of help finding the cool old footage.

942
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,060
And only I can do that fast enough.

943
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,660
So I've been going through the ancient, ancient footage.

944
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:57,300
There's a bunch of Cleveland devival home movies.

945
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,800
With baby Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and baby Princess Wee,

946
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,100
and baby Reverend Stein, and living Chaz.

947
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:06,980
Baby Regan.

948
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,720
I love the babies.

949
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,400
And the baby Jesus.

950
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,440
I love baby Jesus.

951
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,240
I love all forms of babies.

952
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,120
I like to french fry them like a Korean tennis shoe,

953
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,680
and then melt them slowly over the cheese.

954
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,500
Yeah.

955
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,120
And yet you're against abortion.

956
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,240
And yet I'm still against abortion.

957
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,380
You're right.

958
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,180
You are my friend.

959
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,400
I hope Dr. Sinister is listening,

960
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,460
because he's got a lot of recipes for baby.

961
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,200
Yes.

962
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:36,900
Yeah.

963
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,760
Well, I hope.

964
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,000
I hope he gets to do his own barbecued pictures

965
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,520
of those chimpanzees modeling lingerie stuff.

966
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,000
You're getting me turned on now.

967
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,580
You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?

968
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,720
Of course.

969
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:56,300
Hey, Charleston, our wonderful show host before us,

970
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,440
mentioned that he had read recently that some people were saying

971
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,220
that kids that are born now will live to be 150.

972
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,180
I thought that was really horrifying.

973
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,400
Because one of the things I'm most glad about is that I'm not going to be around

974
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,360
to see what is going on 150 years from now,

975
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,680
because I don't think it's going to be good.

976
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,260
Certainly not going to be pretty.

977
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,480
We have a very jaundiced view of the future, I must say.

978
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,180
Well, you know, the horrible thing is my grandkids will think it's normal.

979
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,780
Stuff that we would feel is horrifying,

980
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,980
but I could see my dad looking at modern times that way at the age of 88,

981
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,120
just before he died.

982
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,400
To him, everything was going to hell in a handbasket.

983
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,840
But it is getting, some things are getting worse.

984
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,300
People are remarkably ignorant these days.

985
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,400
And I'm starting to wonder if maybe I'm part of the last generation

986
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,260
to have enough knowledge to understand what we're about to lose.

987
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,320
Because...

988
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,600
It's more incursive writing, believe me, Mr. Penrinship.

989
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,700
I fear for my grandchildren.

990
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,180
But to them, it'll be normal.

991
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,320
Yeah, that's the problem.

992
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,080
They think everything's freaking normal when it's like

993
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,400
we overlook a couple million dead people here and there and stuff.

994
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,000
Next thing you know, genocide is now wiping out 90 bazillion people

995
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,100
or the entire planet.

996
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,600
And it's still not a crime.

997
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,520
Well, I think it's...

998
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,180
I think it'll be Mother Nature that does most of it, really.

999
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah, I think they've been keeping the dams plugged down there

1000
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,840
on the Gulf Coast for quite a while with the, you know,

1001
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,340
temperature up here like 59 degrees and the temperature down there

1002
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,860
in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico area and stuff like that,

1003
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,760
like water temperatures of 90 degrees.

1004
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,860
Come on, that's got to go somewhere.

1005
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:04,480
And them violent hurricanes they said they was going to have?

1006
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,820
Well, that's exactly what they had.

1007
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,880
Was it a more violent hurricane?

1008
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,920
I'm sorry.

1009
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,620
Well, the important thing is our president two weeks ago

1010
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,760
dismantled all of Obama's flood regulations.

1011
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:33,260
Obama had put into place certain regulations to, you know,

1012
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,500
to encourage cities to work harder on their infrastructure.

1013
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,240
Infrastructure to avoid flooding.

1014
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,920
Well, Trump decided that wasn't good for business.

1015
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,780
So, no, they don't have to do that anymore.

1016
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,960
It's okay to just let your city flood.

1017
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,440
I guess, you know, it'll make money for the construction workers

1018
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,660
and the rescue workers.

1019
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:01,740
They have to come in and rebuild literally every single structure in Houston.

1020
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,580
And the National Guard are supposed to be able to handle some of them,

1021
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,420
and yet they're privatizing even rescue efforts.

1022
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,920
I mean, yeah, they're supposed to make the scene when stuff like this happens.

1023
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,460
I mean, at least that's what they get underpaid for and stuff.

1024
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:23,320
Boy, talk about a greed cabal of greasy capitalist swine mongers

1025
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,620
who are completely crazy.

1026
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,600
You sound like you're describing my hero, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1027
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,380
Completely crazy swine monger.

1028
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,320
He is crazy.

1029
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,560
Crazy.

1030
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,620
A what monger?

1031
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:40,640
Did I say that?

1032
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,720
A greed monger.

1033
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,700
I said that.

1034
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,680
Oh.

1035
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:52,180
Once again, you know, the chimpanzees with the fine, fine, fine lingerie.

1036
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,500
Hey, Princess, we came up with a word for what we do.

1037
00:52:59,340 --> 00:52:59,900
Yes?

1038
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:01,960
Extemperadio.

1039
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,200
Oh, that's cool.

1040
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:04,740
Yeah.

1041
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,960
I wrote it down.

1042
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,300
Extemperadio.

1043
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,400
Oh, speaking of which, just before you called in,

1044
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,100
I was playing something that I didn't give credit for.

1045
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:19,060
We'll probably hear a little bit more when I shut us down in about two minutes.

1046
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:29,060
At Tarzan's radio station, it wasn't just Dr. Howell and me.

1047
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,240
I ended up slacking off a lot of the time and letting other people do shows.

1048
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:47,780
I was getting let throughout, and he was up on stage to counsel.

1049
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,000
And the reason I got in came pretty require.

1050
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:50,080


1051
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,780
That was when I was doing a very cool job, it wasn't a delirious достumous performance

1052
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:51,780


1053
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:51,800
He was rather gloomy, but that was it.

1054
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:51,800


1055
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:51,800


1056
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:51,800


1057
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:51,800


1058
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:51,800


1059
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:51,820
that is at the front, 절� Hermes.

1060
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,620
The Da劉e show off.

1061
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,100
They created that show,겠?

1062
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,000
Or I think they did that withき 어�pter show.

1063
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,420
I didn't even say his name,2000.

1064
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,260
I'm just starting to cut that stuff up.

1065
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,780
God, there's hours and hours and hours of it from X Day.

1066
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,240
But I think I'm going to save it until we get to Texas in five weeks and edit it.

1067
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,500
Then, because here we've got the radio station.

1068
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,060
And you sound a lot better on the radio.

1069
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,260
Well, actually, you know what?

1070
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,060
I was listening to some stuff we recorded from the Texas studio, and it sounds fine.

1071
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:26,980
It sure does.

1072
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,800
It sounded just about the same as this.

1073
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,120
Yep.

1074
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,220
With my crappy little microphones.

1075
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:32,740
Yep.

1076
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,800
With the bearskin rug looking down upon us as we record.

1077
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,100
You don't get to see the bearskin rug, though.

1078
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,620
No, but I have imagined voluptuous hot ladies, like, laying on the bearskin rug,

1079
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,660
showing that there are apples and crying to the abnormal, you know, friendly creatures.

1080
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,120
That would be a trick, because the bearskin rug is on the wall, not the floor.

1081
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,700
Who says there has to be any kind of gravity involved?

1082
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,020
Some of them, you know, like, fly like one.

1083
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:10,920
Someone with a hefty dose of fly genes could crawl up the wall and begin singing one of those oafish dilemma songs about the new, you know.

1084
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:19,800
Well, Dave, actually, in Texas, the gravity is a little stronger than it is in Ohio, because it's a bigger state.

1085
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,880
Well, yeah, and you have to support more dinosaurs on the staying range, too.

1086
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,880
And they always lived under the zero gravity zones back in the old days.

1087
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,720
No.

1088
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,880
There's more gravity, not less gravity.

1089
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,260
Gravity is a little stronger in Texas.

1090
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,580
That's why that rain is falling so hard there.

1091
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,420
Oh, man.

1092
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,500
It's not raining there, is it?

1093
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,120
No, not in Stang'sville, not at Stang Ranch.

1094
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,320
We'll be lucky to get a few drops from Harvey.

1095
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,560
If Harvey spits a little bit on Stang Ranch, that would be great.

1096
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,280
But you know what?

1097
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,540
We have to go.

1098
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,760
It's almost time to end the show.

1099
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,840
Oh, no.

1100
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,100
I didn't know that.

1101
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,420
Well, I did actually know that.

1102
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:17,340
I was imagining an elderly woman, like maybe about 95 years old, taking off her brazier and panties and chasing me around the entire housing area.

1103
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,700
I mean, you know.

1104
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,080
Well, thanks for sharing that with us, Dave.

1105
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,780
I can see that's wishful thinking on your part.

1106
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,260
Well, no.

1107
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,320
Everybody should have their own dreams and wishes.

1108
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,020
Come true.

1109
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,660
Just like Santa Claus and all the elves and Jerry Lewis.

1110
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,680
Okay, Dave.

1111
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,080
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1112
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,260
Was I doing something wrong?

1113
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:46,620
No.

1114
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,240
I did nothing wrong.

1115
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,600
Episode number 1637.

1116
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,380
And for more information on the Church of the Subgenius, Hour of Slack, and the stuff that we play,

1117
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:06,500
if you didn't get the credits, you can find them online at subgenius.com,

1118
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,680
where you'll also be able to buy Dave's book, Neighbor World, soon.

1119
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,700
And with that, Dave, we must go.

1120
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,060
We must.

1121
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,920
We have no choice.

1122
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:18,720
Goodbye.

1123
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,660
See you, Dave.

1124
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:19,980
Goodbye.

1125
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,640
That's it.

1126
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,040
Okay, we'll pull that down.

1127
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:29,360
Okay, now back to the lads of Thor.

1128
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,220
You're seeing urine pod crust.

1129
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,420
All right.

1130
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,800
Is that good background music?

1131
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,960
I think we should have a 70s background.

1132
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,600
I feel like we should have the soundtrack to Holy Mountain by Jodorowsky playing.

1133
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,180
You're so into that guy, man.

1134
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:43,980
He's really good.

1135
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,600
I've never listened to him.

1136
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,260
Break open the fridge and get us some Pepsi.

1137
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,100
Some Pepsi.

1138
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,220
Don't.

1139
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,220
Don't admit to any crimes in Caffeine that we could be prosecuted for at a later date.

1140
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,420
You want the middle or you want the side?

1141
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,880
Lucky Pierre.

1142
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,600
You'll take the middle, Donnie.

1143
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,500
Push back a little.

1144
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,320
That's it.

1145
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,680
Snuggle up.

1146
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,160
Well, here's hoping everything records.

1147
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,900
Well, we'll see.

1148
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,560
We're professionals.

1149
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,980
So, it's been an exciting time here at X-Day 2017, whatever the fuck we're calling it.

1150
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,780
The last one.

1151
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,820
The last one.

1152
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,840
The good one.

1153
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,000
The good one.

1154
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,880
The one you.

1155
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:28,800
Missed.

1156
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,060
By not being here.

1157
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,560
So, what'd we do so far?

1158
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,220
Well.

1159
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,400
Mayhem, peas.

1160
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,660
Utter mayhem.

1161
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,180
Right?

1162
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,020
Exactly.

1163
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,460
Bob's dead again.

1164
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,920
Mayhem with a double M or something.

1165
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:43,540
Surprise.

1166
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,320
We're good this time.

1167
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,560
Kill Bob.

1168
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,880
He didn't see this one coming.

1169
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,540
Or did he?

1170
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,440
A lot of people didn't.

1171
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,280
Did he?

1172
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,980
I think he knew all along.

1173
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:55,940
No.

1174
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,020
No, I didn't.

1175
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:57,880
No, I.

1176
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,020
I.

1177
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,280
I believe last night after the.

1178
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:04,540
The radio transmission from the XS came through.

1179
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:12,680
The feedback more than likely short circuited an XS implant in my own brain.

1180
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,020
Which resulted in my.

1181
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,420
Willing.

1182
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,640
And forceful destruction of our deity.

1183
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1184
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,100
What was the means by which you carried out this destruction?

1185
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,020
I.

1186
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,860
Dragged him.

1187
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,660
him by a rope

1188
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,260
around his neck

1189
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,660
face down

1190
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,720
in the gravel

1191
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,540
and threw

1192
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,040
him into a blazing

1193
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,540
inferno. Head first into a blazing

1194
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,520
inferno of death.

1195
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,620
That's what we did to Bob.

1196
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,560
Well, Argus, I was kind of hanging out.

1197
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,280
Yeah, Pease again.

1198
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,820
Everybody else was just roasting weenies on top of him.

1199
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,800
You guys were like, oh, let's go burn Bob.

1200
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,560
And at that point, they didn't

1201
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,520
even know that it was the remains of Bob.

1202
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,740
Some people were just like, oh, it's time

1203
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,720
for hot dogs. Pease and I did

1204
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,540
indeed burn hot dogs when we had

1205
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,380
sharp sticks.

1206
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,340
Sharp sticks in the dark.

1207
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,780
Here was Syria.

1208
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,980
You know, there's no lights out here.

1209
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,600
There's a lot of ways you can trip. It's really

1210
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,820
amazing there's so many surviving subgeniuses.

1211
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,780
And the stones are very pointy.

1212
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,520
Very pointed sticks.

1213
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,780
Fucking pointy? Well, no, I'm talking about the stones

1214
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,300
when you're just walking around on the ground.

1215
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,420
You know, you don't want to be looking for sticks.

1216
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,440
Ah, a fucking rock got my foot again.

1217
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,200
Uh, don't tell me what to do.

1218
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,260
I'll tell you what to do.

1219
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,280
For our viewers at home.

1220
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,000
I thought I was babysitting tonight.

1221
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,880
You were supposed to be and then you

1222
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,620
just stupidly decided to chase yourself again.

1223
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,380
Yeah, go finish your applesauce.

1224
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:40,940
Okay.

1225
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,740
Where's Grandpa Pease today?

1226
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:46,420
Not here.

1227
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,660
That's exactly right, kids.
