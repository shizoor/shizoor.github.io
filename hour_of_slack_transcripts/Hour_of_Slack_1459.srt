1
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,560
No one can do it better.

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,860
Kick it!

3
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
Another UFO sighting.

4
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,300
This one, front page headlights.

5
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,420
Another hour of slack.

6
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,920
Another small, dedicated moment of misery.

7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,300
As the turtles melt into the river.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,160
And now a satanic Elvis arrives in his UFO.

9
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,840
His skin is so blue like Krishna.

10
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,340
Why not make some coffee to keep them all happy while I think of something?

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:18,960
Coffee?

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,540
Coffee break!

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,840
Nice hot espresso enema for yourself.

14
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,240
I mean, Mr. King.

15
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,560
Coffee can only make me nervous when I drink it.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,320
You look like a man who could use more coffee.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,720
Free coffee is a constitutional right.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,400
You got any coffee?

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,680
Coffee?

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,340
Yeah, coffee.

21
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,520
No, I don't drink coffee.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,260
That, sir, is illogical.

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,240
Nothing like a great cup of black coffee.

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,520
How to drink coffee, sir?

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,500
Hit yourself over the head with a baseball bat.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,320
Would you please?

27
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,020
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,300
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,760
Everybody take coffee.

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,180
Now.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,100
Move!

32
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,420
Damn, Jimmy.

33
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,220
This is serious gourmet.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Mob.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,940
It's the best, man.

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,200
I got it from a stank.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
My advice to you.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,320
Start drinking.

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,800
Drinking heavily.

40
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,900
What is this?

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm not saying, but I can tell you that it's fairly rare and very unstable.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,280
I like my coffee like I like my women.

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,320
Frappy.

44
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,220
Bitter and murky.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,200
Oh, you'll like this coffee.

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,000
It's fresh.

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,940
I got blood.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,320
What is that?

49
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,920
I'll take it.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
That's strange.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,900
All of a sudden, I don't quite feel like myself.

52
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,120
Do you feel like once the paparazzi got friends?

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,020
Put that coffee down.

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,880
Too bad.

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,340
Just to be a good man.

56
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,780
Pray we're going to have to liberate George.

57
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,080
But you know what's on my mind right now?

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,760
It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,060
It's the dead Bob in my garage.

60
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,460
Have you got a dead Bob in your garage, my friend?

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,040
How many times are you going to kill that old sod before he finally wakes up to what you're doing out there?

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,860
Don't you care?

63
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,080
Don't you even care about the children of the dead Bobs?

64
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,200
With alacrity and with a great amount.

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,840
With a round of applause.

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,100
But the souls of the dead Bobs are rising up.

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Dead Bobs in garages around the country.

68
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,460
They're leaving their garages.

69
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,060
Lots of coffee.

70
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:21,700
And now the army of Bob clones emerges from the garages as far as the eye can see down the long line of suburban driveways.

71
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,560
Followed by the corpses of the Armenian olive stuffers.

72
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,560
It looks like quite an entourage.

73
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,020
I can smell.

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
I can smell the smoke in the distance.

75
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,620
I don't know if some of them are being smoked or are actually smoking themselves.

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,780
And it looks like quite a cloud.

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,640
These Dobbs clones, as they're called, are the perfect smoking machine.

78
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:57,660
And as well as the perfect selling machine have decimated the economies and the air of every city they've passed through in this wave of destruction and sales.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,860
Now, Turb.

80
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,100
I'd just like to make up one thing I'd like to ask the panel here of Miss Wee and the turbulent Ivan Steng.

81
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:11,980
Many of these corpses appear to have been eviscerated and yet they managed to make steam, as it were.

82
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,880
I don't know whether it's the cold weather or the fact that they've been eating the wrong things.

83
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:23,240
They're freshly dead, the Dobbs clones, when they're finished using them.

84
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,140
I hope I don't have to spell that out.

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,920
Leave the corpses.

86
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,280
The corpses.

87
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,000
The used pinks, as they call them, behind.

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:41,140
And, of course, there's no natural scavengers or predators to dispose of the bodies anymore.

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,520
The Dobbs have also had their way with the buzzards and so forth as well.

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Well, there's plenty of that.

91
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
It's a serious, serious situation.

92
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
There's plenty of it.

93
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,740
We're hearing right now, at least, that there's plenty of that natural jelly surrounding most of the corpses.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
Well, everywhere.

95
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,380
Everywhere these Dobbs clones go, as you know, they leave the cotter pins and the jelly.

96
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,800
No one understands that.

97
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,200
It's been going on for decades now.

98
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,440
Well, they go loose as soon as we put a pin on them.

99
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,600
Jellies, dead bodies.

100
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,900
Yes, that's exactly right.

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,860
Just as bad as any bad Romero or good Romero films we've seen in the last 500 years.

102
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:25,020
These shuffling dead Dobbs are certainly the most horrible manifestation of religious cultism, superstitious nonsense.

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,780
Oh, my God.

104
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,020
Oh, my God.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,720
Oh, my God.

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:27,720


107
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,740
They're coming to the station now!

108
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,420
Oh, my God.

109
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,120
Oh, my God.

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:39,360
Well, we just thought a methamphetamine lab blew up down by the river, and next thing we knew, we were covered with pipes and honkers.

111
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
That's not funny, man.

112
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,940
Methamphetamines are the scourge of the Pobuckers of America.

113
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,360
They're the scourge of Christ.

114
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,720
I lost a lot of friends to bathtub meth.

115
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, we lost the Lord.

116
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,720
He was actually stressed.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,020
I lost the plug of the drain where they made the...

118
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,980
They made the bathtub meth.

119
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,600
Jell-O.

120
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,660
To bathtub meth.

121
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,320
It became as vapid as...

122
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,540
No, it just ate up the...

123
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,160
Vaporize.

124
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,700
Yeah, vaporize the plug.

125
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,420
Very plug.

126
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,040
Meth vaporizes the plug in your head, my friend, so that nothing...

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,000
You know, it all builds up, and it can't drain out.

128
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,400
You know, sooner or later, it's going to have to leak out.

129
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,180
Oh, man.

130
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,300
It's like a corpus callosum.

131
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,640
It's dried like a prune.

132
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,960
Hey, there's talk now of a...

133
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,340
The Columbus Devival.

134
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,560
You didn't hear about that.

135
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,080
No.

136
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,900
That Reverend Janina Grinder was going to put on somewhere around Columbus.

137
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,460
And the band that's...

138
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,980
One of the bands that's going to be there along with loathsome Cal Frunk Dave and the

139
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,340
retarded creatures of slime was Stylex.

140
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,200
Stylex.

141
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,820
Oh, man.

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,820
But that was a recording from a long, long, long time ago.

143
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,420
Oh.

144
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,560
It's funny.

145
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,660
We've been doing some house cleaning lately for weeks.

146
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,200
And one of the things that was unearthed in the excavations was a CD marked

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,840
Hour of Slack for Mom, or Best of Hour of Slack.

148
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,320
For...

149
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,780
Jayge.

150
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,080
It was for...

151
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,140
And I realized this was something I put together.

152
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,200
I put this together about 10 years ago for Princess Wee's mom.

153
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,300
And she didn't send it to her mom.

154
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,120
But she will.

155
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,500
And that's what we were playing.

156
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,160
It seems to be an Hour of Slack from the year of 2005.

157
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,120
You hear certain references to campgrounds that we don't use anymore.

158
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,620
And the year is actually mentioned at some point in there.

159
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,000
Hmm.

160
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,300
And this is a suspenseful Hour of Slack, friends.

161
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,260
For me only.

162
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,500
Not for you.

163
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,600
Because I really have no idea whether the phone lines have been fixed yet or not.

164
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,180
And when Lonesome Cowboy Dave calls in for real, then we'll find out.

165
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,940
The news may be good, may be bad.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,780
But either way, we have an Hour of Slack.

167
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, I'm dangling from those Tinder.

168
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
I'm getting my Tinder hooks too, dear.

169
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,040
That's true.

170
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,580
We don't know what kind of show it's going to be.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,880
But at the very worst, it'll be more of this.

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,000
I guess, you know, I...

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
What are you asking a tantalogical question?

174
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,920
In the first place, you showed that there is the question in front of you.

175
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,020
First, I must ask you a question, friend.

176
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,920
What question did I ask?

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
You asked what is the meaning of Slack?

178
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,400
That is the first question you were asking.

179
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,760
Then you're asking how does Bob relate to the meaning of Slack?

180
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,620
Does anybody really know what's Slack?

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,420
Meaning!

182
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,000
It's something you gotta feel way down in your...

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,160
Way down in your...

184
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,820
You know, what's the part of your tevas?

185
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,460
Yeah.

186
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,860
You gotta feel it way down in your spinal column.

187
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,040
Hey, hey, hey.

188
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,420
You don't need to feel down in her spinal column.

189
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,340
Mr. Cowboy.

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,620
Hey, quit cleaning the...

191
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,140
Cut.

192
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,940
The out-of-control cleaning cowboy.

193
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,860
Hey, this is a tantric spot right here.

194
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,180
Oh, what's...

195
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,660
It's absorbing my finger.

196
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,660
Hey, what...

197
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,540
Listen here, boy.

198
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,380
Kids, don't ever...

199
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,340
Don't ever try to do what I'm doing right now.

200
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,320
No, man, don't ever use your digits to mess with the digital delay.

201
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,420
I mean, think of what happened to Tom Delay.

202
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,980
You know, he spent too long.

203
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,520
And now look at him.

204
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,220
Just do what I say, not as I do.

205
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,520
I'd like to ask you, you children.

206
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,120
You children?

207
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,840
Who are the children of tomorrow to think on this problem?

208
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,360
And as we go through the upcoming academic year,

209
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,420
along with the other members of the department,

210
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,920
we're going to try not only to bring you the most...

211
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,600
the best education we possibly can,

212
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,000
but a wholesome environment in which you can thrive and...

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,680
and get...

214
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,040
Okay, get the implant away.

215
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,680
Get the implant away from...

216
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,620
Get the implant away from that child.

217
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,680
Get...

218
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,220
We have to remove the bruscus,

219
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,020
which is the part of the proboscis which hangs itself daily

220
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,860
at the witching hour

221
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,960
and then rehangs itself on the wall.

222
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,180
It's dreadful.

223
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
It's horrible.

224
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,500
It's...

225
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,020
It's...

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,600
It's...

227
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:55,780
It's...

228
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:55,880
It's...

229
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,000
It's...

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,080
It's...

231
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,340
It's...

232
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,380
It's...

233
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,280
It's...

234
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,280


235
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,300
It's...

236
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:00,520
It's...

237
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,520


238
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,520


239
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:00,840
It's...

240
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:00,860
It's...

241
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


242
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


243
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


244
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


245
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


246
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


247
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:00,860


248
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,440
But in the meantime,

249
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,160
you should know that you can always get more information

250
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,320
about the dreadful church of the subgenius

251
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,780
by dialing in to www.subgenius.com.

252
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,620
There's no O in subgenius,

253
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,200
but there is in .com.

254
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,180
In fact, there's actually two if you think about it.

255
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,520
Friends, you can also check out

256
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,880
the subgenius radio ministry hour.

257
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,560
Slack by way of the U.S. Postal Service.

258
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,820
By writing to us.

259
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:41,820
That's us at Post Office Box 181-417-Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

260
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,880
To whom are you making your address?

261
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,500
How are you speaking to Ohio?

262
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,140
Who are they?

263
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
4-4-1-1-8.

264
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,360
Once again, who are you?

265
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,200
Who are they?

266
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,940
I don't know who they are.

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,480
I've never seen them before in my life.

268
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,640
Yes, if I knew better, I'd say they were here for a different reason than you had in mind.

269
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,980
I don't know it anywhere.

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,780
What's it look like, then?

271
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,320
Well, it's red with yellow wheels.

272
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,900
I mean, blue with orange wheels.

273
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
It's all in the mind.

274
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,900
Well, then, what do you think?

275
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,260
I want to go see the Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

276
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,500
I want to go see Red Mist.

277
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,640
I want to go ride on Red Mist.

278
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,960
I want to go see the Brother Justin Seven-Headed Devil.

279
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,060
Search and destroy.

280
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,980
Search and destroy.

281
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,880
Come on, come on.

282
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,220
I want to go see the Antichrist and buy...

283
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,240
Okay, now just...

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,640
I just want candy apples.

285
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,160
Quiet down or you're not going on any of these damn rides.

286
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,540
First, you pull up your pants.

287
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,760
You're crying out loud.

288
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,940
You look like a shoe baby.

289
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,060
Whatever the hell that is.

290
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,820
So, order caffeine.

291
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,840
And tie your shoes, by the way.

292
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,100
I'm going to go kill that devil preacher, Bob.

293
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,680
Stan, you'll get plenty of chances to kill lots of things if we go on Red Mist or search and destroy.

294
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,280
No, man, I know why I've been given these powers.

295
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,420
I've been given these powers so I could go be the one that kills Bob.

296
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,080
Well, you'll get plenty of chances to try your powers out on these new war rides.

297
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,740
I'm going to kill Bob and save the world, man.

298
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,680
Ah, you can kill anybody you want and win a medal for it or maybe even a Googie Prize.

299
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,280
Really?

300
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,180
Have you ever seen one?

301
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,620
They're as big as the sun and they fit neatly on anyone's chest.

302
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,820
We can go to that recruitment place and join up.

303
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,060
Oh, no, that's for later.

304
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
First, we're going to take a ride on Red Mist.

305
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,440
I just step inside the little capsule here.

306
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,420
Oh, man, this is authentic.

307
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,140
Shut up.

308
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:49,380
This is scary.

309
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,660
Please don't go on the Red Mist ride.

310
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,820
This is the unfriendly neighborhood that has...

311
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,200
I don't want you to go on the Red Mist ride.

312
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,700
...insurgency all over the walls and...

313
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,080
Up, here comes a Red Mist!

314
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,120
Somebody just exploded an anti-personnel...

315
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,040
Oh, that was backwards, wasn't it?

316
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,080
Of course it's backwards.

317
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,780
It's all backwards.

318
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,620
The planets you live on.

319
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,060
The cheese you eat.

320
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,700
The factories you smell and the olfactory feats you perform.

321
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,340
Everything in here is controlled.

322
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,840
The Red Mist.

323
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,200
The search and destroy rockets.

324
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,020
The little rides that take the children to teach them about war.

325
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,820
For it is what they need to learn.

326
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,660
Yourself, why have you enlisted?

327
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,460
Oh, carnival today.

328
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,120
Everything has been so backwards and upside down and inside out

329
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,060
that I just had to come here to see if I could figure it all out.

330
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,680
Well, there's no chance of that.

331
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,800
Everything's going to look pretty much askew as it did before.

332
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,360
But if you just put your hand here on the little plan gar...

333
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,400
I don't know if I should do this.

334
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,700
Oh, you have to do it.

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,820
It's taking your decoder name, your special eye patch now.

336
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,300
Ah, that looks good.

337
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,860
You look like a real pirate.

338
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,380
You're going to be able to kill lots and lots of people and scare them before they die.

339
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,220
And it could feel real good.

340
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,600
But remember, if you step on the wrong thing...

341
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,940
Red Mist.

342
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,980
I'm nervous. I'm really, really nervous.

343
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,780
And we're nervous too because we don't know exactly what's going to happen when we drag on...

344
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Dave!

345
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,620
Is it there?

346
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,240
Is it there?

347
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,900
Something's there.

348
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,420
It's not only there.

349
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,280
There's no ocean.

350
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,680
There's no ocean.

351
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,480
I knew they were going to do away with that stuff sooner or later because it's just so large and so hard to find things there.

352
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,500
They just ban it completely.

353
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,040
Princess, we spoke way too soon.

354
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,540
Pardon?

355
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,160
The ocean is there.

356
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,460
Oh, the ocean is there.

357
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,180
Yeah, I can hear the faint misty.

358
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,200
But it's not too bad.

359
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,720
It's not bad.

360
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,380
We can proceed.

361
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,440
Dave.

362
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,420
So let's proceed as we may.

363
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm having a hard time hearing you.

364
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,200
But I think it's because I perforated my eardrum with my fist.

365
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,980
I didn't like what I was hearing.

366
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,900
Your mama told you to quit doing that.

367
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,080
Quit starking your fist.

368
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,920
Your mama.

369
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,800
Is everybody going deaf or is it just me?

370
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,420
Yes.

371
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,960
You are surrounded by people losing their hearing.

372
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,060
It is true.

373
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,460
It is true.

374
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,200
It is true.

375
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


376
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


377
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


378
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


379
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


380
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


381
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


382
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


383
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


384
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,200


385
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,220


386
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,700
It's not nearly quite as large as I thought you were.

387
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:35,480
I thought you were like about 355, 750, another 50 number pounds, full of weight.

388
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,500
Very meaty, gristly type of guy.

389
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,580
He used to argue with his referees and his friends on the team.

390
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,440
I was but I'm fading away into the red mist, Dave.

391
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,420
Fading, fading away.

392
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,200
How so?

393
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,200
Because I'd rather be on the podcast.

394
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,200


395
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,200


396
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,280
I've been on the radio for a long time.

397
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,500
They're going to get my body all the time now.

398
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,200
That's why.

399
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,540
But it's okay.

400
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,180
We don't need to dwell on that.

401
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,880
Although I wish I could dwell on that.

402
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:18,080
Quite a bit of bait there to such a sophomoreically, painfully oriented show to sit back and let

403
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,820
that go by.

404
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,560
But I suppose I will.

405
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,220
Dave, have you ever...

406
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,180
Have you or your granddaughters ever been on a show?

407
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,180


408
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:25,180


409
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:34,440
heard of a franchise for children called Monster High. Monster High? Monster High.

410
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:44,580
Yes. As in Monster High School. Yes, yes I have. I'm sorry. Well Princess, we and I

411
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,180
have become intermittently interested in that. Of course it has monsters, it has

412
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:57,220
girls, what's what's not to like. Although it being a show for, in this

413
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,640
case, a show for girls as well as a line of toys, it teaches them to be weirdos

414
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,120
they're all exactly the same and cute. It's alright to be different as long as

415
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,720
you're pretty and popular and basically all the same. All types of

416
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,440
monsters can be the same.

417
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,000
The

418
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:28,940
The Monster High movie that we downloaded and watched was the most recent one, Fright Camera Action.

419
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:40,420
And it had me really worried because throughout this discussion of the history of the monster world, when they'd left the old world and come to the boo world,

420
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,660
they actually left the conservative monsters behind in the old world, and the more liberal monsters came to the boo world.

421
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,880
At no point was there any mention of humans ever having existed.

422
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,640
Well, maybe they never did at the time. You know what I'm saying?

423
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:07,360
Well, we later found evidence that there had been humans earlier because the first movie was about the...

424
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,960
We saw the trailer for the first Monster High movie, and it was about the humans versus the monsters.

425
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,640
But presumably, in the intervening three movies, the monsters killed everyone.

426
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,220
And ate the humans, I would hope.

427
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,420
Yeah.

428
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:26,640
As the sassy urban werewolf girl said, time to kick some bat.

429
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,100
But this particular monster... See, you hear the ocean in there, Princess Wee?

430
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,440
It's a tiny crumble. It's not a big crumble.

431
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,900
It's a pretty bad crumble, but we'll proceed anyway.

432
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,660
We apologize.

433
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,280
See, I can't hear a crumbling. I can hear more like these...

434
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,580
These little...

435
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,740
Dwarf reptiles.

436
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,340
And they make a real high-pitched sound.

437
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,960
And I think they're being mind-controlled, too, but I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

438
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:01,020
The dwarf reptile. What was her name? Sally Forktongue or something? I don't know.

439
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,240
Sally Ann.

440
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:13,300
We spent an entire... We completely wasted and yet greatly enjoyed a whole day of doing nothing but looking into this Monster High thing.

441
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,480
And we found a lot of evidence of...

442
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,920
Sort of subverted, subgenius messages in the details.

443
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:31,780
The plots and the dialogue are insipid, like anything networked for 12-year-old girls or for anyone, period.

444
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,820
Including this show.

445
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,360
But the art details were great.

446
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,900
And the hair on these monster girls is just hypnotic.

447
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,800
You could just stare at their hair blob shapes.

448
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,420
Flowing.

449
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,880
Yeah, they're shaking around.

450
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:01,280
They didn't render each hair like in a Peter Jackson movie, but they rather made the hair look like licorice or taffy.

451
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,160
Something delicious.

452
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,040
Twisted, pulled taffy.

453
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,940
Yeah, swollen cheese. That's like in the microwave and stuff when you forget.

454
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:17,440
And the little girls depicted on this cartoon as role models walk exactly like hookers.

455
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:18,980
Prostitutes.

456
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,800
And thrust their hips forward and, you know, walk with their little butts clenched in such a way as to...

457
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,540
They walk like hookers with lots of attitude.

458
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:39,960
Yeah, well, and that's the way, I guess, our daughters and granddaughters are being raised to be pretty monster hooker girls.

459
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,960
But they reject...

460
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,320
How can I complain?

461
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,020
Well, yeah.

462
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,380
That is, if it wasn't one of your children.

463
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,040
And smart.

464
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,000
They're all nerdy and smart.

465
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,720
And also, this is, as far as I'm concerned, an example of a sociological problem.

466
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,360
When this starts to happen, that means there's something wrong.

467
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:09,200
When underage girls are supposed to look like they're 22 and stuff, there's something wrong.

468
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,260
I hate to sound like a...

469
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,100
Well, you know, that's been going on since time...

470
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,200
Time.

471
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,260
Neo-Nazi says.

472
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,040
In memorial.

473
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,320
My daughter would...

474
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,560
I'd drive her to school and she'd get out of the car and run into the school restroom and put on makeup.

475
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,360
And just before I picked her up, she would wipe the makeup off.

476
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:39,920
You know, that's what little girls do, I guess, because they've been programmed by old men like us.

477
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:47,640
To create a sort of a marketing device, a mercantilism, if you will, that's dependent upon this...

478
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:54,000
This natural thing, whatever it might be, to control evolution.

479
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:04,280
Well, that was another issue that was brought up in this Monster High movie, I think the fourth or maybe fifth in the series, Frights, Camera, Action.

480
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,120
The problem of...

481
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,800
The villain was a racist vampire named Count Stoker.

482
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,640
Of course, half the characters in this movie do a Bela Lugosi imitation.

483
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,380
But...

484
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,260
And there were many types of vampires.

485
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,820
Some not as pale as others.

486
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:33,840
But Count Stoker was a racist or a speciesist or a monsterist in that he wanted to take over the world and not...

487
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,980
And oppress all other monster types.

488
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,140
They actually said that.

489
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,580
They said monster types.

490
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,220
And of course, you know, there's your creature amphibious types.

491
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,960
Your Frank...

492
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,160
Your...

493
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,340
Frankie N. Stein, Frankenstein's daughter.

494
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,800
The hero of this one was Dracula's daughter, Draculaura.

495
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,480
And...

496
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,460
Draculaura.

497
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,600
All very cute, but it was interesting to see that they were...

498
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,860
They were talking about how...

499
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Well, the bad guy was gonna...

500
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,960
Was of a different genus.

501
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,120
Yeah, he thought that vampires were like the superior race and they were gonna keep the werewolves down and so forth.

502
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,860
We've seen this story before elsewhere.

503
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,180
It was...

504
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,560
My favorite of the...

505
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:29,000
You know, eventually, looking at a movie like this over and over in slow motion, you start to get kind of turned on even by these little stick figure creatures.

506
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:39,940
And my favorite one ended up being a ghoulie who was this very special monster in that her way of talking was like this.

507
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
She was a living dead.

508
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,300
She was the daughter of the living dead.

509
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,420
And...

510
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,640
And...

511
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,360
Kind of reminded me of Reverend Pantiera, actually.

512
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,120
But...

513
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,580
And she would say...

514
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,280
And other people who spoke zombie could translate for her.

515
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:04,840
But it was interesting that she was kind of like, you know, the autistic monster child.

516
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,800
And in that respect, they were trying to be diverse.

517
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,400
And yet, she was also described as the smartest kid in school.

518
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,060
So even though she couldn't talk anything but...

519
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:24,920
She nonetheless could work a computer better than anyone else and solve the Scooby-Doo type of crime that they were dealing with.

520
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,540
Kind of like an autistic cyber hero.

521
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,560
Yeah.

522
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,020
Yeah.

523
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah.

524
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,240
She's a hot little autistic cyber hero with kind of cockeyed looking.

525
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:43,140
She was the only monster girl that wasn't completely normal looking.

526
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,980
She has bad posture.

527
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,780
She has no bones.

528
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,900
The expressions resemble certain...

529
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,980
The ways of doing that are very manga and anime oriented.

530
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,100
Or not manga but very anime oriented.

531
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:55,920
Yeah.

532
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,840
And I think, well, I just think that it's kind of a worldwide kind of thing.

533
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,480
Well, that...

534
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:13,120
That him to be nipped in the bud like a sacrificial rose named Ernestine or something.

535
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,120


536
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:22,520
And then we plug back into the main filter cabinet and reduce by a series of say seven or eight each time.

537
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,740
Man, you took the words right out of my mouth when you said that.

538
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,220
We'll be right back to genetic equilibrium the way we want.

539
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,600
When the Uber race comes about, if that can happen, everybody's going to be on easy street.

540
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,880
There'll be so much slack.

541
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,540
We won't need Bob Dobbs or any of this.

542
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,340
There's...

543
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,500
Does that sometimes remind you of Bernard, Princess Wei, when he gets like this?

544
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:46,880
Yes.

545
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Yes, he does.

546
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm sorry.

547
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,700
I didn't mean to sound like Bernard.

548
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,500
I meant for Bernard to sound like...

549
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,680
No, we love Bernard, actually.

550
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,540
We do love Bernard.

551
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:54,920
Yeah.

552
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,900
And we love you.

553
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Well, he has an implant, Bernard, and I do not have any more, any longer have an implant.

554
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,840
He's still...

555
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,240
His literature is...

556
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,400
Well, forget about it.

557
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,040
Well, what I was going to...

558
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,320
What I was leading into is that there is something...

559
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,320


560
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,920
There's still discrimination even among monsters.

561
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:22,500
And, for instance, in this movie, there was a real throwaway moment where you saw a yeti

562
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:30,920
hauled by in a cage, which is a horrible thing to see, except the yeti was playing a video

563
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,100
game, very obviously.

564
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,120
Now, also...

565
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,780
Well, it was more to the theme of...

566
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,560
When...

567
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,760
It's more thematic, like of a monster club, the way that Mondo's Retardo Band interpreted

568
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,820
that old classic movie.

569
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,120
Monster Club.

570
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,600
Yeah.

571
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,100
Yeah.

572
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,560
It took...

573
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,700
It wasn't really Vincent Price's Monster Club.

574
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:55,120
It was more that some monsters were nicer, better, stronger, faster.

575
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,000
Well, they were all better.

576
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,180
And the real point was that...

577
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,720
Who were the real monsters?

578
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,580
The humans.

579
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,360
Hitler, Pol Pot, Paul McCartney.

580
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
Those are the real monsters.

581
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,520
It's not what you look like outside.

582
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,720
It's what you are inside.

583
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,740
And I was thinking about that.

584
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:11,740


585
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,200
thinking we know some people we have friends who would if they were evil would qualify as monsters

586
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:24,620
simply because of their weird physical appearance yes which startles you at first you get used to

587
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,520
it real quick of course like going to a nudist colony you know get used to the hideousness

588
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,920
with very quickly much faster than you thought you would in other words you don't even get a

589
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:42,180
kick out of it I'm sorry I just have to say I have to ask you personally and also we do

590
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:49,840
what is your take on these um these concepts like the Nephilim and the originators and you know

591
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:58,820
the existence and religion as a cargo cult and uh who married who for why would it even work

592
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,740
well like I say I don't think it's what's you know what you look like outside that counts so much as

593
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,660
as how ugly you are inside.

594
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,820
That's what makes you a subgenius.

595
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,560
Also, they're trying to censor, you know, everywhere you turn,

596
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,600
they try to repress your abnormality in the most subtle ways.

597
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,980
For instance, we tried to sign up for the Monster High fan club online, right?

598
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,380
Yes.

599
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,980
Princess Wee?

600
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,460
Yes.

601
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,380
And we thought, well, you have to make up a name or sign in as somebody,

602
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,540
and we wanted to be something cool.

603
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,520
And funny.

604
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,340
A funny name, a monster name.

605
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,360
So we thought, oh, we'll be Peep Peep Longstalking.

606
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,820
And it wouldn't let us.

607
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,120
It would not let us.

608
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,100
It said, sorry, you can't use that name.

609
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,980
And I don't think it's because somebody else is already using Peep Peep Longstalking.

610
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,740
I think it's because the name, anything with the word P-E-E in it

611
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,360
is banned from this children's club.

612
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,140
Children's website.

613
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,260
Well, and also stalking.

614
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:06,820
Yeah.

615
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,320
But your hero, I mean, your avatar, your name,

616
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,540
it's not a name that, it doesn't have anything to do with peeping.

617
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,560
It has to do with peeping and stalking.

618
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
Right, yeah, but the computer doesn't know that.

619
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,800
So I decided, we ended up using the name Reverend Seek,

620
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:30,720
but we should have, I wanted to try the name Audrey Tistic

621
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,020
and see if that would fly.

622
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,780
Just to see, you know.

623
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,400
No, it won't.

624
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,200
Well, it's, again, this comes back to the, of who is a monster.

625
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,720
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is included in the ranks of monsters,

626
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,540
but he's nothing but a well-meaning, deformed guy who doesn't talk very well.

627
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:52,940
Yeah.

628
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,400
He's a sympathetic character.

629
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,240
So is Frankenstein's monster.

630
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,220
He's not inherently bad or evil.

631
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,340
He's just misunderstood and immortal.

632
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,900
And ugly.

633
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,880
And very afraid of fire, to the point where it causes alarm in others around him.

634
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,680
Now, you know, some of that stuff is apocryphal.

635
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,740
It may be that they just came up with some of that for the movies.

636
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,320
The monster may not really have been afraid of fire any more than vampires

637
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,960
are really afraid of crosses.

638
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,680
Did not Shelley and the rest of them worship at the testicles of Baal,

639
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,780
the great god of horniness?

640
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,660
I mean, that was back in the,

641
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,100
when they all took Dilaudid for, you know, after the Canaanites and stuff.

642
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,420
They didn't even have Dilaudid back then.

643
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,500
That was the very late 1700s when Mary Shelley wrote that stuff, I think.

644
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,260
Have you ever read that?

645
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,760
Man, they use so many more words per novel.

646
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,300
Different words, I mean.

647
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,980
It's a proven fact.

648
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,100
God, they have words I just never heard of almost back then.

649
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,980
And then nobody knows them anymore.

650
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,560
They just.

651
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,620
They forgot them all.

652
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,380
It's all Stephen King and Danielle Steele and the Dave DeLuca novels in the airports.

653
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,480
You can't just, you know, there's no, they don't use those good big words.

654
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:17,360
Think of the Pobucker letters from the Yankees and the Rebels in the Civil War.

655
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,300
Stuff they sound like.

656
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,000
What?

657
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,520
You know what I mean?

658
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,100
But I know what you mean.

659
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:31,460
No, I mean, these letters were quite well constructed as far as literature was concerned.

660
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,540
And it took a long.

661
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,620
Time to convey there.

662
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,040
They weren't into the abbreviated journalistic style of today's modern cyber writing.

663
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,660
Lol.

664
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,460
OMG.

665
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,860
Well, but yeah.

666
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,580
And they're the issue.

667
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,720
The right part of me had gone, of course.

668
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:49,560
Long.

669
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,640
No, I'm sorry.

670
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,420
Well, in the olden days, their exposure to literature was largely the Bible on Sundays,

671
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,160
which is pretty fancy writing.

672
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,160
And Shakespeare on.

673
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:02,860
On Sundays.

674
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:10,960
So, you know, you got to, and people actually read novels for slack back then.

675
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,280
It was like a new novel came out.

676
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,100
That was like the new Star Wars movie.

677
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,120
Yep.

678
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,160
Penny, half penny horrors.

679
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,060
Dime the yellow backs.

680
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,080
They used to call them all these different names for these pulps you could read on your way to work on the train.

681
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,320
Or whatever conveys streetcar, you know?

682
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:29,960
Yes.

683
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,980
It is hard to read on a horse.

684
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,960
It's hard to do anything on a horse, to tell the truth.

685
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,000
That's one reason I don't ride horses anymore.

686
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,960
I thought it was because of the bite, the wound.

687
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,060
Well, that too.

688
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:54,800
I've been, you know, I've been bit, been stepped on, been thrown, and kicked in the head over and over and over and over again.

689
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,220
That's the worst part, when they kick you in the head over and over and over and over.

690
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,840
Sweet.

691
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,840
But, you know, here we are doing this show.

692
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,160
That's what it leads to, so.

693
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,800
Adds up.

694
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,820
It all makes sense.

695
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,540
There are elements included there that this is the logical conclusion, and that's what brought you here right now.

696
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,700
I'm sorry I overstated it, but that's, you know.

697
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,360
Well, sometimes a lucky accident is what solves the mystery.

698
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:31,940
In fact, I've noticed that in the Monster High mysteries, as well as the great Scooby-Doo mysteries of yore,

699
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,580
and Gilligan.

700
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,000
Gilligan's Island.

701
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:41,860
Often the mystery is solved by a lucky accident caused by the stupidity of the comedy relief character.

702
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,760
The Gilligan.

703
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,260
The Bob.

704
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,500
The Who-Dude, in the case of Monster High.

705
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,540
The Scooby.

706
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,520
The guy going Scooby-Doo.

707
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:57,460
The guy on mushrooms and the dog stumble accidentally, doing something they weren't supposed to do.

708
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,960
They stumble into the secret passageway.

709
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,300
And find the...

710
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,600
The vampire's heart and save the day.

711
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,220
And voila.

712
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,980
And prove it was all a trick by the evil old money-grubbing Republican.

713
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,320
Because these things are all biased, you know.

714
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,560
Well, that's actually true, but I don't know why you'd bring it up at that precise moment unless you wanted to get into one.

715
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,000
No, no, I don't want to.

716
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,220
No, I don't want to.

717
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,640
I couldn't help it.

718
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,580
Sometimes that...

719
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,300
Well, you know how the media is.

720
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,220
The rich guys are always the bad guys.

721
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,560
And they're always fat and cigar chomping.

722
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,180
Or skinny and...

723
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,400
Desperate.

724
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,480
You know, insecure.

725
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:34,940
No, no, no.

726
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,380
It's the bad guys usually are rich guys.

727
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,420
And they always have long hair.

728
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:38,860
Huh?

729
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,000
The bad guys usually are rich guys.

730
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,220
You were saying, well, you know, the rich guys are usually bad guys.

731
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,260
And it's usually...

732
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,680
It's the other way around.

733
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,740
Yeah, the bad guys are the rich guys.

734
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
I wish I could be a bad guy.

735
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,740
You can't, Sting.

736
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,520
I mean, you want to.

737
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,760
And that's what you try to come up as.

738
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,280
You know.

739
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,460
You know what you're trying to do.

740
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,160
You're trying to hoodwink some people.

741
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,260
But you don't have that kind of...

742
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,020
I just wish all the monsters could live together.

743
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,220
That's what I want.

744
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,880
I want all the types of monsters to be able to live together in peace.

745
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,160
In Monster High.

746
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,600
I need quality.

747
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,800
Now, that's different than Monster Hunter.

748
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,060
That's different.

749
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,660
All the monsters must die.

750
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,280
Yes.

751
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,920
Hopefully by my own hand.

752
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,600
Oh, of course.

753
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,400
With Stenberg's help.

754
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,040
I was in a rural camp for 12 days.

755
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,860
And we had each other's license.

756
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,220
There was salami.

757
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,540
We had salami sometimes.

758
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,700
But we had to, you know, like, pick each other's nits.

759
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,480
And stuff like that for food.

760
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,760
Because the vampires wouldn't feed us.

761
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,420
So, I just got up and left.

762
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,460
Well, I guess that bonding exercise didn't work for you.

763
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,100
Because the nitpicking is a form of bonding.

764
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:49,780
You know.

765
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,920
Well, there wasn't much...

766
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,000
Grooming, they call it.

767
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,420
Yes.

768
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah, but they'd have us go through these things.

769
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,140
They'd come up and they'd suck a little werewolf blood for a while.

770
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:58,880
And stuff like that.

771
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,460
And then they'd go...

772
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,580
Like that.

773
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,220
Like it was a bad thing.

774
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,340
But at the same time...

775
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,140
The blood of carnivores is not very tasty.

776
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,220
Herbivores are much...

777
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,700
I mean...

778
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,440
It smells like urine.

779
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,020
Yeah.

780
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,220
Human blood is not really that good.

781
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,240
Well, unless it's a vegetarian.

782
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,100
Or baby.

783
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,040
Or baby.

784
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,520
Yeah, baby.

785
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,260
Christian baby, hopefully.

786
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,840
Just kidding.

787
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,380
Just kidding.

788
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:21,780
Ha ha.

789
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,640
Of course, what I really mean is human baby.

790
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,620
A human baby.

791
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,820
I'm not prejudiced or bigoted that way.

792
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,540
Just...

793
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:31,980
Well...

794
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,580
We're all human bacon as far as I'm concerned.

795
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,780
We're all made to be fried and eaten by another being greater than ourselves.

796
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,540
We've got worms.

797
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,080
Worms.

798
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,260
That's what I was just...

799
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,840
Exactly the word I was going to use.

800
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,560
Because I think some of them got behind my optic nerves.

801
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,680
And are now chewing right into the corpus callosum.

802
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,060
And that's why I mistake certain objects for other objects.

803
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,380
Really?

804
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,860
Yeah.

805
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,200
You mistake your wife for a half-wit.

806
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,240
For instance.

807
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,360
Yeah, stuff like that.

808
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,040
Or, you know, mistake your foot for somebody else's foot.

809
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,660
It's a little bit more common once in a while.

810
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,540
The things I see flying through the air, sometimes they're reptilian.

811
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,080
Other times, you know, they look like...

812
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,820
What's his name in Star Trek 7?

813
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,460
Or is the Zorab or whatever.

814
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,740
The ones that, you know, had interior radar.

815
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,360
They could see in the dark and everything.

816
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,100
The Jedi Vulcan mentality.

817
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,180
The giant hats.

818
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

819
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,860
I think that was it.

820
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,300
And so, that's when I opted out of the whole thing.

821
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,020
Because he said I couldn't get my money back.

822
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,420
Right.

823
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,900
I mean, besides the frozen tissue.

824
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,800
That was completely, you know, no problem.

825
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,900
The lady was real nice.

826
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,020
You know, I talked to her half an hour.

827
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,900
She said she's going to North Carolina this spring to get this ticket.

828
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,480
What the hell is he rattling on about?

829
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,320
Hey, Dave, can you hear this background sound here?

830
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,380
It's frozen tissue.

831
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,620
Tissue.

832
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,800
That's what he's talking about.

833
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,640
Frozen tissue.

834
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,900
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,440
You know, sometimes they'll, like, don't put a...

836
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,300
Take a regular floor tack and stick it right in the middle of their nostril

837
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,180
to try and make a third one.

838
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,980
And I told them that you can't do that.

839
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,360
It's just that, you know, it could really harm yourself doing that.

840
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,740
Dave, the sound on this line has not gotten any...

841
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,640
Well, actually, it did just suddenly get better.

842
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,400
As soon as you said that.

843
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,280
As soon as I said that.

844
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,640
Yes, as soon as you said that, it stopped.

845
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
I wonder...

846
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,620
Abruptly.

847
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,260
As soon as you said that, it stopped?

848
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,820
Yeah, as soon as I complained about the bad audio on the phone line, it stopped.

849
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,780
So I guess we should just keep complaining.

850
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:47,720
Yeah!

851
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,020
I was afraid the show was going to get all boring because of the bad sound in the background.

852
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,040
And it was fighting with the music, which, again, was Hendrix stuff.

853
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,480
But all we have to do is complain, and they stop crumpling the paper.

854
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,160
Here comes the...

855
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,640
Master engineer, though.

856
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,980
Master cylinder.

857
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,000
He can tell us.

858
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,060
You could say...

859
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,820
Could I say...

860
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,940
Or something like that.

861
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,460
But the wiki squeal is always getting oily and stuff nowadays.

862
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Especially with...

863
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,020
No, but I didn't mean that.

864
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,940
What I meant to say was...

865
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,240
Yeah, that's a way of life for me.

866
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,960
I complain constantly.

867
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,780
Oh, you should be on the internet.

868
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,760
I am on the internet, but I just...

869
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,920
I don't know how or who it is, really.

870
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,140
Well, it doesn't matter.

871
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,760
It just does what people do on the internet.

872
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,440
They just whine and complain and talk about how everything that's new is so bad.

873
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,220
And everything that's old is so stupid.

874
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,020
It's funny.

875
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:49,760
And...

876
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,980
Yeah, but then the NSA sells the information to, you know, some corporate sponsor.

877
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Next thing, you're getting all kinds of emails saying,

878
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,960
you know, a brand new pair of...

879
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,700
Sweating's over.

880
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,520
Bad weather.

881
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,440
Well, they are in.

882
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,540
And stuff that they're not really in.

883
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,200
Now, Princess Weed, you hear when Dave talks, you hear the crumpling tissue paper.

884
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,080
The frozen crumpled tissue paper.

885
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,260
Actually, I hear it when you talk, too.

886
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,400
I only don't hear it when I talk.

887
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,000
That proves...

888
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,240
Two lines are screwed.

889
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,500
No, wait.

890
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,180
The only time I really don't hear it is when we all shut up.

891
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,420
Is this a hint?

892
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,040
Is this a hint from Bob and Connie that we're at the shot?

893
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,520
It's a sign.

894
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,220
We are not supposed to be doing this.

895
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,640
Don't worry about it.

896
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:43,860
Just...

897
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,680
You've counseled me that so many times.

898
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,980
Don't worry.

899
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,600
You're not...

900
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,380
You are...

901
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,180
You are slash are not losing your mind.

902
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,000
So who cares anyway?

903
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,860
So just don't worry about it.

904
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,500
Just don't worry about it.

905
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,080
That's the famous...

906
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:00,940
Don't do it.

907
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:00,940


908
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Don't worry about it.

909
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,180
And don't think about it.

910
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,820
Of course those are the famous last words.

911
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,260
You want it to end quick, don't you?

912
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,260
Fabulous last words.

913
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,880
Aren't you hoping that someone from some strange country

914
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,440
has been a root of commandeers and airplanes

915
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,240
right into your area where you live?

916
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,660
You know what?

917
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,860
I think I'm going to end this

918
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,880
and just go to the old tapes

919
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,760
of when you were actually in the studio with us.

920
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,260
Yay!

921
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,200
Is it really a crackling noise?

922
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,400
Or could that be the strength?

923
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,920
It all just...

924
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,080
Yeah, it's...

925
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,140
It sounds like crumpling frozen tissue.

926
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,680
Yeah, crumpling frozen tissue.

927
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,220
And your voice sounds crackly

928
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,560
and much older than you really are.

929
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,620
If you can even imagine that.

930
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,400
White with heart.

931
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,280
Yeah.

932
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,960
They said in...

933
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,260
They said in...

934
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,720
They said in...

935
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,200
What's his name?

936
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah, right.

937
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,740
That one Bob guy.

938
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,600
He did?

939
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,320
Yeah.

940
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,520
There's no crumpling.

941
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,120
The crumpling is gone.

942
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,960
You're just being mean now.

943
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,460
Oh, no, I see.

944
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,380
Okay, he's staring at me

945
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,040
and then the crumpling, it comes back.

946
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,860
Back in ear.

947
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,380
Crumple back in ear.

948
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,700
I'm going to go back in time.

949
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,380
And play the old tapes again.

950
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,080
Okay, well, it did come...

951
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,260
There were some moments

952
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,600
where it was not crumpling.

953
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,480
Is that right?

954
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,120
Right?

955
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,120
Right.

956
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,740
And it didn't often sound like

957
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,700
there were other unusual...

958
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,200
Okay, okay, okay.

959
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,200
Okay, okay, okay.

960
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,040
Feeling kind of nervy now, are you?

961
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,200
Ready to spank the future?

962
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,620
Show them what it is?

963
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,360
Yeah.

964
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,760
That's the first thing I noticed about them

965
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,560
was the strange laugh

966
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,260
after coming out of the rides.

967
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,100
The carnival itself wasn't impressive

968
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,540
as far as the facility

969
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,680
or fairgrounds or anything.

970
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,460
You know, they didn't have much going on

971
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,360
on too many potato cakes or funnel houses

972
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,260
or any of those things.

973
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,580
There were a lot of important records

974
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,480
and documents they were keeping somewhere.

975
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,380
Well, it looked like the ones in Red Mist

976
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,480
were having the most fun.

977
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,220
That simulated blood all over there.

978
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,360
I like that booth.

979
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,440
They had them Arturans

980
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,320
that were that cult

981
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,820
that liked to cut each other's legs and arms off

982
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,840
so they could follow that one cult guy.

983
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,800
Oh, that is...

984
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,840
That's a crazy cult, man.

985
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,040
The John Wilkes booth was my favorite.

986
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,460
The one that just pops the press.

987
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:54,580
That was killer.

988
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,480
Pops the press.

989
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,740
And I wish they'd stop doing this to me

990
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,460
because my nerves are going to die.

991
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,920
My nerves are...

992
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,200
My nerves are not meant to be part of this.

993
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,120
Arturo.

994
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,560
Yes?

995
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,120
What is it?

996
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,920
A hero.

997
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,640
I am not your real hero.

998
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,300
I am more of a figment of your October imagination.

999
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,040
But that's okay, friends,

1000
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,280
because we're back at church again.

1001
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,080
The fun ride, the amusement park, we call it.

1002
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,560
Yes, yes, indeed.

1003
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,440
Yes, indeed.

1004
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,720
The Tubstown Amusement Park of the Hour of Slack.

1005
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,720
This episode, number 996,

1006
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,460
entitled Revenge of the...

1007
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,700
Shit, a foul number.

1008
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,180
1996.

1009
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,540
And we've been listening to...

1010
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:51,780
The show started out with the usual chop-ups

1011
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,300
by Mr. Fernandez and Andy Lemur

1012
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,880
and a bunch of collage material there by Norrell Preff.

1013
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,280
At heavyconfetti.com.

1014
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,280
And, of course, we heard Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence

1015
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,640
and those old-timey guys from the old-timey KPFA show,

1016
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,520
which is still on to this day on kpfa.org.

1017
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,100
And praise all those many orgs who help us

1018
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,460
and bring us things like...

1019
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,000
Fat suits.

1020
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:22,860
Yeah, fat suits.

1021
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,280
The armaments are very important, Stang.

1022
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,040
As a member of the service club,

1023
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,360
you should know that these armaments,

1024
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,780
are fully insured and they're very, very safe

1025
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,340
for even the smallest brat.

1026
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,120
And speaking of brats,

1027
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,120
they're all about to get drafted, aren't they?

1028
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,240
As I understand it.

1029
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,500
Yes, and they're going to have to attend those.

1030
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,500
Big talk of sending them up into the sky

1031
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,500
to pioneer the outer planets,

1032
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,660
the new world,

1033
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,020
where our youth can go

1034
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,580
to fight for the new Mars

1035
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,900
and the old Earth

1036
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,400
and protect freedom

1037
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,340
and media.

1038
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:00,560
Yes.

1039
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,000
The Omicron death.

1040
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,380
T-shirts and tennis shoes

1041
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,400
and the American Western Civilizational Way.

1042
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,280
Queer hats and synoptic remotes.

1043
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,320
And it's our burden, friend.

1044
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,500
It is a burden that we must take on.

1045
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,940
Because, well, actually, no, we don't have to take it on, do we?

1046
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,040
Because isn't there something,

1047
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,900
something bigger than saving the world?

1048
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,600
Something called

1049
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,000
X-Day.

1050
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:29,460
X-Day.

1051
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,300
Yes.

1052
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:30,840
X-Day.

1053
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,640
X-Day is approaching, friends.

1054
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,600
X-Day.

1055
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,160
Your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stank,

1056
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,600
does not want to see you go unruptured

1057
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,240
on that precious day,

1058
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,920
that prophesied day that Bob said was coming,

1059
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,040
July 5th, 1998.

1060
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,580
This could be that year, friends.

1061
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,080
One of these days, it's going to happen.

1062
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,800
You don't know.

1063
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,500
Yeah.

1064
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,880
You don't know what planet this is on anyway.

1065
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,420
I know.

1066
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,860
Yes, it's...

1067
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,700
And, friends, the X-Day drill, actually.

1068
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,480
The event itself, the gathering,

1069
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,440
the great gathering of the subgenius,

1070
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,360
and I will occur from July,

1071
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,460
June the 30th

1072
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,780
to July 5th of this year,

1073
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,920
they falsely call 2005.

1074
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,820
And...

1075
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,720
You're not going to learn much folklore

1076
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,200
over there,

1077
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,180
folklorico this year, are you?

1078
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,480
No, but there will be the bad film...

1079
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,500
Not too many dancing ladies in red piper dresses

1080
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,340
or those people with the funny hats.

1081
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,820
The evil bad film drive-in

1082
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,160
will be there, Dr. Darks.

1083
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,700
Bad film drive-in, as usual.

1084
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,820
With evil popcorn and hot dogs to go with it.

1085
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,600
Sideshow marvels, limbless geeks and cult figures.

1086
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,900
Human fights.

1087
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,120
People with one eye right in the middle of their blatant fury

1088
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,620
can read your mind and wish they couldn't.

1089
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,240
The amino acids heard in the background.

1090
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,960
DNA, which sponsors their activities.

1091
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,680
Nude squid gigs, my friend.

1092
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,900
Oh, and they're fun to eat

1093
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,800
as well as throw at passengers on this rickety train.

1094
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,080
And the costume,

1095
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,460
ball this year

1096
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,200
is with the theme of deities.

1097
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,760
Yes, yes, yes.

1098
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,340
Dress as your favorite

1099
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,240
false prophet.

1100
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,540
Build a huge false idol.

1101
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,760
Actually, friends,

1102
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,400
the costume ball

1103
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,460
theme will be

1104
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,960
warriors this year.

1105
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,300
And the campground

1106
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,740
will be wisteria.

1107
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,620
The giant skull of Philodrummon.

1108
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,680
He'll be there, too.

1109
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,400
Just like he shines his feet.

1110
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:29,700
And look,

1111
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,060
there's...

1112
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,060


1113
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,780
There's the skull of the reverend himself.

1114
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,220
Ah, yes.

1115
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,700
Torpid vehicle.

1116
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,260
But it can still do wonders

1117
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,620
if you push the right button.

1118
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,860
Oh, such torpidity.

1119
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,500
And, friends, you'll get torpid as heck.

1120
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,680
And the naked frop baptism.

1121
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,760
Or baptism, I should say.

1122
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:47,940
In the great...

1123
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,260
In the wisteria pond.

1124
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,240
Bodies will float in the river.

1125
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,220
Gashes above their eyes and ears

1126
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,720
are not a thing to concern yourselves with.

1127
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,060
They have taken these wounds upon themselves.

1128
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,320
They're mad.

1129
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,540
They want only one thing.

1130
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,380
A new...

1131
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,300
A new brave.

1132
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,320
A new race.

1133
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,280
A new slack.

1134
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,300
A new Bob.

1135
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,480
Actually, we do want a brave new world, friends.

1136
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,700
Better than this chicken crap baloney we've been dealing with.

1137
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,100
And that's why lonesome cowboy Dave

1138
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,080
and the mondo retardo band will be at X Day.

1139
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,140
It's why there'll be launchings.

1140
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,600
Why, look at that head fly through the air, followed by the brain.

1141
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,460
And the soul.

1142
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,040
And the soul.

1143
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,760
The soul and brain mind.

1144
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,140
And the fingerprints.

1145
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:32,780
Oh, that's beautiful.

1146
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,140
So many of them.

1147
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,000
What a fine launching.

1148
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,780
Beautiful.

1149
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,380
Excellent form with his swing there.

1150
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,480
Doctor bands, friends, to launch those heads.

1151
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,640
Like the aforementioned amino acid we're all gonna be.

1152
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,240
Fully accredited, fully licensed.

1153
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,620
By the state of anxiety in which this lightning bolt strike,

1154
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,740
never mind it.

1155
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,720
Friends, these are the doctors that'll pry your mind open,

1156
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,880
just like this show does.

1157
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,000
Doctors for Bob, man.

1158
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,300
It will open various doors for you.

1159
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,140
Look closely at these door, a giant mahogany door

1160
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,360
with a beautiful silver clapper on the bell.

1161
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,240
And a beautiful Reverend Nikki Death Chick

1162
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,980
whipping and spanking the guilty and the innocent

1163
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,720
until they're guilty again.

1164
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,440
Yes, I just talked to her tonight on the phone.

1165
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,000
Making plans to be there all the way through July 5th, friend.

1166
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,840
It's on a Tuesday.

1167
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,040
But are you gonna go back to work?

1168
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,980
Because you have more faith in me?

1169
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,100
Faith in Mammon than in Bob?

1170
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,000
Are you gonna do that and just skip?

1171
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,540
Waiting for the saucers that beautiful 7 a.m.

1172
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,060
July 5th, Tuesday?

1173
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,360
Skip on down like a bright innocent child.

1174
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,040
Everything is sanctioned by the Knights Pimpler.

1175
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,020
There's no lost cheese or fried lightning bolts.

1176
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,720
Everything is square and juicy.

1177
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,760
You'll love it, little ones.

1178
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,940
And the little one will love yours.

1179
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,080
And you know why?

1180
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,960
Because you know who else is gonna be there, friend?

1181
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,360
You.

1182
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,560
That's right, you're gonna be at Ex Day.

1183
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,360
You're gonna be with us on the saucers, ain't you?

1184
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,660
Because you're a subgenius minister.

1185
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,940
Otherwise, you probably wouldn't be listening to this show.

1186
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,300
You wouldn't be able to listen to it without wanting to sign up,

1187
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,460
join up and be a subgenius minister.

1188
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,340
Casting out devils and false prophets.

1189
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,420
A lot to throw out.

1190
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,600
Yeah, a lot to cast out.

1191
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,420
And sexing those fraught nuns and nun snakes.

1192
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,460
Oh, lots of sex and nuns.

1193
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,380
You know, we're like any respectable, huge world religion.

1194
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,560
Our priests are sex fiends.

1195
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,100
We don't chase after children because they're too small.

1196
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,960
Oh, yeah, that's the main problem.

1197
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,260
They just don't fit, right?

1198
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,080
And friends, but we chase after them for their soul.

1199
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,400
We want to raise and see that they're raised right.

1200
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:41,780
Wow.

1201
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,140
It's the same for everything.

1202
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,040
There's nothing like, nothing, you never saw anything so heartwarming

1203
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,520
as a whole field full of subgenius children on Ex Day morn,

1204
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,540
waiting for those saucers to come down,

1205
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,820
doing things that, heh,

1206
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,760
you wouldn't do normally, you know,

1207
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,660
because it's not usually the end of the world.

1208
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,880
But you're not normal and you can do these things.

1209
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,420
You can not only warm those hearts,

1210
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,680
you can cook them in a pan.

1211
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,020
Praise Bob, praise Bob.

1212
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,000
And we're going to cook plenty.

1213
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,880
It's a prosperity ministry.

1214
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,860
Oh, yeah.

1215
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,980
It's a prosperity ministry and it's a slack ministry.

1216
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,500
Friends, you'll learn how to slack off like a real slack-off artist.

1217
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,080
No weepers here, no peepers, no silent green, no eyeballs, no nothing.

1218
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,900
Nope.

1219
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:21,580
Nope.

1220
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,220
No peep, no human beings in Ex Day.

1221
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:24,680
No, no one.

1222
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,780
You can't get in unless you're a subgenius minister

1223
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,100
and you can't be a subgenius minister unless you got

1224
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,080
the blood of the Yeti coursing through your veins.

1225
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:33,940
Oh, yes.

1226
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,580
You're going to have to have a little card, maybe, huh?

1227
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,740
You're going to have to have maybe a little ID card that shows

1228
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,680
you've got the right feet and the right structure

1229
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,580
and the front of the brain with a parched skull.

1230
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,520
I've got that card in my pocket.

1231
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,760
I ain't going to be caught on that.

1232
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,080
I ain't going to be caught on that.

1233
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,340
And you know how it's going to be there, friends?

1234
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,040
You know you got the picture on it.

1235
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,220
Princess, we are does going to be there

1236
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,420
and one of these days her flock, the, the,

1237
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,880
you know she's the queen of all the UFOs.

1238
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,540
And one of these days them UFOs are going to be coming.

1239
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,540
They're going to be coming, friends.

1240
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,420
They're going to lift us up in glory

1241
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,060
because we've got subgenius ministers card in our pocket

1242
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,760
and the rest are going to burn cruelly, torturously

1243
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,440
because Bob is not a forgiving God.

1244
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,420
He's neither a wrathful God.

1245
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,240
Right.

1246
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,380
He's a forgetful God.

1247
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
He's not going to pay any attention to what we're doing.

1248
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,880
We're probably going to be getting back once we've got

1249
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,720
those escape vessels at our command,

1250
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,400
armed,

1251
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,560
armed with weapons beyond the, well,

1252
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,860
within the imagination of every subgenius,

1253
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,140
but beyond that of the pink boy,

1254
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,360
the norm worm down below,

1255
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,460
who will be facing those weapons for the first time.

1256
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,880
Those bullies in school that tormented you,

1257
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,160
this is your chance for revenge.

1258
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,000
And if you prefer,

1259
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:46,760
you can reconstruct these bullies in your mind

1260
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,060
and have them torture you all over again.

1261
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:49,520
That's right.

1262
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,880
You can do everything you ever dreamed of all at once.

1263
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,420
It's like the perfect drug, and yet it's without drugs.

1264
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,600
It's Bob.

1265
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:57,400
It's Bob.

1266
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,140
That's all it is.

1267
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,460
It's just the love of Bob entering your heart and your mind.

1268
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,100
The main thing is Bob creeps into your head.

1269
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,180
That face.

1270
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:06,920
You know what I mean?

1271
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,300
It's a face, man.

1272
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,120
You're just a big, big man, Bob is.

1273
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:10,940
I can't believe that face.

1274
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,720
That's why his face has been copied and put up everywhere.

1275
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,340
He's that smoking guy with the pipe.

1276
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:16,240
I can't focus on the sign.

1277
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:16,260
That's Bob.

1278
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,640
That's the Bob we're talking about.

1279
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,500
I got so sick while I was driving, I almost got pulmonary.

1280
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,740
If you see some pipe-less Bob, that's just an A-Bob.

1281
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,500
That's a bad sign.

1282
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,420
That's an A-Bob.

1283
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,920
He's not of the true bobs-ful nature unless he's got that pipe.

1284
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,620
And not every A-hole with a pipe is J.R. Bob Dobbs, my friend.

1285
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,200
Yes.

1286
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,520
There are false prophets everywhere.

1287
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:38,180
There are false prophets.

1288
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,560
Horrible.

1289
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,600
There are false prophets.

1290
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,200
There are missions.

1291
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,580
There are sins.

1292
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,040
Begotten.

1293
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,680
There are dangerous situations.

1294
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,460
Spiritual situations.

1295
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,480
That is deep.

1296
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,720
Oh, yeah.

1297
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,720
This is false prophets.

1298
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,580
Good false prophet music.

1299
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,620
In the meantime, let's dance.

1300
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,120
But of course, let's dance.

1301
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:58,620
Oh, yes.

1302
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,660
The bombs are exploding out the window, and I can't, I can hardly, I can see the flares.

1303
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,640
I can't hear a damn thing but the band.

1304
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,140
Every other soldier has a pipe.

1305
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,340
Yes, look at those.

1306
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,480
Handsome young lads off to die for war.

1307
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,040
For slack?

1308
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,640
Speaking of dying for war and stuff, I think it's probably time for PR.

1309
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,040
You guys, you can't turn the lights on this whole time.

1310
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,600
No, no, no.

1311
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:22,300
It's time for the Hour of Slack to come to its end.

1312
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:22,640
It's time for the Hour of Slack to come to its end.

1313
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:22,640


1314
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:22,640


1315
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:22,940
It's end.

1316
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:26,740
And no, there's not a revival coming up in Columbus.

1317
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,120
Those were old recordings.

1318
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:35,180
I almost said tapes from the olden days of 2005.

1319
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:40,640
And you're listening to Hour of Slack number 1459.

1320
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,020
And you can get more information on the Church of the Subgenius and all of this.

1321
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,180
Stuff from subgenius.com.

1322
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,940
This is Bob's station.

1323
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,640
I feel he keeps a seabed.

1324
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,700
And praise Bob.

1325
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,380
They're always going out there.

1326
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,620
I'm serious, Bob.

1327
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,240
Everything's great.

1328
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:42,380
I have to say all that.

1329
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,220
All right.

1330
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:52,620


1331
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:52,620


1332
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,340
Bye.

1333
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,500
Bye.

1334
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,500
Bye.

1335
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,980
Bye.

1336
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,540
Bye.

1337
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,580
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
