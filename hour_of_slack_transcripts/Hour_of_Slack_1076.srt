1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
Now, what about me?

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,300
All I want for Christmas is the subgenius power of...

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,260
Subgenius Power of...

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,900
Subgenius Convention assemblages, collages, epics.

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,640
As we delve further into the history of the Church of the Subgenius, the first 100 years,

6
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:08,240
this is being done initially for the ongoing MaybeLogic.org online course,

7
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:17,200
but it is also being done for the grander glory of a later book, DVD set, I suppose,

8
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:24,260
and yes, yes, yes, we've been learning so many things that we forgot,

9
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,000
and so many more that we never knew.

10
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,300
It's interesting and inspiring to hear the fervor of the early doctors,

11
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,520
and in this particular episode, friends, we're going to slide back in time

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,880
into an admixture of the 1982 World Subgenius Convention in Chicago,

13
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,240
where the head was launched, where the church was taken over by the women, the Connie Tights,

14
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,840
and in fact, the head was launched onto the roof of the building next door

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,220
and then rescued later from the wino's nest by Buck Naked

16
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,120
and some poor retarded girl that he had picked up that weekend.

17
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,560
Friends, friends, it's exciting, it's deadly, it's dangerous.

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,320
It actually was dangerous, and it's surprising that so many of us survived.

19
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,860
Quite a few didn't.

20
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,240
And so, let us pull the lever and go backwards.

21
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,500
Back, back, now into the past.

22
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,680
When will you believe?

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,300
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,020
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,060
This tape is copyright 1982 by the Subgenius Foundation.

26
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,120
The first step is that you make the art.

27
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,420
You know.

28
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,280
The second step is that you make the art.

29
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,380
The second step is that you mail the art somewhere.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:05,500
And then you destroy the art in the mail.

31
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,500
You claim it on your chance.

32
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,380
The K.R. Bob Dobbs.

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,680
It's come now to us.

34
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,460
It's given us the true wisdom.

35
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,280
I say, fellas, I say.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,100
Make the art, destroy the art, claim the art.

37
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:34,300
You will make much more of that art piece than you would have in any other way.

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,660
Don't you think it would be a good idea for you to turn the radio on?

39
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,120
If you turn the machine on.

40
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,740
Turn the machine on.

41
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,320
Turn the machine on.

42
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,660
Well, it is a beautiful...

43
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,740
...world out there, all right.

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,860
Take, for instance, the city of Chicago earlier this month.

45
00:03:51,080 --> 00:04:00,320
It was filled to overflowing with Wookiees, Warlocks, and Japanese robots as thousands flocked to the annual World Science Fiction Convention at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

46
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:09,320
But at the cheaper hotel across the street, a group of people too weird for most science fiction fans to comprehend were holding a little convention of their own.

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,440
These wackos call themselves the First Church of the Subgenius.

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,560
And they include...

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,140
...in their...

50
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,060
...to say the least, eccentric membership...

51
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,240
Bob.

52
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,180
Bob.

53
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,100
Bob.

54
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,000
Bob.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,460
Bob.

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,420
Bob.

57
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,960
Bob.

58
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,660
Bob.

59
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:22,720
Bob.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:22,820
Bob.

61
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:22,980
Bob.

62
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,060
Bob.

63
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,160
Bob.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
What do they believe in?

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,160
Everything.

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,620
Who do they believe in?

67
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,660
A mysterious character named Bob.

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,080
I'm sorry I haven't time for social obligations.

69
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,740
There is another world.

70
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,580
Who are they winning souls for, Satan or Jesus?

71
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,120
We are not, then, alone in our battle.

72
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,780
Indeed.

73
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,380
The rise and fall of Atlantis, the erections of pyramids and other monuments seen here,

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,560
which no slopeheads could build alone.

75
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,420
Oh, here they are now, the miracles of the Old Testament.

76
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,640
And all these...

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,160
Bob.

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,980
...and more events are so strictly interwoven in the invisible background war between Jehovah and the Exist...

79
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,360
Here we see...

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,220
...a man, the Barbarian.

81
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,140
Yes, it's true.

82
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,840
I work at night.

83
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,800
The Subgenius Convention is in a hotel in Chicago at this very moment.

84
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,660
They cannot get into the hotel. It started off as an innocent convention.

85
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,240
It has turned into the last holdout of the Subdini.

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,200
We're taking over these mics.

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,060
We're taking over.

88
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,320
We've got both heads in custody.

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,880
We have both heads.

90
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:21,960
Both heads.

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,540
Both heads.

92
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,600
Can we get these to go?

93
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,480
We're not giving them to him.

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,960
This is a patriarchy.

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,340
No.

96
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,780
We have to have both heads.

97
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,380
Nine demands.

98
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,580
Until we get all nine demands, both heads are not returned to this room.

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,180
No heads for both heads.

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,560
Nobody.

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,520
Shut that music off.

102
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,960
Put your hands on the radio.

103
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,700
A family doctor says you're just fine.

104
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,020
But you feel so dead all the time.

105
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,560
Well, people, you don't have to worry.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
The job is a man.

107
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,540
Send your money and all is over.

108
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,720
Don't worry. It's deductible.

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, people, you can forget your sins or forget your troubles.

110
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,800
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

111
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,960
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

112
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,200
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer has come to redeem us.

113
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,340
And I'm here to say that I don't want any more beer.

114
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,580
This next convention, we're going to have Kia, gin, vodka, mixers.

115
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,940
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer is the only thing that matters.

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,780
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer is...

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,260
All that we can comprehend.

118
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
And there's the head. I can see it now.

119
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,980
A moment of supreme power.

120
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,460
Okay, you're doing great.

121
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,200
We're standing over the head now.

122
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,900
And I just picked it up by the neck.

123
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,220
I'm holding it up.

124
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,540
Would you give it a kiss, please?

125
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,860
She kissed it.

126
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,280
She kissed the forgotten head that nobody else wanted.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,880
All right.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,820
She patted its head, scratched its hair.

129
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,200
We have a forgotten head!

130
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:11,760
We have a forgotten head!

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Ready?

132
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,360
That's up in the city, going up.

133
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,420
Where do you want me, Head selection?

134
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,820
I like it.

135
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,460
Come on.

136
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:35,860


137
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:35,860


138
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,740
.

139
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:41,740


140
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:41,760
.

141
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:41,760


142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,280
Make sure in heaven you have a substance based partner.

143
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,400
One day, as the story told in Bob Ecclesian, verse 3, chapter 26,

144
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Lo, ye shall know that indeed doctors for Bob shall be as one,

145
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,020
and they shall leak their minds, and doctors for Wotan, Sally Murray,

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,900
victorious doctors for Bob shall become one and all, and have an all-in-one power.

147
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,140
And the individuals make up the separate alignments which be in the end.

148
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,320
The government doctors for Wotan shall align themselves to become one and all to the body.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,620
The head is getting clear.

150
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,920
It's like seeing these cries.

151
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,340
It's crying, it cries.

152
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,260
What is this man?

153
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:35,040
While you're defacing the false head, all the time the real head, the original bonds head,

154
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,800
which has been in my bedroom since.

155
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,960
Eighth grade has been here.

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
You're all damned.

157
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,240
You're not going to burn.

158
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,220
You're going to burn with sparks through your eyes.

159
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,680
You're only the true head.

160
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,860
You've been lost by a non-trivenous, non-steed worshiper.

161
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,320
You ain't going to have the lips of Gabriel Burnett.

162
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,120
You're going to have to lock the head.

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
The true head.

164
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,640
The true head.

165
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,240
The true head.

166
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,700
The true head.

167
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,580
The true head.

168
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,180
The true head.

169
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,220
The true head.

170
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,120
The true head.

171
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,820
The true head.

172
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:16,920
The true head.

173
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:16,920


174
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:16,920


175
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,460
The problem becomes one of mission.

176
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:28,880
The sleazy reality of the present subcon has, I'm afraid, sunk the entire group into a

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,680
morass instead of a prophecy crusade.

178
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,820
The church of the subgenius was an order of scoffers and blasphemers dedicated to total

179
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,040
slack.

180
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,980
The end of mockery science, state of futuristics, mega physics, scatology, off for a proof of

181
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,140
work.

182
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,060
Got the picture?

183
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,400
No?

184
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,300
Well, let's try it again.

185
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,620
The church of the subgenius is the single most important organization of the 20th century.

186
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,440
Oh, there's one now.

187
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,960
A person asking somebody to kill him now.

188
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,220
Don't forget, the launching scene here of the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer,

189
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,400
a sacred relic long in the possession of Taylor Hypercleave.

190
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,620
Is there something wrong with the machine?

191
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:06,880
What?

192
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,520
Yes, I know, Doug.

193
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,340
The mega physics temple lodged with...

194
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,380
Sit down, Doug.

195
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,180
Sit down.

196
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,720
The church of the subgenius in Little Rock, the head was temporarily captured in mid-81

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,120
by a rival band of Trevinoists, worshippers of the false pretenders of the World Cup,

198
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,080
and the Palmer-Trevinoist war still rages at this very moment.

199
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,200
In fact, we have heard conspiracy rumors that the head might be, at some point during the

200
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,980
convention, kidnapped by rogue subgeniuses.

201
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,460
You think John Kennedy was killed?

202
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,420
Why do you think he went to Dallas?

203
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,880
He needed to join the church and disappear forever and become a part of the world.

204
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:36,880


205
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,440
He was a drunk living in Dealey Plaza.

206
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,960
It was the only way to gain his freedom.

207
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,580
A small price to pay for losing your groceries in the high noon sun of Dallas.

208
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,100
As my thoughts swing upward and inward...

209
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:54,620
I was born again and Bob made sure I died again and now I've been born a third time.

210
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
Born thrice.

211
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,340
So the rumors were true.

212
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,680
By the women.

213
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,800
By the women.

214
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,840
What you have to do to...

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,560
Praise Barbara!

216
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,460
I think, I think he's dead.

217
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,540
He likes to change the prop again.

218
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,940
They're telling what kind of dimension we're gonna find ourselves in when our eyes clear

219
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,860
from all this coughing.

220
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,360
This is the drug, I think.

221
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,380
Yeah, it is. I feel my head expanding.

222
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,540
Try and sit down. We're probably still just in the corridor.

223
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,260
Oh. Where are we?

224
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,700
This is the bathroom.

225
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,780
Yeah, big bathroom.

226
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,020
Who's that?

227
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,860
I can't tell. It just changes.

228
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,800
Look, look at that.

229
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,020


230
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,700
Listen.

231
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,640
It's the Slack Squad.

232
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,500
Hey, that's the Slack Squad, isn't it?

233
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,300
I can't talk. I'm trying to talk. I can't help it.

234
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:47,960
Bob!

235
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,340
Oh, what's going on?

236
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,520
Are we back down in that control inch thing?

237
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,380
It's the drug.

238
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,100
I know it's the drug.

239
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,700
I can hear that music.

240
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,920
I can't hear anything.

241
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,520
It's all hard.

242
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,760
You don't hear that music.

243
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:02,760


244
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,580
No, I hear voices.

245
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,320
Focus on Bob.

246
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,980
Try to imagine that your body is made of syrup.

247
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,860
Bob, count backwards from 83.

248
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,140
And then, you may now take your pill.

249
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,440
It reflects what we're feeling. Try to relax.

250
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,140
Okay.

251
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,500
They're not shitting at us.

252
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,740
No.

253
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
This is all the drug, right?

254
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,840
Uh-huh. This is the drug.

255
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
This is all just the drug.

256
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,160
Are you sure?

257
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,720
I am.

258
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,060
Who, you ask? Who is J.R. Bob Dobbs?

259
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,380
Who is?

260
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

261
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:58,380
Well, see, what you gotta understand is, like, Bob is not super intelligent. In fact, he's a complete fuck-up. But every time he fucks up, he makes a million bucks!

262
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,420
This is a restricted area.

263
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,180
You talking about us?

264
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
And the man sent some teenagers.

265
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,800
No, it's the drug.

266
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,640
He's speaking of the drug.

267
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,940
Oh, man.

268
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,720
Oh, man.

269
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,400
What is that noise?

270
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,340
This is a restricted area.

271
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
This is some of the...

272
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,040
Me and Bob.

273
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,960
This is most technicolored problem I've seen in this entire time.

274
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,080
Holy shit.

275
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,500
If you get the Dobbs talent in time, it will happen there, and you won't want to miss it.

276
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,540
Here...

277
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,220
I know that, Frank. We've been singing that song for the last 10 years.

278
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,560
But it can happen here.

279
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,380
In fact, while you weren't looking, it did happen here.

280
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,500
Hi, hi, just go grab the phone. We're going to get it.

281
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,520
Look, we're going to get it.

282
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:49,700
You may risk becoming a weirdo.

283
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,080
At this point, we go to the subgenius convention.

284
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,020
We are live now. If you'll watch the monitor, you will be seeing Guy Dool.

285
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,400
Doug Smith and assorted other subgeniuses speaking.

286
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,220
We can see them there on the floor.

287
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,440
There have been rumors that the conspiracy wishes to interrupt the proceedings here.

288
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,740
We hope that there will be no such interruption.

289
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,000
The subgenius heads are now answering questions from the floor.

290
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,380
Right, exactly. They're trying to cover...

291
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,360
They didn't want us to know about left and right brain to begin with.

292
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Or the forebrain.

293
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,780
The hindbrain.

294
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,520
These are the assorted holy ducks.

295
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,600
We just recently found out that X's do have four brains.

296
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,300
They have four brains that can work...

297
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,580
This proof is available in the rear of the convention area.

298
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,780
They revolve...

299
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,060
Up and down as well.

300
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,240
That's why they do not sleep.

301
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,180
That's in their physical form, which resides on planet X at all times.

302
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,180
We're not defeating them. We're wheeling and dealing with them.

303
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,060
That's what Bob's for.

304
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,700
Why defeat them when you can't guide them?

305
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,000
He's holding up one of four brains of the X.

306
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,580
He's a alien. He has a brain encased in Lucite that is left of the world.

307
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,380
The left of the screen. That is an alien brain that he has hold on to.

308
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,440
Whatever we want.

309
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,300
There's President Xandy in the background.

310
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,540
Asking for his mother or father, but they're so involved in the present problems that they do not see his home.

311
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,820
Just like the aliens training him in...

312
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Here come the tiny subgenius elves marching around on the back of the stage.

313
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,860
They're the ones in the funny color.

314
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,520
Oh, they're gone now.

315
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,580
They disappeared just like that.

316
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,020
That's it.

317
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,700
Bob has slack.

318
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,080
Answering questions now from the floor.

319
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,280
Bob has slack. And even the Elder God...

320
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:33,960
Dallas Doug Smith.

321
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,880
...had trouble getting slack.

322
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,100
Yeah, they can't fight that.

323
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,420
We are, in that respect, we are equal to the gods.

324
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,660
Guy Duell using one of his rifles to push a...

325
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,180
That's the part of God that's in every man that you read about in the Gnostic scripts and everything.

326
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,700
Subgenius window is holy.

327
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,220
The thing that I'm wearing is just black.

328
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,540
The battleground of the gods is in us.

329
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,200
The gods are fighting out there.

330
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,140
It seems that somebody has thrown a tape he didn't like through the stained glass window in the church in the subgenius.

331
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,320
The gods against the Elder God.

332
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,420
But that thing can be replaced in just a moment.

333
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,180
There are two heads.

334
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,280
Now there are two heads.

335
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,640
There's a second, a tiny head and a big head.

336
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,340
No, that is the false head.

337
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,640
The only real head is the bronze head.

338
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,560
Sure, you can be...

339
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,760
You've been bowing down to a false prophet.

340
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,120
The only real head is the bronze head.

341
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,120


342
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,120


343
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,240
The only real head is the bronze head.

344
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,540
And the other is lucky enough to be fated to be in.

345
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,960
Doctors for Odin.

346
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,060
Me, Doctors for Bob.

347
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,320
Consider yourself thrice blessed.

348
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,120
For it shall be your salvation.

349
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,820
And now I guess I went out to smoke a coke in Florida and down here working.

350
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:01,000
But the hang I'm getting is that this is the most important thing that has ever happened to you in your life.

351
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,920
What is happening now will never ever be the same thing ever.

352
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,940
And I'm going to be using the arrow again in the brand new...

353
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,280
I've never seen a dope.

354
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,560
Maybe they've seen some spade or something.

355
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,920
Probably what I like is I can smoke a dope down in Florida.

356
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
If I have an opportunity.

357
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,580
Any place with any substance that I might, you know, want.

358
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,600
And it's probably good to do smoking.

359
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,760
I've never seen a dope down in Florida.

360
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,380
Rather than going in here.

361
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,420
I don't really particularly enjoy working here.

362
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,280
God, that was just one of the most violent drug sequences I think I've ever had.

363
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,100
Look at that.

364
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,900
It's just fading right back in.

365
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,540
All the body parts are just dissolving.

366
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,460
That's amazing.

367
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,700
Look at the hallways.

368
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,820
There's not anybody around.

369
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,640
And it's not even all gone yet.

370
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,720
We've still got some here.

371
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,880
I think I know just what to do with that.

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,900
Ah.

373
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,320
Well, look.

374
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,180
What about these girls you keep telling me about?

375
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,760
Look, Bob has, you know, just all kinds of little groupies and everything.

376
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,980
Something's happening here.

377
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:05,840
The women...

378
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,100
We're taking over these mice.

379
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,820
Somebody's taking over...

380
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,260
We've got both heads in cutting.

381
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,920
God, dissidents and subgeniuses have just taken over the convention.

382
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,560
Both heads!

383
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,860
Until we get these kids back!

384
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,760
A group of women have just stormed the stage.

385
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,740
They're trying to take over the...

386
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,420
They have, they have.

387
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,240
They've stolen the heads.

388
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,780
Until we get all nine demands, both heads are not returning.

389
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,700
Two dissidents...

390
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,920
No heads for nobody!

391
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,700
It looks like a group of women have stolen the bleeding heads of Arnold Palmer and are

392
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,060
now...

393
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,440
Two audience mice.

394
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,360
They're reading their demands.

395
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,620
Bob's jockstrap!

396
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,120
Bob's jockstrap!

397
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,640
Male sacrifice!

398
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Male sacrifice!

399
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,580
Round of chili dogs!

400
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,420
No heads!

401
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,460
No heads!

402
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,700
Dick of Bob!

403
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,960
Dick of Bob!

404
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Take back a 12-year-old dancing boy!

405
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,760
That request applies to all of you.

406
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


407
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


408
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


409
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


410
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


411
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


412
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:54,760


413
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,060
You're so nice.

414
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,980
So much he crashed into the side of the convention hall.

415
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,060
Male Rock and Roll!

416
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,480
Male!

417
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,400
Male Paramount!

418
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,500
Male!

419
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,420
We have the heads!

420
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,260
No heads!

421
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,700
No heads!

422
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,580
No heads!

423
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,580
No!

424
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,160
No, no heads!

425
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,200
No heads!

426
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,100
No heads!

427
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,100
No heads!

428
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,860
No heads!

429
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
No heads!

430
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:17,920


431
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,580
No heads!

432
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:18,880
No heads!

433
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,280
No heads!

434
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,640
Yes, I believe I can see Arnold Palmer showing up.

435
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,340
You mean he's alive?

436
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,040
Something did happen. No, he's not alive.

437
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:26,940
Temporarily?

438
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,340
I'm most honored at this point to say that we will be going to camera one on the floor live,

439
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,360
and we'll be catching the decapitation of Arnold Palmer.

440
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,180
This is Arnold Palmer.

441
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,000
Hi, golfers.

442
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,360
I'm Arnold Palmer.

443
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,220
We will do whatever we can.

444
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,900
Wait a minute.

445
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,160
Hold on, hold on, friends.

446
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,000
Hold on.

447
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,020
Bob said, before this convention started, he said,

448
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:39,180
if any of these cheap bobbies, these immature, pit-eye, pink-splained subgenius types

449
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,000
come out here and blaspheme my sweet name, then pee on my head.

450
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,520
Well, I saw it earlier this morning.

451
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,080
He hopped out.

452
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,700
He's getting a skin.

453
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,940
That's what I'm talking about.

454
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,360
Come on over.

455
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah, that's beautiful.

456
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,340
Those are worth, I mean, well, they don't have a job.

457
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,440
There's no prize on them, yeah.

458
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,260
Nobody knows about them.

459
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,200
Look at that.

460
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,700
Good thing they don't.

461
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,680
These old Malaysian guys.

462
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,900
Just going to capture this.

463
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,920
Lost in time.

464
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,140
Scavenged the records.

465
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,280
That chief has, that chief has like 16 different navigational computers.

466
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,360
Sternos said you guys were worth going to build a catapult, but I guess that didn't happen.

467
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,040
Who was going to carry it?

468
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,980
Who knows?

469
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,320
That's another plan like Wellman's cardboard limousine for dealing claws over.

470
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,580
Yeah.

471
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:37,420
I am a smart extraction and have a maddening memory of the great and great subgenius.

472
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,420
I believe to give one of my bitty eyes.

473
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,360
I might give it all to the boy.

474
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,840
They have this thing where they give, they cut their nipples off.

475
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,320
Yeah, no more sweetness in life.

476
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,260
They're like, well, this is terrible.

477
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:50,700
Yeah.

478
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,100
The only answer is hot lead.

479
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,300
Eat a lot of lead or kill me.

480
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,080
Yeah, right.

481
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,380
Well, they, when they say or kill me, that means you're going to die.

482
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,960
That's it.

483
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,760
That's what it really means.

484
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,900
You know, when Daner says open the door or kill me, you know, you better open it.

485
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,720
I'm protected by the mark of the code in the spiral.

486
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,860
See, has, has Janer ever showed you that sort of stigmata on his back where the blood spattered?

487
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,260
Oh, man.

488
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,580
I've seen, I've seen.

489
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:16,940
I've seen.

490
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,520
I've seen.

491
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:17,980


492
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:26,260
I've seen a little body, I've seen little things run out of his mouth.

493
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:37,880
I've seen, I've seen, yeah, just kind of psychic ether, the little furry ones.

494
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,140
Doctors, calling doctors for Bob.

495
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,020
Calling doctors for Bob.

496
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,220
Your warning in the Doctors for Bob operating room.

497
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,920

all talking this everybody wants to talk

506
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,840
God, we're just faithless.

507
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,760
In all the time Dolphins have played,

508
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,380
it is unlikely that we have ever had a champion or a foe

509
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,840
who could move the chances out so well

510
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,880
and was so little afraid of taking them.

511
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,920
Will Arnold Palmer decide to take a few chances in politics?

512
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah, Arnold wins it!

513
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,540
The skills that he has in that kind of a career next.

514
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,900
Follow the mountains.

515
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,880
That bleeding head.

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,500
The is-ness of the head.

517
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,660
The is-ness and the what-ness and the all-ness.

518
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,060
And the whole being.

519
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,620
A generous sprinkling whiskey on the guy.

520
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,040
Yeah.

521
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,440
Covering the guy with whiskey.

522
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,980
He's drinking it.

523
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,480
That solution.

524
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,600
He's rubbing it.

525
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,240
Yeah, he's got the blood.

526
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,440
Yeah, he's got the prop juice.

527
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,760
Spreading the prop juice around the man's being anointed.

528
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,600
Look at that.

529
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,080
That's it.

530
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,760
And when the head is falling, then I say,

531
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,560
ha, ha, ha.

532
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,580
No head, neither head.

533
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,240
Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have anything else to go on screen right now.

534
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,640
We have to keep these people on screen.

535
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,120
I know that you are amazing.

536
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,760
No head, neither head.

537
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,460
No head, neither head.

538
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
Oh, now Zandy is upset.

539
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,660
No head, neither head.

540
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:40,900
No head, neither head.

541
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:40,900


542
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,300
President Zandy, that's that in the background.

543
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,560
Flying, attempting to scale the head.

544
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,620
19,000 foot head.

545
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,700
No head, neither head.

546
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,980
No head, neither head.

547
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:51,980


548
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,760
The entire convention has been disrupted by this renegade group.

549
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,540
No head, neither head.

550
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
No head, neither head.

551
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,900
No head, neither head.

552
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,240
No head, neither head.

553
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,220
This has to be as amazing as the attempted assassination of Bob late last year.

554
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,080
This is ayes, judикatie, an

555
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,080


556
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,880
I was born.

557
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm going to get these damn people in prison.

558
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,640
I'll keep my��를, arrest her and take her.

559
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:29,640


560
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,320
There's heads every where. We've got no leadership at all. Right.

561
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,020
You can well imagine the usual situation.

562
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,920
Right, bleeding head good, wheel head good.

563
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,300
We're giving up.

564
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,740
We're just going to see if we can break these loose

565
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,740
and get them into the Gulf, the whole state.

566
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,180
There'll be a record inside, a little record,

567
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,320
so that you can play it and hear the songs and the prayers

568
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,840
and the beautiful rituals and hymns to Bob and the screams.

569
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,340
And there will be proof of UFOs and that kind of thing.

570
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:58,760
Yeah.

571
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,340
What about the Subcon 2 that was held recently in Chicago?

572
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,380
Could you tell us exactly what happened with the bleeding?

573
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,540
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

574
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,700
The World Subgenius Convention in 1982 was held in Chicago,

575
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,520
and the bleeding head of the World Cup golfer was launched.

576
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,880
Arnold's face spun through the air

577
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,300
and landed on the roof of the building next door.

578
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,080
So the world won't be coming to an end this year,

579
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,740
and...

580
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,580
Summer will last a little longer.

581
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,680
I think it's already over.

582
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,620
But the problem is the...

583
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,680
I don't know if you guys knew this,

584
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,240
but the women of the church of the subgenius overthrew the patriarch.

585
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,280
It's like I don't even know why you're talking to me.

586
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,920
You ought to be talking to the great masterous dominatrix,

587
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,940
someone else who's downstairs in her throne chamber of exclamatization

588
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,780
waiting for me to fix her a cup of coffee.

589
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,640
I see, I see.

590
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,180
Seriously, the women overthrew the patriarchy of the church.

591
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,800
We knew that.

592
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,380
At this point, it's all just a sham.

593
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:14,780
I mean, us popes and high-end predictables can pretend all we want,

594
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,340
but she's going to babysit tonight, you know what I mean?

595
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,120
I see, I see.

596
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,840
Well, how has the church changed then due to this new development?

597
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,640
I mean, the day-to-day life of the church...

598
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,600
Dad and Barbara is taking command.

599
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,660
Yeah, I see.

600
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,740
Bob's not really dead, but because you can't kill that witch.

601
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,380
He's now running in the back of the limousine.

602
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,840
You know, it's real confusing on this end,

603
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,760
just as much as it is on your end, as you can well imagine.

604
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,120
It's always been that way.

605
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,620
If you'll notice, one of the first gigantic shows we had there in Dallas,

606
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,420
the first one we put on, Jackie was not hit, and yet Jack was.

607
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,480
Of course, we in Puzzled Evidence have the actual photographs of Jackie being hit,

608
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,280
but she was, of course, hit, and there was an argument between people in the car.

609
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,180
Yeah, as I understand, she was climbing over, getting onto the back of the car

610
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,640
to make herself a better target, that noble, noble woman.

611
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,360
She was scrambling for a piece of her brain that was shot out.

612
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,540
And see, she got her brain, but we didn't.

613
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,740
Dallas is a friendly town, and we'll try to cooperate with the snipers here.

614
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,140
We need the trade.

615
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,740
We need the people coming in, and, of course, the hotels are all set up.

616
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,720
Now, you don't have to use school book buildings, warehouses, anything like that.

617
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,500
You can work right out of your hotel room.

618
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,060
Okay, and I just want a note to local callers.

619
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,800
We do see that you're on the board right now.

620
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,500
It's just that we want to complete this satellite call while the satellite's in the arc,

621
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,600
and we'll get to you as soon as possible.

622
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,280
Oh, hi.

623
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,080
Thank you.

624
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,780
Oh, we have more people there.

625
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,040
Hello.

626
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,940
This is who from Dallas?

627
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,180
Oh, hello.

628
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,100
How are you doing, JR?

629
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,220
I'm doing all right.

630
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,460
Doug, are you still with us?

631
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:54,880
Yeah.

632
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,400
Oh, okay.

633
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,540
We've got a conference call here.

634
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,060
JR wants to talk to you.

635
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,380
JR.

636
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,740
Go ahead and speak to Bob.

637
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,400
Bob.

638
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:00,980
Bob.

639
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,780
How are you doing?

640
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,760
All right.

641
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Yeah, you said Dallas was a nice little town?

642
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,440
Slow?

643
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,880
No, nice little town.

644
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,240
Yeah, Dallas is a nice little hamlet, yeah.

645
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,220
Hamlet is a money town.

646
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,120
I want you to know that.

647
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,500
Money.

648
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,140
Well, we know that, and—

649
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,620
Why do you think I'm here, Daddy-O?

650
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,540
This is the money town for any religious cult worth its salt.

651
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,380
I'll tell you that.

652
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,540
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

653
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,200
It's a sunny moment and you're feeling low.

654
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,660
You're hurt all over and you're moving slow.

655
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,520
Well, people, there's nothing that you should know.

656
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,120
Tune us in on the radio, Doc.

657
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,660
We've got charisma, we've got style.

658
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,020
Well, people, we'll make you feel better for a while.

659
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,520
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

660
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,680
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

661
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,780
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

662
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,620
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

663
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,980
And here we are at the subgenius convention.

664
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,160
World subgenius conclave.

665
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,480
Next year, I think, they'll be called the world subgenius party.

666
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:40,480
Because the subwienies have pretty much given up, I believe, according to a spokesman on the organizational idea.

667
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,460
That's the maids, the hotel maids here at the Radisson.

668
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,360
Bob just walked by just a few seconds ago.

669
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,460
We didn't get him on camera.

670
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,000
I understand that is to be expected.

671
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Oh, they're talking.

672
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,500
There's Bob.

673
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,640
No matter where he is, no matter what he's doing, two hours of exercise every day.

674
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,520
Bob's new health clinics are coming out pretty soon.

675
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,560
I think you should be seeing them in most major cities.

676
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,140
You've already seen the ads.

677
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,980
The conventioneers are in the background, some fighting, some having fun.

678
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,780
Almost all of them drunk, inebriated in some way.

679
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:40,180
It was so far, the convention has been much like the first convention for the 15th.

680
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,460
There seems to be no...

681
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,940
Here we are on camera seven.

682
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,300
You can see some of the rituals starting up.

683
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,000
We've got to bust out of here.

684
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,000
Some of the reporters...

685
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,440
Oh.

686
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,360
Not all of the reporters have the security clearance that I do.

687
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Being as I am a publicity manager for Dr. Bob.

688
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,740
How about that's heavy.

689
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,600
Okay, here's a good one.

690
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,400
This one's real heavy.

691
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,740
Jerome Palmer taught his son to be more than just a good golfer.

692
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,360
A good golfer also had to be a certain kind of man.

693
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,280
In high school, for example, Arnie learned a very important lesson.

694
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,320
He missed a shot in a junior match.

695
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,340
He was very, very angry.

696
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,200
Arnie's face turned red and he picked up his golf and threw it over a bunch of trees.

697
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,700
Everyone who is observing us has fled.

698
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,240
They weren't listening to the words. That's the problem.

699
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,540
Don't pay attention.

700
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,280
They think they've got to get in some damn hell ritual musical rhythm.

701
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,320
And they don't listen to the words at all.

702
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,620
Oh hell, their minds on dancing.

703
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,340
They want to dance. That's exactly it.

704
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,840
They want to move their damn feet.

705
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,140
They want to be a little bit more serious.

706
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,400
Beer dancing.

707
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,860
Your modern day sex.

708
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,780
Oh yeah.

709
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,300
Faithless.

710
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,580
Universal creation.

711
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,500
Self-genocide.

712
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:04,640
Mutilation.

713
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,400
They have to see a miracle for proof.

714
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,340
They demand proof.

715
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,380
I demand a job.

716
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,280
Bob demands that we create those miracles.

717
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,760
Yeah!

718
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,460
But Mr. Palmer, what can we do next?

719
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,800
What can we do, Jerome?

720
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,620
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

721
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:25,820
I'm not going to do that.

722
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,300
Bob.

723
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:43,540
The alien myself.

724
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,420
Who am I?

725
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,760
PrAdam.

726
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:46,760


727
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:46,880
But, not ever.

728
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:46,880


729
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:46,880


730
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,340
was a UFO or something.

731
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,220
NASA House Tambiénろう.

732
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,220


733
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,820
The nest of Mars.

734
00:34:54,890 --> 00:35:05,750
Bye wrap over there.

735
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,090
Thank you.

736
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:06,610
He's alphabet.

737
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:09,610
He's alphabet.

738
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:18,250
Doctors for Bob.

739
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,750
Doctors for Bob.

740
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,790
Everything real in my life.

741
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,030
I've got the blues.

742
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,470
That damn pickup truck run over my wife.

743
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,930
Doctors for Bob.

744
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,170
That damn pickup truck run over my wife.

745
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,790
That damn pickup truck run over my wife.

746
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,490
Doctors.

747
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,410
Doctors for Bob.

748
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,410
Doctors.

749
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,250
Wanted.

750
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,250
Doctors for Bob.

751
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,590
You're wanted in the mind incision transplant center.

752
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,870
Doctors for Bob.

753
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,170
You're wanted in the nuclear radiation pickup truck zone.

754
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,690
Doctors for Bob.

755
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,050
You're wanted in the 11 hot dog.

756
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,810
Keep your speed.

757
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,030
Calling.

758
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,590
Calling doctors for Bob.

759
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,790
Calling doctors for Bob.

760
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,030
Calling doctors for Bob.

761
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,230
Look, they've got the flaming pipe that's ready.

762
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,990
They're getting right up to the edge of the pipe.

763
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,250
There's Sterno.

764
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:30,830
There's Sterno.

765
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,650
Look, Jayner is going like, man, I want you to tape this later.

766
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,470
This guy, of course, really thinks he's going to be shoved right in it.

767
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:36,870
Yeah.

768
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,850
That's going to be it, right?

769
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,730
Okay, they put his head down on the block.

770
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,030
He's got his golf clubs.

771
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,930
He's got his iron.

772
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,470
He's holding the iron in his teeth.

773
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,170
This is terrible.

774
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,130
This really is.

775
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,590
Oh, look, he's putting one hand in his pocket.

776
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,410
Good Lord, like he does like it's real.

777
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,250
I do this every day.

778
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,450
This is the first time he's ever had American clubs on.

779
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,510
And now Sterno raises the huge scimitar.

780
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,890
That thing must be seven feet long.

781
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,610
And they're building to a fever piece.

782
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:06,110
He's got lead shot inside to make it go down faster.

783
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,410
Heal the head.

784
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,130
Bad.

785
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,490
Bleeding head.

786
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,150
Good.

787
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,370
Golfer must die.

788
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,310
Golfer must die.

789
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,450
Oh, look at that.

790
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,490
Oh, that looks beautiful.

791
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,570
Oh, man.

792
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,790
Oh, man.

793
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,670
Now he's holding up the head.

794
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,610
It's bleeding, see?

795
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,950
Oh, it's still, yeah.

796
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,630
Okay, he's putting it back on.

797
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,770
Yeah.

798
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,770
There we go.

799
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,310
It bleeds on.

800
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,150
It bleeds on.

801
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,630
They're carrying the body off.

802
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,270
They do throw the body into the pipe.

803
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:34,650
They blow.

804
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:35,530
Look, it's bubbling.

805
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,230
It's bubbling.

806
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,030
It's just, yeah.

807
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,090
There you go.

808
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,050
There goes the body.

809
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,890
All recycled back into the EcoSport.

810
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,810
That's the neat thing about Subgenius.

811
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,050
Look.

812
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,950
Look at that.

813
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,530
You can see in the little mirrors you can see.

814
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,530
Yeah, there he goes.

815
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,450
Sterno really swings a mean scimitar.

816
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,370
And I like that.

817
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,190
I like the way he carries it in the guitar case.

818
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,670
I think that's a real nice touch.

819
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,770
Right on the slide.

820
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,850
Yeah, okay.

821
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,370
He's got a lot more traditional style.

822
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,070
Yeah, yeah.

823
00:37:59,170 --> 00:37:59,690
There we go.

824
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,370
He's holding the head up.

825
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,010
It's still bleeding.

826
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:01,650
Uh-huh.

827
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,210
It will keep bleeding.

828
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:06,270
It will bleed for, until it needs to be done again.

829
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,750
And once the dolorous stroke is administered one more time.

830
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,790
One more donor.

831
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,390
One more.

832
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,150
Open his torso.

833
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:12,890
That's it.

834
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,210
You can't use your brain to think about your religion.

835
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:16,950
You go into war.

836
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,030
This is the law.

837
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,270
That is the law.

838
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,950
What is the law?

839
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,810
Some of these people have been using their brains to break the temple.

840
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:24,990
They use their brains.

841
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:28,350
He says, you put those boxes up.

842
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:28,350


843
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:28,730
They're going to be put up round.

844
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,750
You're fired!

845
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,650
So you go home.

846
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:35,850
So you go home.

847
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,510
And your mother's at the door.

848
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,130
And your mother looks up.

849
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,150
And she says, I don't care what happened.

850
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,350
Where's the ring?

851
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,290
What were you doing?

852
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,630
Smoking pot again?

853
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,210
And you think you've lost it all.

854
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,450
And there's no place for you to go.

855
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,730
You've got no job.

856
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,870
You've got no home.

857
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,770
So you've got to use your brain and make a breakthrough.

858
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,530
Every time they knock you down, you've got to get back up.

859
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,470
That's the real thing.

860
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,510
That's real.

861
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,130
Sex hurt.

862
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,790
Hell, these people think sex hurt means tying them up.

863
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:28,810
Hell, no!

864
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,570
You don't know what that means.

865
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:34,050
They're bruised by misunderstanding, reading meaning into sex hurt.

866
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,110
It means what it means.

867
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,090
Sex until it hurts.

868
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,230
Do it until it hurts.

869
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,190
Praise me for what I'm doing.

870
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,290
Praise the church.

871
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,430
And praise Bob.

872
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,670
I mean, it's simple enough.

873
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,890
You can understand that.

874
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,170
Love them.

875
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,550
Love one another until it hurts.

876
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:47,630
Anybody can understand that.

877
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,310
You don't have to go to school to understand that.

878
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,970
Take a little sore in your mouth.

879
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,330
You go to school and they take it away from you.

880
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,270
You look your way back.

881
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,690
You look your way back.

882
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:58,350
Then you're sure locked in the pit.

883
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,170
You've got to backslide.

884
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,950
Then you backslide.

885
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,670
Then you backslide.

886
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,710
Then you backslide.

887
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,090
You let go of the church.

888
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,790
Let go all the way.

889
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,650
Upside and downslide.

890
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,910
Slide into home.

891
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,910
If you want to avoid temptation, go at it.

892
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,350
Forticate like your very life depended on it.

893
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:16,410
By the way, I have a lot of pills.

894
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,290
And if anybody would like to take a pill, I'd like to give them a pill right now.

895
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,930
Come up and be anointed, friends.

896
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,110
Now, these are Dobbs-type pills.

897
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,850
That means that each one's got a slightly different grain to it.

898
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,310
Each one will hit you just a little different, too.

899
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,270
Oh, friends, let's get ready.

900
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,390
He's got the pill in his mouth, friends.

901
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,690
Go, go, go, go, go.

902
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,590
Oh, yes, friends.

903
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,950
Another sore save for Bob.

904
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,630
Oh, yes, friends.

905
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,370
They're rolling in the aisles.

906
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,690
They're having a spiritual experience at your expense.

907
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,110
Oh, yes.

908
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,590
Jesus had taken pills in church.

909
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,090
Had taken the nine-iron Ecclesian.

910
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:01,370
Five six.

911
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,010
Jesus had taken pills in church.

912
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,570
Jesus had taken pills in church.

913
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,210
As it says, the nine-iron Ecclesian.

914
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:13,990
Five six.

915
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,810
Jesus had taken pills in church.

916
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,350
A little girl came up to me.

918
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:21,350


919
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,390
Crashed up on stage.

920
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,130
Ran over to me

921
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,290
and handed me a magazine article.

922
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,030
And the title of that article, ladies and gentlemen, is Bob's dead.

923
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,090
Hallelujah.

924
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,170
No, blasphemy.

925
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,510
Blasphemy.

926
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,510
If you think Bob is dead, just ask Connie.

927
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,510
Go on.

928
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,750
Get out of here.

929
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,970
Bob's dead.

930
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:46,890
It's true.

931
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,870
He's dead, sure.

932
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,130
My God.

933
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,990
My God!

934
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,670
Where's that near confidence?

935
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,010
...the President of this country can preach lies like this!

936
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,010
It's Bob's death!

937
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:59,590
It's Bob's death! Is he?

938
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,390
No!

939
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,490
Is he even a little sick?

940
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,050
No!

941
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,190
Well, maybe then.

942
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:05,490
It's Bob's death!

943
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:06,550
No!

944
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,690
Are we gonna have him?

945
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,470
Yes!

946
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,270
Yeah!

947
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,310


948
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,450
Kill Bob!

949
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,190
Kill Bob!

950
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,030
Kill Bob!

951
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,570
Kill Bob!

952
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,110
Kill Bob!

953
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:15,670
Kill Bob!

954
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,950
Kill Bob!

955
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,250
Kill Bob Ecclesiastes 5-7!

956
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:19,530
Kill Bob!

957
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,110
Kill Bob!

958
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,890
Jesus did take pills in church and it did kill Bob!

959
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:25,450
Healed head!

960
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,010
Healed head bad!

961
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:30,350
Bleeding head!

962
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,330
Good!

963
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,290
Healed head good!

964
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:32,810
Yay!

965
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,570
Bleeding head good!

966
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,010
Yay!

967
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,910
Sears catalog head!

968
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:37,890
Bad!

969
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,590
Marine Catholic nun choir head!

970
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,190
Bad!

971
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,490
Viral pneumonia head!

972
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,530
Bleeding head Arnold Palmer!

973
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,130
Good!

974
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,010
Healed head bad!

975
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,230
Good!

976
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


977
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


978
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


979
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


980
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


981
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


982
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


983
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,230


984
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,390
棒!

985
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:50,570
Bleeding head!

986
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,470
Healed head!

987
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:52,950
Bad!

988
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,370
Bleeding head!

989
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:54,770
Good!

990
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,110
Healed head!

991
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:56,650
Bad!

992
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:57,910
Bleeding head!

993
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,490
Good!

994
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,350
Healed head!

995
00:42:59,490 --> 00:42:59,930
Broke his top!

996
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:00,510
Bleeding head!

997
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:00,970
Bad!

998
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,990
Healed head!

999
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:03,570
Bad!

1000
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,230
Bleeding head!

1001
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:04,710
Bad!

1002
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,450
Bleeding head!

1003
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:07,130
Wood!

1004
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:14,570
Normal tanningո 008 008 008 006 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 007 009 009 009 0010 0010 009 0010 009 0010 0010 0010 0010 0010.

1005
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:21,350
Those messages from the exes said on this paper, build a church.

1006
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,010
That paper was a $10 bill.

1007
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:33,310
And Bob went out and said, I want my army.

1008
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,710
I want my army of subgeniuses.

1009
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,630
So he went to the police station and he walked in there and he said,

1010
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,870
how many of you people here will do whatever I tell you?

1011
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,650
And three-fourths of them stood like this, one step.

1012
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:49,990
And he looked at the other fourth who were going, hey, I don't know.

1013
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,710
You're subgeniuses, he said to them.

1014
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,430
He went into the Pentagon and he walked up to them and he said,

1015
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,490
how many of you are going to stand with me in my army?

1016
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:04,110
And they all rose their hands, except for three janitors.

1017
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,110
And he turned to the janitors and said, why didn't you do it?

1018
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:10,650
He said, well, I don't want to join an army unless the war is right and everything.

1019
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,910
Bob said, you're with me!

1020
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,290
And the Church of the Subgenius was formed.

1021
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:25,470
Now this, this is the fourth time I've ever been on a stage in front of people in my life.

1022
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,930
And Bob gave me the feeling to do that.

1023
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,310
And he said, what do you mean by that?

1024
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,870
And I said, well, I got something that makes me want to shout.

1025
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,390
I've got this funk that like comes over me.

1026
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,890
And shout all the time.

1027
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:41,890


1028
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:41,890


1029
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:41,890


1030
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:41,890


1031
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,890
And it says, Mike, these people here are here for one reason.

1032
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,190
And you are here for one reason.

1033
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,730
And that is to be funkin', funkin', funkin' with Uncle Bob.

1034
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,670
You better dance!

1035
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:25,010
And he statedly, Michael Flores twisted the little empty Tylenol capsule apart.

1036
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:36,350
A fiendish grin spread over his puckish little face as he poured the cyanide into the empty Tylenol capsule.

1037
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,170
And he did that again.

1038
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,790
Recapped it and put it in the.

1039
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,270
along with all the others.

1040
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,850
He, he, he, he thought to himself,

1041
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,450
won't those innocent people with their headaches be surprised

1042
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,670
when they wake up dead two days from now?

1043
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:03,010
It was the voices in his head.

1044
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,890
It's apparently like getting drunk or something.

1045
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,790
Hold on, that was tentatively a convenience.

1046
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,230
He is perhaps the most picturesque of all the subgeniuses here.

1047
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,970
He tentatively has a very high standard of what is not art

1048
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,350
and is trying to make sure that the convention itself

1049
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:41,890
is kept.

1050
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,670
He's probably killed, if not the convention itself,

1051
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,890
at least a few of the doctor men, the evil doctors.

1052
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:51,170
There he's pumping up his synthesizer.

1053
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:54,770
It's an air controlled electronic synthesizer.

1054
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,210
Oh my gosh, he hit stono!

1055
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,050
What the hell is playing?

1056
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:12,650
I thought I saw one.

1057
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,230
I thought I saw one.

1058
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:18,310
I don't want to cry.

1059
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:18,590


1060
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:18,590


1061
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:18,590


1062
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:19,610
I thought to sing this drivel.

1063
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,470
Close my eyes and beat me away.

1064
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,570
I mean I like the music, but what's this,

1065
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:24,890
is done?

1066
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,490
It's just I and I.

1067
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,630
I saw one.

1068
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,290
I thought I saw one.

1069
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:32,450
I thought I saw one.

1070
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:32,450


1071
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:32,450


1072
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,090
I didn't care what you thought of mine.

1073
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,230
Well, it is legal around here.

1074
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:38,730
Roundabout.

1075
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,550
But of course.

1076
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,670
Wisdom does not depend on drugs.

1077
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,590
Yay, the sacred herb,

1078
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,690
Havafrop, Zipulop,

1079
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,630
that is found on the graves

1080
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,730
of the Tibetan wise man

1081
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,130
in those small white bundles.

1082
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:50,910
Well, that's the kind of thing

1083
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,290
that many, and I don't mean those...

1084
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,010
Opium?

1085
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,070
The white bundles that you find here in...

1086
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:57,010
Oh, opium.

1087
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,010
Well, that's getting to golf.

1088
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,610
There you've got Arnold Palmer,

1089
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,430
the head of the sub-division.

1090
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,010
About whom we used to be apathetic,

1091
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,210
but now we just don't care.

1092
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,690
Right.

1093
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,190
We'll be seeing the bloody head

1094
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:08,770
launching in just a little while, actually.

1095
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,090
We have a lot.

1096
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,470
We have several Arnold Palmer training films, too,

1097
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,490
for those of you into hardcore rough

1098
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:15,970
and green maintenance.

1099
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,350
Right, hardcore rough and tumble,

1100
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:19,890
Arnold Palmer.

1101
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,350
Later on, we'll be having, on VideoCam 3,

1102
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:24,110
the best out of two of three falls

1103
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,070
with Arnold himself.

1104
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,570
Volunteer girls from the audience

1105
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,190
will be coming up and taking their turns with Arnold.

1106
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,090
So why spoil the beauty of the thing

1107
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:32,070
for legality's sake?

1108
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,690
Remember, kids, nothing is illegal

1109
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,490
if 100 sub-guinea businessmen decide to do it.

1110
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:37,990
That's right.

1111
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:40,570
And we had that wonderful tape

1112
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,410
where you saw the young, naked, nubile maidens

1113
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,210
wrestling with Arnold Palmer's bloody head.

1114
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,130
No heads, no heads!

1115
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,570
We want heads!

1116
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,770
Both heads are being held hostage

1117
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:52,470
in one room in this hotel,

1118
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,670
and nobody knows which.

1119
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,870
They're in the closet, they're in a sack,

1120
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:56,730
and you don't know where.

1121
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,150
There ain't no bobs here.

1122
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,830
They're all wits.

1123
00:48:58,830 --> 00:48:59,430
Go on!

1124
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:01,790
No heads, no heads!

1125
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,790
There ain't no bobs here.

1126
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:04,610
They're all dicks.

1127
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:06,730
Dicks for Bob.

1128
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:07,890
No heads!

1129
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,250
No heads!

1130
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,350
No heads, no heads!

1131
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,010
I've been the possessor of the head

1132
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:20,370
for the past, oh, since I was in 8th grade.

1133
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,650
It was originally my dad's head.

1134
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:27,610
Dottie came up to me and asked me

1135
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,510
if she could borrow the head for a minute,

1136
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:30,970
and I said yes.

1137
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,750
But I say, wait a second, wait a second,

1138
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,790
I say, you can have the head!

1139
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,190
You can have the head!

1140
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:40,370


1141
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,010
You can have the head!

1142
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:41,790
I don't want it!

1143
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:42,710
You can have the head!

1144
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:43,370
It's a curse!

1145
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:47,590
It's a horrible curse that's been with me for the past

1146
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,710
all my life, that I absolved myself

1147
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,310
from Spots Building for the head!

1148
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,070
The curse be on you!

1149
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,550
You are the curse of the head!

1150
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,390
You are the curse of the head!

1151
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,790
Flores is trying to make a,

1152
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,850
Flores is desperately trying to break up

1153
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,670
with the cash register where the people

1154
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,710
have been paying to get in.

1155
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,650
He's not the only one, but he's,

1156
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:09,530
looks like he's got a gun, yes,

1157
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,030
but they're holding him off.

1158
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,650
They're trying to, they're,

1159
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,750
Flores is convinced, from what I can understand,

1160
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,350
Flores set this up with tentatively inconvenience.

1161
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,730
All the violence, the nudity, that was LSD

1162
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,210
that was being given away,

1163
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,090
Buck Naked was giving away capsules

1164
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,170
with very, very high doses of LSD inside them.

1165
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,810
We believe it's LSD.

1166
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,910
I don't think it's the legendary prop.

1167
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:36,650
Oh, wait.

1168
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:36,790
Hold it.

1169
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,570
We'll have to tune out now.

1170
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,990
Is Senator Kinney here for the interrogation?

1171
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,450
I guess not.

1172
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,810
Well, you guys, this is the panel discussion.

1173
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,850
Science does not remove the terror of the gods,

1174
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:57,370
especially the elder gods.

1175
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,150
The gods seem to get crankier with age.

1176
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,390
More forbidding all the time.

1177
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,290
More vengeful.

1178
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,110
More dangerous.

1179
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,570
Get your damn foot off Bob's head.

1180
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,090
Put your feet on Bob's head.

1181
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,310
I got a case of boozeys up in the room,

1182
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:17,670
and I figure we ought to lock them up,

1183
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,350
go over to the science fiction convention,

1184
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,730
and just kill them all.

1185
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,870
Kill, kill, kill.

1186
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,870
Kill them goddamn Delronda Hubbard's bag of wild maize.

1187
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,790
We'll all lay there without acid,

1188
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:28,850
sucking ass gunny,

1189
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,530
and doing science fiction weirdos.

1190
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:33,590
And poor earbugs causing illicit.

1191
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:33,930
Yeah.

1192
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:34,990
Who cares about edges?

1193
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,490
Grandpa heard some strange things about William Shatner.

1194
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,150
No, there will be no panel peeing.

1195
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,430
It's not in the schedule.

1196
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,410
Juvenile urination.

1197
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,330
Is anybody out of trouble?

1198
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,210
Nasty doctors.

1199
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,910
Those doctors always talk about pee and gross stuff like that.

1200
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,630
I'm talking real childish.

1201
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,010
Childish doctors.

1202
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,670
Doctors for stool examinations.

1203
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,370
Stool examinations.

1204
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,130
Bone cancer surgeons for Bob.

1205
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:02,250
Species dissection.

1206
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,050
Urologist surgeons for Robert.

1207
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,690
X-ray technicians for Bob.

1208
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,450
Yodelers for Bob.

1209
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,830
Zit cream sellers for Bob.

1210
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,870
Anthropologists for Bob.

1211
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,190
Baby snatchers for Bob.

1212
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,170
All right, the procession has started up.

1213
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:29,530
They're reeling, the women are bringing the dead corpse of Sturdo Kiekever

1214
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,070
into the, into the,

1215
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:32,390
into the crematory.

1216
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,390


1217
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,050
Now, people are laughing.

1218
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:33,930
I can't believe it.

1219
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:34,910
They don't believe he's dead.

1220
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,650
They think this is all a plot.

1221
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:40,090
The Reverend Janor Hyperkleets from Little Rock, Arkansas

1222
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,590
tried to make it all a little clearer to me

1223
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,970
with his own explanation of his conversion

1224
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:47,310
into the church of the subgenius.

1225
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,330
They said this jar was my mind,

1226
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,530
and then they poured it down a sink.

1227
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,490
Run that by me again?

1228
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,010
I, I don't know.

1229
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:56,470
What do you mean?

1230
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:59,170
Who got that?

1231
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,250
Who got that?

1232
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,550
No, we're going to try to find out.

1233
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:01,550


1234
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:01,950
stay at home, stay at home.

1235
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:02,050
We're going to try to find out,

1236
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,050


1237
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,050


1238
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,010
Come on, who's got the

1239
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,190
Come on, who's got the

1240
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,050
Come on, who's got the

1241
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,150
Anybody got any Tylenol?

1242
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:15,110
I just need a couple of extra straight tabs to get off.

1243
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:19,170
I've got some of the 15-year-old Tylenol here.

1244
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,630
Maybe if we soak up in that leftover Kool-Aid

1245
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,550
from that other religious experiment,

1246
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,050
we can have some luck with them.

1247
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,230
Sounds like a Tylenol party, sure.

1248
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:29,290
Sure.

1249
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:32,690
I'm always up for a Tylenol party.

1250
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,950
Because, you know, I don't want no Arnold Baller.

1251
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,550
I don't want no Yarka Teaser.

1252
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,690
I don't want no Sub-Dee-Dees.

1253
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,130
And I predict that our local American doctors will go on strike

1254
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,770
and be replaced by African witch doctors.

1255
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,850
We're splashing liberation right around the world,

1256
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,430
and we'll die to do it.

1257
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:58,990
Everybody.

1258
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,430
We'll sing a Arnold Palmer.

1259
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,690
And he can set you free.

1260
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,030
Bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1261
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,630
He'll stand up for me.

1262
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,070
Bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1263
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:11,630
He'll stand up for me.

1264
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:12,850
Bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1265
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:14,130
Come on, sing up.

1266
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:16,510
How are you going to start this war if we don't sing?

1267
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,410
How are we going to start this Vietnam War?

1268
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,210
It's put the church right down the middle, friends.

1269
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:22,550
It's what the church needs.

1270
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,090
Put the church right in twain.

1271
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,930
Your cross, put it like a moon.

1272
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,010
You're talking Trevino.

1273
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,650
You can just back your party.

1274
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,110
You're talking Trevino.

1275
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,090
I prefer basketball myself.

1276
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,890
They say he's a golfer.

1277
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:40,230
They call Trevino a golfer.

1278
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,750
I was watching TV in 1967,

1279
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,530
Master's Tournament, third hole.

1280
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,730
I saw him miss a shot about like this.

1281
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:47,630
I couldn't believe it.

1282
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,470
They say he's a golfer.

1283
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,630
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft

1284
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,530
with living occupants,

1285
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,150
it must have been very disconcerting for them

1286
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,990
to cross millions of miles

1287
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:01,190
of space, only to be hit on the head

1288
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,110
with rotten orange.

1289
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:04,650
These are subgenies.

1290
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:05,870
Subgenies, right.

1291
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,130
They grant wishes.

1292
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:09,930
Well, kind of, yeah.

1293
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:11,710
Yeah, right.

1294
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,790
Or they give you spells.

1295
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:16,930
They can bring on problems like sickness,

1296
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,750
world problems, death, drugs, pain, perversion.

1297
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,890
Or they can occasionally go out

1298
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,150
and just get spaced out

1299
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,330
and dingy, as the young people say today.

1300
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:28,270
By 1950,

1301
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,810
some of these characters were beginning

1302
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,830
to spin their stories of fantastic conversations

1303
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:34,630
with alleged space people.

1304
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,770
Some of them expanded the stories

1305
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:39,530
to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

1306
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,810
Bob is trying to bring the end

1307
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:46,070
of the world correctly, you might say.

1308
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,110
He's trying to make it the end of their world instead

1309
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:48,970
of the end of the world.

1310
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,930
Because if the conspiracy is still in charge

1311
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,910
when the Xs land, they'll snuff us

1312
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,250
like we would shoot a dog.

1313
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,690
We'll shoot a dog that's been hit by a car

1314
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,550
on the side of the highway bleeding to death.

1315
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:04,350
Whereas if Bob can get to them first,

1316
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,810
maybe he can, well, being the saint of sails,

1317
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,830
he's gonna be wheeling and dealing the fate of the Earth

1318
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,950
with these beings that are so technologically advanced

1319
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,610
they've gone beyond technology

1320
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,630
and they're more like gods.

1321
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,330
They wiped out the dinosaurs on a picnic

1322
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,370
63 million years ago, which was about the same time

1323
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,190
that they planted the seeds of the human race

1324
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,190
and the subgenius race, which are, by the way,

1325
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,210
two separate races.

1326
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,290
Once again, the main point is slack.

1327
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,310
That's the Reverend Ivan Stang talking there,

1328
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,570
a more vocal member of this weird cult

1329
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,290
who I interviewed in his hotel room in Chicago.

1330
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,490
Well, whatever else they may be,

1331
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,170
the subgeniuses are clever sleight-of-hand artists.

1332
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,550
In the midst of my conversation with him,

1333
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,350
he demonstrated something called time control

1334
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:51,630
by suddenly throwing me back to Berkeley, California

1335
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,390
sometime last year.

1336
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,830
I think the most important thing that your listeners

1337
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,010
need to know is that the Church of the Subgenius

1338
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:02,830
is man's only hope for slack in these coming end times.

1339
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,010
That's exactly why we're here in Berkeley tonight.

1340
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:10,310
Now, what is this fabled slack once of you speaketh?

1341
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:15,150
Slack, Bob, is, slack, I guess you'd say,

1342
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:19,650
is the absolute and total absence of any stress whatsoever.

1343
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:24,870
It's the highest state that man can try to reach

1344
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,810
in his spiritual or carnal life.

1345
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:26,810


1346
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:31,830
So, we're here to spread the word of Dobbs,

1347
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:37,930
which, of course, is the main path to slack that the people need.

1348
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,870
If the last 50 years made such a change,

1349
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,970
just imagine the New York of 1980

1350
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:48,290
when everyone has a number instead of a name

1351
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,430
and the government tells you whom you should marry.

1352
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,990
Just imagine 1980.

1353
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,810
Things are coming together.

1354
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,170
Completely out of hand here at the convention.

1355
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:01,810
Mass panic, roaring, heaving.

1356
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,110
Now the security forces are attempting to clear the hall.

1357
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,870
I want to thank the ladies for one of the best moves

1358
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:15,550
that has brought this convention back to life.

1359
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,810
The sex head war.

1360
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:21,070
But you cannot get away from this power.

1361
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,230
Just listening to what I'm telling you now

1362
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,390
can be the turning point in your life.

1363
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,810
Hello, angel one.

1364
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,590
You will die.

1365
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,050
You will die.

1366
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,490
All she needs

1367
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,270
is somebody who'll die.

1368
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:47,810
Jeez, that's horrible.

1369
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,370
Yeah, well, a decapitation is usually necessary

1370
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:53,330
to join the church, to find yourself within the church.

1371
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:55,110
But once the head is lost, the head is found.

1372
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:55,810
That's right.

1373
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:56,650
Bleeding head good.

1374
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:57,390
Heel head bad.

1375
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:57,930
That's right.

1376
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,830
That's the Arnold Palmer cult theme

1377
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:01,930
for those golfers out there

1378
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,050
who may be interested in the Trevinoist theory

1379
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:06,870
of lawn maintenance and green tending.

1380
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,090
We'll tune in later for a live broadcast

1381
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:12,290
from the 14th hole of the Pill Beach Golf Course.

1382
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,210
Now back to you, Doug.

1383
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,710
And we do want to differentiate

1384
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,610
between the live Arnold Palmer,

1385
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,830
the Trevinoist, and the Church of Vic Morrow.

1386
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:19,690
Indeed.

1387
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,630
Somebody who'll die.

1388
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,990
I myself killed some 15,000.

1389
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,490
We will discontinue the interview

1390
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,010
to check the quality of the recordings.

1391
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,690
We switch you to the 16th tee,

1392
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,310
where we'll show you in slow motion

1393
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,590
Arnold Palmer, U.S. opium champion.

1394
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,590
Somebody who'll die.

1395
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:49,090
And everything else is at subgenius.com

1396
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,970
because this is the hour of slack

1397
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:52,730
and it's the Church of the Subgenius

1398
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,490
and our new official post office box.

1399
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,570
Well, it's the old Cleveland Heights post office box.

1400
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,450
Uh, the Texas Austin office had to move,

1401
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:06,910
so now we're at post office box 181417

1402
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:11,490
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

1403
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:15,110
www.subgenius.com

1404
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,330
Where's that bucket?

1405
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:19,890
Where's that bucket, Jones?

1406
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:21,710
Turn it.

1407
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,510
Hey, boy.

1408
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:24,170
Hey, boy.

1409
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:24,570
Hey.

1410
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,090
Hey.

1411
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,750
We're doctors for Bob. We're the band that has the musical questions.

1412
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:08,570
Get large amounts of LSD and be combined with hard liquor to produce bad results.

1413
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,930
And the answer is a resounding no.

1414
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:16,290
You can just get off our fucking game, motherfucker.
