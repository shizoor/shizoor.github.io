1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
I have not had time to brainwash you, so listen carefully.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,340
Fantastic things have already happened, and more are getting ready to happen.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,280
This is because the planet on which you're residing has entered the space age.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,160
You are a most unusual individual, and decidedly in the minority.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,220
Oh, another victim of confusion?

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,180
Decidedly.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:31,740
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC!

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,280
I'm going to bypass your forebrain, and appeal directly to your amygdala.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,240
Good morning, and yes, you've won a fabulous eight-hour day. Chain to this machine!

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,600
Oh, don't grin! Okay, grin!

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,700
Don't grin!

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,820
Unfair to kick a man when he's down.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,440
Let's get him up on his feet.

14
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,460
If you're listening to me now, if you hear my voice on the radio,

15
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,080
I want you to feel the inner power of your own SWAC center.

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,340
I want you to stand up from where you're sitting now,

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,840
and come over to the radio, where you hear my voice reaching out to you.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,300
I want you to feel the inner power of your own SWAC center.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,200
Kill me.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,120
No, you don't kill me.

21
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,000
Go ahead. Kill me.

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,700
Kill me.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,860
What the hell do you think you're doing?

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,780
It should be painfully obvious by now that the world as we know it won't last too damn much longer.

25
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,520
And what are you doing about it?

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,960
Going to work or school?

27
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,720
Coming home?

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,420
Goofing around?

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,780
What's going to happen to your routine when all the...

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,220
comes down on us at once?

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,900
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

32
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,720
No?

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,760
Good.

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,660
The fact is, it's too late.

35
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,160
There is one damn thing you as an individual can do about eco-disaster,

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,240
nuclear death, overpopulation, and so forth.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,560
Things are going to hell on a fast train,

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,060
and about the only thing you, or anyone else besides the Rockefellers,

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,900
can do about it is to just sit back and watch the show.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,120
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse and take a whole lot longer than you thought.

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,300
The mere act of sitting in your home watching everything fall apart on TV

42
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,100
may be too much for even the stoutest brains to take.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,500
In fact, the more alert and intelligent you are,

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,420
the quicker you'll likely be driven to suicide by the sheer hideousness of what you'll be seeing.

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
Will you be ready?

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,020
Will you still be sane enough to laugh with that which must come to pass,

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,040
comes to pass?

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,780
Will you ever get slack?

49
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,340
Uh, answer yes!

50
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,720
You are now getting Hour of Slack number 818.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,040
Uh, friends, because according to my past-time real clock in the recorded world here,

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,840
Happy New Year!

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,560
And don't forget to take a look at the huge, huge amount of art,

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,460
rants and videos on the subgenius website in this new time.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:36,300
Uh, yes, well, that was Hell Pope Huey reading the old What the Hell document back there.

56
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,560
And before that, we heard Dr. Neuroburger speaking on the Slack Center,

57
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:49,280
both from the newly released Media Barrage 11 remix CD.

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,440
Of our old tape.

59
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:57,080
And you're invited for dinner now, friends, with Dr. Leary.

60
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,900
And we'll be having a main course of, of, uh, nuclear, I mean, uh, I mean...

61
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,020
Nuclear is a nuclear explosive, and bring your own meatloaf in desserts.

62
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,320
7 to 9 p.m.

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,080
I guess that's, um, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,300
Did anybody want to go, maybe?

65
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,580
You sure are sorry.

66
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,260
Did you ever laugh and you actually wet the person?

67
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,220
Next to you's pants?

68
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,680
That's what's just happened now, Chip, and no one's here but me.

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,780
Of course it is. You know it's like snakes.

70
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,440
The force is with you, young Skywalker.

71
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,720
You are not a chicken.

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,640
You know, that's what's here in my mind...

73
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Uh, Dave's still there. Dave, we were listening to music. What were you saying?

74
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,540
I was just saying, in my third nostril, while that music was playing,

75
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,200
I could see, like, these big dogs with huge, circular whirlpool eyes.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,120
And I could, that's all I could think of was you guys up there having that flesh party and stuff.

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah?

78
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,700
It was so perfect that I forgot my own imperfections.

79
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,060
The best bounty hunter they got.

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,440
Dave, we didn't forget your imperfections for half a second.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:57,760
I am Bova Fett.

82
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,480
I am Bova Fett.

83
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,420
The ship you seek is nearby.

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,380
Beavisette is Darth Vader's right hand man.

85
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,220
Beavisette is Darth Vader's right hand man.

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,420
I am Bova Fett.

87
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,600
Those aren't the drugs we're looking for.

88
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,440
Move along.

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,900
Move along.

90
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:13,560
Move along.

91
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:13,760
Move along.

92
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,240
I remember once in the old days of purgatory and stuff like that, a buddy of mine said,

93
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,020
and they asked him why he took drugs, he said everybody else was doing it,

94
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,520
so he wanted to make sure there was something left, you know, before it was all gone.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,320
How long were you in purgatory, Dave?

96
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,780
Well, they don't let you know the real number.

97
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh, you just have to guess, because it...

98
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,240
Huh?

99
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,360
It's upward of thousands of years, right?

100
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,160
Well, for you, it could only be, like, a flash in the oyster.

101
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,420
It could be the same thing as when you buckle up your old kneecaps or maybe take a shave in the morning.

102
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,960
Yeah, man, get with it.

103
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,360
Yeah, I mean, you...

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,280
Where you been, dude?

105
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,800
One day, it's your Christmas tree.

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,060
The next day, it's, you know, an octopus is strangling you.

107
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,080
You don't really know in actual numbers.

108
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
You just got to keep up.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:55,860
Yeah.

110
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,220
You got to handle the input, man.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
You got to surf the input.

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,400
That's what it's all about.

113
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,000
It's what Dr. Leary told me.

114
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,720
We're learning, of course, that the Darwinian theory of evolution,

115
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,040
which is based upon natural selection, based upon blind chance,

116
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,520
is a pretty dumb theory of evolution,

117
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,920
not the one that's going to lead us proudly with our shoulders and heads

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,840
into the 21st century.

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,020
One of the ways evolution works is humor.

120
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,980
Young forms look at the old forms and say,

121
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,460
hell no, we won't go.

122
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,900
Young dinosaurs look at old dinosaurs slogging around in the swamp,

123
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,680
like J. Edgar Hoover or Ronald Reagan, and say, hell no, we won't go.

124
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
So, some of our functions to make fun of an adult species,

125
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,600
I'm sure in enlightened Minneapolis-St. Paul,

126
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,440
I can take a risky position and make fun

127
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,620
of the number one sacred icon of American media,

128
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,240
a man who's so revered, who's so upstanding,

129
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,600
that he can only be seen as a miracle of modern merchandising and marketing.

130
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,800
There's the person I want to make fun of at the moment.

131
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,880
Have you ever noticed how much the Pope looks like Tom Landry?

132
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm not here to make enemies, I don't want to offend anyone, but still.

133
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,260
And I like the Pope, I think he's the finest mind of the 12th century.

134
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,080
He regularly gives those marital counseling things every Wednesday,

135
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,360
he tells people that according to St. Paul and St. Augustine,

136
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,680
this is how you should handle your domestic relationships.

137
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:44,940
The Pope actually did say that it was a mortal sin for a husband to lust after his wife.

138
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,900
It never occurred to St. Paul that the wife was a mortal sin.

139
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,740
The wife might want to lust after the husband, did it?

140
00:07:51,520 --> 00:08:00,840
As part of this endemic, and it really is an awesome epidemic of deliberate stupidity

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,440
that is laid upon us by the media, by the press, by the magazines and so forth,

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,400
they simply do not raise any of the issues that will challenge our interest, our intelligence.

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,640
Now when the Pope got wounded, I was very, very sorry

144
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,900
that the Pope was not a mortal sin.

145
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,940
I was shot. I'm against violence.

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,300
I think all violent people that like guns should be put in spaceships,

147
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,820
and in wonderful, comfortable, luxurious spaceships with non-ricochet corners and sent up to space.

148
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,400
Or we should all get in luxurious spaceships and we could go to space and let them have the planet.

149
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,240
So...

150
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,260
Folks really want to believe that the Martians are coming.

151
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,180
They're bored, they want some excitement, and after all,

152
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,660
they come here because this is the closest thing that they can get to actually being on the planet Mars.

153
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,780
Now let's talk about this internet thing.

154
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,500
Which internet thing?

155
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,320
Well, they had a thing on news tonight.

156
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,620
It was like a regular show.

157
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,160
They took up, it was Channel 5 or something, did a whole thing all night long.

158
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,280
It's that thing about Stang being so paranoid.

159
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,020
Yeah, that was it.

160
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,700
It was actually all about the internet.

161
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,720
Wasn't Stang paranoid?

162
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,860
Wasn't Hitler?

163
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,160
And how child molesters, you know, your children,

164
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,160


165
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,160


166
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,860
they were children in the internet.

167
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,440
And what they had was one of the guys who worked there,

168
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,400
they had a camera on him the whole time,

169
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,360
and he was online in the teen chat rooms on AOL trying to get people to pick him up.

170
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,020
Right.

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,180
And pretending like he was a little girl or something like that.

172
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,720
And then they were reporting, they'd come back with a microphone and go,

173
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,960
this just in.

174
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,540
Well, well Sally, over 12 people have propositioned me.

175
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,360
They've asked me my age.

176
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,640
And my sex.

177
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,540
And they've sent me links to very questionable websites.

178
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,520
Your children are in danger from the internet.

179
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,060
Oh my God, sausage links sent and delivered.

180
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,820
That is satanic.

181
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,600
The internet will destroy your children.

182
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,560
Can you imagine what these children are doing with these sausage links?

183
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,640
These satanic links?

184
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,660
Yeah, but that was a television show you were watching, right?

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,440
Well, it was like a shock TV news thing.

186
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,220
Yeah, well the movies, you know,

187
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,240
they thought television was going to wipe them out,

188
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,420
so they came up with CinemaScope and 3D and so forth.

189
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,220
And then entertainment.

190
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,820
Well, whatever happened to the old adage, don't talk to strangers?

191
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,620
Is it any different on the street than it is in the...

192
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, once again, you're not allowed to be responsible for yourself anymore.

193
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,820
Right, that's exactly the point.

194
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,360
Somebody else has to take care of you by making sure there is nothing

195
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,760
that you might accidentally do to yourself.

196
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,240
Don't you think?

197
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,140
Like, see nipples.

198
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,740
Don't you think any dubious person anywhere, perhaps in the laundromat

199
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,580
or perhaps just walking errantly down the street should be stopped

200
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,300
and inspected to see if there are any child, vast semen or glandular orifices on their penis?

201
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,180
Possibly.

202
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,700
I do.

203
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,140
Hello, you're on the air.

204
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,580
Hello.

205
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,200
A couple of things.

206
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,380
First, I saw a few minutes of that special and, you know,

207
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,320
Channel 5 was acting as if they had just suddenly realized,

208
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,980
oh my God, the internet is dangerous.

209
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah, right.

210
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,420
This whole thing wasn't...

211
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
Yes, this is what happened.

212
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:13,880
Right.

213
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,120
Yeah.

214
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,220
It's like this whole thing wasn't fully covered in...

215
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,980
It's also like I read that they set up one of those i-Team reporter thing type thing.

216
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,140
Provocatourism.

217
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,420
They set up some kid working at a CD store and they sent with a camera some little kid in and said,

218
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,920
even if I'm not old enough to buy, you know, the Fuck Your Mama CD,

219
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,240
will you sell it to me anyway?

220
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,840
And the kid was like, oh, I don't care.

221
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,680
I'll sell you anything.

222
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,780
You know?

223
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,180
Like a real American.

224
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:42,760
Yeah.

225
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,000
That's what America is all about.

226
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,760
I'll sell you anything.

227
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,280
That's right.

228
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,060
Don't you see what this is all about anyway?

229
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,580
And then they even mention, wait a minute, they even mention that there's a blessed parental discretion sticker on there.

230
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,400
But yet, did the news people say anything about that?

231
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,240
The sticker says parental discretion, not store clerk.

232
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,340
Oh, my dear friends, you don't understand.

233
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,380
We have reached the days...

234
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:12,340
Not poor schmuck that goes to high school and is just trying to make a few bucks to take his girlfriend on on a weekend.

235
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,840
And thinks the record's cool.

236
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,520
Yeah.

237
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,360
This is, this is provocatourism.

238
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,380
Parents, parents, go after the stupid parents, you moron.

239
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,240
The world has reached this level now.

240
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,200
All of these news agencies do as...

241
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
Oh, as a bum...

242
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,100
Throw Mom and Dad in jail.

243
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,820
Throw Pee-wee in jail.

244
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,560
Carl Monday.

245
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,240
Pee-wee died for you.

246
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,200
They're never going to go after Mom and Dad because Mom and Dad are the people that are trying to get to watch the broadcast.

247
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,820
They're the ones in the closet shooting the footage.

248
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,080
Delivering them to the sponsors.

249
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,100
They're the ones knitting the fuzzy pink socks for you.

250
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,740
You slander.

251
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,500
Yeah, and it's never their fault.

252
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,240
It's always your children are being threatened by this evil outside...

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,820
You're threatening my children with evil fornication, buddy?

254
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,160
Get this guy off the line.

255
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,880
He's threatening my childhood with fornication and evil.

256
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,360
Your childhood is, it's way too late for your childhood there, okay?

257
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,640
It's already been blackened.

258
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:01,780
Besmirched.

259
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,180
Forget it.

260
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,740
No.

261
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,360
You don't have to get every thought you've ever had in your life in, in 20 minutes.

262
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,980
Chaz, you just did that when you referred to that humble Iroquamo you were speaking to.

263
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,920
Oh, I only do it though every once in a while.

264
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,360
Oh, okay.

265
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,880
Yeah, huh?

266
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,300
Atari 2600?

267
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,320
Is it 2600 now?

268
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,420
No, we're not on military time unless you're in Kaboola or perhaps Kanduz.

269
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,220
Hello?

270
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,500
What are some of those other delightful names that ring off our tongues like little silver sandals?

271
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:27,920
Alekandibu.

272
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,180
Apostun.

273
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,920
Malahunia.

274
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,760
Turkmen.

275
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,740
And I am the Emperor...

276
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,520
Azmeketh?

277
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,600
Jalalabad.

278
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Jalalabad.

279
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,760
...of Blue.

280
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,180
I am the Emperor of Blue.

281
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,500
Jalalabad.

282
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,540
Jalalabad.

283
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,440
I am the Emperor of Blue.

284
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,260
Who are you?

285
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,960
So, so the way that we can get...

286
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,520
I am the Pakistani Minister of Art and Science.

287
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,140
I have discovered in the very old Quran...

288
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:55,620
...a certain passage which limits us in a certain way which we can only express as...

289
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,440
What is your quest?

290
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:04,620
I guess, I guess then the only people will accept the internet when they come up with something even worse for our kids.

291
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,540
You know, the way as Stang pointed out, the, the, the, the TVs were criticized, you know, the movies were criticized...

292
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:11,800
Yeah.

293
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,700
What is the internet going to be scared of?

295
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,460
The cube.

296
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,080
The direct neural stimulation.

297
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,500
Yeah.

298
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,220
The hollow cube neural...

299
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,540
That is what we need to do to avert this child's organophilia.

300
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,500
A direct neural butt plug.

301
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,480
The hollow...

302
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,580
Well, that would work as well too.

303
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,560
A lot of children enter your anal areas as a form of erotic exposure.

304
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
Then we could do that.

305
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
Straight up, all the way to the brain.

306
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,060
Right, the fuzz buzz right up from the...

307
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,420
Wow.

308
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,020
Yeah.

309
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,720
Wow, wow.

310
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,320
Man.

311
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,000
And they would come back from...

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,240
Wait till they take that catheter out, baby.

313
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,500
It's gonna tickle.

314
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,100
...the electric goose will conquer the world.

315
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,280
I can't wait for the one that goes up to 11.

316
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:46,820
Excuse me.

317
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,220
Sorry.

318
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,520
Some of the, some of the children grew up straight and strong...

319
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah.

320
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,000
...like those weeds there in old Granny Dingy's yard.

321
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,760
But other children grew up all twisted and slimy like the backyard over there filled with festering...

322
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,160
Your mind is ours.

323
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,420
...like a snake.

324
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,120
Yeah, I just wanted to say that, that one of you is doing a great imitation of the Fireside Theater tonight.

325
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,120
Who? What?

326
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,240
Who?

327
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
That it is.

328
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,620
The what?

329
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,420
I'll be ding-dong darned.

330
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,180
What channel is he listening to?

331
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,240
I think he's had his...

332
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,980
That was the barber shop for kids.

333
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,260
...most fun.

334
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,340
The television will not be revolutionized.

335
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,100
Oh, friends.

336
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
But you know, and people get paranoid.

337
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,880
They go,

338
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,560
Oh, I'm afraid to have a TV in my house or turn on the internet because the TV might watch me back.

339
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,660
Oh, the government, they're always watching you.

340
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,380
That television might, they might be watching some special cameras and recording all my internet transactions.

341
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:09,700
Friends, they don't need to watch you through television or the internet because as long as you're sitting on their butt, on your butt, watching TV, they know what you're doing.

342
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,760
They know where you are.

343
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,280
They know where you are.

344
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,340
You're safe, man.

345
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,320
As long as you're sitting there watching TV or just reading something, well, hell no.

346
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,520
They're, you're safe.

347
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,920
You're, that's easy enough.

348
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,180
But friends, how do you go about fighting the conspiracy?

349
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:32,700
Do you, you know, do the Tim McVeigh route and, uh, and blow things up only not get caught?

350
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,960
Do you, uh, well, wouldn't that be just like what they did?

351
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,500
Or do you work from the inside?

352
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,040
You know, go to college and get a good education, try to change things from the inside.

353
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,140
Well, you know, it's funny how that always works out.

354
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,140
You end up turning into your parents no matter what.

355
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,400
Is there hope?

356
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,900
Is there hope, friends?

357
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,480
Well, um, yeah, sure, if you get off your butt.

358
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,040
Now, we expect, see, here's the problem with our religion.

359
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,180
We thought that we only had to stay alive and deal with the conspiracy for a limited time.

360
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,740
Because Bob Dobbs, our prophet, said that the world was going to end on July 5th, 1998.

361
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:22,660
Those Axis from Planet X would come down and lift up all the news-paying believer subgeniuses

362
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,480
into an infinite slack forever.

363
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,040
Plus, we'd get to take revenge on all the normals down below.

364
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,140
Well, needless to say, we've been disappointed year after year after year.

365
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,340
And so after a while, we started thinking, maybe Bob's got an important lesson for us here, friends.

366
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:47,980
Maybe Bob is saying we don't, better not depend on invisible monsters up in the sky to save us,

367
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,220
or fancy little aliens and spaceships that make deals with the government.

368
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,980
We shouldn't even trust grinning pipe-smoking salesmen.

369
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:03,000
Because yes, as hard as it is to believe, even a preacher can lie or fuck up.

370
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,860
And so we thought, okay, we'll screw the aliens.

371
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
We will do it.

372
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,380
We'll have a new cause, a new world.

373
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,020
We will build our own ships.

374
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,980
We'll build our own spaceships.

375
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,700
Well, of course, then we found out how dangerous they were.

376
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,420
A few of us got our fingers blown off, and we put Dave inside that big dumpster

377
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,640
and set off all those bottle rockets tied to it.

378
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,040
Look what happened to him.

379
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,380
And so, friends, then we had to change our plans a little bit more.

380
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,780
We thought, goddammit, okay, we can't build a rocket ship and escape this drudgery.

381
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,160
We'll just take a vacation to Amsterdam.

382
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,600
Yeah, that's it.

383
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,380
So we started doing church field trips to Amsterdam.

384
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,560
And by god, that was fairly close to the kind of slack we'd been dreaming of.

385
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,500
But then we found out they've got cops there, too.

386
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,400
And it's not all legal.

387
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,000
So then we realized, no, if we can't, if building our own ships is too expensive,

388
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,960
and stealing our own ships is too dangerous,

389
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,840
and building our own Amsterdam, moving to Amsterdam is too expensive,

390
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,420
we will build our own Amsterdam, friends.

391
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,500
And actually, if you think about it, that is exactly what's up here at Starwood tonight.

392
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,940
We have built our own Amsterdam.

393
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,380
And that's why you find out that Bob only has one real rule, and it is a true rule.

394
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,800
It's a rule you can live by, and that rule is, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

395
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,600
Praise Bob.

396
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,860
Strangely enough, those really are words to live by.

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
Bob said a lot of funny shit like,

398
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,720
too much is always better than not enough.

399
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,560
Try living by that one.

400
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,700
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

401
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,640
Well, that sounds real good, but actually that's kind of what the conspiracy had you doing all along anyway.

402
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,600
Friends, when you find the slack of Bob, you're going to find it in your own way.

403
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,340
In fact, you'll probably have given up on Bob Dobbs to give you any easy answers.

404
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,380
Because there are no easy answers.

405
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,380
Rush Limbaugh will give you simple answers.

406
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,980
He loves to make the complex simple.

407
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,040
Well, friends, we happen to think the complex is complex.

408
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,800
In fact, we like it that way.

409
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,620
We like things to be complicated and intricate, if that's the kind of thing you're into.

410
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,840
Like those psychedelic videos up on the wall.

411
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,600
By God.

412
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,420
Well, I'm going to spell on you.

413
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,700
It's a magical crowd, right?

414
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:47,420
Ooh, because you're mine.

415
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,900
It's time for things to do.

416
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,380
Ooh.

417
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,860
I like you.

418
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,620
I like you.

419
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,580
I can't stand the world around.

420
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,520
I can't stand the putting down.

421
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,600
I'm going to spell on you.

422
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,540
Ooh.

423
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,320
Because you're mine.

424
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,920
Because you're mine.

425
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:34,840


426
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,140
Say it out loud.

427
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,200
Say it.

428
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,340
Say it.

429
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,340
Peek-a-boo.

430
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,820
I can see you.

431
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,860
And I know what you do.

432
00:21:52,360 --> 00:22:01,580
Bob is that big, all pervasive figure that encompasses spuddom on planet Earth.

433
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,000
And what is spuddom?

434
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,320
It's the human condition.

435
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,680
It's things falling apart.

436
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,700
It's fat ladies in double-knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Kroger's.

437
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,480
Now, that ain't very nice, mister.

438
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,640
Those guys are protecting you from yourself.

439
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Like if you was loose, you're liable to walk into a fist or something.

440
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,840
What's going to happen to your children?

441
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
What's going to happen to your children?

442
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,700
What's going to happen to you when this society we've created,

443
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,420
when this society we've created,

444
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,540
air conditioners,

445
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,900
air conditioners,

446
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,720
station wagons with wooden sides,

447
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,300
station wagons with wooden sides,

448
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,100
cautious indeed,

449
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,660
a retired actor,

450
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,580
orange hair,

451
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,700
a political politician,

452
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,220
orange hair,

453
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,720
what happens when that collapses?

454
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,900
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

455
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,440
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

456
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,760
That's when the man from Planet X-9,

457
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,440
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

458
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,060
But until that day,

459
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,160
the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

460
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,220
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

461
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,120
Yes.

462
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,360
We have a covenant with Wotan,

463
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:14,720
and it is the sacred grudge chore of the subgenius to smite the conspirators

464
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,300
and their slavish dupes,

465
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,780
the mediocratons,

466
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,960
the stupid pink boys,

467
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,680
the hoi-boloi,

468
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,620
them,

469
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,400
the normals,

470
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,560
the other...

471
00:23:34,120 --> 00:24:04,120


472
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:34,120


473
00:24:34,120 --> 00:25:04,120


474
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:34,120


475
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,740
baptized in electronic water.

476
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,700
Chronical sons and beautiful daughters,

477
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,440
with smiles and bows and rosy cheeks,

478
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,420
and a righteous path to death to the freaks.

479
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,240
Do you feel the power?

480
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,040
Do you feel the power?

481
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,420
Yes.

482
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,820
The man's voice sounds reassuring,

483
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,620
completely thorough and so alluring.

484
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,380
He's lived a thousand times before

485
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,100
and seen the world before before.

486
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,940
The calmness and tranquility

487
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,280
that oozes credibility,

488
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,720
the delusiveness and the confidence

489
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
that seamlessly knock common sense

490
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,620
and it makes you feel just like a babe,

491
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,500
daddy holding you tight and safe.

492
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,200
Hey, everything's alright,

493
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,040
daddy's gonna stay with you tonight.

494
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,940
Now he's got you by the balls,

495
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,600
he can sell you anything and all.

496
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,160
Immorality, diamond rings, genocide,

497
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,840
magazine, religion,

498
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,180
two thousand apologies,

499
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,560
and the end of a democracy.

500
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,460
It's a new generation,

501
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,140
it's divine inspiration,

502
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,180
always ready to follow,

503
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,840
never willing to swallow,

504
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,560
all the doctor's prescriptions,

505
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,240
all the mystic inscriptions.

506
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,720
It's a spandex obsession,

507
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,300
it's a lasting impression,

508
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,900
it's the calm meditation

509
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,960
of a tranquilized patient.

510
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,320
It's a hallucination,

511
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,000
it's a new generation,

512
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,560
it's a new generation,

513
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,780
it's a new generation,

514
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,740
it's a new generation,

515
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,840
it's a new generation.

516
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,820
ELECTRIC HISTORY

517
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,260
guitar solo

518
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,820
guitar solo

519
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,220
Yes, friends, oingo boingo from boy and go.

520
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,640
Before that, many cuts by the old-timey subgeni from Media Barrage 11,

521
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,020
such as Pope David N. Meyer, Dr. Dr. Mr. M.D.,

522
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,440
in his very first sermon, 1982 or so,

523
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,740
we heard also Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh on the church,

524
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,300
about 1983 or so,

525
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,520
filmed by Larry Sulkis, who wrote Ghosts of Mars just recently.

526
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,040
And before that, friends, I put a spell on you.

527
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:16,400
The classic Screamin' Jay Hawkins song performed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

528
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,040
at the Starwood Festival of 2001,

529
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,960
preceded by preaching by me and Dr. Timothy Leary

530
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,640
from a 1987 or so Minneapolis lecture,

531
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,160
which is on a new CD from Ace here in Cleveland.

532
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,200
I helped put this project together.

533
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,320
It's a CD called Cheerleader for Change.

534
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,840
And you can get information about Ace

535
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:54,420
and their other materials at www.rosencomet.com.

536
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,940
That's R-O-S-E-N-C-E-R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T.

537
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:57,940


538
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,920
R-O-S-E-N-C-O-M-E-T.com.

539
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,680
www.rosencomet.com.

540
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,280
But wait!

541
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,040
Something is coming in on the interocitor!

542
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,920
Oh, it's a new image by Dr. Legume.

543
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,760
Yes, the 3D artist Dr. Katadon Legume

544
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,680
has created an image on the internet here.

545
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,940
Especially just for Christmas.

546
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,340
It's very holiday-y.

547
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,740
It appears to be a bowl full of amputated bodies.

548
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,440
Romantic, even.

549
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,880
It appears to be a bowl full of amputated bodies.

550
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:27,940


551
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,260
Romantic, even.

552
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,260


553
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:32,140
That I'd rather not even look at any longer.

554
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Although they are very well sculpted and rendered.

555
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,340
They're identical.

556
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,440
That's how you know it's a 3D model.

557
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,200
It's not the only way to tell anymore.

558
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,680
Who are the alien creatures looking on at the bowl of penises?

559
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,440
When you look at a crowd on TV

560
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,180
and there's three or four people in the background

561
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,300
that look exactly like,

562
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,140
that's when you know it's fake news.

563
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,160
Totally fake.

564
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,800
Like when they have red eyes and stuff, too?

565
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,100
No, no.

566
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,920
Oh, you don't even see that anymore.

567
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,880
They get rid of that.

568
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,920
I've got a red eye removing program for now.

569
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,740
What about the scenes of the masses of people that are all like waif-like?

570
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,140
You can do a translation almost.

571
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
That's what had me concerned.

572
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,620
That was last year, but you never see that anymore.

573
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,840
That's on the old stock footage of the fake news, the computer-generated news.

574
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,640
Every now and then, you'll see somebody run by,

575
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:23,080
and their arm will seem disconnected from their body just slightly for a couple of frames.

576
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,660
Right, right.

577
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,120
That's one of the giveaways, just the way that it's a rendering problem.

578
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
It's amazing that they can do it that fast for live TV.

579
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,140
I've seen the head elongation.

580
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,540
I've never seen an arm or hand come undone.

581
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,120
They can do an entire crowd running from a collapsing building on TV and make it.

582
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,440
Or not.

583
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,900
Well, that's how they did the World Trade Center, isn't it?

584
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,480
No, that one was probably real, but parts of it were real.

585
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,420
Then parts of it, you just don't know.

586
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,360
What do those words mean to you?

587
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:56,960
People.

588
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,100
200 million of survival.

589
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,620
People.

590
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,540
One door, all for one state.

591
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,220
A land of laws.

592
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,240
A genius system that checks and balances.

593
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,800
That allows no man to be a man.

594
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,080
That lets no group prevail.

595
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,440
That their power is not created.

596
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,040
A real concern in the country.

597
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,640
A land of laws.

598
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,660
And it's an income.

599
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,680
Most people's only goal is to fair the lays.

600
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:42,780
It's dissimilar to the economic picture of that school.

601
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,780


602
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,840
strongly opinions about their実кая decisiveness.

603
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:42,840


604
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,200
I simply want to be a leader in this country.

605
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,200


606
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,600
I knew white America was gonna break,

607
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,720
that many were gonna break.

608
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,620
Well, athletes, whether they're huge or small,

609
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:53,620


610
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,760
The American people have now spoken,

611
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,440
but it's going to take a little while to determine exactly what they said.

612
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:13,800
Friends, and the only thing sicker than what the networks did with it

613
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,700
is this very, very strange homage or whatever

614
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,760
by Chris Corden.

615
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,440
I put my hand in my pocket.

616
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,180
How much do I feel?

617
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,860
110 stories of concrete and steel.

618
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,680
I like to play.

619
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,080
Too much.

620
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,960
That plane-shaped pole really gets me hot,

621
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,420
but the big ball of fire is the money shot.

622
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,860
I like too much.

623
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,760
I like too much the plane going in.

624
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,620
I like too much the flame shooting out.

625
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,680
People dying.

626
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,440
I like too much the fire going in.

627
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,320
While I play with my meat,

628
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,080
my steel melted and my tower is coming down.

629
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
I like too much the plane going in.

630
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:28,400
My tower is coming down.

631
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,740
I like too much the plane going in.

632
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,460
The glowing glow of a cloud Let me rise on thesteel again.

633
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:33,460


634
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,740
I like too much the plane going in.

635
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,940
I like too much the plane going in.

636
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,360
The Brock Fugilesדי Club fans said That the cemetery is darüber died structural,

637
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,360


638
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,360


639
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,040
and if you want to see the Hun schmuck at the testing site on an antipersu mai Turn the light on and later gun.

640
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:53,580
The New York skyline will never be the same, but the guys who flew those planes have a

641
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,620
fucking amazing name.

642
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,520
I like to watch.

643
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,180
I like to watch.

644
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:08,220
There must have been a reason, but I don't understand why they hit the Pentagon instead

645
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:08,960
of Disneyland.

646
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,320
I like to watch.

647
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,940
I like to watch.

648
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,680
I like to watch.

649
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,220
The plane going in.

650
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,300
I like to watch.

651
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,840
The flame shooting out.

652
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,740
It's raining broken glass while I sit on my ass.

653
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,440
My steel melted and my tower is coming down.

654
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,780
I almost had enough of watching planes explode until they showed it in reverse.

655
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:13,920


656
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:13,920


657
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:13,920


658
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:13,920


659
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:13,920


660
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,860
And I had to shoot my load

661
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,860
I like to watch

662
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,500
I like to watch

663
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,540
I like to watch

664
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,740
Now my hands all sticky

665
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,780
And I cannot find a rag

666
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,880
I guess I'll have to use

667
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,460
The American flag

668
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,580
I like to watch

669
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,260
I like to watch

670
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,940
I like to watch

671
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,540
I like to watch

672
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,480
The plane going in

673
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,540
I like to watch

674
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,180
The plane shooting out

675
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,120
People dive into the street

676
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,000
While I play with my meat

677
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
My steel melted

678
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,760
And my tower is coming down

679
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
This is all I ever needed

680
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,020
I'm on a journey

681
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,020


682
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,180
To school

683
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,180


684
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,140
To work

685
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,520
To be an astronaut

686
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm alone

687
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:26,460


688
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:26,460


689
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,360
As I saw

690
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,540
Mrsацию

691
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,480
And I pray

692
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,480


693
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:30,600
And I grow lidt

694
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,900
and you can find them on the web

695
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,180
at www.churchofeuthanasia.org

696
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,980
and church of euthanasia

697
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,220
well look up the word euthanasia

698
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,680
it's all one word

699
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,300
churchofeuthanasia.org

700
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,620
and now let's let Dr. Tim

701
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,100
put in his endorsements

702
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,720
I'm certainly not here to

703
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,060
you know to endorse

704
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,360
people shooting the Pope

705
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,760
but I was amazed

706
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,660
and amused by

707
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,820
our intelligent opinion leaders

708
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,460
like Barbara

709
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,500
Barbara Cronkite

710
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,060
is that her name?

711
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:20,960
Walter

712
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,920
Walter

713
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,660
what's gone wrong?

714
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,800
what's gone wrong

715
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,640
with human nature?

716
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,380
the Pope

717
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,280
who would want

718
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,500
to shoot the Pope?

719
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,040
well for starters

720
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,180
let's look at

721
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,560
yeah

722
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,840
there are

723
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,580
600 million people

724
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,500
fundamentalist

725
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,260
Arabs are like fundamentalist Christians

726
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,760
they actually believe that that book written

727
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,500
several hundred or more years ago

728
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,000
is the total word of God

729
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,480
to a fundamentalist

730
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,800
I don't want to insult any

731
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,440
liberal left wing acid dropping Arabs

732
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,160
in the room

733
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,260
laughter

734
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:08,300
laughter

735
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,440
laughter

736
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,000
laughter

737
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,340
laughter

738
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,340


739
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,340


740
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,340


741
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,340


742
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:10,340


743
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,720
laughter

744
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,800
there's one

745
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,380
there's one

746
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,860
there's one

747
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,040
there's one

748
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,180
but for a fundamentalist

749
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,720
Bible thumping Arab

750
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,220
or Christian

751
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,900
it's the same thing

752
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,220
they actually believe

753
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,280
that the way to get to heaven

754
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,240
you know

755
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,780
is guaranteed

756
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,860
to kill a Christian

757
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,540
or as an added attraction

758
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,420
if you don't kill a Christian

759
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,020
if you die

760
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,760
trying to kill a Christian

761
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,200
you go to heaven

762
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,520
well that

763
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:29,940
that

764
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:30,980
um

765
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,280
um

766
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,860
we interrupt this program

767
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,360
to bring you

768
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,680
an emergency news bulletin

769
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,160
repeat

770
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,900
this is an emergency bulletin

771
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,180
emergency

772
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,080
emergency

773
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,340
emergency

774
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,340


775
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,340


776
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,340


777
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:40,340


778
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,380
just a few moments ago

779
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,120
Godzilla appeared at

780
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,680
Corolla Beach

781
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,780
it is presently moving

782
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,860
toward Nagoya

783
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,680
we will be issuing

784
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,080
emergency instructions

785
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,800
keep your television

786
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,600
and radio turned on

787
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,220
music

788
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,540
music

789
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,640
music

790
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,320
music

791
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,080
music

792
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,080


793
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:06,720
music

794
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,800


795
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,920
Snap, quackle, quackle.

796
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,500
And go punch the booth.

797
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,240
I am insane.

798
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,300
Now I like waffle.

799
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,820
Now I like waffle.

800
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,180
Now I like waffle.

801
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,580
Tastes like homemade waffle.

802
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,940
But if I had it my way, I'd make them crunch.

803
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,940
The End

804
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,120
Uh, Crunch.

805
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:21,320
Crunch was the name of that excerpt by someone called Saint Alio.

806
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,640
Or Stalio. I don't know.

807
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,280
It was posted to Alt Binary Slack by the Queejeebo cartel.

808
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,780
What next, friends? I'm not sure.

809
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,440
Well, first I should mention to you that this background music

810
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,720
is Einstein's secret orchestra

811
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,600
from their CD, Witch Disco,

812
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,480
which is now released by the Subgenius Foundation.

813
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,140
And, uh, yeah, strangely enough,

814
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,500
this is an all-instrumental CD

815
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,780
by Einstein's secret orchestra,

816
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,500
which also does ESO Swamp Radio

817
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,980
from WCSB here in Cleveland,

818
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,180
at Cleveland State University.

819
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,740
And, friends, I think I know what I'm gonna do.

820
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,340
I'm gonna play you a good dose of Bleepo, Dave, Chaz, and Wee!

821
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,120
You do, and it'll be the biggest mistake you ever made,

822
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,860
you Texas brush popper.

823
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,040
Last night while I was masturbating in the bathtub,

824
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,940
I dreamed that Bleepo was gonna stick on Harry Poop Eye,

825
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,140
or Harry Poop, or whatever his name is,

826
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,180
and we would all join in in a merry entourage and dialogue.

827
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,420
Mental-mentalize.

828
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,820
That's weird.

829
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,900
Because, you know, in the book...

830
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,360
That's so weird.

831
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,520
Now, look, this is the thing that really got me about the book.

832
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,400
There's an elf who every mistake he makes

833
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,940
keeps on making him more lucky,

834
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,700
and the name of the elf is Dobby.

835
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,660
Dobby?

836
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,920
Yeah, I kid you not.

837
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,880
I kid you not.

838
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,360
Dobby's a very important animal, uh, creature.

839
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,260
I won't, you know, I won't give away any plot things here, but...

840
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,800
My, oh, my.

841
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
Dobby plays a very major role.

842
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,260
Dobbies in, uh, Celtic history are a type of...

843
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,880
They're a species, a sub-species,

844
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,180
a sub-species of leprechaun.

845
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,140
Really?

846
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,200
With a forked tail.

847
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,160
Ah.

848
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,820
And little...

849
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,960
Oh, voracious aperture.

850
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,200
Antler-like horns.

851
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,460
For Hunan beans, too.

852
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,940
Huh.

853
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
For Hunan beans.

854
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,900
Well, he starts out kind of menacing,

855
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,500
but then, in a sense, in a sort of an elfish sense,

856
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,760
not menacing, but you're not sure whether he's a good elf or a bad elf,

857
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,380
and then, you know, you find out that he is basically a good elf

858
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,340
who is forced to work for bad people.

859
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,500
Well, they have car salesman elves, too.

860
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,040
Yep.

861
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
They're kind of cheap, not direct.

862
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,160
Aren't we all...

863
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,620
Aren't we all good elves forced to work for bad people?

864
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:38,800
Really?

865
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,280
Nobody wants to see that face anymore.

866
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,080
Poster of Dobbs, go away.

867
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,480
Subgenius guru, he just makes me bored.

868
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,020
Poster of Dobbs, go away.

869
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,440
Big white woke hand, great old god of the north.

870
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,140
He's a real mean god.

871
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,460
Stole my soul, made me sing this song.

872
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,020
Now all I do is cry.

873
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,820
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

874
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,040
Oh, you scary, scary poster.

875
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,800
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

876
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,720
What color is it?

877
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,340
What color paper?

878
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:33,120
If you just rolled it up and burned the thing, I'd feel a little safer.

879
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,460
It's black and white, but never red.

880
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,960
It's just the picture of just a head.

881
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,520
My wall is empty and my bank account's bled.

882
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,000
I mean this bad, but I wish I was dead.

883
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,900
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

884
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,100
Oh, you scary, scary poster.

885
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,840
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

886
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,220
Oh, you scary, scary poster.

887
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:02,620
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

888
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,040
Why did you do this to me?

889
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,900
Now I've seen everything I've ever wanted to see.

890
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,300
Now I'm everything I've ever wanted to be.

891
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,820
Poster of Dobbs, when will I be free?

892
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,120
The grin is friendly, but I know it's a lie.

893
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,460
Excuse me while I twitch and die.

894
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,960
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

895
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,740
Oh, you scary, scary poster.

896
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,900
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

897
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:44,780
Oh, you poster of Dobbs.

898
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,240
Wee, friends, that was Gary Gobofam,

899
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,200
the great Gary Gobofam of the band that dare not speak its name.

900
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,300
And I should also mention that some of the wonderful sounds and clips that we've been hearing

901
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:10,940
were posted to Alt Binary Slack by Zinu, I-M-B-J-R, and Reverend Tesla Coyle.

902
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,820
Now there's this band, I'm going to play this song by a band discovered in Fort Worth

903
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:22,780
by our good friends Doc Froth and Sister Decadence called The Necrotones.

904
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,820
They're one of those, well, it's not exactly, it's kind of like lounge goth.

905
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,440
I think you can imagine what you need to know from this.

906
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,120
Thank you. Good evening, darlings.

907
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,100
I'm Necrophilia, diva of the dead.

908
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,160
And yes, we are the Necrotones.

909
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,520
You know, I was talking with a cool friend of mine the other evening,

910
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,560
and she said, Necky, love the act, the band's great, the music swings,

911
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,240
but there's one thing I just don't understand.

912
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,880
You play songs by bands that are considered dead,

913
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,740
or songs by bands that have experienced the spectacular rock and roll death,

914
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,040
or, well, songs about death.

915
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,580
What's up with that?

916
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,420
Morticia, I said.

917
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,000
Lift the lid, bitch, get a clue.

918
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,420
I've left the deck.

919
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,460
I love the dead for their comb,

920
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,920
the blueing flesh for meat to hold.

921
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,060
Cadaverize upon me, see nothing.

922
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,980
I love the dead before they rise.

923
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,920
No farewells, no goodbyes.

924
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,460
I never even knew your now rotting face.

925
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,140
While friends and lovers mourn your silly grave,

926
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,780
I have other uses for you, darling.

927
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,760
La la la la la la la

928
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:23,760

Day to day to day to day

938
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,460
I love the dead

939
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,480
So

940
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,300
I love the dead

941
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,340
I love the dead

942
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,100
I love the dead

943
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,880
So

944
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,200
Don't grit!

945
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,480
Okay, grit!

946
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:12,640
Don't grit!

947
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,200

Gaylord M. Falker?

962
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,420
Gaylord?

963
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,120
What?

964
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:15,740
Gaylord?

965
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,860
Yeah, that's me.

966
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,960
I thought your name was Greg.

967
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,900
It is.

968
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,340
That's not what it says on the phone.

969
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,200
I know.

970
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,080
It's my legal name.

971
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:26,220
Nobody's called me by it since I was in third grade.

972
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,480
All right, whatever.

973
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

974
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,280
See, your name's Gay Falker.

975
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:35,900
What?

976
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:50,060
I have a story I need to tell.

977
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,460
It's kind of boring, but I know it well.

978
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,220
The phone rings at 9 a.m.

979
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,980
It wakes me up, so I answer it.

980
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,440
There's a lady on the other end

981
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:16,900
Speaking very quickly something like this

982
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,780
A bunch of words, a bunch of words

983
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,980
Ron's appliance

984
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,260
And then another bunch of words

985
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,800
I kindly mention

986
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,880
She has the wrong number

987
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,640
No, I doubt 5516278

988
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,300
Says the hurried voice

989
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,800
Correcting me

990
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,480
Assuring me

991
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,460
I'm Ron's appliance

992
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,400
I think about it

993
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,780
I think about it

994
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:56,780


995
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,060
I think about it

996
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:58,740
Perhaps she's right

997
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,440
Perhaps I've forgotten

998
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,260
I live in an appliance store

999
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,560
No, I decide

1000
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,840
After looking around my living room

1001
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,140
This is no appliance store

1002
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,260
I am not Ron

1003
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,680
With newfound confidence

1004
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,800
I speak to her

1005
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,880
Like a

1006
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,780
I'm Ron's appliance

1007
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,440
Patient stranger to a

1008
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,140
Wrong number

1009
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,760
I'm sure you dialed wrong

1010
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,760
This is 5516178

1011
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,360
I emphasize the second one

1012
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,580
I sense her illusioned reality

1013
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,780
Is crashing swiftly before her

1014
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,900
But not before she gets the last word in

1015
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,500
Oh

1016
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,780
And then she asks me to tell her

1017
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,880
She hangs up the phone

1018
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,700
She hangs up the phone

1019
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,300
Say y'all

1020
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:06,700
Ron's Appliance by Sherry Elf

1021
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,480
The strange Sherry Elf

1022
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,360
And you can get information on her music

1023
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,900
From www.sherryelf.com

1024
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,860
And that Sherry Elf is like one word

1025
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,200
And here it is spelt

1026
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,760
S-H-A-R-Y-E-L-F

1027
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:31,020
S-H-A-R-Y-E-L-F

1028
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:35,580
As in Frank Sherry Elf

1029
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,420
And this background music of course is

1030
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,600
By Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1031
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,940
From their Witch Disco CD

1032
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,120
And now I am EJR

1033
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,240
It's also very exciting to know

1034
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,300
ein maximum der

1035
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:00,940

Jetzt矄�요

1037
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,780
I got this

1038
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,160
I just like to go get to eardrums

1039
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,660
So my voice

1040
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,240
I respect theWhiteB확

1041
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:25,060
I don't get to eardrums

1042
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,220
Oh my god, there was this guy, and he came over and he was like,

1043
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,380
Wee!

1044
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,440
Oh my god, I went over to my mom and she was like,

1045
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:31,640
Wee!

1046
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,480
I was so afraid because I went over and I said,

1047
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:33,940
Hey, Dad, wee!

1048
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,720
Oh my god, then there was this guy, and he goes,

1049
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,560
Hey, I got a knife and I go,

1050
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:36,740
Wee!

1051
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,560
So I went up to a sub-gangster and he was like,

1052
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,260
Yo, motherfucker, wee!

1053
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,620
Yo, I saw a dude on the street and he was like,

1054
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:42,740
Wee, bitch!

1055
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,760
Yo, I saw this kid on a wheelchair and he was going down the hill really fast,

1056
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,060
and he was like,

1057
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,380
Wee!

1058
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,300
Yo, I was watching a movie in the theater and this guy,

1059
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:47,640
he was like,

1060
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,100
Oh, I got popcorn!

1061
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:48,600
And I was like,

1062
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,200
Oh my god, wee!

1063
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,540
When you're a kid and you wanna go wee,

1064
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,780
but you ain't got drugs yet.

1065
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,600
You hold on for your life.

1066
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,560
Hold on to your little gonads in strife.

1067
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:18,440
Gonads in strife.

1068
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,880
Go hands in strife, go hands in strife, go hands in strife

1069
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,280
Go hands in the lightning, in the lightning, in the rain

1070
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,540
Whee!

1071
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,120
Yo, I saw a squirrel across the street and it got in my car, so it was like, whee, whee!

1072
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,480
That was Whee by Three Brain.

1073
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,560
And don't ask me, friends.

1074
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:47,500
Let's now join Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Professor Chaz Smith

1075
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,980
to learn what has happened to the voices in our heads.

1076
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,180
The voices in our head have become the voices that we speak with.

1077
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,460
The voices have become one.

1078
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,360
It's just a...

1079
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,400
Uh, yes.

1080
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,420
It's just a...

1081
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,820
Here it is again.

1082
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,260
Oh!

1083
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,220
Lonesome Cowboy Dave!

1084
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,620
These are deadly.

1085
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,400
Bill Abernathy!

1086
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,360
There he's a desperado.

1087
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,760
Oh, we gotta wait for the next chorus to keep doing the rundown.

1088
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,900
Before that, we'll come back to the other part.

1089
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,780
We're gonna have to wait until they sing Desperado 8-Minute.

1090
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,180
Or even once, for that matter.

1091
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,180
Or even thrice, for that matter.

1092
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,460
Giving you and yours comfort.

1093
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,640
And divers.

1094
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,100
Like a voice in a mist from above.

1095
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,000
They look down their lives.

1096
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:46,700
They look down their shoes.

1097
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,480
They look down their lives.

1098
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,880
They look with a pale, pale sky.

1099
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,960
Here it is.

1100
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:52,960
Ready, Dave?

1101
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,040
Ready, Dave?

1102
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,540
And princess, we are dome.

1103
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,380
A desperado.

1104
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:03,960
And Professor...

1105
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,620
A desperado friends and Professor Chad Smith dances with rockets.

1106
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,260
He's a desperado.

1107
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,220
He's a desperate man.

1108
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,860
I am a desperado.

1109
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,480
I am a desperado.

1110
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:17,480


1111
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:17,480


1112
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,160
Force.

1113
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,740
Right here.

1114
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,000
Proof.

1115
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,620
And you,

1116
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,320
the listener,

1117
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,680
are a rubber-faced

1118
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,160
walking acid flashback.

1119
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,500
And all of us,

1120
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,800
each and every one of us,

1121
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,560
together

1122
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,160
in this

1123
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,580
strange world

1124
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,280
are desperados.

1125
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,380
We are all desperados.

1126
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,120
We are all desperados.

1127
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,820
My God, we're desperados.

1128
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:52,840
Waiting.

1129
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,700
Waiting.

1130
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,300
Where is the train?

1131
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,500
Have you got a ticket, my friend?

1132
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,980
The conductor's coming.

1133
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:09,340
Bye-bye.

1134
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,120
We've dreamed us up a kitchen.

1135
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,940
And sang another verse

1136
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,800
to that old song.

1137
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:25,900
Come on, Jack.

1138
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,180
That son of a gun's a-coming.

1139
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,920
Like desperados

1140
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,760
waiting for the train.

1141
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,000
The path of the righteous man

1142
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,120
is beset on all sides

1143
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,120
by the inequities of the selfish

1144
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,420
and the tyranny of mob.

1145
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,860

Long cow, Dave.

1161
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,300
Don't you know?

1162
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,060
Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?
