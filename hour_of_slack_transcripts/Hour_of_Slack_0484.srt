1
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:22,380
I'll start with you. I'm getting leery of these offshore funds. I suggest we sell 10,000 shares of OUS. What's your opinion?

2
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,820
Give me a moment, Bob. There is something I want to check on that.

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,700
The entire San Francisco stock has been stolen. John Bishop has been liquidated.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,620
Yes, my information seems to indicate a sell. I agree.

5
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,260
Now to regular matters. Do you have the joint venture agreement with Yugoslavia handy?

6
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,240
Strange, strange. That looks just like Bob.

7
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,320
No, stop!

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,620
We gotta warn Bob that the mask he's delivering is really a Bob Megabyte.

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,420
And I didn't want to tell you those from him because you never let me input anything exciting.

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,060
But I didn't know it was gonna get Bob in trouble and I was wondering if Megabytes are gonna blow up any nanosecond if we don't.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,380
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:25,980
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

13
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,100
The new Prime Minister.

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,400
You're a swat.

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,060
The aims as published in the manifesto are total domination of the world by 1958.

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,660
That's what we're planning to do. We've had to revise it. We're hoping to bring a new manifesto out with a more realistic target.

17
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,740
How we aim to go about it is as follows.

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,200
We shall move about into people's rooms and say,

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,560
Excuse me, we are the World Domination League. May we dominate you?

20
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,100
Dude, Bob's in major trouble, and it's all my fault!

21
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,460
Howdy!

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
The end.

23
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,460
Howdy.

24
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,920
Well, that was it.

25
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,820
Howdy.

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,360
So much for all the...

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,020
I got caught dead in my tracks.

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,580
Here I am, standing here, three feet away from the microphone.

29
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,000
Trying to work them...

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,420
I don't even have the other headphones.

31
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,440
Am I on the air?

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:42,960
No.

33
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,660
No?

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,280
We don't...

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,800
We're not starting yet, don't worry about it.

36
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,000
Hello.

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,420
Go ahead and use the bathroom if you need to, right now.

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,680
Here, listen to this for a while.

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,120
We're not on the air yet.

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,100
Oh, baby, here we go.

41
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,180
Oh, baby, here we go.

42
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,180


43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,180


44
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,180


45
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,180


46
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,160
We'll be right there.

47
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,500
My lithium, baby, can't you see?

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,900
Oh!

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,660
Oh, yeah!

50
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,460
My TV is watching me.

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,800
My TV is watching me.

52
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,240
You know, if a solar flex ain't nothing but a very expensive hat rack, baby!

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,720
Oh, and my goal in life is to be picking my nose on TV

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,120
because my TV is watching me.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,760
I can't find my remote.

56
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,420
I can't find my remote.

57
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,380
I don't know where it goes.

58
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,220
My TV is watching me.

59
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,440
I see Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie.

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,020
Malcolm X is a hat, but Luther King is a street.

61
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,300
My TV is watching me.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,120
I was in Branson, Missouri, and I was hooked on phonics.

63
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,260
My name's Carbuncle Jones, and I'm supersonic.

64
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,740
I see the one, two, three faces of Bob.

65
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,260
I see the one, two, three faces of Bob.

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,040
Bob in the replacements.

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,660
Bob the self-genius.

68
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,580
Bob.

69
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,620
Bob on three, two, three.

70
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,900
Yeah, everybody!

71
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,100
Yeah, everybody!

72
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,100


73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah, everybody!

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,720
My TV is watching me.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,900
My TV is watching me.

76
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,260
I got Latter-day Saints messing with me.

77
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,540
And knocking on my door won't let me be.

78
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,760
My TV is watching me.

79
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,380
Well, the outcasts will be heard.

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
You gotta speak the truth.

81
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,600
Make the weak and the greedy.

82
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,100
Make the weak and the greedy.

83
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,100


84
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,100


85
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,100


86
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:25,860
Make the weak and the greedy.

87
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm reeking the credo.

88
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,940
I'm reeking the credo.

89
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm reeking the credo.

lonesome cowboy Dave and Chaz recordings from ESO radio there in Cleveland.

131
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:24,380
So the WCSB listeners, praise WCSB, will have to listen twice to this horrible, horrible thing.

132
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:36,120
It's more scariness and mystery radio there also with Pee Wee Ardo and some new OBE is coming up.

133
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,060
Friends, it's horrible. Yes, yes, we must help Bob. He has the mask and the frappy.

134
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,380
He's about to sell off Yugoslavia.

135
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,940
Yugoslavia. We must stop him.

136
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,500
And Bob has no idea. I see what you mean. We've got to warn Bob.

137
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,440
Well, there's still a Bob to warn.

138
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,900
We must assume we have been penetrated.

139
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,560
We are sending all Darfur personnel out of the country on trumped up errands.

140
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,840
We want five thoroughly reliable men sent here at once.

141
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,120
Usual covers.

142
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,660
Now, production simply must be increased at the Turin plant.

143
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,580
We believe Giovanni should be replaced.

144
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,400
I'd like everybody's opinion on that.

145
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,640
All existing heroin from Marseille refinery and increased purchases of raw opium in Turkey, regardless of price.

146
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,960
Zach and I agree on Melatesta.

147
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,040
What do you think?

148
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,680
We agree, Bob.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,580
Okay.

150
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,720
Same time, day after tomorrow.

151
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:43,900
Jesus.

152
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,080
If we've been penetrated.

153
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,000
If I know Bob, God help the smart bastards who did it.

154
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,380
Oh, no. Is that possible?

155
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,320
Is that possible?

156
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:03,940
Possibly.

157
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,840
Possibly a show has gone through.

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,280
Oh, no. Not now.

159
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,880
Oh, no.

160
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,080
Bob.

161
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,080
Bob's racing against the clock.

162
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
And the clock's gonna win.

163
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,040
You know what this means, Enzo.

164
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,520
Oh, boy, do I.

165
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,300
Time has come.

166
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,000
Turn on.

167
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,080
To the live view.

168
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,740
Tune in.

169
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
And drop out.

170
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,120
Are you ready?

171
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,220
Experiencing an arctic gas gas.

172
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,280
Your colors become electric.

173
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,880
Sounds reverberate.

174
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,340
It's all part of a cosmic.

175
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,140
Unconscious.

176
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
Turn on.

177
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,100
Tune in.

178
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,840
And drop out.

179
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,740
Are you ready?

180
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,380
Man, you're talking about a war crime.

181
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,100
I got one.

182
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,760
We got one for you now, friends.

183
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,120
Oh, that was OBE.

184
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,340
Out of band experience.

185
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,780
You should call them up for their catalog.

186
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,500
One six one seven lick OBE.

187
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,980
Can't say that number enough for you.

188
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,920
One six one seven lick OBE.

189
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,200
It's actually a really fun answer machine thing that you get to hear.

190
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,700
And now I don't want to have to deal with these guys again.

191
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,320
But we're going to have to go back in there.

192
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,060
Friends back in that ugly, ugly, ugly place.

193
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,760
The studio at WCSB.

194
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,400
For Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

195
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,880
History.

196
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
Man.

197
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,200
Right!

198
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,220
Gaze deep into your radio speaker.

199
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:43,680
And you can visit heaven anytime you want.

200
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,480
It's a big, big lie.

201
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:56,940
Journey to the center, to the very center of the web of your mind.

202
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,720
Man was not meant to fly.

203
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,860
Hundreds of people reported seeing and sense in the belt of their human.

204
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,980
The good, the slack, and the Dave.

205
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,920
Woman was not meant to kiss the bird.

206
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:39,960
Yep.

207
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,380
Dave was riding across the prairie,

208
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,380
toting his drum,

209
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:46,680
toting his guitar,

210
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,900
shooting fairies.

211
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,460
Shooting fairies out there.

212
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,740
They were extinct by the time he made it across the range.

213
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,640
By the time the range wizards made it there,

214
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,140
there were only five people left.

215
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Yee-haw!

216
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,460
Lonesome cowboy Dave all alone there on the prairie.

217
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,480
Talk about heliocentric world.

218
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,420
The lava pools was melting.

219
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Him and those angels that he could hear whispering in his head.

220
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,320
The angels that told him,

221
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,000
Dave,

222
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,120
who to kill.

223
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,060
Dave.

224
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,200
You know who.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,740
You know who, Dave.

226
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,620
They told him who to kill.

227
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,980
He was a gunslinger.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,420
Yeah.

229
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,820
Gunslinger and a pooter pop.

230
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,920
He was a holy gunslinger.

231
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,780
He was a preacher.

232
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,900
A preacher on the range, on the wild, wild west.

233
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,560
A gun guru with a fast hand and a quick conversation.

234
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,680
The gun.

235
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,080
The gun because it has no sex.

236
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,080
The gun is the perfect teacher.

237
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,540
The gun has no name.

238
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,260
The gun has no identity.

239
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,100
The gun has no sex.

240
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,880
Oh, no, not the gun.

241
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,960
Not the gun.

242
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,400
The revolution come from the gun.

243
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,760
The revolution is a thief.

244
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,860
He was the mal-quoting.

245
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,700
Cowboy that rode the range.

246
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,280
Lowbrow spouting.

247
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,800
Carrying that little red book and the big black book.

248
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,120
And also.

249
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,040
There was no contradiction in him to Dave.

250
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
My cage and his cage.

251
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,780
And he won.

252
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,580
He was going to bring communism and Christianity to the west at the same time.

253
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,420
Get down on your knees.

254
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,040
Get down on your hands and knees.

255
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,780
Do you see who this is before you?

256
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,900
This is not the picture of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

257
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,560
This is Vladimir Indy.

258
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,900
He's Lenin.

259
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,740
And I want you to know what he did.

260
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,840
Did you ever hear the story of Lenin's raincoat?

261
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,520
No, no, I mean Lenin's overcoat.

262
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,980
Oh, hold down there, cowboy.

263
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,060
I want to make a few introductions here before they go and scramble your brains completely.

264
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,120
Welcome to this batch of recordings by Olo T. Schickelgrover and the Happy Philanthropist Orchestra.

265
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,920
Our first tune is a little number that goes something like this.

266
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,020
I don't even know what you always say about me.

267
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,280
This is so.

268
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,280


269
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,460
Uh-oh.

270
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,160
Uh-oh.

271
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,900
Uh-oh.

272
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,220
Uh-oh.

273
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,280
Uh-oh.

274
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:35,800
Uh-oh.

275
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,020
I am a jelly pill donut

276
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,180
I am a jelly pill donut

277
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,560
I am a jelly pill donut

278
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,900
I am a jelly pill donut

279
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,840
Ich bin ein Berliner

280
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,300
Ich bin ein Berliner

281
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,480
Ich bin ein Berliner

282
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,440
Ich bin ein Berliner

283
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,540
Ich bin ein Berliner

284
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,700
Ich bin ein Berliner

285
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,600
This is ESO Radio

286
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,100
and my guest in the studio

287
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,500
is not the normal Einstein secret orchestra.

288
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,100
No.

289
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,920
No, the baboon is not here tonight.

290
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,980
The violin is not here.

291
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,440
Well, she might be later.

292
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,840
In the studio

293
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,280
for your listening pleasures

294
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,220
this evening

295
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,200
this evening only

296
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,960
and only on WCSB.

297
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,240
Visit heaven anytime you want.

298
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,080
Anytime?

299
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,120
Anytime.

300
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,580
Day or night.

301
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,800
Day or night.

302
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,660
Simply gaze skyward

303
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,240
and point that third nostril

304
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,300
directly above the emerald wings.

305
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,660
The princes we are Doe,

306
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,220
lonesome cowboy Dave,

307
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,800
and the reverend Ivan Stang.

308
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,580
My name is Chaz

309
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,400
and I'll be mixing this whole mess.

310
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,420
So sit back and do your job.

311
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,780
He's the mess mixer.

312
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,680
Don't relax.

313
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,440
And we're gonna play a game.

314
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:38,920
Ha!

315
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,980
My friends.

316
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,920
Game time.

317
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,800
We're going to play a fun game called

318
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,800
The Subgenius Reality Reboot.

319
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,720
La la la la la la la la.

320
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,740
Pornological de-mentertainment.

321
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,940
With your mind in mind.

322
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,340
As I used to say back in the old days,

323
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,820
but seriously now friends,

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,920
this is a game that works from your radio,

325
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,030
out.

326
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,610
You plugged a little disk into your radio.

327
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,510
Go ahead.

328
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,490
The one that came in the mail.

329
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,970
That slipped out from between the pages of that magazine.

330
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,030
You know.

331
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,510
It's so repugnant I can't stop at it.

332
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,390
You're gonna love this game, man.

333
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,630
It's better than life.

334
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,590
I hate life.

335
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,990
You'll find it a handy replacement for your life.

336
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,390
I need a handy wipe for my replacing life.

337
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,150
What there was of your life.

338
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,090
I hate life.

339
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


340
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


341
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


342
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


343
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


344
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


345
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


346
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


347
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


348
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


349
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


350
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


351
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,090


352
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,690
It is the bomb.

353
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,250
Guaranteed, friends,

354
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,330
to utterly and totally change your life forever

355
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,010
and get you to think like Dobbs.

356
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,010
And what an awful mistake that would be

357
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,490
for each and every one of you.

358
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,310
So put your hands on the screen.

359
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,570
Go ahead.

360
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,230
Reach up there.

361
00:20:59,290 --> 00:20:59,850
Touch.

362
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,970
Caress the screen.

363
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,510
Screeeen.

364
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,950
And put your ear up against the speaker.

365
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:16,170
Because what you want to do is get the image injected directly into your eye's retina.

366
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,650
And if you can take those little wires out,

367
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,310
unclip them from the speaker,

368
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:26,050
and take a little alligator clip and put the same wires from the speaker

369
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,850
right against your eardrum.

370
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,730
You have to use really tiny alligator clips that go down inside your ear

371
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,350
and clip it right to the eardrum

372
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,670
because we don't want any,

373
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,830
anything,

374
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,610
you know,

375
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,850
this doesn't need to be filtered through the air.

376
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,550
It picks up a lot of pollution and conspiracy taint that way.

377
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,590
Now,

378
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,630
lean in.

379
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,730
If you want the quick 10 second,

380
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,210
quick implant brainwash,

381
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,010
just lean in real close.

382
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,050
And when you see Bob come up on the screen,

383
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,770
give him a great big kiss.

384
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,590
Go ahead.

385
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,890
Don't be embarrassed.

386
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,430
Even if you're a guy,

387
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,550
you know,

388
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,250
he's a deity.

389
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,110
It's not like just some guy.

390
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,270
It's Bob.

391
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,430
It's Bob.

392
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:14,570
It's Bob.

393
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,030
Go ahead, Dave.

394
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:16,770
Can you kiss?

395
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,350
Oh, come on.

396
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:18,830
Go ahead.

397
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,970
You can kiss Bob.

398
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,650
Kiss the hem of his garment.

399
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,510
Oh, God.

400
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,070
Hey.

401
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,490
No, that's not it.

402
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,370
That's kind of gross, man.

403
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,330
Oh, God.

404
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,130
Oh, God.

405
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,890
Oh, God.

406
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:36,990
Oh, God.

407
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


408
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


409
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


410
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


411
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


412
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


413
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,010


414
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:37,750
Oh, God.

415
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,070
Oh, God.

416
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,110
Oh, God.

417
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:40,410
Oh, God.

418
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:40,410


419
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:40,410


420
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,750
Everybody's grossed out, Dave.

421
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,610
OK, wipe up the Dave slobber off of the Bob hem.

422
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,350
I mean,

423
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,150
remember to use these special handy wipes.

424
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,030
They can retain a disinfectant and not leave you

425
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,230
when the time comes.

426
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,290
And that's right.

427
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,470
Just let the disinfectant roll over you.

428
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,990
It's going to clean out all your hair.

429
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,430
all those other viruses.

430
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,950
It will replace your previous viruses

431
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,730
with a new one.

432
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:19,230
A special new telepathic brain-eater type virus.

433
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,230
It actually...

434
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,970
What it does is it creates tool-pick hallucinations.

435
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,670
In other words, if you concentrate closely enough...

436
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,070
Focus.

437
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,330
Focus on the music...

438
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:33,910
Focus.

439
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,170
...that Chaz is playing there.

440
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,630
Bring everything...

441
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,870
Focus on the music.

442
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,490
Now, concentrate.

443
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,110
Think of Bob dancing to the music like a little puppet.

444
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,050
Focus on that.

445
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,210
Let the wet wear of your very synapses be rewritten.

446
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,190
Just follow the bouncing ball, the bouncing pipe,

447
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,470
and concentrate.

448
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,710
Concentrate, friends.

449
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,150
Help Bob to slant the head...

450
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,570
Half-worlds, just so.

451
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,890
Okay, if Bob can slant the two half-worlds

452
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,830
at just the right metaphysical angles,

453
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,270
it will open up the axis, the astral axis.

454
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:26,770
You'll be able to cruise the Akashic Records at 78 RPM.

455
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,010
As a symbolic, this is the occlusion of both hemispheres

456
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,230
wherein prismized beauty, Akashic Records,

457
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,730
which did that all, which is happening,

458
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:35,990
well, will happen, perhaps.

459
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,010
Just look at this show as a dream stimulation device.

460
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,310
Just close your eyes and let the dreams wash over you.

461
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,910
It's what they call an organic virtual reality game.

462
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,950
Yes, yes.

463
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,050
It's a game, only a game.

464
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,490
Let the oracle of the sex goddesses

465
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,150
come to the forefront of your third night.

466
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:06,770
Nostril.

467
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,970
Drink, drink, deep draft.

468
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:11,310
Drink steeply of that draft.

469
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,310
What? You have to go to the bathroom now?

470
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,530
All right, you may go to the bathroom.

471
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,590
We all may go to the bathroom before resuming.

472
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:23,870
Resume.

473
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:26,430
All right, now reboot the deity.

474
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,270
The deity.

475
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,230
He just lit up.

476
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,630
The deity just lit up.

477
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,930
He's rebooted.

478
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,770
Okay.

479
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,910
Now, what was it we were going to talk about?

480
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,390
We were recreating a human form

481
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,810
of a combination of a new form of recombinant DNA

482
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:49,610
you had developed,

483
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,570
and also a polyphone which you had developed,

484
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,030
and we were going to go deep, deep, deep into the oracle.

485
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,110
Deep into the oracle.

486
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,150
Just lean into the foam.

487
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,450
Just sink into the foam.

488
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,250
You're floating in a sea of pills, friends.

489
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,970
You're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to taste them, see them, hear them.

490
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,130
Yeah, go ahead, kids.

491
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,530
Oh, yeah.

492
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,050
Make that pact with the devil.

493
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,530
Yeah, listen to that crazy, weird show on the radio.

494
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,390
Go ahead and drink them liquid false slack drugs.

495
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,490
Yeah, go get it.

496
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,390
You're going to sign up.

497
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,590
Sign up with the devil.

498
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,590
I tell you, man, sometimes I can't stop crying, man.

499
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,450
Yeah, play it.

500
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,110
Sometimes I just can't stop crying, man.

501
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,590
Play your music backwards.

502
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,950
Sign up with Satan.

503
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,110
Pay your taxes.

504
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,670
Go ahead.

505
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,010
I tell you, listen to my voice.

506
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,050
I speak at a time.

507
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,970
It's your soul.

508
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,290
I talk to you and I die.

509
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,170
I die on my knees.

510
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,070
I, I, I.

511
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,870
Well, it's your soul for now.

512
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,670
Where is owned?

513
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,230
Which cannot be owned?

514
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,070
What sees?

515
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,090
What cannot see?

516
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,310
What hears?

517
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,230
What cannot hear?

518
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:04,670
Yeah.

519
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,150
What looks at its own eyes?

520
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,750
What can't look at its own eyes?

521
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,590
Shut up, little man.

522
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,730
Shut up, little man.

523
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,650
Nobody asked you to say anything.

524
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,410
Shut up, little man.

525
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,370
I've had some wonderful ideas for getting the dominating going.

526
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:29,690
I've got some extremely subtle advertising slogans that should get the public behind us.

527
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,150
You know, Bob isn't one of these namby-pamby,

528
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:39,690
uh, messiahs that thinks that you have to be forgiven for something.

529
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,110
He, he's not here to forgive your sins.

530
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,250
He doesn't care what your sins are.

531
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,210
He probably never even noticed them.

532
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,690
But he does bring not forgiveness, nay, but an excuse, Bill.

533
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,710
A, a rationalization, a great justification for your sins.

534
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,290
And he sells a $3 certificate that will, uh, guarantee that everyone knows that you have

535
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,690
that all-inclusive divine excuse.

536
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,890
You know, cause what do you really need?

537
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,750
Do you need forgiveness?

538
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,090
Have you done anything that you really need?

539
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,510
Well, I shouldn't ask you that.

540
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:13,750
But don't you really need an excuse more than you need the forgiveness?

541
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,650
You know, let's be practical about it.

542
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,090
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,630
I saw an advertisement the other day for the Secret of Life.

544
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,750
It said the Secret of Life can be yours for 25 shillings.

545
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,890
Send to Secret of Life Institute, Wilsdon.

546
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,650
Uh, so I wrote away, seemed a good bargain, Secret of Life, 25 shillings.

547
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,870
And, uh, I wrote it down.

548
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:40,350
And I got a letter back saying, if you think you can get the Secret of Life for 25 shillings,

549
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,290
you don't deserve to have it.

550
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,610
I don't know.

551
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,830
It's some kind of a mystery.

552
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,970
It doesn't make sense.

553
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,710
It doesn't make sense.

554
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,610
I mean, you listen to the show and you wonder just what it is they're talking about.

555
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,950
Fine, just go.

556
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,550
We're Bob's only hope.

557
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,910
You haven't lost me yet.

558
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:04,870
I'm not going to.

559
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,610
Bob!

560
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,290
Bob!

561
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,630
Dude, go away.

562
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,970
Bob!

563
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,070
Warning, game corruption.

564
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,810
Yes, Bob, you're okay.

565
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,330
Not good.

566
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,650
This is not good.

567
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,810
Bob!

568
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,190
Bob!

569
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:34,870
Bob!

570
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


571
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


572
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


573
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


574
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


575
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


576
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


577
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


578
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


579
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


580
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


581
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


582
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


583
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


584
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


585
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


586
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


587
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,870


588
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,270
I am a jelly-billed donut.

589
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,070
I am a jelly-billed donut.

590
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,130
Open up my side.

591
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,590
Look in the middle.

592
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,430
You will see a little bit of jelly right there.

593
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,110
I am a jelly-billed donut.

594
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,190
Get a little bit of powder sprinkled on my top.

595
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,870
Leave it on there.

596
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,050
Leave it on there.

597
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:54,870
Oh, man.

598
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,710
It's enough to drive you completely out of your mind, isn't it?

599
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:06,370
Yes, this is Olo T. Schicklgruber there with the happy philanthropist orchestra.

600
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,730
Frightening.

601
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,550
No, it's on the air.

602
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,330
Why can't I...

603
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,550
I'm all scared.

604
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,590
I'm all confused.

605
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,850
I thought I could hear and see and be TV, but...

606
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,590
But is that the one I'm thinking of?

607
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,690
No, no, that's not...

608
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,650
I'm all wrong here.

609
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,030
That's...

610
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,910
Well, see and see, and I don't see.

611
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,070
See never will.

612
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,970
Gosh darn it.

613
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,830
What's wrong with Channel 2?

614
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,030
Channel Toodaloo.

615
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,690
It just doesn't...

616
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,210
It has a real hard, hard bad thing.

617
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,370
Oh, no point in complaining about it.

618
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,170
Okay, you better get it.

619
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,250
Boy, it's dancing all over the place.

620
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,370
That effervescent...

621
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:30,690
Oh.

622
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,170
Phantom spirit.

623
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,010
Swirling and twisting.

624
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,030
Look at it go.

625
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,550
Around and around and around.

626
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:37,850
There we go.

627
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,810
We're backing up the spirit.

628
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,470
And let's see here.

629
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,470
See if you can...

630
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,430
It seems to be a VH problem.

631
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,210
You know what I mean?

632
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,090
Yeah, UVH, I think it is.

633
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,050
Oh, I do not.

634
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,030
Just see if there's a special control.

635
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,790
You know, they often have a little teensy knob on the back or the side for the V.

636
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,170
Let's see here.

637
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,850
Whoa, whoa.

638
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,030
See these newer...

639
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,790
Oh, you had it for a moment.

640
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,390
Oh, yeah?

641
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,150
Okay, all right.

642
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,370
Do you have the VH knoblet?

643
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,390
There.

644
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:06,870
Oh.

645
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,230
Yes, in Gobbler's Knob, Nantucket,

646
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,730
this strange stone was found.

647
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,550
A new system narrowing and broadcasting your brain.

648
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,570
So if you're watching Channel 2, that's what's happening.

649
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,110
We're joining a little bit late the scary, spooky story.

650
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,670
In fact, we don't even know what the scary, spooky story is.

651
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,310
It's the story of the lost jewelry of Atlantis.

652
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,350
Not that again.

653
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,630
Well, there it is.

654
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,630
In all its impotent splendor.

655
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,950
Shut up, little man.

656
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,430
I got a decent dinner ready.

657
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,470
Nothing happened with the dinner.

658
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,770
Because you crucified it.

659
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,190
You ruined it.

660
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,570
Shut up, little man.

661
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,690
But Dr. Legume demonstrated last week with a couple of spoons in a restaurant

662
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,430
that you can, in fact, gaze upon your own eyes.

663
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,710
He did.

664
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,330
He did.

665
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,690
He did.

666
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:00,690


667
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:00,690


668
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,210
He did.

669
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:01,790
He did.

670
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:01,930
He did.

671
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:01,930


672
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,690
He was.

673
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,070
He was.

674
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,130
He was.

675
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,570
He used a spoon on either eye inserted.

676
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,150
Now, kids, don't try this at home.

677
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:15,030
This was done by a professionally trained subgenius psychic surgeon,

678
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,930
Dr. Katahdin Legume, in a Chinese restaurant.

679
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:24,190
And he would insert the spoon underneath the eyelid,

680
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,390
the bottom of one eye, and underneath the other eye,

681
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,550
and slowly, carefully...

682
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:30,690
Slowly.

683
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:36,090
try the eyeballs out of his socket without disturbing he would stretch the

684
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,810
optic nerve and the muscles but he wouldn't tear them and he'd pull his

685
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:48,210
eyes out pop them out just enough and then turn them inwards so that he could

686
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,850
actually be looking from one eye into the other eye.

687
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,150
or then he would fork over his eyes and they look just like

688
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:06,530
Gordy on Star Trek it was amazing it was it was funny dinner tricks and it's a

689
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:10,910
shame that we couldn't bring the opening act from the Pittsburgh subgenius'

690
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:16,390
diVivals to Cleveland because there was a wonderful opening act called circus

691
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:19,870
apocalypse do you remember them princess we are the

692
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,830
Yes I do. It would be very hard for me to forget about that.

693
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:23,830


694
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:23,830


695
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,590
I'll never forget the things that I saw them do that night.

696
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,830
It was a return to the good old days of vaudeville.

697
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,110
You know, kids are bored with MTV and the public executions

698
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,390
and the broomsticks up the wazoo on TV nowadays.

699
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:45,210
So they like to see live shows where people bleed for their art.

700
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,010
I mean, this is real art, friends.

701
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,410
You call them people?

702
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:53,750
This guy, this young practicing artist stood in front of this

703
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,770
dues-paying subgenius crowd and hammered a nail,

704
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:03,330
a six-inch nail, into his nose, straight into his human nose.

705
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,810
Seen here on screen six.

706
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,810
You really did it.

707
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,970
You call it a human nose?

708
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,950
He then extracted the nail and replaced it with a long screwdriver.

709
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,390
Deep into his sinuses, his third nostril,

710
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,230
opened up all the way.

711
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,970
And he said that it...

712
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,030
We said, does it hurt?

713
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,250
And he said, not enough to...

714
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,190
get off.

715
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,610
And then this young man at this subgenius revival,

716
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,990
and this is the kind of religion we're in, friends,

717
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,510
he stood up there and he ate handfuls of live mealworms,

718
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,270
live crickets, and one screaming Madagascar cockroach

719
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,390
to demonstrate that,

720
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:51,830
to demonstrate his agreement with vegetarians

721
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,190
that people shouldn't eat dead meat,

722
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,810
but should only eat living meat.

723
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,430
Or light bulbs.

724
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,210
He also ate a light bulb.

725
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,370
And then to top off the show,

726
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,370
this great, greatest of all subgenius creatures

727
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,730
had his lips sewn shut...

728
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,750
With piano wire.

729
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,670
With piano wire and a needle.

730
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,710
Live on stage,

731
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,730
to demonstrate the futility of subgenius preaching,

732
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,050
which we may also be demonstrating tonight.

733
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,290
We sometimes locate stuff for Christ.

734
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,330
The Church of the Subgenius is, of course,

735
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,510
a completely unique organization among covert

736
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,130
and information-sharing groups,

737
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:45,310
since its public facade of excessive and ludicrous fantasy

738
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,770
has made it possible to be absolutely and publicly truthful

739
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,830
about its aims and goals.

740
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,690
Its continuous cries of wolf

741
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,450
deliberately destroy its credibility,

742
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,330
making secrecy unnecessary.

743
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,090
You don't know all you want to know, man.

744
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,790
You can't know all you want.

745
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:12,750
The facts of Dobbs' origins, nature, structure, and intent

746
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,390
appear to be another set of fantastic fictions.

747
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,810
The Church's hide-in-plain-sight approach

748
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,210
to sensitive and dangerous information

749
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,710
makes it possible for anyone to penetrate the organization

750
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:33,290
and retrieve and disseminate any information.

751
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,790
It's like hermetically sealed, man.

752
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,630
Nobody can get in there. Nobody can get in there, man.

753
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,290
It's like a spider. It's like...

754
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,250
It's like a web of...

755
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,110
Yeah.

756
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,290
You know what I mean. It's just...

757
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,030
It's an interesting web.

758
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,790
You can get into the web.

759
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,850
In fact, you know,

760
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,450
the mouth of the great spider

761
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,110
of the Dobbs Palace

762
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:57,990
is the only way to get all the way to the very center

763
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,530
of the web.

764
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,050
Man, this stuff's all covert, man.

765
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,790
This stuff's all covert. It's all hush-hush, man.

766
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,870
You don't want to get into this stuff, man.

767
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:03,650
You don't want to go in there, man.

768
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,770
Oh, anybody can get in.

769
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,950
Nobody wants to go in there, man.

770
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,950
You want to know about it, but you just want to know enough, man.

771
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,070
You don't want to know all about it, man.

772
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,990
Oh, it looks like a lovely fairytale.

773
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,610
It's a fairytale palace from outside.

774
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,190
Oh, yeah, when you first dial it up,

775
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,670
you're looking at the prettiest, like, Cinderella's palace

776
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,710
there on the screen.

777
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,990
And you say the magic words,

778
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,090
and the great gate opens up,

779
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,530
and the stone rolls aside,

780
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:34,910
and suddenly you're looking right into the mouth of the spider.

781
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,550
The eyes of the spider.

782
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,090
The eyes of the spider have created

783
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,610
cool animation in them,

784
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,130
so that you just want to stare at it.

785
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,530
It's like computer animation.

786
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,490
Dobbs head mandalas.

787
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,130
And the ears of the spider are what you're listening to right now.

788
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:00,430
And they look so pretty, and it all sounds so pretty,

789
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,110
that you just want to just stroll.

790
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,330
That spider's jaw opens up,

791
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,770
and that red carpet-like tongue rolls out.

792
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,430
Oh, you just want to stroll right in.

793
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,150
And you want to just, you know,

794
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,150


795
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,150


796
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,570
you're looking back into the web site of Bob.

797
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,970
You'll find out everything you need to know in there, friends.

798
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,150
It's the link that leads to the center.

799
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:31,350
Yes, the very center of the web itself.

800
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,290
Of course, you don't get to the very center at first.

801
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,630
You gotta pass over the tonsils of the great spider.

802
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,530
Slide down that long, slimy chute.

803
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:55,370
And you find yourself landing on your butt right in the middle of the great vault.

804
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,350
The cathedral, we call it.

805
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:02,790
It's actually the thorax of the spider.

806
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,690
You're kind of in the center of his chest.

807
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,510
And that's where we worship.

808
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,370
We have an altar set up there with a big TV on it.

809
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:20,830
That's where the naked zombies for Bob go dancing around that great altar.

810
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,530
The arachnid dancers.

811
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,010
And you can, when you're standing there in the middle of the great vault,

812
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,670
the cathedral of slack,

813
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:41,450
you can see eight hallways leading off out of that huge chamber.

814
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:43,770
Eight hallways.

815
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,090
You can pick your way.

816
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,470
You can wind your way down those hallways.

817
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,450
There's the hall of sex hurt.

818
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,390
That's the one everybody usually tries first.

819
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,270
It's got the word sex in glowing neon.

820
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,090
Oh, baby.

821
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,290
At the entranceway.

822
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,590
You go in there thinking, oh, boy, I'm going to see some of that subgenius,

823
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,470
pornological, demontertainment.

824
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,330
Oh, yeah, I'm going to see some of that.

825
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,370
I'm going to see them naked stripper preacheresses like I've heard about.

826
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,730
Or maybe there'll be pictures of Reverend Susie the floozy in there.

827
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,090
Oh, yeah.

828
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,210
It's a madness of gold, baby.

829
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,330
Such a pleasure.

830
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,450
But, friends, it's even better than that.

831
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,850
At the end of the hall of sex hurt,

832
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,570
you get to have sex with the great spider.

833
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,610
And she'll lay her eggs in you.

834
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,050
And she'll spew you right back out onto the web.

835
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,750
Only now you're one of her agents.

836
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,310
One of her pipe smokers.

837
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,850
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

838
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,670
You can pick any of the other halls.

839
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,070
After you've got the eggs laid in your bowels,

840
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,590
you could go down and visit the hall of bulldada.

841
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,410
I am full now, man.

842
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,830
I am full bulldada now, man.

843
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,350
I am ready. I am full.

844
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,330
That's the tunnel that leads to the greatest bad movies

845
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,870
and silliest radio preachers in the universe.

846
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:10,990
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

847
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,950
Go down the hall of evils.

848
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,430
Into the house of hate.

849
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,890
Into the cavern of conspiracies.

850
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,830
And when you get out of the hall of evils,

851
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,510
then you get into the hall of goods.

852
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,470
And that's when we sell you some of those goods.

853
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,310
And all it costs is just little tiny chump change.

854
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,990
Bits and pieces of your useless soul.

855
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:41,810
Yes.

856
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,570
I mean, this is a religion.

857
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,170
This isn't just a, you know, this isn't the home shopping network.

858
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,970
Sure, you can buy the stigmata.

859
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,090
You know what you can do with that stigmata?

860
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,810
Do you know what you can do with a big enough shop?

861
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,330
A hole in the palm of your hand?

862
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,910
Well, I'm not allowed to talk about it on radio, friends,

863
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,650
but if you'll step into the hall of answers, you'll find out.

864
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,430
What would I like to know?

865
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,370
Name, name.

866
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,110
Oh, you're looking for the hall of questions.

867
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,370
Oh, I forgot I asked you a question.

868
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:17,950
We don't know what's in the hall of questions yet.

869
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,410
It is a question.

870
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,450
That's what we don't know.

871
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,370
But what we do know is in the hall of science.

872
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,150
That's where, friends, in the hall of science,

873
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,390
there's the dead man's secret drawers.

874
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,430
Prepare the laboratories.

875
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,110
It's a novel experience.

876
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,790
Let's notice the...

877
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,890
Where you can learn your future, yes?

878
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,330
The oracle.

879
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,210
...the future in this man's liposuction.

880
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,870
The fat makes a configuration.

881
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,470
It is an anomaly.

882
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,610
Yes, we're able to read your future

883
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:05,930
in the patterns of the liposucted fat

884
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:11,110
removed from your thighs, your hips, buttocks...

885
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,630
And 250-pound rapists.

886
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,090
...during psych... psychic surgery.

887
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,250
Oh, you need to know this.

888
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,290
Answer the game.

889
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,490
Come on in.

890
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,170
Yeah, this is the only computer video game

891
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,670
that will actually perform psychic...

892
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,130
...psychic surgery on you.

893
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,970
The game itself will push its fists

894
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,670
so deeply into your belly,

895
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,490
your tummy muscles,

896
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,230
that the skin will part without excess bleeding,

897
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,170
and the shaman will be able to remove

898
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,950
the chicken gizzard tumor or...

899
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,610
...foul, disgusting cyst

900
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,570
composed of everything bad you ever ate,

901
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,470
all the preservatives.

902
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,890
And he will extract that foulness,

903
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,310
that evil humour from within you.

904
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,270
And then, why, covered with some chocolate sauce

905
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,630
and, uh...

906
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,710
Yes?

907
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:15,610
...set afire with a little cognac on top,

908
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,310
why, you'll have...

909
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,050
...the finest dessert.

910
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,990
Oh, fleshy lantern, that's what you want to put in there.

911
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:23,910
Fleshy lantern?

912
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,330
So, come on in, folks.

913
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,730
Bob's Diner.

914
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,970
At the sign of the spider.

915
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,790
Queel on in.

916
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:43,010
Come get caught in the web.

917
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,290
Come after...

918
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:45,830
It's bouncy.

919
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,310
It's like a great big net,

920
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,130
like at the surface that the acrobats fall into.

921
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,450
You can just jump into the web and bounce up and down.

922
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:56,270
It's important.

923
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,330
It's a little sticky, sure,

924
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,850
but...and you'll get a little on you.

925
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,310
But it feels good.

926
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:04,410
Yeah.

927
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:07,930
And those cuddly, furry spiders

928
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,610
that crawl in and out of your mouth

929
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,850
while you lay there all hypnotized.

930
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:16,410
Oh, they tickle, don't they?

931
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,850
They are so tickly.

932
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,330
Those little tarantulas.

933
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,550
They're just agents of the big tarantula.

934
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:23,570
Antimony.

935
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,270
And when they've laid their eggs inside your glands...

936
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,170
Oh, they're so sweet.

937
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,650
...you'll be able to go out and lay eggs yourself.

938
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,350
Now, what I want to know is,

939
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,450
can you perform mystic surgery with a spider egg on your belly?

940
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,730
You'll go out and lure your friends into the web

941
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,590
where you can impress them by performing psychic surgery on them,

942
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,310
inserting, yet again, more eggs.

943
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,630
And every time you bring in a new customer,

944
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:54,530
you move a little bit higher up on the pyramid.

945
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:55,990
That's right.

946
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,790
If you can...once you've signed up,

947
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,310
if you bring in five more friends...

948
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,450
Don't be afraid to climb the ladder.

949
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,270
...you'll climb the ladder,

950
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,530
the ladder of the web,

951
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,910
until you're sitting right under the abdomen

952
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,390
of the great spider herself,

953
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:18,350
catching those warm eggs as they poot out down your throat.

954
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:18,730
Oh.

955
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,190
Mmm.

956
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:25,670
Better than an all-you-can-eat breakfast at Shoney's.

957
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,470
I want to change it.

958
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:28,650
I want to change it. I want to go...

959
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,830
Scrambled spider eggs.

960
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:37,610
They're...

961
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,050
And they're made of information, friends.

962
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:46,430
It's not like we're adding poisons or evil preservatives or anything.

963
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,710
No, no, we're just filling you up with knowledge.

964
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:49,550
That's all.

965
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,010
Did you ever see that movie Videodrome?

966
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,070
It's like that, but it's not like that.

967
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,870
Pearls of wisdom.

968
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,530
Have you seen the pearl?

969
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,830
Have you had the dream of the pearl?

970
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,710
Does this viscous liquid contain...

971
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,050
Are you capable of storing more information than the average?

972
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,590
It's okay.

973
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,590
You...

974
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,890
Yes, yes, you just sort of slurp it up.

975
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:16,770
You just place yourself right under the abdomen of the great mother spider

976
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,090
and let her...

977
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:21,970
start excretin' that web fluid right in.

978
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:22,330
You'll...

979
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,810
You'll have spidey powers yourself, Dave.

980
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,170
Psychic-a-bin war boys.

981
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,470
Rolling around and around.

982
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,890
Oh, boy.

983
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,130
Time.

984
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,210
Mother spider-built time.

985
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,710
But it's not like occult or anything.

986
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,870
This isn't like one of those Egyptian occultists,

987
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,490
uh,

988
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,550
you know,

989
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,090
like,

990
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,670
this isn't one of those satanic deals.

991
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,270
Uh,

992
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,150
when we worship the great spider at the center of the web,

993
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,410
it's not like we're,

994
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:58,350
uh,

995
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:58,790
you know,

996
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:59,570
just, uh,

997
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:04,510
trying to condone evil or human sacrifice or anything like that.

998
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,390
Oh, but she's a spinning woman.

999
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,010
No, no, no.

1000
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,030
Or, or, uh...

1001
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,150
She's his grandma.

1002
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,550
No, no.

1003
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:11,990
We just want you to have fun.

1004
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,850
We want you to join with us in,

1005
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,110
in the brotherhood,

1006
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:16,130
in the sisterhood

1007
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,070
under the web of the great spider.

1008
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,090
Who protects us.

1009
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,570
Yes, she protects us.

1010
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,650
She nurses us.

1011
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,810
We may nurse at the teat,

1012
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:27,190
at the information teat of the great spider,

1013
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,430
of the sticky, sticky web.

1014
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:34,950
All the victim shares a blood,

1015
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,550
and the blood expands.

1016
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:44,530
Look at Chaz fiendishly playing that gigantic organ of his.

1017
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,690
With that wax mask on his face.

1018
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,810
Look, Princess Wee is sneaking up behind him.

1019
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,930
She's, she's tiptoeing up behind Chaz.

1020
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:58,190
She's, she's reaching out as if to lift the mask from his face.

1021
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,850
She's going to do it.

1022
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,030
She's grabbed the mask.

1023
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,150
He turned around.

1024
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,610
His hideous, hideous face.

1025
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,730
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry

1026
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:17,770
Hour of Slack.

1027
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:20,430
For free information on Bob Dobbs

1028
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,890
and the Church of the Subgenius,

1029
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:24,450
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to,

1030
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:25,550
got your pencil ready?

1031
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,130
Bob, Post Office Box 140306,

1032
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:32,050
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1033
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,490
That's Bob.

1034
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,470
Shut up little man.

1035
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,890
Nobody asked you to say anything.

1036
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,430
Trying to get machines in to do everything that we're doing.

1037
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,370
He's very fond of machines.

1038
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,550
He wants machines to be doing everything.

1039
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:49,250
And this will give everybody else a lot of leisure, you see.

1040
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,850
And if everybody has a lot of leisure,

1041
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,770
they'll be forced to read his ghastly old book.

1042
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:58,550
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306,

1043
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,950
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1044
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,130
He'd like to see machines all over the place, you see,

1045
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,510
spying on what we're doing.

1046
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,350
But very soon, you see,

1047
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,750
all the machines will be wandering around

1048
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,190
on spindly legs, great metal spindly legs.

1049
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:20,830
And we'll all be living in little metal boxes.

1050
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,170
And the machines will pass by,

1051
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,850
an awful antennae will come in through the window.

1052
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,350
And they'll check up.

1053
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:30,470
They'll all start breeding amongst themselves, the machines,

1054
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,810
and going out to the cinemas with each other

1055
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:34,650
and sitting and whispering in the dark.

1056
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:38,310
And holding their metallic tentacles together

1057
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,530
and reproducing.

1058
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:42,270
It's a horrible idea.

1059
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,570
I can't bear the ideas of machines.

1060
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,550
I can't bear the ideas of machines doing everything.

1061
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,590
Hey, Chaz, remember those interesting recordings

1062
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:50,650
that we brought in?

1063
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,270
There's the Charlie Manson karaoke.

1064
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:57,510
Which crept out on two legs.

1065
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:05,230
And the ultimate heavy metal song,

1066
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:08,570
the song that pretty much tells the truth about heavy metal.

1067
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:11,810
The song that every kid should be forced to listen to

1068
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:12,870
on glue.

1069
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,590
That's number...

1070
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,470
Did you flip your tape?

1071
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:17,350
Yes.

1072
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,170
Mine is gonna be coming out soon.

1073
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:24,850
By the way, you are listening to WCSB Cleveland,

1074
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,310
the radio voice of Cleveland State University.

1075
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,470
This is ESO Radio.

1076
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,210
What was the cut on that?

1077
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,930
Number 666.

1078
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,470
Anything you want to say about this?

1079
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,270
Well, this band, Kings of Feedback,

1080
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,350
out of Boston, Massachusetts,

1081
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:48,170
I think these guys have maybe taken heavy metal

1082
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,110
to its final logical extreme.

1083
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:55,010
I think that any child, teenager, young person

1084
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,850
who's been considering a career in satanic devil worship,

1085
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,190
backmasked heavy metal music,

1086
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:04,810
should take a good, close, hard listen

1087
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,390
to this sorry, sad situation.

1088
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,390
Oh, my God.

1089
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,170
It's pretty serious.

1090
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:12,350
Kids...

1091
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,050
Listen to it backwards.

1092
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,650
Well, they're gonna listen to it backwards

1093
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,590
at the same time.

1094
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,970
Oh, I got it all messed up now.

1095
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:21,710
Did you erase that CD?

1096
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,650
Man, it was the only one I had.

1097
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,110
He pushed record instead of play.

1098
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:28,150
I have something called C-index on here.

1099
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,310
Oh, wrong one.

1100
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,170
Here you go, kiddies.

1101
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,850
Chew on this for a while.

1102
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:32,770
Yeah, kids.

1103
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,390
Rock music is leading our young people

1104
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,050
to drug addiction and promiscuity.

1105
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,030
Rock music is leading our young people

1106
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,030


1107
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:44,650
to the power of the cosmos

1108
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:48,050
and all the powers in command.

1109
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,970
And virtue in the form

1110
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,150
and all else that has that power.

1111
00:53:59,370 --> 00:53:59,630
Ah!

1112
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,730
Oh, .

1113
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:05,930
Ah!

1114
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:07,990
Oh, my God!

1115
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:08,950
Ah!

1116
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,830
You seem a little nervous.

1117
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:14,990
My friend.

1118
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,250
When the strength of my soul

1119
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,230
You're telling me from beyond

1120
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,870
You'd better be ready

1121
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,430
To speak your piece

1122
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:37,830
You call me from beyond

1123
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,550
You disturb my rest of sleep

1124
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,870
With your childish games

1125
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,550
You don't know what you're playing with

1126
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,550
This is not a game

1127
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,010
But it's a voice in you

1128
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,470
This is your life

1129
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,350
You're not alone

1130
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:10,610
You're not alone

1131
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,350
You're not alone

1132
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,590
You're not just another stupid heavy metal band

1133
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,390
Listen to your music backwards in reverse.

1134
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,410
If the troops they were foot

1135
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,770
You know you can't get in

1136
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,470
Heavy metal, heavy metal, heavy metal

1137
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,190
I'm a singer, you know

1138
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,230
Where are these metal cuts?

1139
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,270
The bottom is dry and sweet

1140
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,850
This is heavy, get it?

1141
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:37,870
Oh!

1142
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:45,130
You wait for me

1143
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,910
I used to be a nice guy just like you

1144
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,510
And then I found

1145
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,330
The truth is in the taking

1146
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:04,150
You know I'm slow

1147
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,130
And I will need a line

1148
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,670
But you have a spit in your face

1149
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:15,790
I'll tell you how I got here

1150
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,330
You're ready for me

1151
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:24,330


1152
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:28,910
You ready for me

1153
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:28,910


1154
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:28,910


1155
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:32,410
Can it be ready to face the consequences?

1156
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,390
It's never too late to redeem yourself

1157
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,390
One last chance

1158
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,810
That's all you have

1159
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,790
It's up to you

1160
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:50,870
You ran from me

1161
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:57,070
No escaping my eyes

1162
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,550
You will see them in every dream

1163
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,350
You ran from me

1164
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:12,390
You never escape the eyes

1165
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:26,230
The sun will never shine with these eyes

1166
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,150
Would you like a drink?

1167
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,890
You ran from me

1168
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:39,530
You'd better be ready to face the truth my friend

1169
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,470
I'm here for you

1170
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:58,430
Slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o

1171
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,630
Edward? Edward? Edward?

1172
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,590
The number you have reached

1173
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:09,710
1-800-OUTBEND

1174
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,430
Has been changed

1175
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:12,970
The new number is

1176
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:16,810
617-LICK-OBE

1177
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:19,090
Please make a note of it

1178
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,030
At the tone, record your message

1179
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:27,810
J.R. Bob Dobbs told me to call and here's my really weird message

1180
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:30,350
Bob Dobbs

1181
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:36,450
Still distorted

1182
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:42,550
No one could have anticipated this thoroughly modern telephone could wreak such havoc

1183
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:43,930
Hello?

1184
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:45,270
Edward?

1185
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,350
800-NOB-O-O-B-E

1186
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,070
I love you every time I call, I love it

1187
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:56,330
You guys are sick but I think I love you very very much

1188
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:00,530
Call me to get me free information by mail, now

1189
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,990
Oh my God, all that noise is gonna drive me into orgasm

1190
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:09,570
617-LICK-OBE

1191
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:15,050
If people would just listen to our music they'd see we have a humanistic message for the kids

1192
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,810
You know, social and environmental concerns

1193
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,070
You're gonna slay us all!

1194
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:28,290
Are you a voyeur? Do you like to watch?

1195
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,310
What's your name?

1196
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,270
Bob

1197
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,230
Hi Bob

1198
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,230


1199
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:35,050
What are you gonna do with it Bob?

1200
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,790
Tell me, tell me how you like it if I came in your room right now

1201
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,470
Uh huh

1202
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:40,350
What would you do to me?

1203
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,570
Baby if you came in my room right now I'd want you to put your feet

1204
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:46,290
Oh boy

1205
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:47,570
Oh yeah Bob

1206
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,390
Oh yeah

1207
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:50,090
Uh huh, do you think you can find

1208
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:50,510
Oh yeah

1209
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:53,990
Uh huh, do you think you can find my sub G spot Bob?

1210
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:54,590
I think so

1211
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,970
Come up baby, find it for me

1212
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:57,310
Yeah

1213
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:59,230
Oh Bob, oh yeah

1214
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:00,650
Yeah

1215
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:04,490
Oh Bob, oh yeah

1216
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:09,670
4, 3, 2, 1, fire!

1217
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:20,190
This is all Bob ya know

1218
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:26,270
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

1219
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:28,290
Augh
