1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
It's wise to smoke.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,360
If you want a long cigarette, smoke the long cigarette.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,380
It's wise to smoke.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,460
So, enjoy long cigarettes.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,220
You're not going to sedate me anymore.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,940
Who are you?

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,280
The self-genius, power of smoke.

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,460
I seem to be in a timeless space void, neither light nor dark.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,180
I have awareness, but not mind, but no memory.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,100
That should hold her till you get her home.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,620
Gina got a...

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,360
Bob.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,600
This comes from...

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,360
From PR News in Washington.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,900
I'm linked to Tainted Egg.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,080
Because of bug parts.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,900
President Obama says...

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,060
But the president says...

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,520
The president told a U.N. conference today that...

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,740
Obama administration officials plot attacks.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,600
Officials say the number and pace of attacks is greater than at any time.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,240
Administration officials have stepped up efforts to recruit Americans to act inside the country.

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,360
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has become more diversified.

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,980
Diversifying.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,900
Diversifying.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,860
Diversifying.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,080


28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,700
The chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had been convicted of PR News...

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,140
On Wall Street, 2114.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,620
In Boulder County, Colorado, authorities have decided that this is PR News from Washington.

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,240
Here is the actual report.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,160
The story you are about to hear is changed to protect...

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,840
Dragness.

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,380
Dragness.

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,420
Dragness.

36
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:55,780


37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:55,920
Dragness.

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,460
Drag shall be

39
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,580
Will you tell me why?

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,220
Well, it's our job to keep filthy junk like these books falling into youngsters' hands.

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,560
Yeah?

42
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,260
Now, on the other side of the fence, the youngster has to be taught dirt and filth and garbage.

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,620
And the youngsters have to be taught that in the home, in the school, in the church.

44
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,200
Bible, things like that.

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,380
The man was seldom.

46
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,000
How do you reach them?

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,460
Through the youngsters.

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,860
They seem to know the way.

49
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,660
Here.

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,500
Rotten filth, boy.

51
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,840
Here you go.

52
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,060
Possessing lewd and lascivious literature in the county jail.

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
What do you think?

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,820
No sense of humor.

55
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,440
Yes.

56
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,640
Oh, well, if I figured it out in those other town Kay's

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,380
possible she's the smell of factory poison,

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:33,380


59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,660
Listen, gear and travelling must be Mizunin's真的 he'll be a real man.

60
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:34,660


61
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:34,660


62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:34,660


63
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:34,660


64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,960
Is a multinational, a Socialist?

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:35,960


66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:35,960


67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Oh, boy.

68
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,420
.

69
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,860
The Empire's New Leaf

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,480
flipped another stream of tobacco dust

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,020
into the enamel-dragged ash heap

72
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,540
as the lenses panned to reveal

73
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,980
13 bloated television evangelists

74
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,040
cursed atop satellite thrones

75
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,060
of sacred Chlor-A-Kimbo.

76
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,540
Val Good lamented the recent lapse

77
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,040
in quarterly revenues

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,460
attributable to a spate of land investment

79
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,320
instructional tools and herbal-aid products

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,640
available through toll-free phone numbers.

81
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,760
Market infringement had been a problem

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,300
since the good pastor had slammed

83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,220
his shiny aluminum cylinder

84
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,840
through a 32-ounce package

85
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,020
of saltines.

86
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,520
Diversify, cried the leftists

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,280
as cherubs and accountants

88
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,840
showered tens and twenties

89
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,440
over their swollen, oily carcasses.

90
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,880
Their chests would expound,

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
seemingly to spill out

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,120
and retract at the last moment

93
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,380
as angels rejoiced and sang

94
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:01,920
Hallelujah.

95
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,720
Thus inspired, the traditionalists

96
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,260
vowed not to stray unto

97
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,580
dietary supplements and kitchen utensils,

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,980
but to continue forcing Jesus Christ

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
up the collective,

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,940
or to lize Victor with a fiery hot poker.

101
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,180
Three dozen expensive prostitutes

102
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,860
with Jesus-loved-you G-strings

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,240
danced and sang praise

104
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,400
to the Reagan administration

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,640
while the ministers coalesced

106
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
into a viscid ball of oily influence

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,940
emitting a noggish, piss-yellow light.

108
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,860
Tampon Louis resurrected from this pious miasma

109
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,900
and rode the light to his righteous pedestal,

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,860
watching biblical prophecies

111
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,820
and a fifth of the world's public opinion.

112
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,480
Full of God's most precious turds.

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,840
Hallelujah and praise the Lord

114
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,080
Tampon Louis got the going again

115
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,640
Hallelujah and bless my soul

116
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,860
Tampon Louis got the going again

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Music

118
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,780
Music

119
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,340
Jim Scott

120
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,600
Tampon Louis Are You Esta��요

121
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:32,240
Tampon Louis Are You Estaiano

122
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,240


123
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,920
This is Phil Proctor and David Osman of the Firesign Theater.

124
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,900
And we're enjoying listening to the hour of slack.

125
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,800
I'm slacking off myself.

126
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,820
I think the people are leaving them.

127
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,080
X-Day's over.

128
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
And then the complications of X-Day.

129
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,220
So true.

130
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,120
So true.

131
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,560
That's it.

132
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,460
It's just sick.

133
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,400
It's just so sick.

134
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,960
In a good way or a bad way?

135
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,480
Well, in a good way.

136
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,060
So you think that's funny, huh?

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,220
That's fine.

138
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,700
Okay, laugh, laugh.

139
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360
It's easy for you to do.

140
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,060
Okay.

141
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,020
I'm just going to go back and post some more tweets.

142
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,920
What?

143
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,820
What?

144
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,200
What?

145
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,300
Talk.

146
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,520
Say something.

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,800
Now.

148
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,120
Well, I don't know.

149
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,900
It can be confusing at times.

150
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,340
You know, the water is a bit, a tad too warm.

151
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,480
One could say it's even too hot for one's taste, for one's body.

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,720
You know, we're all individuals and our bodies feel the warmth of the water.

153
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,280
You know, warmth is nothing but micro-movements of particles in the water.

154
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,660
You know, H2O.

155
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
Christopher Walken calling.

156
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,160
I think so.

157
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,820
It's such an honor.

158
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,740
This sounds like, are you Christopher Walken?

159
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,620
Christopher Walken, yeah.

160
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,940
Oh, yeah.

161
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,160
You sound like him.

162
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,360
I think I am.

163
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,160
Yeah, you sound like him too, man.

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,300
Yeah, because what happened is, Mr. Walken, it's great to talk to you after hearing nothing but Lenny Bruce for three hours.

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah.

166
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm a huge fan of KPFA.

167
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:31,740
Every time I, well, I don't know if this is suitable for airtime.

168
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,260
Sure.

169
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,820
Well, don't say any of those seven deadly words of Christ and you're okay.

170
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
What are those?

171
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,260
Can you do a little recap or something?

172
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,460
Maybe.

173
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,800
Well, it's an honor to have you call, Father Guido Sarducci.

174
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,980
Well, a little recap could be in place if you would like to refresh the.

175
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,040
Yeah, yeah, I'll refresh the computer here.

176
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
Okay, I'm going to refresh my, I'm going to refresh my page.

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
Whatever you do out there, if you're listening to the show, refresh the computer.

178
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,160
Okay.

179
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,200


180
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


181
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


182
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


183
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


184
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


185
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


186
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


187
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


188
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


189
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,240


190
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,160
What are you doing up at this hour is the real question.

191
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,560
I always have, or listeners have, 848-425-510-ERICA.

192
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,900
Well, it's time to slack off.

193
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,580
Oh, yeah, I agree about that.

194
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,520
Okay, here we go.

195
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,860
Slack off like that.

196
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,980
Yep, we're slacking off.

197
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,860
What other business should take place right now at this hour, man?

198
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,660
Exactly, I agree.

199
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,520
I have two healthy hands, so what else do I need except maybe one cold brewski?

200
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,160
Yeah, that's all you need.

201
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,640
That's all.

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:30,860
That's all.

203
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,140
As long as it's, you know, like a gallon-sized brewski.

204
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,340
Yeah, and something to do with your hands, you know.

205
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,040
Yeah.

206
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,320
Maybe a pen you could tap on the table.

207
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,440
The idle hands are the devil's playground.

208
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,160
What?

209
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,900
If you're going to medicine, you could pop some pills.

210
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,280
Self-medicating, now you're talking.

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,360
An idle mind is the devil's workshop.

212
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,960
I don't do that kind of stuff, but, you know, many people are into that, you know.

213
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,640
Yeah.

214
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,860
As many people are into, have you heard of this new phenomenon called freaking out?

215
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah, it's like flipping out, only even more extreme.

216
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,480
You know, in UK, many young, you know, the youth, they're really doing this.

217
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,960
They got this new brand, you know, they're doing this freaking out thing.

218
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,000
They freak out?

219
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,320
Really?

220
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,020
Yeah, yeah, green hair.

221
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,960
He had a green hair at the disco check or a warehouse party, like we call it.

222
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,320
You know what?

223
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,580
I heard that they can get the freak out for a while, and then they turn around and look,

224
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,800
and they flip out.

225
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,100
Well, they should freak in.

226
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,880
They freak out and in.

227
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,280
While flipping.

228
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,900
Yeah, and then they drop.

229
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,560
My grandmother.

230
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,940
For their job.

231
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
Your grandmother had been known to do that also.

232
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,080
We had to put her in an institution.

233
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh.

234
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,920
Well, I think that's.

235
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,240
The institution was burning in.

236
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,900
It's inevitable.

237
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,660
You know, it's inevitable.

238
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,580
What's the word?

239
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,080
I don't know.

240
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,940
I'm getting confused here, man.

241
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,820
Yeah, that's the show.

242
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:56,960
I am too.

243
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,100
That's the radio show.

244
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,040
That's the radio show does that to you.

245
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,420
This show too, game TV.

246
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


247
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


248
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


249
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


250
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


251
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


252
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


253
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


254
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


255
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,420


256
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,940
Someone must be like, oh, laughs, but not the video of this.

257
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:25,940


258
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,020
The doctor.

259
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,020


260
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,020


261
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,240
I would do anything.

262
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,480
That was slightly.

263
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,000
Hello.

264
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,900
I got your hey

265
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:59,660
Something new, something different, something swell to eat

266
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,040
Here it is, and you'll all want to try it

267
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,880
You can produce a rabbit from a hat that's absolutely swell-eating

268
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,220
Creamy and mellow and delicate, gold and fine, wholesome, quick and easy, simple and smooth

269
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,480
And real delicate and creamy, real homemade rabbit pie

270
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,920
And it's easy to make, and here's what you do

271
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:29,640
First, chill and then turn into a really swell, cold, baked, thick, rich, molded, beautiful, delicious, genuine, delicious, new, fluffy, firm, fragrant, brand new, glamorous, gay, sprightly, rich, tantalizing, bright, patsy

272
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:38,740
And we've just received one from Mrs. Garden City, Iowa, and Mrs. Garden City writes

273
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,240
After a long, real and genuine good, fruity good, grand, delicious, extra rich fruit without any fruit

274
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,220
It still had that grand, satisfying, true, clumpy rabbit flavor

275
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,240
Take a plane, go to London, go to Spain

276
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,740
Take a train from Amsterdam to Monaco

277
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,780
Take a loved one if you think they enjoy things that stink

278
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,920
Cause everything is different over there

279
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,120
Take a plane, go to London, go to Spain

280
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,640
When you're in the middle of the world

281
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:29,640


282
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,520
When you're in Belgium, you can eat

283
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,920
A lot of mayonnaise with your frites

284
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,960
And no one will say, hey, that's too much mayonnaise

285
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,160
Enjoy a German sausage hall

286
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,540
Eat an Italian meatball

287
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,300
But I hope you don't want a Twinkie

288
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,220
Because they don't have posters Twinkies over there

289
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,200
Over there, you'll never feel at ease

290
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Cause there's not much soap and there's too much cheese

291
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,640
And everyone wears clogs and rides on trains

292
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,400
Over there, they'll make you regret that you ever

293
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,580
Saved their asses in World War II

294
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,560
Don't make me go over there

295
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,620
Over there, they'll make you regret that you ever

296
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,420
avaient

297
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,840
Because only a man goes around the world

298
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:55,920
Dude, this must be like Ok Himself

299
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,020
Mr gold dispenser

300
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,000
I would never have broken aaro

301
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,020
I'd never have broken your forties

302
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,600
But it's a good thing I don't give a shit about boring people

303
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,580
Ladies dance

304
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,020
You can find it

305
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,700
If you ask around

306
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,480
And there's a hole

307
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,140
There in the wall

308
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,780
Where the man

309
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,380
Can see it all

310
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,760
Men don't care

311
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,700
Because they chew

312
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,800
Their underwear

313
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,960
The underwear they chew

314
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,020
Costs a dollar ninety-two

315
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,500
Men go around

316
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
With their ding-dongs

317
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,720
Hanging down

318
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
Over there

319
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,280
You never feel at ease

320
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,120
Cause there's not much soap

321
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,860
And there's too much cheese

322
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,660
And everyone wears clogs

323
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,820
And rides on trains

324
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,480
Over there

325
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,940
You'll make you regret

326
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,280
That you ever

327
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,140
Saved their asses

328
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,620
In World War II

329
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,640
Don't make me go

330
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,360
Over there

331
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,600
No, don't make me go

332
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,260
Over there

333
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,420
Don't make me go

334
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
Over there

335
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,720
Ah, yes

336
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,460
Dear,

337
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,940
Dear friends

338
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,220
That was

339
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,380
The beautiful

340
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,040
Jonathan Colton

341
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,360

345
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,020
You can find

346
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,680
The Coltanian stuff

347
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,540
There

348
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,000
And this is The Large

349
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,620
In the background

350
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,220
Before that we heard

351
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,460
Lemur

352
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,440
And the Puzzling Evidence show

353
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,880
With The Large calling in

354
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,380
Puzzling Evidence show

355
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,060
From KPFA

356
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,820
Wow

357
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,640
And before that

358
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,940
The Rudy Schwartz Project

359
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,000
Did that wonderful song

360
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Tampon Louie

361
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,360
And Lemur did the openings

362
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,260
And speaking of openings

363
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,500
We may have an opening here

364
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,100
Hello

365
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,700
It's your third nostril

366
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,400
It's opening

367
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,080
It's opening

368
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,600
It's opening

369
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,480
It's the opening of the day

370
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,320
Don't you

371
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,500
Miss me

372
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:25,920
Yay

373
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,660
Give us a whiff

374
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,260
It's such a brilliant feeling

375
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave has called in

376
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,720
Princess We is here in the station

377
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,740
I think I've done

378
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,960
The credits

379
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,020
And so

380
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,140
So I guess everything's okay

381
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,820
Now don't wet your britches there

382
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,760
Things will be alright

383
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,440
Just remember there's a large group of people

384
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,600
Right outside your window

385
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,840
Waiting to sign autographs

386
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,580
Waiting for you to just shake their hand

387
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,620
Or perhaps even say

388
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,980
Gotta run, you know

389
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,400
Yep

390
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,700
So

391
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,120
We're famous now

392
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:57,800
Yep

393
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,860
Big time

394
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,640
Big, big, big time, baby

395
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,900
Big, big, big, big

396
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,500
Sorry

397
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,060
It's reassuring that they're not out there menacing

398
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,900
Well, they have been known to be that, too

399
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,340
Yeah, yeah

400
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,660
You will get a fair amount of that

401
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,740
But I've protected you from that, Princess We

402
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,020
Yes, you have

403
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,000
I've tried to

404
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,240
Thank goodness

405
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,900
I did let Mayher lead such an insular life

406
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,140
It's amazing that she could get anything done at all

407
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,720
Like the cooking, the sewing, the handling of the pets

408
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,100
The creation of a vast garden in the backyard there

409
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,560
The, uh

410
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,640
I guess the

411
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,260
The two new cows you guys just got

412
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,560
I don't know what you're gonna do with them

413
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
It's hard to fit all that into a golden cage

414
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,800
But that's where we keep her

415
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,160
Well, this life is like a cage

416
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,300
This skeletal body is a cage itself

417
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,640
It holds a

418
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:44,900
Holds a

419
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,620
Holds a key to

420
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,120
Never mind

421
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,100
But this physical world is a cage

422
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,640
A cage of three dimensions

423
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,660
Why can we not

424
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,540
Why is Bob not in the cage?

425
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:57,640
Why is Bob not in the cage?

426
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:57,640


427
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:57,640


428
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:57,640


429
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:57,640


430
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
Why can Bob not come with a key?

431
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,980
Why is Bob not in the cage?

432
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,480
Why is Bob not in the cage?

433
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,420
Why is Bob not in the cage?

434
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,860
Mary was not in it

435
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,840
A PG remote setting

436
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,860
A 3-bill cop

437
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,140
Just like this

438
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:18,220
This animal gives a sly look

439
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,520
Don't you want to open it?

440
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:18,520


441
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:18,800
Uh-uh

442
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:18,800


443
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,980
Back when we were Ju CA

444
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,780
Don't say I have a Erin

445
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,120
The seed of yourيرة

446
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,120


447
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,020
What?

448
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,380
Disgusting

449
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,480
The key

450
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


451
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


452
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


453
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


454
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


455
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,480


456
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,640
And the map

457
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:27,640


458
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,060
name Bob for practically

459
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,020
any exemplary, I wonder

460
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,840
if everybody's so plugged in that they

461
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,780
their neurons

462
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,520
have shorted pretty much.

463
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,000
So they just get the information

464
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,760
from the most superficial

465
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,420
part of their brain.

466
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,940
No, Dave, it's

467
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,900
simply that Bob is the most

468
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,960
common first name in the English

469
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,620
speaking world. But

470
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,180
I think you're referring to

471
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,320
how we got famous on TV

472
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,340
last Friday night when

473
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,040
that devil

474
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,260
demon rat woman

475
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,260
Rachel

476
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,940
Maddow

477
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,180
praised Bob. How come

478
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,060
the right wing guys hate her so much?

479
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,040
I'm not really that familiar with

480
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,140
television as a medium, you know.

481
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,200
I know. I actually

482
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,160
the first time I saw the Rachel

483
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,980
Maddow show was

484
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,240
on the web Friday night after somebody

485
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,100
called me up and said, hey, Rachel

486
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,080
Maddow talked about Church of the Subgenius

487
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,800
at great length the other night.

488
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,520
Just now.

489
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,660
And we have an audio tape of that

490
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,500
which I could play.

491
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,680
Our dearest friends worship her.

492
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,720
Oh, yeah, yeah. We have lots of

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,180
friends who worship her, but

494
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,560
they're like

495
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,020
center of the road people.

496
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,040
Left

497
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,300
leaning centers.

498
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,640
Yes. Well, they claim that anybody who's

499
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,420
on, can I say the name of a network

500
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,140
without plugging or something like that?

501
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,520
But anyone who's on her network, they're

502
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,460
also defile. They defile all

503
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,400
the MSNBC.

504
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,420
Yeah, you can say that. That's okay.

505
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,560
And they defile also

506
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
CNN, which

507
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
they believe to be Marxist. Right.

508
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,440
Yeah. And that we're all going to be going

509
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,380
to the gulag work camps and somehow

510
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,220
our freedoms are going to be taken away.

511
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,320
Any second now. Any second.

512
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,180
2012, man, the world ends.

513
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,420
July 5th.

514
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
7 a.m. 2012.

515
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,880
You're hoping for that even more than normally.

516
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,320
Well, that's the funny thing.

517
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,360
They've been hoping for that for a long,

518
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,540
long time. And they've been promising that the world

519
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,480
ends for a long, long time. But we

520
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,600
know exactly when

521
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,860
the world ends next year.

522
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,580
It's 1998.

523
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,340
July 5th.

524
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,560
It's 7 o'clock in the morning.

525
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,920
Yeah. Rachel

526
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,820
Maddow, a lot of the subgeniuses

527
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,560
got to talking about how they had a crush

528
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,180
on her.

529
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,420
Partly because she's gay.

530
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,200
That makes it safe, you know.

531
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,300
Oh, is she really? Yeah.

532
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,180
An out lesbian girl.

533
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,300
That's probably another reason why.

534
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,120
Exactly. It makes her extra sexy to the

535
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,400
subgenius boys.

536
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,000
Because they know

537
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,420
they can't do anything at all about it.

538
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,960
Except, you know.

539
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,740
Perfect, perfect, yeah.

540
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,940
The perfect woman.

541
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,400
For the perfect subgenius, frustrated in his own

542
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,120
mind over things he doesn't have

543
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,920
because he couldn't have them, but he never did.

544
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,580
Never mind. It doesn't make sense.

545
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,000
Well, let's play this little edited

546
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,940
excerpt.

547
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,600
This is quite edited because she was actually

548
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,620
doing a report about a crate

549
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,800
the guy the Republicans

550
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,500
are running for New York governor

551
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,960
who's

552
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,400
kind of off.

553
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,760
But that probably won't stand in his

554
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,920
way in today's

555
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,640
climate. But here is

556
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,680
an excerpt from that show.

557
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,420
I won't comment. I'll just listen.

558
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,080
I hope.

559
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,160
I hope.

560
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,620
It sounds like a Japanese commercial.

561
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,520
Okay, last slide, please.

562
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,940
Here we go.

563
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,640
This is a category of nearly ubiquitous iconic

564
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,000
1990s era American urban street art.

565
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,440
Art that was so iconic and so ubiquitous

566
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,540
it doesn't even really count as urban

567
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,020
anymore because it turned up everywhere.

568
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,040
You also have to include Bob Dobbs.

569
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,940
Bob Dobbs, the icon

570
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,800
of the Church of Subgenius,

571
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,540
which itself is a subject for another day.

572
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,980
But admit it, you have seen this guy's face

573
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,800
stickered or stenciled somewhere,

574
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,800
haven't you? Or on a t-shirt or something?

575
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,380
Okay, we can

576
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,900
bring the lights back up now.

577
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,760
Bob Dobbs,

578
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
and the Church of the Subgenius.

579
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,000
Certainly in the top tier of nearly ubiquitous

580
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
iconic 1990s era American

581
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,100
urban street art.

582
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,940
Alright? Now, back to Carl Paladino.

583
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,740
I'm telling you, I think

584
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,820
I have finally figured this out.

585
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,500
Carl Paladino is the Republican nominee

586
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,840
for Governor of New York, who I think

587
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,260
maybe isn't running a campaign.

588
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,820
Who I think is maybe doing an art project.

589
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,980
My proof

590
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,040
is here. There is a tagline

591
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,840
that goes along with Bob Dobbs

592
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,560
with the iconic 90s street art.

593
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,960
A stenciled guy with the pipe smiling at you.

594
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,840
What is the tagline that gets into your

595
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,940
subconsciousness for Bob Dobbs

596
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,080
of the Church of the Subgenius?

597
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,700
It's, I'm mad too,

598
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,740
Bob. And what's on

599
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,400
Carl Paladino's lawn sign?

600
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,820
I'm mad

601
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,920
too, Carl.

602
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,500
I'm telling you, this

603
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,800
is an art project.

604
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,620
Carl Paladino is not yet a stencil

605
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,720
on a skate park, but he will be.

606
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,700
And when he is, it will be so...

607
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,560
He will go for years and years

608
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,540
and years. He will be.

609
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,420
Years. Years.

610
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,340
Quite a plug.

611
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,080
And years.

612
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
To be mentioned as iconic street art

613
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,880
of the 90s on a national show.

614
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,880
Well, Dave, you know, that actually

615
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,240
used to happen all the time

616
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,760
in the 80s, because she's wrong.

617
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,080
It was actually iconic

618
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,640
1980s street art, but that was when

619
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,400
she was a little

620
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,840
mewling, puking baby child.

621
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,660
That's when she used to hang

622
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
out in front of PS1 where the huge

623
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,040
balloon head is of Dobbs.

624
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,480
Well, yeah, it's funny. I mean,

625
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,360
in the 80s,

626
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,780
my gosh,

627
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,060
we were covered by all the

628
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,000
CNN,

629
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,420
CBS,

630
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,660
New York Times, New York Post,

631
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,480
People Magazine.

632
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,740
I was even on the...

633
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,520
Who was that talk show

634
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,720
host, the loud

635
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,480
mouth, the guy that said, zip it, zip it.

636
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
That early

637
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,440
obnoxious talk.

638
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,220
Not Jon Stewart.

639
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,820
No, no, no. Long before that.

640
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,880
The guy with the large hair.

641
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,060
We were on Jon Stewart, too.

642
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,480
I know.

643
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,040
He had similar hair.

644
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,720
He died of alcoholism, didn't he?

645
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,320
Yeah, well, I would think so.

646
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,860
He faked

647
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,460
getting beat up by minority

648
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,260
members and then got caught

649
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,380
faking it.

650
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,500
And then he had to give all their members back.

651
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,380
My favorite kind of guy.

652
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,700
That guy, yeah.

653
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,080
Yeah, that guy.

654
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,660
Anyway, Rachel Maddow needs to

655
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,580
learn that Bob is more than just

656
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,600
a pretty face.

657
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,600
In fact, I invited her to the

658
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,620
New York City Devival, which

659
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,820
happens next weekend on October 9th.

660
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
I personally

661
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,560
invited her to come see that

662
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,500
since she said it was, you know,

663
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,560
Church of the Subgenius was for another story.

664
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,580
And what a

665
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,620
story it is. And you can

666
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,460
learn the story of the Church

667
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,100
of the Subgenius if you're

668
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,080
crazy. If

669
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,240
you were to take the Subgenius

670
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,060
history course online,

671
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,120
which involves about

672
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,340
three DVDs worth of downloads

673
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,440
of everything we ever did,

674
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,180
including all of our

675
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,140
magazines and shows

676
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,780
and movies.

677
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,020
But that's something you would have to

678
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,120
look for other

679
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,420
information about, because I can't tell you.

680
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,920
Yeah, you'd have to be a Christian.

681
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,220
All I can say is,

682
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,780
subgenius.com

683
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,660
is the place to look

684
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,760
for more information

685
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
on that. That starts

686
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,960
October 25th

687
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,540
and lasts for six weeks, all

688
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,840
online. It's like going to a Subgenius

689
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,560
show without ever leaving

690
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,540
your house, so you don't get the

691
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,740
diseases, but you also don't

692
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,740
get the beautiful live girls.

693
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,760
That's when you really

694
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,900
need to get the diseases.

695
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,860
On slide three.

696
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,780
I wonder what

697
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,220
is that thing?

698
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,940
Oh my God,

699
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,560
how could she do that?

700
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,040
I didn't know that was

701
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,820
physiologically possible.

702
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,580
Oh my God.

703
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,700
With Bob's pipe,

704
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,500
all things are possible.

705
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,860
Take a deep breath, friend.

706
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,120
You have nothing to lose.

707
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,940
You have very little

708
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,780
gain, but at least you'll be

709
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
on the plus side.

710
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,880
But steep.

711
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,960
Take a big, long draw

712
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,120
from Bob's pipe.

713
00:27:59,500 --> 00:27:59,960
Yes.

714
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,900
Your eyes are rolling back in your head.

715
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,620
I hope you don't mind if we use you

716
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,800
for a little comic enjoyment.

717
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,940
Just stand over here in the middle of this

718
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,880
stage while you react, and we'll

719
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,760
laugh at you.

720
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,840
And I thought

721
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,180
my jokes were bad.

722
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,960
They are.

723
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,380
Honey.

724
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,920
It's like the Fibber McGee and Molly show sometimes.

725
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,380
I thought my jokes were bad.

726
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,580
And I mean,

727
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,260
she's you guys

728
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,800
perversely.

729
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,100
Well, that's

730
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,700
yeah, babe.

731
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,760
Well, listen, you know, you know, I don't know.

732
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,800
That's just the way we do it.

733
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,760
No, I'm saying no.

734
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:46,960
Sure.

735
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,980
No, I'm saying no.

736
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,140
Sure.

737
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
No, no, no.

738
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:51,920
No.

739
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:51,920


740
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,500
No.

741
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,060
No.

742
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,520
No.

743
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:54,820
No.

744
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Okay.

745
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,080
Okay.

746
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,640
And I think

747
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,740
I think glyphic toolbar languages

748
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,580
and the social media.

749
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,820
And I think they've gone

750
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,740
too far without knowing

751
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,700
how far they've gone.

752
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,940
It's like a little dingleberry

753
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,660
in a life raft dreaming of perhaps

754
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,160
the other shore where there is none.

755
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,400
You know, that's so ironic because I

756
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,900
dream of dingleberries in life rafts

757
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,200
going around in circles.

758
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,080
And they dream of being

759
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,040
on our shore.

760
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,020
Well, sometimes there's huge tsunamis that

761
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,760
that bear down on them.

762
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,060
At the times there's clear sailing and there's

763
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,540
Hawaiian dancing girls wearing suitcases and

764
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,160
and enamored of boxes.

765
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,580
I think then other times you're stuck in the middle

766
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,500
of a strange shore that you wish you wouldn't have

767
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,160
landed on it.

768
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,200
The natives could be hostility and there could be

769
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,760
problems with your zippers.

770
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,860
I'm stuck here at the island.

771
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,480
I'm stuck here at the island of WCSB's beautiful studios

772
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,080
in downtown Cleveland.

773
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,520
Where the coconuts grow year round.

774
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,300
They do?

775
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,860
Well, yeah, sure.

776
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,420
Well, the nuts at least.

777
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,400
Dr. Sinister is here.

778
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm stuck.

779
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,640
Is he wearing the, you know, the funny eyeglasses

780
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,620
that I sent him?

781
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,340
Well, he always said he can't take those off.

782
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,180
None of us can.

783
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,260
If I did, then people might recognize my secret identity.

784
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,840
Well, I guess.

785
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,080
Well, they're not worried about your secret identity

786
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,860
right now.

787
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,460
They're worried about how you're going to make it

788
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,300
for the next 25 seconds with them goggles on.

789
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,700
Those secret glasses I sent you.

790
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,860
25 seconds.

791
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,380
I can't.

792
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,600
I can't count that high.

793
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,480
You've just got to take life one 25 seconds at a time.

794
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,140
But I want an Oompa Loompa now.

795
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,920
Well, they can.

796
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,140
Just breathe deeply through the diaphragm.

797
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,400
If you can find one in the studio there, I guess there

798
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,880
was a pretty wild party last night.

799
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,340
I don't know, there was a party last night.

800
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,340


801
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,540
I feel really lucky right now.

802
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:03,940
And while you're on your

803
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,980
board with Lord Sinister, that was really

804
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,000
crazy.

805
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,780
How on Earth can you usually go to Oompa Loompa

806
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,060
and figure out your secret identity without showing

807
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,160
any sign you don't know about him and letting people know you for

808
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,160


809
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,560
And, uh, now.

810
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,100
That's great.

811
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,180


812
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,920
to see the out of doors,

813
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,260
that big bright light in the top of the dome.

814
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,480
Yeah, what is that thing?

815
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,440
It hurts.

816
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,200
So bright.

817
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,960
They could turn it down, but they won't.

818
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,940
No, they let the hula girls go past your window,

819
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,520
drifting by.

820
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,620
Oh, look at the girl.

821
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,820
We're on a little ukulele,

822
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,100
surfing one of them hundred-foot highways.

823
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,420
You can see through those grass skirts.

824
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,320
Mm.

825
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,180
That's so exotic and foreign.

826
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,180
Mm.

827
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,280
Hey, hey.

828
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,500
Hey, I'm going to play the news real quick.

829
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:57,840
Help me.

830
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,260
From PR News in Washington,

831
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,980
I'm now in police custody.

832
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,360
Authorities say 11 people were hurt.

833
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,820
The French government is bracing for another massive turkey.

834
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,120
President Obama says he's sorry.

835
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,100
On Wall Street 2010, 740.

836
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,400
The owner of an Iowa egg company says this is PR News.

837
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,420
PR News, Washington.

838
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,140
The drug administration has approved a new drug.

839
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,020
It's the first that can be taken in Washington.

840
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,520
The new drug slows the patient's brain.

841
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
It's called slow brain.

842
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,620
A company spokeswoman says no information is available.

843
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,480
The district attorney said the group paid itself hefty salaries.

844
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,600
The driver who was involved in a deadly tour bus

845
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,080
faces at least 11 charges of having children.

846
00:32:51,080 --> 00:33:04,980
The statistics detail a serious

847
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,980
ose.

848
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,340
Stephanie Insurance,

849
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,500
English Translation,

850
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,060
And because the Black Widow's movie this morning

851
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,060
is phenomenal,

852
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,320
legged captain of the Clara M accidentally overheard an argument between Subban and the

853
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,780
crew. Jimmy was discovered eavesdropping, threatened with dire punishment by Clark Kent.

854
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,860
It is now several days later. Listen.

855
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,120
That's our biggest report of any waste party from me.

856
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,180
Hey.

857
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,860
What holy mackerel? What can that be?

858
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:53,020
Yes, what can it be? What is the meaning of the strange, dark, thrilling, mysterious weird Subban?

859
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,400
Tune in the demon-talling rip-snacker, Subban.

860
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,460
Subban.

861
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,500
Subban is right.

862
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,960
Subban is right. That was my favorite Subban episode so far.

863
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,380
I remember when Harry Olsen, the Paleolithic editor of the Daily Stones,

864
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:15,620
accidentally was found overlapping the desk with the lovely Miss Lois Arcade.

865
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,300
That was something for Superman to see.

866
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,720
You know, he had a hard time. He was about ready to bust a move,

867
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,240
but he knew that he would probably blow his cover.

868
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,880
You know what really gets me is how they always have to change one little detail or another

869
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,280
when making a comic book-to-film adaptation, you know?

870
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,480
And, you know, like just now they were saying that Superman was from the planet Supton.

871
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,940
No, he was from the planet Crouton.

872
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,120
Superman.

873
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,100
You know, they just had to change that for some of the Hollywood suits.

874
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,000
Superman.

875
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,560
Superman.

876
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,880
Does he come in garlic flavor?

877
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,240
Pardon me.

878
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,500
This is a family show.

879
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,700
He comes from Parma.

880
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,420
Parma.

881
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,780
Comes in melted cheese flavor.

882
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,860
I was told to pronounce that Parma when I first moved here.

883
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,780
Were they making fun of me?

884
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,140
Parma.

885
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,340
Yeah, you're a little bit behind the ball.

886
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,360
It's Parma.

887
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,340
In Parma, there's a street called Chevrolet Boulevard, and there's a place where they make cars.

888
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,300
If you come over to Pennsylvania sometimes, you'll notice that they make cores over there.

889
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,900
And then you go across the border and they make cars.

890
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,300
It's kind of weird.

891
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:33,000
But I love it, so I remember the last time I was in the same frame in the movie,

892
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,880
and it got frozen and started to burn.

893
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,020
Is that what happened to you?

894
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,900
No, that's what happened to you.

895
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:41,660
Oh.

896
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,760
Well, I knew one of us suddenly swole up and melted.

897
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,260
I was just watching.

898
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,480
Are you sure?

899
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,860
I was one of the many viewers chewing their popcorn and gribbling.

900
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:00,920
Now that frame stuck in the projector is a plug-in that doesn't make any sense to modern-day kids.

901
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,860
Well, thank God for that.

902
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:09,980
Because nobody shows 16mm films or even 35mm films on regular projectors anymore, hardly.

903
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,260
Well, what do they do when they go to a psychotronic film fest?

904
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,540
And they're sitting there.

905
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,840
And the weird...

906
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,700
strange...

907
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,060
vinyl-looking...

908
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,440
pale-blue-shirted...

909
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,820
gym teacher goes upstairs to see what's wrong with the projector,

910
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,840
and the kids, before the monster attacks,

911
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,620
the kids are all like,

912
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,240
ehhh,

913
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,940
because the film is going to...

914
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,380
and burns and stuff.

915
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,240
Thank you for reminding me.

916
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,620
I was going to do a movie review.

917
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,780
And how is Tyler Durden going to splice in single frames of pornography into family films?

918
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:38,680
Yeah.

919
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,260
How can they still do that, even after all of...

920
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,980
how technology has advanced so far?

921
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,820
Yeah.

922
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:51,060
I think, um, what we need to do is to form a new covert brotherhood.

923
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,400
Both for...

924
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,280
Are you playing Ema Schumach?

925
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,740
No, that's Princess Wee.

926
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,640
She's ate one of those one-dollar chicken sandwiches on the way back from Rabbit Town.

927
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,400
Oh.

928
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,820
And, uh, it's kind of...

929
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,560
it...

930
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,340
it...

931
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,580
irked her.

932
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,200
Now, does Rabbit Town about Frog Town, or does...

933
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,740
No, it's near Hutchville.

934
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,560
Oh.

935
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,220
Rabbiton and Hutchville.

936
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:20,320
Anyway, I was going to mention this movie that nobody's ever heard of, except, I guess, film students.

937
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,880
And I had not heard of it.

938
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,200
I found it in the media ditch near my house, and I didn't know what it was.

939
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,960
It's called Monsters.

940
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:36,040
And not really very aptly named, because although it has monsters, it's really a love story.

941
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:44,200
And, um, apparently it's such a low-budget independent film that, friends, you may never see it in your mind.

942
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,900
It's in your movie theaters.

943
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:53,100
But look for it in your local media ditch, or wherever you find movies that the conspiracy otherwise tries to hide.

944
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,420
It's called Monsters.

945
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,700
Made this year.

946
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,980
Directed by and written by a guy named Gareth Edwards, who also photographed it and did all the special effects.

947
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,020
The whole movie is on a budget of $15,000.

948
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,160
Lord have mercy.

949
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,920
Which is what you would pay for...

950
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,300
You know, a few minutes of film on a film camera.

951
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:27,060
But apparently it was made with a crew consisting of only two people using off-the-shelf consumer-level cameras and digital effects programs.

952
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,780
The film was shot entirely on location.

953
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,180
Any settings featured were real locations, often used without permission asked in advance.

954
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,960
And all the film extras were just people who happened to be there at the time.

955
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,520
And it looks like a million bucks.

956
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,380
And not only that, it's a really good movie.

957
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,300
So...

958
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,960
I'm sorry.

959
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,180
Even the central characters were just...

960
00:38:53,180 --> 00:39:00,600
There's two central characters, and apparently the cameraman was the director and the writer, and he's really good.

961
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,980
He used to be a special effects person, apparently.

962
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,760
And he and the sound man and the two actors went to Mexico and shot this movie.

963
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
And made it look fabulous.

964
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,440
Here's the story, okay?

965
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,960
Six years ago, NASA discovered the possibility of alien life within our solar system.

966
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,460
A probe was launched to collect samples, but crashed upon re-entry over Central America.

967
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,580
Soon after, new life forms began to appear and half of Mexico...

968
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,500
That's not in Central America.

969
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,880
Was quarantined as an infected zone.

970
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,740
Today, the American and Mexican military...

971
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:40,740


972
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,460
Still struggle to contain the creatures.

973
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:50,800
Our story begins when a U.S. journalist agrees to escort a shaken tourist through the infected zone in Mexico...

974
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,060
To the safety of the U.S. border.

975
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,120
Which in this movie looks like the Great Wall of China.

976
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:57,580
And...

977
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,820
The thing is...

978
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,360
It's not really a monster movie.

979
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,740
It's really a love story that could have been set in any non-American country...

980
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,740
With Americans trying to get home through a disaster.

981
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,800
It could be a revolution.

982
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,880
It could have been anything.

983
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,140
But they decided to make it giant crab-octopus-squid monsters.

984
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:17,640
Who...

985
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,640
Well, I don't want to spoil it for you.

986
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,000
But...

987
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,040
The monsters aren't in it very much.

988
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,340
And monster fans who are stupid...

989
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,320
The stupid ones...

990
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,060
Like...

991
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,600
Not even subgenius level.

992
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:32,100
Because they didn't do the right thing.

993
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,660
And write to Bob.

994
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,400
They...

995
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
They didn't like it.

996
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,740
Because it was like, well, it's all mushy stuff.

997
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,380
It's just these people in Mexico running around with...

998
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,360
Trying to bribe their way through the panic.

999
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,700
But...

1000
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,240
You know, the funny thing...

1001
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,780
I've made low-budget movies.

1002
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,280
And I've been trapped in foreign countries.

1003
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,480
Not speaking the language very well.

1004
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,160
And anxious as to whether I was going to get out...

1005
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,800
Before the government changed its mind.

1006
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
Or the monsters came.

1007
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,580
Or whatever.

1008
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,600
And the whole atmosphere of it is great.

1009
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,400
Monsters.

1010
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,160
2010.

1011
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,680
Directed by Gareth Edwards.

1012
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,660
That is my review.

1013
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,100
If you look it up in...

1014
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,040
IMDBA.

1015
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,140
Internet Movie Database.

1016
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,780
The...

1017
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,260
The...

1018
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,360
The user comments are actually pretty good.

1019
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,800
I was tempted to read them.

1020
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,660
But I won't.

1021
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,420
Because I had a nice review of the movie by G8 Jedi.

1022
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,260
That's the name that was attached to the review.

1023
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,020
But...

1024
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,700
Yeah, it was...

1025
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:36,940
It's...

1026
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,280
It's...

1027
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,240
As this person says...

1028
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,440
The monster effects are believable.

1029
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,520
And...

1030
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,400
And Edwards deserves due credit for some fun visuals.

1031
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,000
But he successfully directs our attention to the human story.

1032
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,640
Rather than letting the monsters be the main characters.

1033
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,500
This is not a traditional action-sci-fi movie.

1034
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,020
Though there are certainly heart-pounding, jaw-dropping scenes of mayhem and military firepower.

1035
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,000
It's a character-driven story set in a sci-fi disaster-monster movie.

1036
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,540
And it works.

1037
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,660
Don't go in thinking it is district novella.

1038
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,580
or Cloverfield, although it actually

1039
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,920
looks kind of like both of those

1040
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,620
at times.

1041
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,500
I heard this

1042
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,960
Cloverfield reference, but

1043
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,820
the products... It's a monster movie.

1044
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,740
It was a monster

1045
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,680
movie from the point of view

1046
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,400
of the fleeing public,

1047
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,160
not from the point of view of the

1048
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,620
general or the scientist

1049
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,840
or the scientist's daughter

1050
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,680
or the handsome square-jawed

1051
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,700
hero who all already know

1052
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,820
what the monster is. It's from the point of view

1053
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,680
of the people fleeing down the street who don't

1054
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,500
know what happened.

1055
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,480
And that's the kind of monster movie

1056
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,740
we like these days, because we've seen

1057
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,560
all the other kind.

1058
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,860
I got a great idea. Now listen to this. This has got all the elements.

1059
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,420
See? There's a gay scientist.

1060
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,840
No, no, he's a doctor. The doctor's

1061
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,400
a scientist, and there's a monster.

1062
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,720
This is a big monster, and he's coming by real

1063
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,640
quick. So anyway,

1064
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,500
the handsome colonel

1065
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,320
in the Air Force, he falls in love with the

1066
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,060
general's daughter. But the general's daughter

1067
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,400
is falling in love with the handsome, no,

1068
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,480
the gay professor. The monster. The monster, that's

1069
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,340
right. And then the monster comes with all these

1070
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,320
central characters that killed in the very

1071
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,420
first act. The monster. And the next is the POV

1072
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,460
of the monster. Do you see

1073
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,920
where I'm coming from? I see, I see.

1074
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,440
It's from the

1075
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,320
monster's point of view. I'm digging it. I'm

1076
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,220
digging it, man. I'm digging it. After that

1077
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,540
last bite, he feels remorse.

1078
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,020
He falls in love with another monster.

1079
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,180
They come up with an idea.

1080
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,340
See, this is the idea. It's gonna sell. It's gonna

1081
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,680
sell. I can tell. It's gonna sell.

1082
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,960
They taste pretty good and so on and so forth.

1083
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,200
We're gonna do something better.

1084
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,580
Aye, aye, aye.

1085
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,200
Aye, aye, aye.

1086
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,140
Aye, aye, aye.

1087
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,960
Aye, aye, aye.

1088
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,140
That's why they call them

1089
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,200
news croppers, see?

1090
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:51,180
They break into every little thing and give you

1091
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,220
little tiny bits that don't make any sense.

1092
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,180
But you're supposed to absorb them

1093
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,740
just like a moist towel.

1094
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,760
They're crying out loud.

1095
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,960
They're eating our children.

1096
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,080
Hey, Dave,

1097
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,240
we saw you on the internet.

1098
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,600
I didn't. You got on the secret

1099
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,540
subgenius news group. Yeah, man.

1100
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,540
You managed to get in. You're out.

1101
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,120
Yeah. You're out.

1102
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,080
Yeah, man. We outed

1103
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,500
Dave on the inside.

1104
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,960
He's netting, man. He's out there netting

1105
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,160
and surfing. Well, what I don't like

1106
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,900
is these people who are

1107
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,460
obviously crazier than me

1108
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,940
responding to whatever I come up

1109
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
with to say at a particular moment

1110
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,840
is, you're crazy. And they say

1111
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,920
pretty succinctly, you know, just a couple words

1112
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,800
and it makes you really feel deflated.

1113
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,940
You want to just kind of

1114
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,120
go hang your head somewhere and

1115
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,200
wish you were on your own.

1116
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,820
What, it bothers you that the crazy people call you

1117
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,360
crazy? Well,

1118
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,780
you better get off the internet then, dude, because

1119
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,860
that's all the internet is, is crazy

1120
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,900
people calling each other crazy, as far

1121
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,540
as I can tell.

1122
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,540
I think they're thought narcissists.

1123
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,820
They think that their thoughts are so damned

1124
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,840
important that they look at it

1125
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,780
and it's like a, and then they

1126
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,480
want everyone else to look at it.

1127
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,540
Well, I

1128
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,040
like it.

1129
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,040


1130
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,920
I like to look at people's thoughts sometimes.

1131
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,580
Me too. Sometimes.

1132
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,920
I don't have any of my

1133
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,880
own and I, I

1134
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,840
yearn so much to have

1135
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,740
a thought someday. A real

1136
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,340
thought. A thought of my own.

1137
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,820
See, then you are like Dr.

1138
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,900
Juergens. You are his true son.

1139
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,840
You are a thought psychic

1140
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,640
vampire. You are, you are.

1141
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,580
Admit it.

1142
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,020
So that's where all your ideas come from.

1143
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,780
You go around checking out

1144
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,780
the loony bins and crazy farms and

1145
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,360
you even do little interviews with

1146
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,840
a secret handheld mic and you walk in and you say

1147
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,200
hey man, how's it going?

1148
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,540
They're coming for poop talk tomorrow

1149
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,760
and they don't know. Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,560
Okay, okay. Well look,

1151
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,760
what time they coming?

1152
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,060
July 5th.

1153
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,960
You only have to

1154
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,040
do it every few years.

1155
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,780
You leave a tight deck in the state mental

1156
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,740
home at the

1157
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,340
cafeteria

1158
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,860
for a day and then you

1159
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,900
hire a secretary

1160
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,860
to transcribe everything the crazy people

1161
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,600
say and there you've got your

1162
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,720
new church of the subgenius for the next

1163
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
five years. Point. Everything you need.

1164
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,540
Right there.

1165
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,460
Yep.

1166
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,380
That's the plan. Sometimes.

1167
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,120
Sometimes.

1168
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,880
Well, you know, we teach, we actually

1169
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,760
teach a course in how to run

1170
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,040
your own

1171
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,660
cult. Mind control cult.

1172
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,260
I don't mean a

1173
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,780
religion. I mean a cult.

1174
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,140
Something that

1175
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,460
takes away your judgment.

1176
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,220
It replaces your

1177
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,820
real thinking power with a set of

1178
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,340
arbitrary rules, formulae

1179
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,920
and that you have to

1180
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,840
memorize. We teach you

1181
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,680
how to teach other people that

1182
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,040
and sell them on that

1183
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,580
on your notion.

1184
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,640
Your one thought. You only have to have one thought.

1185
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,720
You can steal it. But

1186
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,920
we teach you how to turn that one thought into

1187
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,560
a cult.

1188
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,680
You just take that nail and hammer it

1189
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,040
and hammer it.

1190
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:05,260
Hammer it.

1191
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,680
And hammer it.

1192
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,220
That's what I say.

1193
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,160
And there you go.

1194
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,500
And then you've made something.

1195
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,580
I think it's probably one of the most brilliant

1196
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,620
self-help and

1197
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,900
self-education.

1198
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,560
A learning at home system that

1199
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,300
nobody can deny actually

1200
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,520
has merits far beyond its use

1201
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,180
and its value.

1202
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,340
And when the price of gold does

1203
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,920
continue to skyrocket,

1204
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,900
I think you better

1205
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,040
learn what you need.

1206
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,840
You need to learn by paying attention

1207
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,180
to this important course.

1208
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,660
It's offered by a man of great authority.

1209
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,040
A man with wisdom far beyond

1210
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,680
yours and mine. And he's made

1211
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,180
plenty of money.

1212
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,800
I'm sorry.

1213
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,960
I'm sorry.

1214
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,820
And that man

1215
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,940
is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1216
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,780
The saint of sales.

1217
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,980
The living avatar of slack on this planet

1218
00:47:58,980 --> 00:47:59,360
Earth.

1219
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,740
And his church, the church of the subgenius,

1220
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,600
could indeed be the greatest joke

1221
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,380
ever told.

1222
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,100
If and only if Earth can make it to the punchline.

Copyright 1979.

1224
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,820
Reverend Ivan Stang.

1225
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,100
We're getting close, aren't we?

1226
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,040
To the punchline.

1227
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,400
Well, we're getting close

1228
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,740
to the end of this show.

1229
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,900
Well, we need a punchline.

1230
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,680
We've got about, I don't know, what, ten minutes?

1231
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,760
In the last five minutes, I'm going to play

1232
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,260
a song by my son.

1233
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,840
The son of Stang,

1234
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:31,900
who has now grown

1235
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,380
to the age of 30 years.

1236
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:34,780
He's six years old.

1237
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,520
And, uh,

1238
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,740
and does things like

1239
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,520
songs.

1240
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,900
He sent me a bunch of them, and

1241
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,580
I apply it. Now I know how my parents

1242
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,360
felt when I saw my first underground

1243
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:48,940
movie.

1244
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,180
Our child is so depressing.

1245
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,420
Oh, my God. He's so

1246
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,480
grim. I'd hoped that he would

1247
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,320
avoid those angry,

1248
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,380
awful, lonesome thoughts.

1249
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,200
But, uh,

1250
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,580
they do grow up.

1251
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,120
Most of them grow up fast,

1252
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,420
but they don't grow up much.

1253
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,960
This one grew up

1254
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,760
instantly.

1255
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:14,920
Actually,

1256
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,660
from the time he was born,

1257
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,420
he had a judgmental look.

1258
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,860
And how old

1259
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,820
was he when he looked up at you and said

1260
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,980
that he was having a bad life?

1261
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,540
Yeah, when he was five,

1262
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,060
my son had,

1263
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,180
he just sort of had a bad day.

1264
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,660
A toy broke

1265
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,440
or something. He stubbed his little,

1266
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:34,580
uh,

1267
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,140
toe, had a boo-boo or something.

1268
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,200
And he looked at me and he said,

1269
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,020
Dad, I'm having a very

1270
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,320
bad life.

1271
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,380
It was so cute.

1272
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,800
And I said, yes, son.

1273
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,200
And soon you will be like that

1274
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,780
dead squirrel we saw,

1275
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,260
electrocuted on our electric

1276
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,300
fence. We'll all

1277
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,200
end up like that squirrel, son.

1278
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,140
Is that why

1279
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,300
he's now good at everything that he

1280
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,340
does? I don't understand how he can

1281
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,100
do that. Well, he had a sense

1282
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,300
of time.

1283
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,300
Like his daddy,

1284
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,060
he had told me independently,

1285
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,700
in fact,

1286
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,880
when I was driving him to college

1287
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,800
in New York, he said

1288
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,620
that,

1289
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,740
like me, he is

1290
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,060
constantly aware of the grim

1291
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,780
reaper lurking right

1292
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,060
behind him, breathing down his

1293
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,060
neck, going,

1294
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,900
I've only got a limited bunch of time, son.

1295
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,620
Better use it right.

1296
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,260
Which, of course, means

1297
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,620
to repent, quit

1298
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,140
your job, and slack off.

1299
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,680
But it also means if your idea

1300
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,540
of slacking off was to get certain things done,

1301
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,280
maybe you better get cracking on them.

1302
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,700
And, in fact, the song that my

1303
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,820
son did is about, he has two songs

1304
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,200
about that. The first one is called

1305
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,840
Timeline. And we will

1306
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,780
be playing that

1307
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,780
very soon. It is ironic that he would

1308
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,460
come up with a song called

1309
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,800
Timeline, as time is

1310
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,440
one of your major problems.

1311
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,240
Oh, you can't imagine the irony.

1312
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,100
The irony is of the things that these two do

1313
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,220
at the same time. It's incredible.

1314
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,520
It's mind-blowing.

1315
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,260
They both started video editing

1316
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,340
and making DVDs at the

1317
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,560
same time. At the same age.

1318
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,340
At exactly the same time.

1319
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,160
I was 35 and he was 2.

1320
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,380
And their DVDs

1321
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,500
crossed in the mail.

1322
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,500
Unbelievable. Actually, his movie script

1323
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,660
is bogged down at exactly the same point

1324
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,700
mine is. It's really... Or ours is.

1325
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,500
Actually, I should say.

1326
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,240
Dave is part of the

1327
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,200
subject.

1328
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:33,980
Genius movie script.

1329
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,060
It's just been announced that Dave will

1330
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
be played by Robert De Niro.

1331
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,920
No, Robert Duvall.

1332
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,240
Robert Duvall is going to play Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1333
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,880
And Robert De Niro is playing

1334
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,360
the old Reverend Stang.

1335
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,280
But Johnny Depp is playing the young Reverend Stang.

1336
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,760
That's very self-deprecating.

1337
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,880
I thought it was going to be Mel Gibson.

1338
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:55,820
But...

1339
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,080
He blew it.

1340
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,040
And Princess We will be

1341
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,120
played by Scarlett Johansson.

1342
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,900
But the most... The old and young

1343
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,740
Princess We.

1344
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,020
She doesn't change. Oh, anyway.

1345
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,140
Well, yeah, it's getting down near the end of show.

1346
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,020
This show

1347
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,120
is The Hour of Slack from the Church of the

1348
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,840
Subgenius.

1349
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,980
Subgenius.com

1350
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:19,820
And...

1351
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,800
Now, that's not your son playing right now, is it?

1352
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,900
No, that's my daughter. That's your daughter.

1353
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,720
Yes, that's actually my daughter singing

1354
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,580
at her wedding.

1355
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,480
She sings very well.

1356
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,760
So, yeah, I'm going to...

1357
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,240
Let's see. Okay, all right.

1358
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,260
Then...

1359
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,560
I can't tell...

1360
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,200
The time control and the timelines

1361
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,660
around here are all messed up.

1362
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,820
My watch says one thing and the

1363
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,600
clockety-clock says another thing.

1364
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,020
But...

1365
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,080
But I'm going to go ahead and just

1366
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,160
run this...

1367
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,540
This grim...

1368
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,360
Somewhat grim or perhaps hopeful

1369
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,680
depending on how you look at it.

1370
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,020
Depending on whether you are, in fact,

1371
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,020
a rewardian like most subgeniuses

1372
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,520
or an emergentile.

1373
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:08,940
Dave?

1374
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,760
Like Reverend Stang and his son.

1375
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,160
I'm going to leave you on, but I'm going to

1376
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,380
take the volume down.

1377
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,980
I want... Yes, I want it.

1378
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,800
Okay, okay, okay. And then...

1379
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:17,800


1380
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:19,820
Huh!

1381
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,420
Huh!

1382
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:21,620
Huh!

1383
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,220
Huh!

1384
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,180


1385
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:25,260


1386
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:25,880
Huh!

1387
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:25,980
Huh!

1388
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,040
Huh!

1389
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,460
Huh!

1390
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,120
Huh!

1391
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:27,800


1392
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:30,780
Huh!

1393
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,540
Huh!

1394
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:39,880
Huh!

1395
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,000


1396
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:40,520
Huh!

1397
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,300
Huh!

1398
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,440
Yesterday was yesterday.

1399
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,160
Tomorrow's another day.

1400
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,060
One thing that doesn't change is

1401
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,860
that today is still today.

1402
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,440
Huh!

1403
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1404
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1405
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1406
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1407
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1408
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1409
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1410
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1411
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1412
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1413
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1414
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1415
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1416
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1417
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1418
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:56,440


1419
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,640
You can look back at what went wrong

1420
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,720
Or at what might go right

1421
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:08,760
But if there's one thing I'm sure of

1422
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,060
It's that I'm giving this time bullshit a fight

1423
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,320
I can feel the timeline on me

1424
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,740
I can feel it shortening down

1425
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,100
I can tell you that time is telling me

1426
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,340
That it's about time I come around

1427
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,040
Make all the plans that you want

1428
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,700
They can always wait

1429
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,840
There are always unfixable problems

1430
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,580
When it's already too late

1431
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,080
Look back at what went wrong

1432
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,480
Or at what might go right

1433
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,400
But if there's one thing I'm sure of

1434
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,820
It's that I'm giving this time bullshit a fight

1435
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,080
I can feel the timeline on me

1436
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,500
I can feel it shortening down

1437
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,840
I can tell you that time is telling me

1438
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,140
That it's about time I come around

1439
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,980
Is this where it all starts?

1440
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,860
Or is this where it all ends?

1441
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,520
As far as I'm concerned

1442
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,200
There's no middle for me

1443
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,600
I can feel the timeline on me

1444
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,980
I can feel it shortening down

1445
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,080
I can tell you that time is telling me

1446
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,080


1447
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,080


1448
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,080


1449
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:54,080


1450
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,600
That it's about time I come around

1451
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,980
I can feel the timeline on me

1452
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,420
I can feel it shortening down

1453
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:09,700
I can tell you the time is telling me

1454
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,860
That it's about time I come around

1455
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,380
I can feel the timeline on me

1456
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:20,700
I can feel it shortening down

1457
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,080
I can tell you the time is telling me

1458
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:24,080


1459
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,440
How about that?

1460
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,800
That's delightful.

1461
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,600
That's quite a nice hook.

1462
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:03,440
Yeah, he did like five songs and put them together and sent them out to the family.

1463
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,020
And we all went, oh my God, he's as bad as me.

1464
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,420
And they all have vicious hooks like that.

1465
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,040
You listen to them once and they're with you forever.

1466
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,780
Yes, they might be giant-ish.

1467
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,660
Took the words right out of my mouth in terms of the vocals.

1468
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,500
Oh, really?

1469
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,060
Just the vocals.

1470
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:19,420
Just the vocals.

1471
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,200
The hook approach, yeah.

1472
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,960
Well, he sounds different on each song.

1473
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,040
That one's kind of higher pitched.

1474
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,240
He tried all kinds of little funny filtering things.

1475
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,420
He did all the music and drum loops.

1476
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,020
There were loops in the drum track?

1477
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,820
The drum, I think, was all loops.

1478
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,360
Oh, wow.

1479
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,820
But he played the guitar and keyboards and stuff.

1480
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,460
Yes, Zandy Smith.

1481
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,320
I'm not going to give his website because if the subgeniuses saw what this guy does,

1482
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,800
they'd be so jealous.

1483
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,600
They'd want to kill me even more.

1484
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,860
So I tend to leave the family out of this stuff, you know,

1485
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:02,120
unless they want to get into it.

1486
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,780
Yeah, they don't want daddy's friends schlepping into something

1487
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,840
which actually makes sense and works.

1488
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,860
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1489
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,520
No, no, I'm sorry.

1490
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,040
And with that, we must go because the show is over.

1491
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,380
And that is it.

1492
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,080
Praise Bob.

1493
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,160
Praise Dave.

1494
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,300
Praise Bob.

1495
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:21,980
Praise Dave.

1496
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,600
Praise Princess Wee.

1497
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,480
Praise this tiny little thing or big I pulled from the back.

1498
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,880
And praise the listeners.

1499
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,680
Oh, yeah, those things.

1500
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,560
Those things, the ghosts.

1501
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,700
And praise Rob.

1502
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,240
Praise Rob.

1503
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,000
And praise the universal.

1504
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,220
Sorry.

1505
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm bracing for the remnants of Texas.

1506
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,460
President Obama, who's all talk,

1507
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,420
spoke against Texas.

1508
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,140
Atlanta, Ash, and Dolman Schko.

1509
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,820
I believe to Schmishy.

1510
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:53,940
I believe to Schmigar.

1511
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,000
I believe to Schmigar.

1512
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,040
In Cleveland, Mr. Obama spoke against incentives for businesses

1513
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,420
and called for more out-of-control spending

1514
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:04,480
and severely hurting economic recovery.

1515
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,220
I believe government must be the main engine.

1516
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,940
I believe it's the private sector that should be lean.

1517
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,440
This is PR.

1518
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,800
The Federal Reserve Bank spreading to many areas

1519
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,060
and in parts of the eastern and mid-eastern U.S.

1520
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,440
Shikta, Landry Kong, Afya, Dull, and Phil Edmund Schko.

1521
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,260
After months of speculation, CNN in January.

1522
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,060
In a statement, CNN in January, and quote,

1523
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,020
every weeknight of them all, from time to time.

1524
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,760
A wildfire outside Boulder, Colorado,

1525
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,460
is going with British journalist and talent show judge Larry Morgan.

1526
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,260
However, we're hearing that several people are unaccounted for.

1527
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,500
