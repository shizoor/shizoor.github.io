Ah, yes, dear friends.
Rub-a-dub-dub.
Thanks for the grub.
Souls, friends, it's all souls.
That's all we're after.
Your money is a secondary consideration, really,
compared to the fine meat of the soul.
No, wait, Mom, no, not yet, not now, no.
Really?

That, my friend, is the face of the enemy,
always trying to get his greedy little hands on endangered species.
Now, hold on.
Ronald Camp is connected with the dolphins?
Yeah, that subgenius gave him the land the new stadium's built on.
And look at this.
He's throwing another I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party.
Hmm.
Looks like it's time for me to get myself a date.
All right.

You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery
which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Subgenius Hour of Sight.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
And it's showtime.
Wow.
Turn on now.
Okay.
Push-up up.
Sure.
Twist the dial.
No!
That's a little too close for comfort, fella.
So I'll say this to Janer and all who would stain or deface our continuing trope.
This effusion of noise creates slack in its joys.
So prepare one and all to elope.
So I'll say this to Janer or any complainer who whines for his place in the sun.
Don't you know in Bob's eyes,
we are all the same.

We are all the same size.
And now I think we have begun.
So I'll say this to Sterno,
that Dante's Inferno is hardly more grim than this show.
To the listener's ear, nothing could be more clear.
So now let's get ready to go.
So I'll say this to Philo.
It's true I may smile owing to my profound faith in Bob.
Though I lost my career and I cry in my beer,
this show is my only real job.
Why don't you just tape it and say,

I'm a real seller?
Yeah, really.
No, he makes these beautiful edits and things, you know.
He puts them together on his system and they come out beautiful, man.
I heard that if we could, three feet down and two feet over,
we can get out of the show.
Well, why would anyone want to get out of this paradise?
Well, if we can do that in 25 minutes, I guess,
maybe a paradise for you.
Someone can come in and clean you all up.
This is the eternal living mind of the unending pulsating now, man.
You're going from nowhere, Phil.
This show is really happening.
Crazy.
Crazy?
Some may call it crazy.
They called me crazy.
Just a computer.
Okay, now go ahead, Paul.
Is this the Sub-G show?
Here, take some more church here.
No, this is People Radio.
I found your number in the phone book under Bob.
No, that's not a...
You gotta look under Gary.
You're looking for a chance number.
Put your feet up on the end line
and relax with a big mug of Jaffa Joy juice
while you listen to the swellest, humdingest,
sockadolager show ever to come crumbling and toddling down the pike.
This show has got it all.
Everything you could possibly want.
Just hang on your phone.



Kebabs at 9,


Huhuhu.



He's a human tornado
Mules has kicked me
Didn't bruise my hide
Rattlesnakes has bit me
They just crawled off and died
I had cover light
And it's with the rage you see
They don't want no
Dilapidated sea slapping
Pigeon toad across out of bow leg
And some guns are messing with me
I've been known to rise up
But I'll cool down later
I'm a bad motor scooter
I'm a human tornado
He's a human tornado
He's a human tornado
He's a human tornado
He's a human tornado
Taste the blood on Satan's claw
Dance a jig in crimson bra
Build the fire for a boiling pot
Watch the neighbors don't get caught
Ernest Borgnine knew him well
St. Bill Shatner strayed to hell
What the hay, it served him right
Eyeball sockets wrinkled tight
Well, there's a big light shining in the coconut grove
Where Satan used to watch the Barney Miller show
Syndicated television puts him in the mood
Hoping a pagoda just might get nude
Satan gets an erect shot
Staring at a pagoda butt
Meat and poultry by the pack
Extra servings, bring them back
Ain't no need to raise a fuss
Just yodel your way to that flaky crust
I'm going to go off the deck
This is a lie
Satan was invented by religious fundamentalists
Just to keep you acting like the jerk you really are
Sammy Davis Jr. used to worship Satan
When he wasn't taking drugs
Staring in the mirror while his eyeball twitched around
Let's watch Satan!
Sammy's eyeball twitch!
Don't bother asking if it's greasy or red
Or if he's got pointy horns stuck in his head
All you need to prove it is a Bible-thumping prick
Satan only happens if your tater's all sick
Hey, Satan
Satan
He works better than guilt from your mind
Taste the blood on Satan's claw
Oh, yes indeedy-o, daddy-o
Uh, Joe Newman there
Hey
Where's the echo? Oh, there it is
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You know it can drive a man insane doing these shows
Uh, yes, Joe Newman there
Doing the Human Tornado
The theme from Rudy Ray Moore's great film
The Human Tornado
Rudy Ray Moore playing Dolomite
In that particular work of art
And Satan's Claw by Joe Newman
Rudy Schwartz Project
Well, where are we now, friends?
Uh, uh, uh
458 hours of slack in the can
458 hours of slack
Get one down and dub it and dub it and dub it and dub it
And send it around
458 hours of slack on the wa-air
And I know we're talking about something...
Okay, dear friends
Well, uh...
Uh, this is the second show that I have to do today
So, wh-wh-well, heck
You know, let's try for more of an editing challenge this time
Of course, that means I won't be able to talk much
Uh, eh, or cut in and give credits
Because I must, I must need sync
sink into the edit mode.
Yes.
Yes, friends, it takes super subgenius concentration.
And when I'm deep in that mode,
I'm out of the speech mode.
It's either rant or edit.
And tonight, I feel like editing.
So, here's what it's going to be.
Yeah, here's what it's going to be.
The inside joke hour of slack.
Yeah, that's it.
The inside joke show.
Has your show become too normal for you?
Too familiar?
Well, we'll just have to fix that, dear friends.
You already know about how Bob is the center of the universe
and Slack is the be-all of all being.
Oh, um...
But what about the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?
What about Aunt Bertha?
What about, yay, even Susie's lizards?
I mean, you want to sound cool to the other Bobbies,
like you really know what's happening
and you're really on to the inside track
with the super obscure ultimate intellectual heaviness of Bob, right?
Well, just to prove that subgeniuses can be just as hilariously funny,
even when making no sense at all.
I mean, it just sounds good.
We present these excerpts from the following.
Well, first off, we'll have, uh, we'll, uh,
have just some more keen Rudy Schwartz Project music
from the Yodelin' Satan and Salmon Dave albums by Joe Newman,
just to give us in the right frame of mind,
and then it's pure ritual.
Some introduction, shall we say,
to the real inside Arnold Palmer head doctrine,
as preached by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
and Dr. Bleepo Abernathy at the Starwood Hippie Fest in, or near, Ohio.
Then, the old-timey subgenius rituals
as recorded live at last month's DragonCon
sci-fi convention subgenius revival in Atlanta,
starring Jane or Hyperclutes and the Swinging Love Corpses.
Yes, a live recording of the most self-referential,
head-launching ever.
And somewhere in there, we'll hear the highness,
sex-hurt rant of Reverend Susie the Floozy of Atlanta,
finally recorded by Bob Payne,
as well as perhaps, perhaps,
cuts from her radio show on WREK in Atlanta.
Praise WREK.
Not necessarily last, but probably nearly the least,
uh, more from our broadcast with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
and Dr. Bleepo Abernathy.
And Reverend Chaz Smith on Swamp Rot Radio WCSB Cleveland.
But, dear friends, before we go any deeper...
in the course- accessories.
Along with The Bчик Tworry Scholarship Fellowship belly of issue white.
We may, though, have taking grasp some readiness to discover

the gift safely available over cattle.


from Christmas into it.
And that, as well, could leave us mincednecks forлề
in the future at the age ofsee to forget about the camelliac Texas Swing from실�.

We want you, as people in young people,
to touch those suckers' silently pulled byPD7 while getting back to their old age politeness,
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It has been a pleasure to grow friends with you,
I just want to express a huge thank you for watchinghow we shared everywhere it's been
a great time.
Well, I'm going to give these two steamed eggs to Mr.
Stanford.
Would you mind getting a Class D firework?
Stop playing with those dangerous fireworks and come in the house.
Can I go to my local Red Devil distributor and get me a Class D firework?
You cannot.
You can march right up to your room and stay there until I say it's safe to come down.
Oh, I can't do anything, can't I?
What on earth do you mean, talking to Aunt Bertha like that?
I've only got ten fingers. I don't need all ten of them.
I'm falling off. I'll blow a few of them off. It should be my decision.
God gave you your fingers, Timmy.
Hand me those matches, will you, Dr. Howell?
Here they are, buddy. Go ahead and have fun.
This is the famous Chinese flower. I'm lighting it right now.
Okay, here we go.
Don't listen to that young man. He's possessed by Satan.
Oh, darn it, it's a dud.
All fireworks come from Satan and his imps.
Every year.
Every year I waste my money on this stuff. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Yeah, me neither.
Billy!
Now Aunt Bertha's voice comes and haunts him repeatedly as he tries to make important decisions.
What has God wrought?
Billy, stop that!
Billy.
That, of course, is what...
Oh, Billy.
Oh.
Billy, what are you doing?
Oh, Billy.
Oh, my.
Billy.
Billy.
Billy.






Little Billy was bilious that day when he awoke and saw Aunt Bertha's bulk
leering at him from the other side of the counterpane.
Billy, what are you doing?
A joint knife perfectly clean, Billy.
Now, work to and fro.
Avoid lumps, bumps, and uneven application
because Jesus wants this world to go all the way up to heaven.
Oh, I'm sick of that.
Jesus.
Jesus.
913.
Jesus.
Place your knife over a clean scrap of wood.
Not over the edge.
Not the puzzling evidence shelf.
Oh, there we go.
Okay, now the little Christ-kini.
Choke.
Timmy and Billy stole an atomic submarine when they should have been in church.
Timmy and Billy were always doing that.
That's why Billy's mayor of the world and Timmy is one of the most sought after...
Now, Billy, don't you imitate your dear father.
I'm the real Aunt Bertha.
You certainly are not.
I'm the real Aunt Bertha.
I'm the real Aunt Bertha because...
Uh-oh, look what's happening.
Another duel of the Berthas here on planet Earth.
There was another Bertha on the alternate world.
Bertha 2.
The alternate Bertha channel.
That the movie was made of.
I saw that movie and I give it a big thumbs down.
I give it a big thumbs up because they didn't have enough time.
But we don't have to worry about it.
They have to.
They have Anzac, Prozac, and Natal.
They just do not understand.
Billy, where did you go, Billy?
Billy and Timmy sneaked off to go to the movies instead of studying the Bible.
I sure hope Aunt Bertha doesn't find out that...
We're not in our Bible lesson.
I'm scared.
Oh, forget about that old bag.
Let's light some cigarettes, smoke them, then we can go burn some churches and worship Satan.
Cool.
If you're right in front of your left, open out your eyes and bring us together...
Experimenting again?
Every evil thing that ever happened was the result of an experiment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Drugs?
Oh, my.
Don't you know you're supposed to give all drugs to Aunt Bertha?
Dial a something or other.
Bacteria.
Grand Dragon.
Two Clucks Clash.
Hehehehe.
Clash.
Quit sticking your pencil in there.
Clash.
Now pipe down.
Pipe down.
I want you to confine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull roar.
I don't want to hear one peep out of you students, or it's right down to Mr. Hennessy's office.
I'll meet you in the rumpus room, Peach.
All right now, calm down, John.
When the number of outer electrons, defined as the number of electrons lying outside of the nearest rare gas, Ns2Np6...
Rare gas.
That's what I smell.
Or pseudo rare gas, N minus one, the quantity d10, or...
Good thing this good thing's gonna be open book.
This goes on and on about this stuff.
Who cares?
Who knows?
What can we do to make him stop?
Remember this in real life.
Now vape it on, and keep more people coming in.
...that there are certain things which a good subject never does.
Like what, Aunt Bertha?
Well, he always puts his thumb along the seams of his trousers like this.
He never stands vulgarly with arms akin to a...
Oh, but I've tried to stand correctly for many hours.
I've prayed...
That doesn't matter, Billy.
It's what you do, not what you try to do, that counts in the long run.
Oh, I'm so tired.
But I don't understand.
Be silent when your elders are talking.
But there's...
And you won't be thrown into the pit of scorpions and worms as it practices to say.
But Aunt Bertha, there's giant ants, and they're coming up to me.
They're coming up to the house real fast.
Oh, who cares about those?
They must be going a hundred miles an hour.
Oh, those do seem to be rather large ants, Billy.
We'd better get off the porch and go inside.
There's a bee gone high on the porch.
Oh, those ants are getting high out there on the porch.
Oh, my.
That's against the law.
The police department is investigating allegations that several officers, while on duty,
engaged in questionable sexual activity with a woman.
They call Aunt Bertha the star of the frozen north.
That's the other room over here.
In fact, I can take the phone in there.
Here, you can listen to it.
Exactly how many officers are suspected of malfeasance is unclear.
There you go.
But police chief John Cornkernel confirmed there is more than one,
and sources close to the investigation say there were at least 36 officers
who had repeated sex with the aged woman who lives in North America.
According to the woman's sister, Tant Bertha,
nearly 50 officers had repeated relations with the woman,
though not all the encounters occurred while the officers were on duty.
And not all of them occurred simultaneously.
But the situation had been going on for up to 10 years,
and the woman was extremely tired and wished to stop.
Sources say she liked to be around police officers
and was even called a police groupie by groups of radioactive rodent hamsters.
That was really something.
What are we seeing in the movie drone movie theater?
This is the...
I've seen this before.
It's a trailer for the Big Aunt Bertha production they're doing up in Ontario.
Oh, I've heard that has the latest state-of-the-art special effects.
Yeah, they've hired Industrial Light and Magic to do them,
and they're using the same nuclear reactor that they used to shoot the Abyss,
and they're building the bathtub there,
and they're putting, I believe it's 650 million gallons of cocoa butter in it,
and then they're lowering down this big hydraulic Aunt Bertha
that Dino De Laurentiis made.
Cuckoo for cocoa butter, eh?
And in the article that I saw, there was a picture of Mel Gibson
straining on a crowbar dressed up as Billy, and he just doesn't look like him.
Yes, Mel Gibson essays the role of Billy in this film.
Yeah, it's just, well, you know, they had to get a name for the Billy part,
because they know that I can bring people in.
Nobody's heard of Aunt Bertha!
Now, these clips that we're seeing are rough footage.
This is not the way the finished film will appear in the theater.
Oh, okay, good. Yeah, because I don't know if I can really support
the way the Aunt Bertha character acts.
Well, look at that. That looks pretty good.
Yeah, I guess it does, but still, I mean...
That's jerky animation, jerky.
Yeah, what happened there? The pin registration went out.
Well, we'll just use it anyway, because it costs so much.
Well, you know, they could have done all that.
They built this go-motion Aunt Bertha thing that weighed 74,000 pounds,
which was kind of big. I think they should have only made it...
Pulled the Japanese into pain for her, too.
...double scale.
Yeah, well, this scene right here is where Aunt Bertha is turning someone into a pillar of fire,
and you'll notice they're using computer-generated imagery.
Nice.
And she's using a little bit of morphing to turn the person into a pillar of fire,
and she says that that's just like what happens to Zen Taff in the Ballad of Zen.
Morphine? Good God, these Hollywood rocksters are sick, sick, sick.
Sure is nice.
I hope you like this story, boys and girls.
If you would like a free picture of me and the nude,
write to Aunt Bertha, dial a story,
Box 666.
Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Goodbye now, children.
I'm checking out over Jordan to that great red dome in the sky.
From my perch up in heaven, I'll keep an eye on all you little dirt balls down there.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I remember for those who'd like a free can.
Oh!
What the hell is that?
Let's just do the new Bible sitting down.
We didn't have a pulpit or anything.
We'll do the whole, we'll do a two-hour radio show and the Bible.
Why?
Oh, man!
Okay, sorry to take Jimmy out again.
We were just given a donation here.
A little 10-cent used book,
The Professional Career of Arnold Palmer.
Now, some of, it sounds like many of you here are familiar with the,
the first of the sacred schisms from the Church of the Subgenius,
which is called the Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society.
And they have a copy of this book.
Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.
They have a copy of this book as well.
Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.
And they discovered, just as we did.
My kids, Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer.
Okay, now here.
No, this is the way you read this.
If there is such a thing,
as getting off to a roaring start in golf,
Arnold Palmer did it in 1960.
Before the Masters rolled around in April,
he had won four tournaments.
The Palm Springs Golf Classic,
the Texas Open,
the Baton Rouge Open,
and the Pensacola Open.
Okay, here it is.
The crowd went wild,
and one can only imagine how great Arnie felt.
The crowds that followed him,
followed this almost mystical figure,
form what has been best described as Arnie's Army.
Oh, Arnie, sorry.
And no army ever had more loyal soldiers.
Boy, you know.
Wow.
If I had that little miniature bleeding head of Arnold Palmer,
I could launch it here.
But, but, this is not the time.
The time is not yet for the arisal of the launching of the head.
It says here that there was a point
that they believed that Palmer was washed up.
Palmer was washed up on the seas of Mars,
where he was found in a basket
by the kings of Atlantis who taught him
to hit the sacred ball with the sacred nine iron.
And there's a connection there, friends.
Nine irons equals nine inch worms.
And as it says in Prescriptures 5.16,
inside Bob's head is the same thing that's inside those golf balls.
As every kid knows,
when you cut open golf balls,
you cut open Bob's head with a little pocket knife,
first you come to a lot of rubber bands,
millions of compressed rubber bands.
But deep inside those rubber bands
is a little black marble-sized rubber ball.
But inside that rubber ball
is the deadliest poisonous acid known to man.
And if a kid cuts into that,
now you kids here, you pay attention.
If a kid cuts into that little rubber ball,
this acid drips out.
It'll burn a hole through a spaceship hull.
It'll burn all the way to China,
except that it enters equilibrium
at the center of the Earth.
There's a whole lot of little golf,
the oil from golf balls is like gathering up
at the center of the Earth,
someday to drive the Nazi flying saucers out.
And you know, kids,
if you pick up a hamster by its tail,
its eyes will fall out.
Go ahead and try that at home.
We'd say don't wait for the stuntman.
Just, you see him do it on the movies?
You can do it too.
Go ahead.
We say legalize drugs and abortion
to weed out the humans.
As Bob said, abortion is murder,
but it's murder in self-defense.
And Bob believes in retroactive abortions
up until the age of, say, 50.
If it's not a subgenius by then,
it's merely a human.
It's never going to develop.
Terminate it.
As for the drugs,
let those whining sissies wipe themselves out
if they can't handle it.
I don't like drugs.
No, please.
Let them sell that stuff to each other
until, like, you know,
it's a good riddance factor.
Here, have some Tylenol and some Jack Daniels.
Aren't drugs bad?
Calm down, honey.
Those drugs will go away soon.
Yeah, oh, maybe you shouldn't have taken some today.
Maybe...
Okay, well, this usually is the song that we play,
like, when we go out and pray.
But we come back out afterwards honest.
And then we play...
We usually play more songs.
Of course, tonight we might be kind of scared.
We might not want to leave after this song.
We might just stay here and keep playing
for fear that you will leave.
But if Reverend Stang was with us today,
we're supposed to come up here and launch ahead.
At least that would give us temporary respite.
Then we could go back there and clap
a whole bunch of blues.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Even despite the fact
that we have only the little tiny golf club
in Reverend Stang's complicit game,
we do have the two things necessary.
We've got to get a club, a little tiny club.
And we have...
We do have St. Changer Hypercreek.
Oh, here he is.
Here he is.
You said you're sorry, and now you apologize.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I won't get into this with you now.
I'm not going to do this again.
What are you talking some Pat Trevino ?
Are you just bowing your knees to me?
Are you just bowing your knees to Lucifer?
Is that what you're saying?
Are you saying that you're a Trevino head worshiper?
I never had a Trevino head.
I've never lost a Trevino head, but I would.
Oh, yeah, I bet you would.
Oh, yeah, I saw you smoking that Sam Snead head that night.
Mm-hmm.
That was a demagnetized head.
I can't get off on a demagnetized Trevino head.
What is this?
I don't know.
Some of it's like decaffeinated coffee, you know.
I was trying to get off a magnetized Palmer head.
Some people have to get a demagnetized Trevino head.
It's just, you know, I mean, I'm sorry.
I respect where you're coming from, but I hope you'll honor the fact that I'm beating your face in with a pair of brass knuckles.
I mean, if that's your thing, man.
I mean, I see you just as a modern-day Lucifer promoting a Sodom and Gomorrah.
I launched one Trevino head once.
Okay, I admit it.
Yeah, and one leads to another.
Oh, just one more.
Just let me launch one more Trevino head.
He said, day after day, the Trevino head rehabilitation center.
Oh, just give me one more Sam Smead head to snort.
Oh, and it was only cut 20% with the ground-up glass and the comet.
Oh, no, no, look.
There's ranchers lined up, and I'm sure there's probably people who'd love to make a witness.
Look, they come here.
They want to see you, Dan.
You know, one of these days, you're going to be in a...
A stadium surrounded by cheering Christians with your head on the block.
And that guillotine blade will come down probably to the beat, the demonic beat of some Christian rock music.
And you know what the heck?
It lives for another 12 seconds after it's chopped off.
You'll still be alive before the blood stops flowing to your brain long enough to...
Maybe you'll just be seeing the inside of the basket for the last 12 seconds.
Or maybe your eyes will roll around seeing the blade smeared with your blood and row upon row of Christians.
Oh, is this...
Of blood and wildness.
Oh, is this slack?
Is this slack he fought as his head landed in the basket?
Or perhaps, maybe, possibly, this is what those comedians, those satirists, the Church of the Subgenius were talking about when they talked about the conspiracy.
When they talked about evil.
When they talked about a modern-day corporate...
Sodom and Gomorrah.
Yes, we stand with Robert Tilton.
We stand with Jerry Falwell.
We stand with Jimmy Swigert.
We stand with a finger of hate, a righteous hatred of modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah.
We can launch the head.
We will launch the head.
We must launch the head.
We shall launch the head.
Where is the head?
Bring forth the head.
I'll burn your eyes.
At least not a month.
The head.
No arms.
No legs.
Not a single bone in his body.
By the time you've seen the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, you'll thank your lucky stars you're all in one piece.
If you don't throw up your money for the Washington.
If I had to launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?
If I had to launch the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer one more time, I'll vomit.
Of course, a lot of people vomited the first time I launched the head.
That's beside the point.
What about the T?
What about the T?
What?
The role of the actor.
What about the P?
I'm not talking about the T. I'm talking about the P.
The role of duct tape, sir.
The sacred role of duct tape.
The sacred role of duct tape.
Yea, in power.
For he who was once called me shall not be known as thee, who was later found to be called Blee.
And he was called Glee, later being involved in the later swing of John Lennon.
But that's the false prophet's interpretation.
But what of the club?
What about the fact that the Greyhound bus station, owned by the conspiracy, treats you like dirt?
I mean, when they said, leave the writing to us, I didn't know they meant they were going to take a dildo and sodomize me.
Lost my luggage and lost the sacred nine iron.
But wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It was a miracle caused by the one and only Susie D'Fluzzi that she would be ordained on this night to have given Reverend Ivan Stein this combination bottle opener, seven inch bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, Launcher Society.
Launcher, a miracle of God.
Praise God.
Praise God.
And look at that.


Oh, for the head was covered in the beard of Milwaukee light.
Milwaukee's beast.
The light, the light of the beard cannot be lost.
You're an amateur failure.
I'm a professional.
For the head was turned upside down and mocked for a thousand years by the conspiracy, by the Trevina.
But we shall make it whole again with the beard of Milwaukee's light.
Milwaukee's beast.
We've already had seven.
It's prostitution.
It's prostitution, baby.
I can't do it.
I can't.
It was funny 10 years ago.
Oh, yeah.
It wasn't really funny then.
Launch the head.
Oh, yeah.
Let's have some more surreal humor brought up.
There's no life left in any of this.
It was no longer funny 10 years ago.
No, no.
Don't do it.
Okay, we're not going to launch the head after all.
Sorry.
The head lays.
The head lays filled with fear.
Thank you for coming.
We appreciate it.











We're not going to do it again.
Watch the head.
Watch it.
Watch it.
Heel head back.
Bleeding head good.
Heel head back.
Bleeding head good.
Heel head back.
He's testing the wind.
It looks like he's flying.
Bleeding head good.
Heel head back.
Bleeding head good.
Heel head back.
We're talking big money, friends.
Big money.
You know what a human soul is worth?
About 5,000 bucks, man.
That's exactly...
You are very close.
It's $5,631.
Is it going right?
I'm using it.
But it's made up of...
A Japanese soul is slightly more valuable right now.
But isn't it made up of 97% water?
A soul is made up of...
No, no.
No, that's atherogastric.
No, the soul is actually made mostly of hair.
That's a little-known scientific fact,
but it's like the horn of the rhinoceros or the fingernail.
Oh, it's very rare.
It's hair.
It's a calcified rhomboid.
I would like to trade my soul for stangs.
You want to change your soul for Reverend Stang?
I'm going to make a trade.
I'm going to have to talk to my boss man about that soon.
I want to make a trade.
But you'll be seeing him soon enough, I have a feeling.
X.
X.
X.
Well, I'll tell you, my soul's in hocks so deep,
and I wish I could get it out.
I wish there was a way.
But I know that they're not going to cash it in,
like yours, for instance.
No.
Well, in judgmentary days...
It'll probably end up being a paperweight or something.
You're sold up?
Huh?
You're sold up?
Sold up, man.
You're sold up and sold out.
On that final judgmental day,
when everyone accuses you of power beyond your own,
which you don't really have,
and say you've been using like a form of witchcraft.
Witchcraft!
I say, man, it's power slack.
That's what Bob...
What's Bob done for me?
He's locked?
Bob can bring...
Bob can bring...
Can give you power, friend.
Power.
And that's what you want.
Because you know, if you had power,
then you could have the money.
You could have the Tootsie Rolls.
You could have everything.
You could have all you ever dreamed of.
If you just had the power.
Would you bet the right number on the lotteria?
That's all they really want is power.
Power.
Would you bet the right number on the tray pack?
And that is what Bob can give you.
Bob can give you vast, unthinkable power.
Entire planets of your own to do with as you will.
Ha, ha, ha.
And surprisingly enough, it's not even very expensive.
Only $30.
Appaltrance, appittance, appaltrance.
It's only appaltrance and pittance to have your own planet.
And it comes with...
Now.
Triple your salvation or eternal money back.
He's speaking cockabomblian.
Cockabomblian spy.
Kill him.
Look for the flame.
It's one of the old callers.
That's soul.
That's used soul.
Man, the exus won't take stepped on soul, dude.
Isn't the next step...
They can tell the difference.
Isn't the next step from speaking in tongues spontaneous combustion?
Well, now, that's what we try for.
That's what we've been trying to do all this time is work up enough of a fit.
That you just rupture right there.
Premature rupture.
You know, you're fully immaculated in a ball of flame.
Man.
How do you know an exus when you see one?
They can look like anything.
You'll be able to tell by their halos and wings.
And white robes.
But are they good or are they bad?
And pitchforks.
I know, I know, I know.
You keep saying this over and over.
Are they the good guys or the bad guys?
They're coming here to cause some inclement weather.
They're going to really, really disadvantage us, I must say.
Are they the good guys or the bad guys?
I think that would be rather a moot point.
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
He's looking at his watch.
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
Mr. Cowboy Dave, this is Wes from the West Coast.
Oh, yes.
You're on the hair phones.
The Reverend Ivan Stinky is here in the studio, too.
I'll be damned.
You are damned.
I know that.
We're all damned.
Every one, two, three, four people in this studio.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Every one person out there in San Francisco, as you used to like to call it in Baghdad by the bay, is damned right now.
In the obnoxious year 1990, or in the least obnoxious and least innocuous of all years, in the summer tawdry time of 1998, in the time this season when men and women dance and frolic in midsummer's hopes and aspirations, the death knoll, the town.
The knoll?
The bell will toll.
And when the bell tolls, you better not pick it up.
Ask not for whom the head is launched.
The head is launched for thee.
No, it was launched for Jane.
Oh, I thought it was launched for thee.
No, that's the cosmic version.
I'm tired of that cosmic stuff.
I am, too.
I'm into the just down-to-earth bacon and eggs, meat and potatoes.
Rubbing sandpaper all over your nipples and your chest.
Yeah, good old...
Good old time prairie squid loving...
Coffee and lemon pie.
Oil and...
Oil?
Yeah.
I forgot.
You know, peanuts and Coca-Cola of old days.
Goobers and chomping on the egg and chomping on yourself.
Yeah.
I'm sick of plastic cards.
I'm sick of pulling up behind gas stations and punching into, like, little concrete monoliths
and having...
Pieces and eunuchs and...
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, I'm sick of it.
I hate that stuff.
I hate that stuff.
And I hate when people pull up behind you in some monstrous vehicle that was never meant
to be.
Fueled by beings which may or may not have existed based on someone's own Freudian preclusion.
Or some Velikovsky nightmare.
When the whole time we could be space-traveling billionaires.
We could be eating fried chicken in the park.
Yeah.
We could be...
That burns me up, man.
I...
What does?
What you just said.
I can't...
All those dwarfs in the trucks and everything.
Yeah, all the dwarfs in the trucks and the times...
Hey, you guys sound like idiots.
It's getting hot in here again.
No!
Take me to a poopy and I'm praying for some pain!
Dave, what is this hegemonic game?
What is it about you?
It's that the hoo sound is from the Yeti.
Home is the wimpy, laid-back universe sound.
Hoo is the true Yeti sound.
Hoo!
Hoo!
What it's like having a roadie.
What it's like having a roadie.
So tied together, this game that you think is film based, isn't.
Hang it!



What a great idea!
Spirited away!
By Y'all Iitable.
Sub indo.
Every Host's Discover, Chef Aaron.
Highole Imperfect!
Celeste!
beaut aka.
Yeah, right, right, Dave. That's right.
Yeah.
Do you want some weed?
Would you like some lemonade stuff?
Ma'am?
Just give me the keys to the truck.
Huh?
Just give me the keys to the truck and the gun.
I've been driving so long, I...
What?
It's okay, David.
There, thanks.
Fits very good.
Now, uh...
Huh?
Princess, we will escort you to your hive chamber.
Do I have to go in there?
For reprogramming.
I have to go in the hive thing again?
Put on these shackles.
But I can't remember all this stuff.
I go in there and I just...
All right.
Be careful while I clamp them on.
Okay.
Oh, my feet.
Do I have to wear these things?
I can't stand that sound.
What's with the guns back there?
Yep, his gun still works.
Too bad about his mind.
What's the wrong time to do it?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ugh.
Good.
I wish I had the...
We've got...
We've done...
We've done hour of slack shows
that we probably could be sued for
by the families of people who lost their minds
because their kids thought,
I know I'm gonna take acid
and watch a subgenius show today.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
It's either that or Fantasia.
Meanwhile, their soul is being scooped
into this little metal canister.
You know, like...
You know, like Reiki, the way Reiki...
Has anybody ever had Reiki done to them?
No.
He takes the pain out of your body,
but that's what...
That's what we do.
Well, yeah, except that we use real reiks,
and it's called acubiting.
Dear friends, you've heard of acubiting.
It's merely transferal of pain.
You have a headache?
We'll take that sledgehammer and hobble your ankles.
You won't think about that headache again.
That's an old one, actually.
I think the Scientologists use that.
Bhagwan Rajneesh.
What's his name?
Stephen King is a secret.
He's the head of the Church of Scientology.
Stephen King is a Scientologist?
No.
Secret head of it, yeah.
He's running it now.
He handed the banner to him.
Well?
It's just a rumor I'm starting to...
I made it up.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Well, yeah, I heard about the colostomy bag
in Frank Sinatra.
Okay.
Oh, oh, oh!
Shh!
Man, I get in trouble for that one.
Presenting, dear friends,
Reverend Susie Thub-Blizzy,
also known as Lois Coleman,
dear God, Mayor.
A lady just met a man





in the room.
Stand up!
What kind of gentleman are you?
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.
The lighting just went off.
And right there is where the tape ran out,
not only on my video camera,
but also on Reverend Bob Payne's excellent recording.
So we're going to have to pick up
Reverend Susie Thub-Blizzy
right in the middle of her rant
at the Atlanta Phenomicon,
backed by none other than the Swimmin' Man.
Swinging love corpses.
Let's see what, uh, yeah, what the...
Incidentally, I wanted to apologize
for the terrible little edits
that sound like this.
In the middle of this tape,
we're trying to deal with new equipment.
This is actually the best recorder we have.
Unfortunately, it's not a very good editor.
And maybe for next week's show,
we can work around that somehow.
Mm, yes.
So let's get back to Reverend Susie Thub-Blizzy.
Cut and all.
Too bad you can't see her, my friends.
Hey!
And if you can look Bob in his half-toned eyes
and tell him you don't have the time for slack,
ha! Try it.
Try it, you can.
Oh.
Yeah, Bob and slack.
Slack is so many things.
Slack is an element.
It's a food.
You need a regular amount of slack in your life.
And the conspiracy cuts your slack off.
And please keep away with it,
throwing it over your head, just out of your reach.
Well, Bob is gonna fan that slack right down
in your green-and-go-fingers, kids,
because you need it.
You need it.
It's not enough that they take their slack away.
They don't even use it.
It's just enough for them that you don't have it anymore.
Oh, but it's us and them.
And thanks to Bob, I know what lies are wrong now.
Oh.
Oh.
Tension deficit can be a wonderful thing.
You know, sometimes when there's the wrong kind of stupidity
in your life, it is your duty to go out there
and get more of the right kind of stupidity back into it.
If your life is making too much sense,
you're f-----.
You're living your life.
You're living proof that you don't have to have sense to survive.
I'm not senseless.
I'm sense-free.
Yes!
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Sometimes you just haven't been slapping them in the face,
wagging your weirdness enough.
It's your job to get back out of there.
Oh, Bob.
Oh, Bob.
You don't have your feet angry, Bob, sometimes.
But, Bob, sometimes,
you'll stand on your feet,
hold you down,
and breathe in the fumes from that pipe.
Oh.
Yeah, and you know what Bob told me?
Bob told me,
you have the right to remain slapped.
Oh, let the sleeping dogs beat the dead horses.
Guns don't kill people.
Girls kill people.
You can get more flies with honey than with vinegar,
but you can get all of the flies with slaps.
Oh.
Oh, the conspiracy drove me to madness
and then charged me 22 cents a mile for the trip.
Bob called me.

I lost only pennies a day.
And you have any idea of the street value of pure, uncut slap?
Oh.
But I'm so glad there is Bob.
He is here to justify our sins,
to be sincere to your sins.
Don't give him a wallow in them.
Oh, please.
Would you rather be separated like a fool from his money,
or would you want to be separated from,
like the wheat from the chaff?
It's your choice, and you can make it by accepting Bob.
Or, if you'd like to swing the other way,
there's always Connie.
The eternal sex ceramic goddess.
Tara's vulva.
The wet spill on aisle five.
This church has all sorts of convenient protuberances
and orifices to fit your particular faith needs.
It's a faith that's strong enough to sit on.
And praise Reverend Susie the floozy.
Uh, the...
Oh, yes, and the swinging love corpses.
We'll have to come back to that next week
when we have a better editing machine, we hope.
And because it's now time to give you addresses, dear friends,
so get those pencils ready.
Uh, because I'm going to give you the addresses of those
whose tapes we've been playing, at least some of those.
Um, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz can be reached for tapes
via ESO radio at Box 14776, Cleveland 44114, Cleveland, Ohio, dear friends.
And, uh, let's see, the Rudy Schwartz Project can be reached, uh,
at Joe Newman at P.O. Box 4542.
Austin, Texas at 78765.
I hope you have your tape recorders running.
And, uh, uh, the Phineas Narco tapes, uh,
he has many edited tapes of the Puzzling Evidence Dr. Howell KPFA show.
You can reach Phineas Narco, uh, at P.O. Box 1247.
Box 1247 in San Jose, California.
That's 9510.
And, of course, dear friends, even though we have physically moved
to a new studio, uh, the sacred post office box of the Hour of Slack,
Bob, and the Church of the Subgenius remains at
Post Office Box 140306
in lovely Dallas, Texas, 75214.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
And we'll be back next week, I guess, with, uh,
probably quite a bit of Phineas Narco's edits of the Puzzling Evidence show.
Uh, for you, it'll be next week.
For me, it's only the next take.
Uh, thank you.
So, honey, get right with Bob.
Because since I got right with Bob, now I count my age and slack years.
That's right!
Yes!
Oh, caution!
I pray for slack.
I heart my slack.
I'll give up my slack when they pry my cold, dead fingers off it!
This bar is protected by slack.
I get my kicks on Route 666, and there's no slack limit there.
Oh, so don't just expect the worst.
Do what you can to make it.
When you get the worst, make the most of it.
Look at life through the rose-colored glasses.
And give your life up to Bob.
It's the best thing you'll ever do.
Yes, it is!
Thank you.
Whoo!

Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
