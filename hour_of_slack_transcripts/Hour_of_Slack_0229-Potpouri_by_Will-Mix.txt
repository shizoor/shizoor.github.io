Coming soon to a station near you, the radio program that was so scary, so frightening,
so utterly terrifying that you won't believe your ears, and for good reason.
Because if you did believe your ears, you wouldn't believe you were believing them.
It will raise your hair white, it will cause cardiac arrest and produce nightmares for your children,
even if you don't have any. It's hideous side effect, or to graphic or speak up publicly.
Hear the horror, feel the fear, touch the terror, and know the nightmare that others can only imagine in their most dreaded dreams.
You are about to participate in a great adventure.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.
The Subgenius Hour of Swag that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station...
And only in the city of...
So that any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device.
Being inhaled during broadcast.
Small animals or other children becoming exposed to the ultra-high or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies
constantly scanned throughout our program should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.
Here is your host...
It's the Will of Dobbs tonight.
The show itself can begin.
Yes.
Yes.
Oz is over the rainbow.
God is an astronaut.
And the Hour of Slack is where the monsters live.
That movie didn't really play long enough for any of you to know where that's coming from anyway.
So tonight it's going to be that potpourri, that mix you love so well.
God, actually, if I had my choice, I think I'd just let this play for a while.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

But of course, I can't do that.

Alarm Santa Fe parents met again with elementary school officials last night to discuss the growing presence of Bob in the schools.
Bob, the deity of the Dallas-based Church of the Subgenius, is a comic book character who communicates with aliens and worships money.
Parents and teachers complain that the Bob stickers and pamphlets, which have turned up in school laboratories with increasing frequency, encourage troublemakers and weird behavior.
It's not healthy for the children. I'm convinced of this.
There has been a pamphlet going around, a Bob pamphlet that I have looked at, and it's the least well-adjusted children, really.
It tells them that if they are uncomfortable with their classmates, it is because they are better than their classmates.
Can you imagine this? Better. Not smarter, mind you, but better.
Lies up!
¶¶
The dark building told it was real funny.
We don't call the devil your friend, are you?
Your dreams are true.
Go ahead.
Their little excuse is dull like fun.
You make fun of the major.
Let's go spend the night in a haunted house.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go mess around.
Let's go make a face.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.





Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.








I want to show my mom this.

Do you want to rise or stand?
Weird men arise!
Find out who they are and how to smash them!
You probably already knew that the US government is a sham.
Something propped up there for you to blame.
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?
That they are actually shambling, unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?
Yes!
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet!
Defy the sinister star forces which mock us all.
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years.
God has been misquoted all this time!
His actual words may disturb you,
but Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind.
God is thirsty for souls and standard man's help.
And to serve him, he's given holy slings and arrows.
He must have been just a voodoo Wizard forですね
thin��는 towarducheo
The U.S. should perpetuate the systolic struggle
to shaming these all Felix Byrds with false promises of freedom,
whereas in 하나 translated King Timothy,

He's going... There goes his heartbeat!
Look! We're losing him! Do something! My God!
What happened, boss?
What happened, boss?
The doctors for Bob helicopters, the doctors for Bob helicopters, shooting the doctors for Bob airport landed at 9.30.
Oh, my God!
Oh, the doctors for Bob army started firing the doctors for Bob helicopters until it was all gone.
They kept fighting him and fighting him. They keep fighting him and fighting him. Fighting him and fighting him.
They keep fighting him and fighting him and fighting him.
The doctors, the doctors…
Then they shooted down the bomb.
Blew up.
They kept shooting.
There.
That's the end.
That's a lot of stuff.
Now you can sing a song.
Going where?
Bob said he'd like to go to the meeting with us tonight.
Well, now he wouldn't like to go.
So we got a few things to do together, my son and me.
We won't be late.
Look, don't let him talk you into doing nothing you don't want to do, Bobby boy.
You want to sit around all evening with a bunch of religious nuts?
Or how about that little ride we was talking about?
I really think you'd get a lot out of this personally, Bob.
I really think you'd get a lot out of this personally, Robert.
What's all the noise out there?
Would you shut up?
The preacher man here is trying to take money.
He's trying to get Bobby off to save his soul.
Well, ain't that nice.
Look, fella.
I got enough problems without you turning my boys against me.
That religion stuff is for softheads.
And my boys ain't soft.
Get in here, Bobby, and tell your friend to go whistle.
Don't let him make you do anything you don't want to, Bob.
Get my money back.
First of all, check out my

Whatever opens up the door.
There's some psychomen here.
They see them, and the other models have it.
The voices are designed to trigger themselves, same voices in your head, your own head, generating those voices.
Guess what? It's gonna be a while before you can turn them off.
It's gonna be a little while before you can turn them voices off.
Take your headphones off now.
Oh, quick, take them headphones off.
Oh, go ahead.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, kid.
Hey, you think it's all legal?
Oh, yeah, we go get a W-2.
I play it for my friends.
You've convinced yourself.
You possess.
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.
Little realized, even by leading scientists, there are really two races.
Actually,
two distinct species of so-called human beings.
If you gaze upon any given street, normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary looking crowd on an ordinary day, a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person is a genius or not.
None or that carries the rare subgenius gene.
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe.
A new dimension, coexisting, not always in harmony, alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.
Now at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads.
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads.
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,
Behold us!
For we are the subgeniuses.
Behold us! For we are the subgeniuses.
There you go.
You brought the guitars in.
We made him 8.9 thousand kz.
We're playing skull drums.
We made him 8.9 thousand kz.
We closed the garage somehow.
We had all our hands on him.
We had all our hands on him.
Every time that we'd get some swag bathroom on the CD, we'd have to get behind him.

Now these are the funniest days in the darkness.
I'm glad even the carnivores get over it or die for you.
I get sad when I see you going to hospital.
Tell those guys, those are my best friends.

Go, go, make sure you talk with your hero best friends around.
Tell them all about me.

All right.
Alejandra!
So as you can see, my life was pretty well messed up.
It's just, it's just the Lord that some of you caught me when I wasn't stoned out of my head.
I think the thing that got to me most was that, with me, everything was wrong.
But you showed me love.
Is it worth it?
A man might live with an alcoholic.
A man might live with a dope addict.
This man could live with his wife, but not his wife's habit.
People whisper, it's unnatural.
His wife's habit is tormenting, never sleeps.
Her habit leads her to dangerous places.
And under the influence of the devil, she's a woman.
Unrestrained pleasures.
Yes, people whisper, it's unnatural.
A habit born of reckless passion.
His wife's habit is tenderness and violence.
His wife's habit compels her to convert others.
Even her young, innocent daughter.
When you see his wife's habit, be ready to feel a sensation too startling to describe.
We're going to tune you in onto what's happening.
Now this here is called the The Man Who Made Me.

It's called A Joint.
In a world where drugs were the only gods, she couldn't say no.
I may be a junkie, Rich, but I'm no fool.
Weekend with the Babysitter.
A film that shows that communication is more than just words.
A motion picture that hits home.
Maybe your home.
I can see you, you can see me as we stand.
We can live forever, God, and God is wonderful.
Here they are.
The hippies.
The mind blowers.
The pot smokers.
The psychedelic dropouts.
They're the Cosmo Changers.
Reaching for everything.
And wantonly giving love.
Becoming the world's greatest.
Becoming a citizen of a weird new world.
Of voluptuous visions.
Debauched delights.
And bizarre sensualities.
Reality is a bad trip.
Love is beautiful.
People raise their voices.
Don't get caught in that mess.
Like a fly in a spider's web.
Is it true more is less?
Herded like a happy flock.
To the big TV slaughter.
Why don't you break that leash?
Something happened to her seat.
It's a new generation.
It's a hallucination.
It's a mystic vibration.
It's just intimidation.
It's the will of the people.
It's the church with the steeple.
It's the sacred devotion.
To our plan of denotion.
People raise their voices.
Becoming the world's greatest.

When your friends and your neighbours push.
Why don't you push them back?
Don't you think the time has come.
To stand up and be heard?
Ain't no use to try and wait.
For the magic word.
It's a new generation.
It's a new passion.



It's a new perpetuation.
It's a beautiful body.
Both erotic and deadly.
It's the fear of the future.
It's resurgence and suture.
It's a spandex obsession.
It's a lasting impression.
Feel the power.
Feel the power.
That's the power.





Baptized in electronic water.
Honorable sons and beautiful daughters.
With smiles and bows and rosy cheeks.
And a righteous path.
Do you feel the power?
Do you feel the power?
The voice sounds reassuring.
Completely thorough and so alluring.
It's lived a thousand times before.
And seen the world through soul to soul.
The calmness and tranquility.
That oozes credibility.
With wisdom and confidence.
To see the screen of common sense.
And it makes you feel just like a babe. Daddy holding you tight.
Alright, that is my say with you tonight.
Now he's got you by the balls.
He can sell you anything and all.
From morality to diamond rings.
To genocide to magazines.
From religion to cosmology.
To the end of a democracy.
It's a new generation.
It's divine inspiration.
Always ready to follow.
Never willing to swallow.
All the doctors, doctors, doctors.
All the prescriptions.
All the mystic inscriptions.
It's a standing succession.
It's a lasting impression.
It's a calm invitation.
Of a tranquilized patient.
It's a hallucination.
It's a new generation.
It's a young generation.
it's a new generation.
It's a new generation.
It's a new generation.
It's a new generation.

Ah, yes, and that was Oingo Boingo.
I got my ticket.
Uh, so we've...
I was going to try and tell you what all we've been listening to,
but, you know, I haven't...
I haven't been able to keep up because our phone's been just
ringing off the hook tonight, friend.
Well, I think that's all the business I'm going to get today,
so unless you have something to buy or sell...
Actually, I do have some business to conduct with you.
You do?
I would also like to make a loan.
But...
You have $15,000.
That belongs to the Burns family.
I need money for something personal.
What will you give me?
Well, it depends. What do you have for collateral?
My soul, and seeing that I am a priest,
that should be worth a great deal more,
like everything you've got, correct?
Incorrect.
You see, priests are the only ones that never pay back their loans.
I can't quite understand it myself,
but needless to say, I don't pay anything for a priest.
They're not worth it.
I guess the devil gets them for free.
Amusing.
Well, if that's all, I guess I'll let you go.
There's one more thing, actually.
Well, there is?
Yes. Do you sell guns?
Guns? Are you blind? They're all over the wall.
No, I mean handguns.
Handguns? Now what would a minister want with a handgun?
Are you putting me on?
I thought your business was business.
What do you care about my purpose?
Whatever you say.
I've got handguns. I've got tons of them.
Here's a display case right here.
I covered it up just before you arrived. See?
Whatever you want.
Got a .38?
Sure, right here.
I'm putting her in the front.
May I see it?
Well, you see with your eyes, not with your hands.
Just kidding. Here, here you go.
Is the safety on?
Well, no. It's unloaded.
Got any bullets?
Look, I'm a pawn shop. I'm not a sporting goods store.
If you want some ammo, there's a shop called Vincent's that's not far from here.
Yes, I know. That's where I got these.
Are they the right type?
Well, those are .38 calibers, but I really wish you wouldn't load the gun in here.
But what harm could I do?
Well, I don't know, but I really wish you'd take those out.
Accidents can happen, especially if you're running with guns.
Oh, I know guns well enough. See? Hold your wrist like so.
Oh, please. Don't aim that thing at me. It might go off accidentally.
Don't worry about it going off accidentally. Worry about it going off deliberately.
What do you mean? You're not trying to scare me, are you?
No, that wouldn't do any good. You'd make promises. But the Prince of Darkness is the King of Lying.
Isn't that right, Mr. King?
What, are you crazy? You're not actually thinking of using that thing, are you?
You're a priest.
The Bible says that.
The Bible says thou shalt not kill. You'd burn in hell if you believed in that sort of thing.
I was wondering how long it would take you to quote the Bible.
Few are as good at manipulating it as the devil himself, and no doubt it's worked up until now.
But I happen to read the Bible myself.
Thou shalt not kill is the King James translation of the Bible.
God's actual commandment, as he stated it in Hebrew, is thou shalt not commit murder.
Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being.
Satan is not a human being.
And it is God's law to send Satan to hell, and that's where you belong.
Return to hell, Lucifer, in God's name!
And deliver us from evil.
You're having a good time tonight, boys, yes, we surely are.
Hello out there in radio land.
Prell here, inviting you to enlist as a soldier in America's war against drugs.
And it's so easy.
When someone offers you drugs, just say, you're under arrest.
That's right, narcotics are illegal in America, and possession and or sale of illegal substances is just a sort of information police want to hear.
Now some of you are saved, but they're my friends.
Baloney!
Friends don't offer friends chemical poisons.
So remember, when the enemy offers you drugs, don't turn the other cheek, turn them in.
You'll sleep much better after doing your civic duty.
A message from this great station, and yours truly, Papa Prell.
Crushing the Curry Corporation.
That's right, and they had to start up again from the very beginning and build themselves up by their own bootstraps.
But that's exactly how Japan won the war.
Well, someone said that they won it, but I hardly gave it any thought.

Any credit?
Uh, I can almost hear my own breath now.
Yes, and they can hear it out in the radio world, too.
They can taste it, too, I imagine.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I really suggest that everyone who's hale and hearty seize a microphone and start the lusty life of the airwaves right away.
Well, Dr. Howell, I've got two microphones in front of me, and I can't hear anything on my headphones.
It's causing incredible distortion and feedback, too.
What a show. What a show.
Here you are, boy.
Yes, it started millions of years ago, of course, back in the Proterozoic Age.
Shows like this were just too good to be true.
Don't we have yet another member of our quorum here at the station?
But where is she? Somewhere wandering out among the corridors, the kickashaws and goo-gaws of KPFA?
No, she's out wandering amongst the, uh...
...the horrible backwoods.
Back alleys of birth. Oh, no, there she is. Okay.
No, you see, I thought Allison would come in and take a seat and join the Quorum of the Stars here on the most exclusive show ever done, secretly famous here on KPFA 94.1 FM on your radio dial.
Wait a minute, Dr. Howell, what do you mean, what do you mean, KPFA? I thought this was K-N-O-N in Dallas, Texas.
You thought this was K-N-O-N, right. Well, but Federal Bureau of Demonology Standards and Practices prohibit us from giving false call letters or illusory or misleading signals.

That's right.
I don't make these rules, I just...
Roger to that, Doctor. Howell.
That's right, we don't want to imperil our status as a non-affiliated broadcaster.
And for that matter, uh, they won't allow the truth to be told either.
Yes, for without tooth there can be no lies.
Now, I suggest we all take a deep breath and take a stress pill and start again. There will be a show later.
As soon as, uh...
As soon as certain planets are in alignment and certain buttercups open their faces to the sun and drops of dew fall on, uh, tiny deformed lizards scuttling through the grass.
There they are now.
In fact, that's a sound effect I'd like to hear again if it's, uh, at all possible.
Oh, there it is, yes. It's really remarkable.
I think you ought to be really careful. That's actually some coffee dripping on the board over there.
Oops, ah, is my countenance crimson.
Well, I, if I only had some carts, I could play Babies Crying, uh, Volcanoes Crying.
But it's, it's, it's a little over-the-top, and I, uh, I think it's a little over-the-top.
But, uh, it seems that the brow, in his haste to be off, left all the records and sound effects and tapes all locked up. But why do we care about that?
All right, let's start the show now.
A dear friends out there, uh, in, uh, Radioland,
It's so good to be here in, uh, among the Bay-Arians. I, I just...
Yes, your Bay-Arian destiny. You must grasp the nettle for your, oh, sorry, pardon me. Go ahead.
I, I, I'd just like to, uh, share something.

I left my wallet in my other pants.
I left my antibiotics at home.
Yeah, let's not get squirrely like John Squirrely and over-antibioticize.
Well, I'd just like all the listeners out there to join in
in something that almost never happens on this show,
that traditional old thing that we do out in Texas and Arkansas
on the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack,
originating from K-N-O-N, which, of course, we really are.
And we'd like you to participate if you could.
And, friends, yes, just join us.
Just bow your heads for a quiet moment of the sacred noise!
Well, that's one way to do a show.
That's one way to do a show right off the air.
Yes, I've both cut off.
I've cut off your microphones because you're just irresponsible,
trying those antics and hijinks here.
Oh, he's no fun.
Look at him there.
His forehead was smoking once those meters peaked.
All right, I've put it back to your peak operating capacity.
Oh, very well.
But don't abuse the responsibility of the airwaves again.
Well, the listeners should have gone to their windows,
thrown them wide open, and announced to the world that, yes,
they were up and they were listening to this show.
Some of them are.
Some of them are.
And I will attempt once again,
to engage these listeners in a dialogue on the air.
But, you know, it's complicated, folks.
I don't know how it works.
So let's see once again if we can talk to these.
Radio dialectic going here.
Your happy eater asks you to bow your heads in silence
for 15 seconds in memory of those who have passed away
while watching our next attraction.
Please bow your heads.
Can we be sure that there is no evil force at work in the world?
No.
Just as there are forces.
For the good.
Nothing you have ever seen before
and nothing you have ever heard before
will prepare you for the shock of...
My baby is black.
The black musicians.
I've never thought of them as being people.
Or were the past, future problems as...
as...
human beings.
That's right.
You see them as machines.
Turn out pleasure.
To make you dance, laugh, sing.
To give you a merry time.
You know, when people go home.
You forget all about them.
Negroes.
There is nothing funny
about a rat.
Rat fate.
They carry on swimming.
But there is also this secret...
A rat saying....
rat affects my life
What is love?
It's torture.
Where are they?
As intelligence spills.

Not.
Oh, yeah.
Chaps, hundreds of them.
This calls for strategy.
Here's yours, bold eggs.
Here, one for you, monkey face.
That boat shop is plenty for all.
Everybody gets one.
In seconds, the fireball erupts into a geyser that towers 25 miles into the stratosphere,
spreading into a hundred mile wide mushroom cloud.
Well, that's that.
Oh, I think this is booming.
Notice how he keeps from moving or from getting up and running?
Believe me, sweetie face, it's a pleasure.
Bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night.
That boat shop is plenty for all.
Everybody gets one.
You'd better get one.
Now, this is a little fun, huh?
Well, it's admittedly, there's a serious problem with the entire church of the subgenius in
that it is, one might say, the joke that dare not speak its punchline.
The light that failed.
The door that closed.
No, but there's yet a light at the end of that tunnel.
Tunnel.
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, the light at the end of the funnel.
Unfortunately, that light, in the case of many of us,
is nothing but a Mack truck coming straight at us.
But that just delivers us into the other world,
where we approach the blinding light of the isness of the beyond world,
which is itself just another giant Mack truck bearing down upon you.
It's perfectly, and the records are here, and the brow is tanked up on coffee.
But friends, we haven't reached that world yet,
and we may never reach it tonight,
because right at this moment, he's driving around Berkeley looking for you.
Yes, you.
He's got his show detector caller, and he's wondering if you're listening.
Who knows?
Oh, what a relief.
Now, can we shut up?
Can we go back to bed now?
Well, we could, in another life.
In another life.
In a better world than this.
But as we wander through life,
aren't we looking for something a little bit better than the usual radio show?
We're struggling. We're struggling.
Certainly, Bob insists on something better than what he's getting so far.
But on the other hand, really, what do you people care about?
Bob, when was the last time you said anything about J.R. Bob Dobbs on this show, Dr. Howell?
Well, I try to, but every time I do, a hairy hand,
reaches over and cuts off my ear.
Or a gun is thrust up into the roof of Bob's mouth.
Yes, or someone shoves a long knitting needle into one of my eyes
every time I mention the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
But now, with the brow out of the picture, we can talk about Bob all we like.
And, friends, who is that man, Bob, if he is indeed a man?
Well, Pastor Stang, let me ask you, wasn't it true that,
he received a divine immaculation by shocking the bee Jesus out of himself
through the back of a TV set?
Why, certainly it is, yes.
On the date of Bob's divine immaculation,
he received not just a 220-volt shock.
From his old Zenith, I might add.
Well, it was actually a television of his own invention.
It was a basic Zenith chassis that he modified with his interoster unit.
It was the moment when Jehovah One, the alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy,
chose to reach down with his stark fist of removal and raise up some mortal.
It could have been any of us.
You, perhaps, but no, Bob was luckier.
And so he became the living avatar of Slack.
It wasn't the first person to be chosen, though.
No.

No, nay.
Three or four others were chosen first, but could not survive the process.
And they became the stunted, malformed growths on the trunk of the tree of Bobly wisdom.
But Bob, due to the special fillings in his teeth, was somehow grounded.
He fumbled himself and became obedient to entropy.
Therefore we praise his name, which is above all others,
so that every tongue shall slave her,
and every knee shall water.
So that we, yes, can drag this show down into the depths.
Down into the bottom of a bottomless pit.
Now I see all you callers are out there trying to call,
but until we receive our word, we're not going to let anyone on this sleepy show.
Just went off.
Just as I thought I was figuring it out.
No, wait, here comes one back again.
So, without further ado.
You might be on the air. Hello?
Hello?
Oops, that was unfortunate.
That caused a glitch in our...
Oops, again, there we have another problem.
Whoops, oh, there went another problem.
Oh my gosh, yet another problem.
Why, the problems are snowballing around here.
Are you sure you can't hear us callers?
I mean, we can't hear you.
Hello, you're on the air.
Radio of the deaf.
Well, fortunately we can offend deaf people,
because this is Berkeley, and they can't complain,
but I must remind you that other minority groups are not to be tampered with,
even here at 4.30 in the morning,
or else we might lose our license according to the Federal Bureau.
But nobody worries about the subgeniuses.
Uh-uh.
No, you can say anything you want about the subgeniuses.
The ultimate minority.
They seem to like it.
The ultimate pressure group, the ultimate splinter group,
are the subgeniuses,
and we have two subgeniuses here in our studio this evening.
Emma Fordyce-Weirbogger,
and Robert,
Ralph Fielding Snell are with us tonight.
Good evening, sir, madame.
Did you appreciate the church air serenade earlier this evening?
Mm-hmm.
And what was it that struck you as the most unique aspect of this ceremony?
The seating arrangements.
Ah, yes, the vinyl seating, the vinyl solution.
Some might call it the vinyl frontier.
The vinyl fullback?
We do.
I'm Seb.
That's right.

You got me looking at life.
You got me searching down overcome.
You got me another life.
You got me looking down on me.
You said I should accept all this
You think it's funny
But what I say is true
The reason that I live like this
Is all because of you
You got me looking at life
You got me searching down the road
You got me all on you
You got me jumping right in front

Look at you with your mouth watering
Look at you with your eyes spinning
Why don't we just admit it's all about you
That's the guy you want
She's just a girl

Ah
And you are still listening to the
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack
For those of you who are used to hearing it this time
Also don't forget
If the show hasn't been terribly self-explanatory tonight
It might get that way before we're all done
You may write for that free information
Wait a minute, listen to the music
Whoa
And that P.O. Box is
Bob at P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas
The zip is 75214
I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to talk
Did you have a problem?
I'm dying
I'm dying
And
I'm dying
And I'm dying
And I'm dying

Waving not
But remain steady
Oh, you say that prop stick was a little too strong for your aim
But I said, well, they dropped the bill
And I'm changing it
I'm not sure I'm having a good time
I'm not going to wait
The sun's out tonight
I'm not going to sleep
Exactly
What are these processes?
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'm dying

I have to carry on
If you're looking for a bus to your old home

This soul water we squeeze down you tastes real good
Even at this moment
Your consciousness is sending emissaries
Fugitives
Fugitive soul consciousness
The citizens arguing in this very moment, arguing with the elder gods.
I think they're civilized. I think they're civilized scientists.
The punishment is summed by your willingness to participate in keeping us afloat just a little bit longer.
It is.
The pro-friend in this instance, fairly well.
Let's have a sip of the accumulation of tiny particles.
What is left is the average subgenus' mental identity.
After quaffing the essence,
I think he's drained almost from the excretions of the body.
As Bob has said,
every penny freely given counts as a molecularly altered percentage.
Another one made ill,
in the eyes of the ill-dressed.
An untoward nomination of your DNA encoding presupposed notions of exactly what you were supposed to tell Bob.
I'm sorry.
I don't think you should say a word to that oso floor at 야.
''Grandpa's dad?''
Well, if you think major ill-espeyeable,


So I better assume he's got modalities in a good and constant version of myself.

Certainly, in retrospect, this now seems to have been our greatest mistake.
So, what is the difference?
Examine this seemingly docile crowd,
and know that in some few, simmering beneath a placid surface,
there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness,
ready at any moment to explode outward, often with catastrophic results.
