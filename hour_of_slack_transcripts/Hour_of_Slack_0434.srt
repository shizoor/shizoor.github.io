1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Eve, it's always the same.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,600
There's no stopping what can't be stopped.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,900
No killing what can't be killed.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,400
We want love! We want love!

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,160
Let me out!

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,520
If you want it, here it is. Come and get it.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:26,500
You are about to experience a full-length subgenius show the way it was meant to be heard.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,740
In full-frequency modulation stereophonic broadcast sound.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,740
So relax.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Three beats per measure.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,940
Sit back.

12
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,480
Exercise one.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,600
And enjoy our feature presentation.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,800
This is the story about the brave men and women in the Church of the Subgenius

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,160
and all the things they did to get themselves evicted from the Hall of Shame and Narcolepsy on Fantasy Island.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,480
But when you get...

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,300
right down to it, good triumphs over evil.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,920
And the forces of light trample into bloody pulp with sickly powers of darkness.

19
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,440
So remember, as we wander through this charnel house, this abattoir we call life,

20
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,420
that even though the future promises nothing,

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,480
destruction looms ahead.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,200
And the end of all joys, old age robs us of everything worth having.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,180
There are some nice things in life, like a shaft of sunlight drifting down...

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,360
down...

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,480
Down the...

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,760
barn.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,720
A

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,040
و

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,720
structures.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:45,880


31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,980
These.

32
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,180
Ores.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,500
..are in...

34
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,920
Well, I guess you bloodsuckers enjoy your impulse, eh?

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,860
You're loyal to the gore.

36
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,880
Well, that's good.

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,760
We don't want to be decked with wood in our fraternity of fright fans.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,140
Is that just right?

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,040
Run!

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,700
Vincent, I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins,

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,720
spinning every corner of my being with the desire to do wrong.

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,020
I feel so bad.

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,600
That's good. Good.

44
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,500
Yes, it is good.

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,480
You are about to experience a totally new dimension in sound.

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,960
No lesser work than the overthrowing of creation itself.

47
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,740
We will remake man in our image, not his.

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,220
Run!

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:02,960
It's just like a...

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,560
Run!

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,080
Front, back, above, below, all around you when you wear headphones.

52
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,520
So, put on your headphones.

53
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,940
You should be hearing me in your right ear.

54
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,680
If not, reverse your headphones.

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,440
You should now be hearing me in your left ear.

56
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,160
So now, sit back and enjoy a new dimension in sound.

57
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,720
It is. Come on, don't confuse people with anxiety.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,880
They're gonna be listening on the radio and probably two people crashed right now as you said that,

59
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,740
thinking, I'm late, I'm late.

60
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,100
Crash.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,760
We talked about doing it. We talked about this show for so long.

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,760
We thought so.

63
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,240
Yeah, just maybe we could make a chance, you know.

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,740
We'll leap up and...

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,460
Are we done?

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,460
Radio.

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,040
EU Radio.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,360


69
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,060
TDM.

70
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Ooh, yeah.

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,800
An old religion, out of date, harmless, tired religion, just lingering along with its dim, hazy, almost forgotten gods.

72
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,740
A perfect setup for the warlords to move in on.

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,100
They made it a place where the people had to listen.

74
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,400
Sell the people ancient nightmares.

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,160
Sell the people ancient hatred.

76
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,440
Play up the bloody fairy tales and pagan superstitions.

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,840
Bring back the mumbo jumbo.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,360
Bring back the mumbo jumbo.

79
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,740
Bring back the mumbo jumbo.

80
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,820
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

81
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,720
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,880
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in his church of the subjeets.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,560
All one sacred family created to rule the whole world.

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,520
Created to rule the whole world.

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,380
Make him bow.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,700
Make him say it.

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
Make her bow.

88
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,480
Make her say it.

89
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,180
Make them bow.

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,240
Make them say it.

91
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,060
Everybody bow.

92
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,420
Everybody say it.

93
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,940
Created to rule the whole world.

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,640
When they've bowed enough, when they've said it enough,

95
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,540
when they've heard it enough,

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,360
they'll begin to believe it.

97
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,960
Tell it to the school kids.

98
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,160
Tell it to the bank clerks.

99
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,880
Tell it to the farmers.

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,340
Then start to drill the school kids.

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,080
Drill the bank clerks.

102
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,780
Drill the farmers.

103
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,720
Warriors of today, they will be the gods of tomorrow.

104
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,280
I am thy captain.

105
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:09,100
The flight thou art making today is the same which Abraham, Moses, John, Peter, Paul, and all of us redeemed before thee have made.

106
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,060
Enoch and Elijah joined us in mid-flight without passing through the gate of death.

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,000
We shall be flying today at altitudes unlimited.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,280
And at a speed never known to thee before.

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,080
Flying time to the New Jerusalem is not considered for thou art now in the realm known as eternity.

110
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Where time is no more.

111
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,740
As we left the earth, the weather was stormy with heavy overcast.

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:47,340
But the report from the New Jerusalem is, as it always will be, a beautiful day without a cloud.

113
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,660
Directly in front of us now, there's a dazzling light.

114
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,620
It must be brighter than the sun.

115
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,640
And it certainly is stirring up some excitement here in the cabin of the plane.

116
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,940
The passengers recognize it as their destination as we get closer.

117
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,060
Where I'll never roam.

118
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,320
I see the light of the sun.

119
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,000
And the city is so bright.

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,820
My home sweet home.

121
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,940
Well done, good and faithful servants.

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,980
Thou hast been faithful over a few things.

123
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,340
I will make thee ruler over many things.

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,760
Enter thou into the subterraneous hour of slack.

125
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,420
To know and to act is one in the same.

126
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,680
The studio, the rule, formula for fame.

127
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,120
Be a winner, self-motivate, read a fashion magazine.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
The more you sell, the more for you.

129
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,560
Be a goal achieving machine.

130
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,420
To know and act is one in the same.

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,740
If you know what's right, do it.

132
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,420
Take control of your customer.

133
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,340
Let her feel your individuality.

134
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,620
Your good taste, you geek.

135
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,560
There's no reason for her to shop department stores and see the same old.

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,340
We ain't McDonald's.

137
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,300
We're special.

138
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,640
Your customer special.

139
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,120
And booze.

140
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,400
Any piece can be done anyway.

141
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,600
Imagine.

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,940
Once you're juiced and rolling, the next sale is so easy.

143
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,980
Energy.

144
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,800
When you're fluid.

145
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,260
Customers feel you've just been to the register.

146
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,460
And they want you too.

147
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,280
Winner.

148
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,980
Lynn welcomes you to spray on some eau de success.

149
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,900
Behind both ears and anywhere else that makes you feel good.

150
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,440
Ooh.

151
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,420
Coordinate the ensemble.

152
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,440
Tie pieces together.

153
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,380
Accessorize.

154
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,000
Mesmerize.

155
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,760
Physicalize.

156
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,660
Accessorize.

157
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,520
Mesmerize.

158
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,380
Physicalize.

159
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,180
There are no limits.

160
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,780
And don't forget follow up phone calls.

161
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,120
Build up clientele.

162
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,940
Make our total experience so special.

163
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,380
We'll come back for more.

164
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,920
More.

165
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,860
The more they spend.

166
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,380
The more they thank you.

167
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,140
You're welcome.

168
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,580
Let this be their fashion clinic.

169
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,400
Dig in.

170
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,040
All for one.

171
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,760
One for all.

172
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,120
The big money to sell is your given.

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,960
Make the magic happen.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,660
Do it.

175
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,580
I'm a winner.

176
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,920
Be a winner.

177
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,640
I know my goals.

178
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,320
I am intelligently aggressive.

179
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,840
I sell from my total knowledge of merchandise.

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,080
Using appropriate adjectives.

181
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,900
I act with an always positive mindset.

182
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,560
The more I sell.

183
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,900
The more I'll have.

184
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:37,920


185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,840
More.

186
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,060
The more I sell.

187
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,120
The more I'll have.

188
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,540
More.

189
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,380
The more I sell.

190
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,000
The more I'll have .

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,440
More.

192
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,300
The more I'll have.

193
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,720
More.

194
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,780
Get it?

195
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,120
Boobs out...

196
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,020
Get it?

197
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,700
Raster eyes...

198
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,460
Wait.

199
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,160
Bring up...

200
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,040
Every time he Gardens the

201
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,040


202
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,900
I can go soup.

203
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:22,660
the thing that makes us really different is how we think what we believe is important

204
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,860
the ways we look at life

205
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,220
we do not just imagine that most people we have to live with or against us

206
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,660
how we think what we believe is important the ways we look at life

207
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,720
real conscious hierarchies which have their real unconscious extensions and their traits by the thousands

208
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,300
the man who nothing can control

209
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:33,660
they are the man who can be considered the man who has the你看

210
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,500
the human being

211
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,500


212
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,500


213
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,500


214
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,500


215
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,820
we do not just imagine it

216
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,880
we have to live with

217
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:37,880


218
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:37,880


219
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:37,880


220
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,420
live with or against us.

221
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,720
I mean, we live with people

222
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
who sold us for things.

223
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,720
The thing that makes us really different is

224
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,760
how we think.

225
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,000
What we believe

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,900
is important. The ways we

227
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,640
look at life.

228
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,060
And thank you

229
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,180
for that. To the Tate

230
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,980
Beatles. Everything they do is

231
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,640
legal here tonight is

232
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,020
public domain.

233
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,300
Do you think it's an accident? And do you think it's an accident

234
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,440
that you tuned in tonight?

235
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,780
You won't know that for a while to come.

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm your host

237
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,340
tonight. The Will of Dobbs.

238
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,280
There should be another host here next

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,120
week. And last

240
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,180
week when I was here,

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,880
I played

242
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,160
a bit

243
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,620
from the Crosley Bendix

244
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,260
series

245
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,820
that we received

246
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,820
on CD from

247
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,460
Negative Land.

248
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,940
Last week, the

249
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,020
subject, I believe,

250
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,940
was technology.

251
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
And this week,

252
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,020
why the subject

253
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,460
will be electricity.

254
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,540
But before we got into

255
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,680
Mr. Bendix's review

256
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,100
tonight,

257
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,820
three people called last week, which for this

258
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,500
show is considerable, wondering

259
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,800
what that was all about.

260
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
And there is a biography of

261
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,840
Mr. Bendix on the CD.

262
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
But the problem is it's actually

263
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,340
on the CD, so I can't really

264
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,020
read it without

265
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,360
holding the CD in my hand.

266
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,640
Once done, it

267
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,560
explains that Crosley Bendix

268
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,360
was born in Canberra, Austria

269
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,100
in 1940.

270
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,580
His father was chief speechwriter for the U.S.

271
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,540
Embassy's Cultural Attaché in Sydney.

272
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,840
His mother was the former toy

273
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,580
Celica of the coastal New Brunswick

274
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,020
Celicas.

275
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,120
And Mr. Bendix attended

276
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
school in Sydney, then returned to the United

277
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,760
States with his father, who fled Austria

278
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,380
under threat of copyright litigation.

279
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,560
In the U.S., Mr. Bendix attended the Andover

280
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,140
Underschool of Arts and Handiwork,

281
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,680
took his degree in social aesthetics from

282
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,720
Montana State College and his Master

283
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,020
of Bachelors from the Marriage Institute of America.

284
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,620
Mr. Bendix first ventured into radio in 1976

285
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,700
when, while lodging a complaint at a radio

286
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,140
station, the person on the air fell over dead

287
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,040
right in front of him.

288
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,680
It was love at first emergency.

289
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,420
Since then, Mr. Bendix has established himself

290
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,160
as America's best loved, no task too big,

291
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,460
social critic of the air.

292
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,560
Mr. Bendix now broadcasts regularly for the

293
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,880
Universal Media Net web, where he is director

294
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,240
of stylistic premonitions.

295
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,740
Unmarried, he lives in Berkeley, California

296
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,000
with The Memories, a group of women who are very popular with their

297
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,580
improvising recollections.

298
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,820
And now, if I may,

299
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,060
Crosley Bendix, the radio reviews, courtesy of Negative Land,

300
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:54,520
and tonight's subject, again, CD player willing,

301
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,040
is electricity.

302
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,100
Stay tuned and thank you for choosing to listen tonight

303
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,920
to The Church of the Subgenius and its

304
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,340
Hour of Slack!

305
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,900
Praise Baha'u'llah

306
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:31,040
And now, Crosley Bendix, cultural reviewer and director of stylistic premonitions

307
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,640
for the Universal Media Net web, with today's Know Your Art if

308
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,000
you want to learn something like this.

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,000


310
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,240
Good hello.

311
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,260
My discussion tonight does not concern any endeavor so trivial to the welfare of humankind

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,500
as the arts.

313
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:02,200
After all, the creation of perceptual titillations and imaginary diversions for the leisure time

314
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:09,240
consumption of our luxury conscious citizens can hardly compare in actual significance

315
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:16,580
to the kind of relentlessly important human invention which has propelled the sciences

316
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,300
to the very top of our societal bell jar.

317
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:32,140
This culture, any culture, does not run on art or the mental one-upsmanship and casual

318
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,180
talk.

319
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:39,700
The calculated pretensions of controversy which characterize the arts today, no, it

320
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,460
runs on two things, oil and electricity.

321
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:51,480
Now the sticky subject of oil and those slippery international manipulations which exist entirely

322
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,420
outside any governmental ability to regulate must remain the crude subject of another power

323
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:58,920
discussion.

324
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,180
Tonight, it is electrical.

325
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,260
Electricity which sparks the relatively short circuits of my brain.

326
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,860
But I'll return to my brain in a moment.

327
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,540
Let me set it right here for now.

328
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:22,400
Have you ever begun to realize how electric living, unique to this century, affects our

329
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,640
knowledge and habits of thought, movement and perception, producing patterns of response

330
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,620
and behavior in our nature?

331
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,280
Have you ever seen a picture of a man in a wheelchair, which has already begun to separate

332
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,160
us in critical ways from the whole of pre-electric human history?

333
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,880
Well, I hope not, because that's a lot of silly technopop thinking with about as much

334
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,660
real juice in it as the 17-volt battery they uncovered in King Tut's tomb.

335
00:18:53,300 --> 00:19:00,100
No, don't be swayed by any modern compulsion to feel thoroughly modern.

336
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,360
What Shakespeare knew is still true.

337
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:14,040
Quote, thy proud filament puts nodding bodkins to yawn while yet our bowling brains be blessed

338
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,140
to see or not to be.

339
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,200
And wasn't it Raymond Chandler who was so fond of shooting the lights out?

340
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,080
Well, the cost of one fictional bullet circa 1949 would buy an entire century of electricity.

341
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,080


342
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,080


343
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,080


344
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,860
The cost of a light is one hour and twelve minutes of precious light for one of today's

345
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,980
underpaid garment workers who must painstakingly embroider bolts of lightning on the backs

346
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,120
of satin jackets in a dark basement sweatshop somewhere on Taiwan.

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,100
But is it art?

348
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:57,720
No, not by any stretch of the definition, not when these jackets can be purchased in

349
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,080
any dim tourist trap in our city of light for a few bucks.

350
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,080


351
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,080


352
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:08,660
And what about import laws versus the need to conserve some of that electric blue mountain

353
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:15,240
water that's getting all dirty as it is forced through the oily conduits of a major hydroelectric

354
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,740
plant?

355
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:25,160
What am I getting at here, if not the inevitable linkup between electricity and our whole society,

356
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,160
whether big or small?

357
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,060
Do politics and electricians really have the right to do that?

358
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:38,340
Well, between the finality of the electric chair and the finality of the nuclear button

359
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,400
lie thirty million computers and a twelve day wait when they're down.

360
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,800
Is it a reprieve for us, for them, for all of us, or none of us?

361
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:59,420
The printout on that must wait, because we must now return to my brain, or this exact

362
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,800
replica of my brain sitting waist deep in this alcohol bath beside me.

363
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,260
Now take a look here.

364
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:14,000
These thousands of hairlines around my nebula here, highlighted in shocking pink, indicate

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,920
the prominent neural paths that my most frequent thoughts take on most occasions as they attempt

366
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,960
to make sense to me.

367
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,180
You're aware, of course, that thoughts themselves are electric.

368
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,200
They are very tiny, very weak electrical.

369
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,400


370
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,960
The軽渦 varieties, and whatever you use toMr.

371
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,100
Mitterrand him, and there is a little expression of the

372
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,660
great science.

373
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,140
Dr. Simon was familiar with that.

374
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,380
It was evident from a last minute spot in his mother's eyep Movie.

375
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,380


376
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:06,020
I'm going to insert these electrodes into this silly putty model of my brain

377
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,940
in order to show the effects of electricity on silly putty.

378
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,820
Here, we'll just put one in the left frontal cortex here

379
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,760
and one in the base of the pituitary cavity there.

380
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,680
And I'll put one right down here in the middle between the two hemispheres like that.

381
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,960
Now, switch on.

382
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:39,420
And now, over 40,000 volts of AC pulses are churning through this glow-in-the-dark model brain.

383
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,020
Dark model brain.

384
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,200
Now, notice the vibrations.

385
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,120
The expansion of the three lobes here.

386
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,200
You'll see.

387
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,520
And now, just wait a moment.

388
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
Wait a moment.

389
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,440
As the mysterious forces of subatomic pulsations take effect.

390
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
The vibration's increasing now.

391
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,600
The silly putty now reacting a bit like the special effects in altered states.

392
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:19,520
Now, we see the viscous fluids seeping from the silly putty.

393
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,240
This fluid, of course, a typical byproduct of a petroleum product such as silly putty.

394
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,300
But the

395
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,740
The brain now violently quivering in its steaming alcohol bath.

396
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Literally jumping and bouncing under the relentless forces of electricity.

397
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,680
And now, it's alive.

398
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,900
It's alive!

399
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,800
It's alive!

400
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,800
Oh, no.

401
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,120
Oh, no.

402
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,920
Oh, no.

403
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,220
Oh, no.

404
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,860
Oh, no.

405
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:53,860


406
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,400
Oh, no.

407
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,700
Oh, no.

408
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:54,880
Oh, no.

409
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,220
Oh, no.

410
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,220


411
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,220


412
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,220


413
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,220


414
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,560
You've been listening to cultural reviewer and social critic, Crosley Bendix.

415
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,100
The bird stretches an accusing finger at the sky and wants to invade.

416
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:39,140
And this time, the secondary backup system dropped to the right side on the inboard wing of the rocket-award aircraft.

417
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,080
Important subgenius system. We all watch these over and over again in a kind of narcissistic Valhalla.

418
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,080
Amen to that, brother. Amen to that. I couldn't have said it better had I been standing on the deck of the fabulous subgenius aircraft during that unfortunate explosion.

419
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,360
Well, here I'll say it better because the explosion...

420
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,940
Unfortunately, wiped out Reverend Hale for just a moment or two. The reception was very poor. We couldn't really do much about it.

421
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,980
As you can see on the video picture right now, it's completely... And then suddenly he's back.

422
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes, the reception was terrible. We had to stand and shake hands with everybody in line for hours.

423
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,300
I'm plugging in, tuning on, and turning off the microphone level.

424
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,640
Okay, let's start from silence.

425
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,320
Let's start from scratch here.

426
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,360
Go quiet. Everybody quiet. Ready?

427
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,020
Ouch!

428
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,720
Don't scratch me again like that or you'll have something to...

429
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,600
Because from silence...

430
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,980
Silence is what all sound comes from, okay? I saw that at a Mahavishnu concert.

431
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,260
Yeah, that's what sound comes from.

432
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,220
Okay, so let's start with silence.

433
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,700
All right, all right, cool.

434
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,180
Okay, quiet.

435
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,600
All right.

436
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,020
Quiet.

437
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,460
Go ahead.

438
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,020
No, quiet.

439
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:33,840
No, really.

440
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,340
No, I'm sorry.

441
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,380
No, really. Honest. Okay.

442
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,860
No, I'm serious now, okay?

443
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,680
Okay, quiet. Okay.

444
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,260
Shh.

445
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,020
Because from silence...

446
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,260
Hey, what?

447
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,980
...is what silence comes from, so let's...

448
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,120
Hey, come on. Everybody be quiet, okay? We're trying to be quiet.

449
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,400
Okay.

450
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,700
Come on.

451
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,420
My God, the...

452
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,240
Where are Brooke?

453
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,360
Everybody's...

454
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:49,900
Maybe.

455
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,280
What's going on?

456
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:51,800
Maybe.

457
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
Nobody's down here walking around the building.

458
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,820
Maybe.

459
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,560
Nobody in any of the offices.

460
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,020
Let them robots out of control.

461
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,200
Maybe.

462
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,560
They keep cutting.

463
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,160
Maybe.

464
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,140
Maybe.

465
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:00,780
Maybe.

466
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,480
If any of the listeners could...

467
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,340
I can't hear you.

468
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,320
I can't hear you.

469
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,640
Stand by, please.

470
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,840
Stand by.

471
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,300
What happened to that car?

472
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,720
Stand by, please.

473
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,440
Stand by.

474
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,620
Stand by, please.

475
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,240
Get off the line, please.

476
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,860
...the point of the carpet.

477
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,700
They're nice.

478
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,800
Prepare elimination dump. Process number C5G3-1.

479
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

480
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,900
There's something in the woods.

481
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,520
Fingers and toes are in the woods.

482
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,900
Fingers and toes are in the woods.

483
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,520
Say, aren't we having loads of fun?

484
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,560
There's something in the woods.

485
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,760
Toes.

486
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,560
Dream.

487
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,400
Grain.

488
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,720
.

489
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,220
I am the heaven.

490
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,820
I am the water.

491
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,540
I'm the dirt under your old tent

492
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,860
I'm your secret spout

493
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,960
And the lost metal gold

494
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,080
Metal gold

495
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,580
I am the cloud

496
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,060
I am the cloud

497
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,060


498
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,640
I am the cloud

499
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,520
I'm the car of the hearth

500
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,720
And the facemask

501
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:33,080
I'm the gold of your home

502
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,280
I'm the gold of your home

503
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,240
I've been here

504
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,720
But who is to find so far?

505
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,460
I've been here

506
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,400
But who is to find so far?

507
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,060
I've been here

508
00:29:40,480 --> 00:30:08,020
But who is to find so far?

509
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,520
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

510
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,580
System System System in your audio

511
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,680
And so I plunged in with all of my notes

512
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,460
beautifully arranged

513
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,180
and off I went on these tirades

514
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,380
Exactly

515
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,400
Approaching 1 o'clock central standard time

516
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
which is about 35 minutes ago

517
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,500
After being shot at

518
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,520
After being shot

519
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,420
By an unknown assailant

520
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,060
By an unknown assailant

521
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,040
During a motorcade drive through downtown

522
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,760
downtown Dallas

523
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,240
downtown Dallas

524
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,620
Yeah well

525
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,160
I may not know who all was

526
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,100
in on killing JFK but

527
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,580
I know who blew Jimmy Hoffa away

528
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:55,940
Hoffa

529
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,240
It was Rose Kenny

530
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,820
Rose Kenny

531
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,520
Just to be sure

532
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,700
There was no reason why the United States

533
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,420
was so easily separated by so many thousands of miles

534
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,840
of land and water

535
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,100
Both rich countries both with very energetic people

536
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,500
should not be able to live in heat

537
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,400
Exactly

538
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,340
The combination of these two systems in conflict

539
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,620
around the world in a nuclear age

540
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,380
is what makes the city

541
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,840
Why do we have to be afraid of dying?

542
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,320
Are we really going to die?

543
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,400
Is there really going to be a nuclear war?

544
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,040
And why do we have to be afraid of dying?

545
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,800
Why do we have to think about this?

546
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,000
This is too big for us

547
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,040
I remember the absolutely stunning hush

548
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:50,120
I remember the sense of wanting to stay indoors

549
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,760
Of being actually afraid to walk outside

550
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,440
Not because something was going to fall from the sky

551
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,580
in this particular moment

552
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,000
But because the sense of crisis was so intense

553
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,400
And our unpreparedness for it

554
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,100
And our sense of being afflicted with it

555
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,020
Was so strong that we couldn't even think about it

556
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,760
It was so intense that you did not want to walk alone out under that sky

557
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,740
The gigantic task of moving some 8 million people

558
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,180
in time of emergency to achieve dispersal

559
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,060
which will reduce the percentage of vulnerability

560
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,420
of great masses of people

561
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,380
has been programmed as a result of extensive research and detailed study

562
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:28,180
Most importantly a battery operated radio

563
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,320
to listen for official civil defense information over Conrad

564
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,500
640

565
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,000
And thank you for joining us here today.

566
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,900
On side 2 of the subgenius hour of slackened

567
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,260
Up to now after the Tate Beatles with Do You Think It's an Accident

568
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,340
We heard Crosley Bendix on the subject of electricity

569
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,080
More than an hour, less than a show

570
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,420
From Berkeley, California with the redoubtable puzzling evidence

571
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,940
And Dr. Howell starting from scratch

572
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,980
And looking for toads

573
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,780
And then came sofa number 2

574
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,000
And the last thing we heard was a voice from the radio

575
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,200
And now

576
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,880
The noise

577
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,380
The pressures

578
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,580
The decisions

579
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,140
The noise

580
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,080
A man screams for quiet

581
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,340
A man wants sanity in the confusion

582
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,220
A man wants release from the pressures

583
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,400
They say Christ cares and wants to help

584
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,340
No money back guarantee you will be free of noise, confusion, pain, pressures, decisions

585
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,320
He just says trust me man, trust me

586
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,500
I've been through it all

587
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,260
I understand

588
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,760
And I'll help you

589
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,240
And there's hope in that

590
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,680
The preceding brought to you by your station in observance of the 450th anniversary of the reformation

591
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,240
A film by ...

592
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,240


593
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,240


594
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,240


595
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:27,240


596
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,300
The trumpet summons us against

597
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,820
The trumpet summons us against

598
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,920
Not as a call to bear arms

599
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,720
Not as a call to bear arms

600
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,640
The arms we need

601
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,500
The arms we need

602
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,180
Not a call to battle

603
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,280
Not as a call to battle

604
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,900
Though in battle we are

605
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
Though in battle we are

606
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,260
But a call to bear the burden

607
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,240
Of a long

608
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,180
Twilight struggle

609
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
Year in, year out

610
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,500
Rejoicing in hope

611
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,460
Patient in tribulation

612
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,360
A struggle against

613
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,920
A struggle against

614
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,980
The common enemies of man

615
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
Tyranny

616
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,200
Poverty

617
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,300
Poverty

618
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
Poverty

619
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,000
Tyranny

620
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,940
Poverty

621
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,900
Tyranny

622
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,680
Poverty

623
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,260
Deceit and war

624
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,940
It's all the fault that's on us again

625
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,220
Not as a call for our hearts

626
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,640
Oh

627
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,380
So I'm speaking

628
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,500
Not as a call to battle

629
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,440
So we must be in heart

630
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,120
Not a call to bear the burden

631
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,280
Tyranny

632
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,440
Poverty

633
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,300
Poverty

634
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,140
Tyranny

635
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,220
Poverty

636
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,140
Tyranny

637
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,140


638
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,140


639
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,980
Poverty

640
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,920
Deceit

641
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,340
Tyranny

642
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,740
Poverty

643
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:17,700


644
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,200
Sack

645
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,320
Tyranny

646
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,580
Poverty

647
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Tarn rempl SPEAKER

648
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:32,920
TARGET

649
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:32,920


650
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:32,920


651
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,140
TBL

652
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,740
And an eleven

653
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,100
Dboxing

654
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,420
I think those are good songs.

655
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,740
When you went down there, when you went down there,

656
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,360
when you went down there, you lost your hair,

657
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,000
they blew off your head, that's what you know.

658
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,500
Last move, ball one.

659
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,960
Clear move, frontier.

660
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,340
We all remember where we were on that vegetarian run

661
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,400
John and Tim O'Donnell,

662
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,280
the 35th president of the United States.

663
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,420
It was exceeded by a smuggler's random action.

664
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,400
I think we're having a drug OD here at the studio.

665
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,640
Put me on, put me on!

666
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,540
Put me on!

667
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,800
This is a strange but true story

668
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,700
which proves that history does repeat itself.

669
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,020
And the events depicted here happen just 100 years apart.

670
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,500
Both President Lincoln and President Kennedy

671
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,060
were concerned with the issue of civil rights.

672
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,520
Lincoln was elected in 1860.

673
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,920
Kennedy was elected in 1960, 100 years apart.

674
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,320
Both were shot from behind the scenes.

675
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,440
Kennedy was shot from behind in the head.

676
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,820
Their successors, both named Johnson,

677
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,840
were Southern Democrats with seats in the Senate.

678
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,620
Andrew Johnson was born in 1808.

679
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,540
Lyndon Johnson was born in 1908, 100 years apart.

680
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:35,080
John Wilkes Booth, the man that shot Lincoln,

681
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,780
was born in 1839.

682
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,260
Lee Harvey Oswald, the man that shot Kennedy,

683
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,080
was born in 1929, 100 years apart.

684
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Well...

685
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,060
Booth and Oswald were Southerners,

686
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,860
favoring unpopular ideas.

687
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,180
Booth and Oswald were both assassinated

688
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,420
before going to trial.

689
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,260
Both Presidents' wives lost children through death

690
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,500
while in the White House.

691
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,580
Both Presidents were killed on a Friday

692
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,600
and in the presence of their wives.

693
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,640
President Lincoln's secretary, whose name was Kennedy,

694
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,180
advised him not to go to the theater.

695
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,360
President Kennedy's secretary, whose name was Lincoln,

696
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,720
advised him not to go to Dallas.

697
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,360
John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln in a theater

698
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,260
and ran to a warehouse.

699
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,700
Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy in a warehouse

700
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,100
and ran to a theater.

701
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,080
The names Lincoln and Kennedy each contain seven letters.

702
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,680
The names Andrew Johnson and Lyndon Johnson

703
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,420
each contain 15 letters.

704
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,760
The names John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald

705
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,800
each contain 15 letters.

706
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,700
And friends, it is true,

707
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,020
history does repeat itself.

708
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,840
It's truth is marching on.

709
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,240
JFK, the most talked about film of our times.

710
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,480
The motorcade is coming into view

711
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,580
with the Dallas Police Motorcycle Escort

712
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,960
of course, alongside the presidential limo.

713
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,180
And now we see President John F. Kennedy

714
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,180
and Mrs. Kennedy waving to the crowd.

715
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,520
Seated in front of the president is Governor Conley.

716
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,060
And he is also smiling and...

717
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,540
Still going.

718
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,020
Ladies and gentlemen, something is terribly wrong.

719
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,940
It appears the ladies and gentlemen

720
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,980
the Energizer Bunny has just been shot.

721
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,660
We repeat, the Energizer Bunny has just been shot.

722
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,840
Police say they have arrested a suspect

723
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,320
and have brought him in for questioning.

724
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,440
There is a theory at this time of...

725
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,480
November 22nd, 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

726
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,240
Three shots ringing out

727
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,480
vaguely wounding the Energizer Bunny.

728
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,480
He was pronounced dead upon arrival.

729
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,540
This is the most terrible...

730
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,200
The lone gunman identified as Billy West of New York City

731
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,500
was quoted only as saying, quote,

732
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,660
he had it coming.

733
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,500
He interrupted one frigging commercial too many.

734
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm played on it, end quote.

735
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,340
Tired of that exposed cold feeling of unprotected feet?

736
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,700
Tired of the sidewalk wearing holes in your socks?

737
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,260
Then you need shoes.

738
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,020

for them to do it again that that's exactly what they did the monkey song it's their answer to the

756
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:11,360
ridiculous theory of evolution so right now by the miracle of recording Robin and crystal Bernard

757
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:18,500
singing a song that probably you haven't heard before but I'm sure after you hear it this time

758
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:24,340
you'll want to be hearing it again I don't know of any better way than just to call it what it is

759
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:31,060
it's the monkey song and it's about the monkey theory the ridiculous theory of evolution that

760
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,240
refutes the Bible account of creation Robin and crystal Bernard

761
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,960
I know

762
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:52,380
the monkeys no key into me yeah I don't know much about his ancestors but mine didn't swing from a

763
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,260
tree it's a

764
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:54,740
ridiculous

765
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:54,740


766
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:54,740


767
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:54,740


768
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,080
thing so unbelievable and yet they're saying it's true

769
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:05,140
they're teaching us about it in school now that humans were monkeys once too

770
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:17,140
whoa I'm no kin to the monkey no no no the monkey's no kin to me yeah yeah I don't know much about his ancestors but mine didn't swing from a tree

771
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,200
although it's so ridiculous they're teaching us now that it's true

772
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,320
it's a

773
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:24,480
ridiculous thing I hope it's true

774
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,940
the teachers that came from a monkey would be better off in the zoo

775
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:40,800
whoa I'm no kin to the monkey no no no the monkey's no kin to me yeah yeah yeah I don't know much about his ancestors but mine didn't swing from a tree

776
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,900
it seems so much more believable and surely surely it's true

777
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,040
the God made man in his image

778
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,720
no monkey story will do

779
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,400
Whoa, I'm no kin to the monkey, no, no, no

780
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,240
The monkey's no kin to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

781
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,120
I don't know much about his ancestors

782
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,420
But mine didn't swing from a tree

783
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,540
This monkey business has to go

784
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,000
Because it just isn't true

785
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,860
It's such a disgrace to the monkey

786
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,620
A disgrace to the human race, too

787
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,280
Whoa, I'm no kin to the monkey, no, no, no

788
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,160
The monkey's no kin to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

789
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,760
I don't know much about his ancestors

790
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,020
But mine didn't swing from a tree

791
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,800
Mine didn't swing from a tree

792
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,880
Mine didn't swing from a tree

793
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,500
Hey!

794
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,480
Hey!

795
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,140
I was walking...

796
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,840
I was walking on the ground

797
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,260
I didn't make a sound

798
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,120
Then I turned around and I saw a clown

799
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,560
Had a frown, stood on a mound

800
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,060
Started barking like a hound

801
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,640
When I came to it, I found

802
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,800
He showed me something that was frown

803
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,340
So we became great friends

804
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,880
And late in life, we got sick

805
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,400
I gave him some soup, but he got worse

806
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,180
It asked for his purse, it got it

807
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,300
But it was empty, so it cried a plenty

808
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,560
I wondered what to do

809
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,960
I didn't know what to think

810
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,700
So I got a drink

811
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,180
And then I showed it something that was round

812
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,940
Then it died, smiled, fell on the ground

813
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,020
Looking back about those days with the clown

814
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:04,380
I get teary-eyed and really snide

815
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:09,560
Deep down, I hated that clown

816
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,620
But not as much as Mr. Farr

817
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,060
I'm gonna go smoke a cigar

818
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,980
We don't need no education

819
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,060
We don't need no dark...

820
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,680
We don't need no education.

821
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,440
We don't need no dark sarcasm.

822
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,500
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.

823
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,200
Teachers, leave those kids alone.

824
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,880
Hey, teachers, leave those kids alone.

825
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,700
I want you to listen to the atmosphere that this song creates in this place tonight.

826
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,580
Do you see the frog in the fog?

827
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,340
Why don't you preach your name?

828
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,480
I didn't imagine this.

829
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,240
They came to my hotel room and told me they had taken Bob.

830
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,740
Honey, you don't know who you're dealing with.

831
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,120
I don't care who I'm dealing with.

832
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,060
You're only going to make it worse for Bob.

833
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,140
They won't kill him as long as we don't panic.

834
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,980
Don't you see he's their bargaining power?

835
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,360
Without Bob, they have nothing to hold over my head.

836
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,460
Now let me do it my way.

837
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,400
You've got to trust me.

838
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,000
I do? Why?

839
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,620
Because you're his brother?

840
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,200
Because you say so?

841
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,820
How can I trust someone who...

842
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,120
who might be psycho?

843
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,420
Do you really believe I am?

844
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,280
Honey, they're going to let Bob call tomorrow at dinner time.

845
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,120
Now at least let me talk to Booth before you ruin our one chance of getting Bob out alive.

846
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,180
Please, Grace.

847
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,120
Please.

848
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,680
I don't know.

849
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,440
I don't know anything anymore. Who I am.

850
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,200
What's happening.

851
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,280
Oh, I know...

852
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,080
He's in shock.

853
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,360
No, he's a freshman.

854
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,720
I know it's左over.

855
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:33,720


856
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,380
Don't you love him?

857
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:34,380


858
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,160
Bro, I got to help him out with this case.

859
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,160


860
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,160


861
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,160


862
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,160


863
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,160


864
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,240
stationary must go on it self-examining

865
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,820
out of the words ofensa.

866
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,660
This is nice.

867
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:54,400
for me. Well, they don't do that for anyone anymore. Narcotics have been systematically

868
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:07,800
scapegoated and demonized. The idea that anyone can use drugs and escape a horrible fate is

869
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:19,900
anathema to these idiots. I predict in the near future, right-wingers will use drug hysteria

870
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:28,260
as a pretext to set up an international police apparatus.

871
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:37,460
Good old man, I may not live to see a final solution.

872
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:48,360
You know what, Tom? You and my mystical woman should have been a philosopher.

873
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,740
Well, Bob, in another life, perhaps. In another life.

874
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:01,680
Yeah, well, a mind is a terrible thing to waste. I get bored so easily.

875
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,380
Yep. And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

876
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,860
Maybe I'll go on aalk if I can.

877
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,220
Well, how wasteful, don't you get?

878
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:22,340
How precocious.

879
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,360


880
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,360


881
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,360


882
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,760
Now nobody relative of me is telling you how false was Annie Lincoln to do.

883
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,380
Mayor, A.T., if my good will will, come on.

884
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,020
Sir?

885
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,780
I wanted this and I want the dal, Doc.

886
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,420
No, either one.

887
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:33,640


888
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:33,880
Look, I said quite a bit of tax exceeded that.

889
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,900
Is this what they're telling the workers to do?

890
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:34,980
Public tax?

891
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:34,980


892
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:34,980


893
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,940
結果 ih,便 g seventh kind, an.

894
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,520
what has been called the wave theory.

895
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,320
Yes, but in this case,

896
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,040
waving, undulating, shaking, vibrating,

897
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,680
waving, undulating, shaking, vibrating bodies

898
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,720
so that they can shake in time

899
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,240
or the messages of the,

900
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,280
the messages of the,

901
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,840
shake our message out of ourselves

902
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,000
and shake our message into someone else

903
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,020
or some other receiver

904
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,860
and therefore acknowledge the,

905
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,460
the, of the, the, the messages

906
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,860
that you can acknowledge.

907
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,420
Consider the impasse of one God.

908
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,160
He is all-knowing and all-powerful.

909
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,860
He can't go anywhere

910
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,880
since he is already everywhere.

911
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,900
He can't do anything

912
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,040
since the act of doing

913
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,540
presupposes opposition.

914
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,820
His universe is irrevocably thermodynamic,

915
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,360
having no friction by definition.

916
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,180
So he has to create friction.

917
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,880
War.

918
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:06,740
Fear.

919
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,640
Sickness.

920
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,500
Death.

921
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,200
Keep his dying show on the road.

922
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,140
Sooner or later.

923
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,640
Look, boss, we don't have enough energy

924
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,160
left to fry an elderly woman

925
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,260
in a flea bag hotel bar.

926
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,860
Well, we'll have to start faking it.

927
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,140
Joe looks after him sourly

928
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,660
and mixes a bite comedy in his soda.

929
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:35,560
Perfect.

930
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:36,720
Sure.

931
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,280
Start faking it.

932
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:38,620
Sure.

933
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,140
And leave the details to Joe.

934
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,260
Now look, from a real disaster,

935
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,840
you get a big event.

936
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,340
Sacrifice, heroism, grief, separation,

937
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,920
fear, and violent death.

938
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,320
And remember, one violent death

939
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,540
yields more energy than I can reward.

940
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,620
So, from an energy surplus,

941
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,220
you can underwrite the next one.

942
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,840
So, from an energy surplus,

943
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,580
you can underwrite the next one.

944
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,340
But the first one is a fake.

945
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,920
You can't underwrite it.

946
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,520
Try to explain to God Almighty

947
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,220
where this one God universe is going.

948
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,500
He doesn't know what buttons to push

949
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,620
or what happens when you push them.

950
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,840
God damn it, every man for himself.

951
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,640
They collect both.

952
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,580
John XXIII sang,

953
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,180
Like a little soldier,

954
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,980
I stand in attention

955
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,380
in the presence of my captain.

956
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,800
The whole army came from here to eternity.

957
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,000
Yet their first is with a brownish nose.

958
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,240
A world where kids can go out in their front porches

959
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,440
and bite the bottom off an ice cream cone.

960
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,840
Important thing.

961
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,520
Why so?

962
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,100
That's...

963
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:04,640
Shit.

964
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,740
The material is the plastic form of art.

965
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,500
But use of space

966
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,860
has given us the greatest inspiration.

967
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,480
It has given us the greatest inspiration.

968
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,120
It has given us the greatest inspiration.

969
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,540
The joke is not funny anymore.

970
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,700
All you can think about is lost or sensual thoughts

971
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,620
or twisted habits or unusual ideas.

972
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,360
And new drugs.

973
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,100
We haven't even discovered the drugs

974
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,000
that we're using.

975
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,000


976
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,680
So do you now understand

977
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:36,680


978
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:36,680


979
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,860
Well, I know now

980
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,540
how you're especially

981
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,840
proud of boys and people

982
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,920
with a serious voice.

983
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,860
You're nothin' wrong with I'm alright

984
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,080
I know that

985
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,320
I, I think,

986
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:49,620
I now know

987
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:49,800
well, you are

988
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:49,800


989
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:49,900
really have you

990
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:50,140
and it works

991
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,020
in other ways.

992
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,160
You don't know

993
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,940
I feel good

994
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,560
about myself every night.

995
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,220
Now...

996
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,900
I don't know

997
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,040
That's my father.

998
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:00,520
My partiere

999
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,700
ein USS

1000
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,980
Looks good, what?

1001
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,440
Jack Kennedy's mistress was bringing drugs that we sent to Jack Kennedy.

1002
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,080
They have to be smudged.

1003
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,120
He has a secret love name just for you.

1004
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,540
Transistors, rectifiers, and diodes belong to a family of devices called the Screens.

1005
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,820
And he might even have expelled them in a flatulent cloud of locker room clearing methane.

1006
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,040
Yeah, it's true.

1007
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,880
Yes, they become part of your very being.

1008
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,520
Yes, and you become part of your very being.

1009
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,080
And he becomes part of your very being.

1010
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,280
Because you know, we are all one, really.

1011
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,700
It all comes out in the laundry that we are all the same.

1012
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,480
All religions are true.

1013
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,920
All perceptions are valid.

1014
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,840
All ideas are new.

1015
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,540
And all flavors go into the stew.

1016
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,820
All dressings go well with the salad.

1017
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,480
Well, everyone needs their special mojo bag.

1018
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,520
Oh, get that away from me.

1019
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,940
What do you got in there, buffalo chips?

1020
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Somebody open a window.

1021
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,500
Well, I may have...

1022
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,700
น

1023
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,420
We'll meet you at the prompter.

1024
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:30,700
Looks good.

1025
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:34,500


1026
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:34,500


1027
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:34,500

1031
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:03,320

1032
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:09,120

goodnight

1044
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:37,500
booth

1045
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,900
please one raise while you from this round so if you have a subject you'd like the proud to speak of just

1046
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,840
and as a'm Australian over these killed

1047
00:59:52,040 --> 01:00:03,300
ourdisciplinary services has performed in discounted an einzelbr curve where he leaves at the patient lives by because of the mentions of the good but also because we are living Viviana you know like in your family and givers and pay attention to your lapフ

1048
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,240
Profram and their special plastic implement they use shown here.

1049
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,800
And now we'll show you that technique once again.

1050
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,260
Dr. Profram? Yes, thank you. Well, I believe that

1051
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:19,420
we have found out that the Wotan Beast can be brought out of its grave for small, small periods of time

1052
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:24,120
by putting in more amounts of energy and electricity than was previously used

1053
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,900
and that the new instruments, although dangerous, are very, very usable

1054
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,320
in the small little padded room. I lost my

1055
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,560
tool manual. I can't find where he's reading the circuitry.

1056
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,060
No, no, just take it directly off the charts now. The charts from Dallas tell us exactly.

1057
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,760
Oh, yeah. Well, there you go, the charts from Dallas.

1058
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:44,500
And that nice frame that Dallas bought. Thank you for this opportunity to explain this to you.

1059
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,520
Well, that's what you get for doing your holographic records on plain old window glass.

1060
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:54,140
Shelter. You should construct a fallout shelter and stock it with a two-week supply of food and water,

1061
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:59,540
a battery radio, first aid kit, and other essential items for survival.

1062
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,200
Our guys are working.

1063
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,820
Where is your show coming from?

1064
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,340
From the bowels of hell.

1065
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,020
Are you sure hell won't stop you?

1066
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,260
Directly from hell or is there a show?

1067
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,560
No, the bowels of hell.

1068
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,420
The bowels of hell.

1069
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,140
There's no other possible.

1070
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,500
There's no other possible.

1071
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:17,600
There is no other possible.

1072
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,440
There is no other possible.

1073
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,860
There is no other possible.

1074
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,540
Now, if your prospects are definitely not interested, there are three things you can do.

1075
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,200
First, ask them, who do you know?

1076
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,600
That you think would be interesting.

1077
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:36,660
This one question can often lead you to some of your best prospects.

1078
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,580
Seriously, what do you have to do?

1079
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,940
What can you do?

1080
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,020
Why are you being so generous?

1081
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,740
Why are you being so generous?

1082
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,300
Why are you being so generous?

1083
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,860
And now, what will it take to reunite all four Beatles?

1084
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,220
I think you're gonna have to resurrect Joe Lennon for that.

1085
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,000
No, three more bullets.
