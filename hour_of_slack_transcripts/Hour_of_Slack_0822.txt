The Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be made on real-station and only in the city of...
Uh, my friend, the best thing about Slack is that I don't have to deliver it.
I can just accrue it, and so can you.
And you know another great thing is somebody else can deliver Slack, whole hours of it.
I don't have to.
I can Slack off on something else, like computer animation of the Antichrist, as it happens to be this time.
But thanks to other subgeniuses and other subgenius shows, Slack is bursting out everywhere.
In fact, your Slack this hour comes from one of...
One of those other shows!
The great Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.
Lymph Node Institute Edition, hosted and run out of the hose by the great Dr. Ellis and Dr. Bug Blatter,
broadcast on the great WREK in Atlanta, Georgia Tech.
Friends, one of the last great college.
Radio stations.
Before the conspiracy swoops down upon us all.
Ah, yes.
Bird of prey, bird of prey.
Lying high, lying high.
In the summer sky.
Bird of prey.
Bird of prey.
Bird of prey.
Flying high, flying high.
Gently pass on by.
Bird of prey, bird of prey.
Flying high, flying high.
Am I going to die?
Bird of prey.
Bird of prey.
Bird of prey.
Flying high, flying high.
Take me on your fly.
Welcome to Bob's Slack Time Funhouse, the lymph node edition.
I am Dr. Ellis and seated to the right is...
I'm Dr. Bug Blatter.
How the hell are you?
Not so good?
Understandable.
How you doing?
The studio of WREK is run with incredibly large tubes for some mysterious purpose.
And I'm thinking of movies like THX 1138.
Books like Brave New World.
George Lucas and Aldous Huxley, respectively.
Why are you listening to college radio?
Isn't there a war on...
But you've probably come to escape all that.
Well, too bad for you.
Because we're just as immersed in this thing as you are.
Remember that war on drugs they tried doing?
Uh-huh. And how well that went?
It went well?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, real well.
You're facetious.
People can't tell sarcasm over the radio unless you saturate your voice in it.
But I'm winking.
Oh, wait.
You're right.
Was that your third eye?
Third eye winking.
My third brown eye.
Don't it make your brown eye blue?
Don't it make your brown eye bleed?
Aye, aye.
Well, it kind of...
It could.
I've been winking all the week.
I was like a fantasy.
I've been winking all the week.
I've been winking all the week.

All the pickles, all the lettuce, special on the donut status.
Oh, yeah, I'm dancing and I'm swimming.
Oh, well.
I'm still a lawyer.
There's too much fair boys.
I'm over a friend.
Tell me which is better.
Get down.
Go.
Yeah.
,
cool.
Are you smart?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.




Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think I got some talent, huh?
Ain't no record, got the bomb
I think I got a weapon, huh?
I think I got a big ragged tongue
All the people, all the ladies
Spend the money, go themselves
All the people, all the ladies
Spend the money, go themselves
Don't worry about it
There's too much
Don't worry about it
Don't worry about it

Pharmaceutical disbursement has spiked
over the last two weeks and I think
that this is due to that scary
miniseries the Thought Tube has been
oozing non-stop since.
I know it is
disconcerting to say the least,
stuck between an invisible horde of
Hashishin and the frothing dupes
of the home front. Unfortunately,
we must confront the possibility
that we are not alone.
that due to some mistake on our parts, and when I say our parts, I most certainly mean
your parts, or perhaps a failure on the part of Bob himself.
And when you think about it, that is the most likely scenario.
I mean, he's just as happy swindling bacteria.
But due to some combination of misfortunes, we are stuck on this cold rock with these
damn apes and their plague of certainty.
Anyway, my point is that there is a rumor whispering around behind the back rooms that
may soothe your collective and yet very personal minds.
But first, I would remind you that the ruling elite are, themselves, rogue subgeniuses.
Repressed and smoldering, but sub nonetheless.
These professional perpetual sublimators are sitting on an unknown quantity of goodies.
The good goodies.
Free energy.
Alien trinkets.
Experiments that disprove reality.
You know, the good stuff.
The stuff that might, no, shall we say, soften the borders between countries, and individuals
for that matter.
The only problem is that there are a few branches of the behavioral evolution tree that are
growing too close to the wires of progress, so to speak.
The most troublesome of the three branches is the one that is the most problematic.


It is the one that is the most problematic.
The two branches of the three branches fall under the rough heading of fanatics.
And of the fanatics of the world, the two new monotheologies seem to provide the majority
of the grief.
The fitful flailing of the previous American regime with its WAKOs and sporadic African-Asian
bombings was just the dalliance of an old before its time phallocentric empire getting
itself hard, and perhaps demonstrating the intractable nature of the current situation.
Clearly, in the spirit of efficacy and incrementalism, the two withered limbs must be intertwined
and pruned in one concise motion.
So, they activate the Falwells to lather up one side, while the other side comes pre-lathered
by a southern Lebanese adolescence and fifty years of border wars.
Put them together in the desert or mountains?
Yes, someplace near the Tibetan Plateau would do quite nicely.
Who's to say what happens fifteen thousand feet in the air when a battalion of mostly
junkies start slinging grenades at the wind?
Well.
As the omelette said to the egg, WATCH OUT BELOW!
Following whatever atrocity they do have planned, they will be free to unveil their precious
goodies as products of the war effort.
Come on, you're all conspiracy theorists.
You don't think the big bad boogeymen in Black Puppeteers would let things get too out of
hand, do you?
Huh.
Well.
Don't come crawling to me when you run out of time.


I'm not a roach crap pate.
For now, just absorb this aural information burst, and when I come back, I will tell you
how to survive the looming dark age.
To be continued...
I have...
We way!
Watch out!
Die!

Ah!
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
We get up
Imagine how free we would stay
We believe in tough love
Imagine how freedom is thrilled
We get up
Imagine how free we would stay
We believe in tough love
Every single one of us.
The responsibility is still going on
No matter how far we are
No matter how far we'll stay
Our hearts will remain the same
Imagine how the sugar would spread.
Unpredictability.
These are the times when the rock has to sell you.
We believe in tough love.
All this is a foretelling of the future.
Not clear.
I can see my sense for myself.
Imagine how the sugar would spread.
The world would be a better place.
Back to the old times.
Imagine how freedom would spread.
The incredible freedom we understand now.
The incredible freedom we understand now.
Tough love.
Imagine how the sugar would spread.
All these arms would remind you of your family.
Looking across the Willow Bridge.

Imagine our future now.
Look out the window Wow!
Where is my wall?
Look, now we're finished.
Now, the j dense here
we've got to do the J French

Royce Reema to the beginning at the sign.
You're stuck in a state of shock for shock.
And the f***ing words in your mind.
And I'm going to go to heaven.
One man who knows what's at work is a living, living, living, living, living.
These are the times to fly and show.
I tell you this, I don't know what's going to happen, man.
But I want to have my kicks before the whole dish house goes up in flames.
All right.
Well, now that I've soothed your apocalyptic fears, I can give you the bad news.
While there is the negligible possibility that the overall struggle is for a greater good,
the local and immediate home front effect will likely be a contraction of liberty.
Yes, it's just a matter of time until your favorite amendment is in peril.
Worse still, the same herd that is so quick to cash in your freedom for their security will be far more volatile.
Tolerance for aberrant behavior may drop to an all-time low since the Red Scare.
Yeah.
Don't be surprised if some anti-globalists decide to stay home and work on their besieged websites the next time the super-capitalists get together.
And those that do not may wish that they did.
But boo-nick-off-who.
They have their problems and we have ours.
One of our main problems is that many creatures will exert no effort until forced to do so by a need or threat.
If you are one of these, then it is time to consider acquiring.
A few defensive adaptations.
Yes, it is evolution time.
Don't worry.
Your helix is old and has twisted past far worse than this.
So just relax and listen.
First and foremost, it is absolutely necessary that you remember to breathe.
I know this may sound a bit elementary, but the basics are so easily overlooked.
I have seen many a smooth operator busted by a gasp.
Regulating the depth and frequency of your respiration not only moderates your heart rate and blood pressure,
but also provides a certain sense of personal continuity.
In a similar vein, resist the temptation to scratch your itches.
In the literal physical sense now, not the dirty little yearnings that get you into so much trouble.
While the full explanation of this exercise is out of the question,
I will say that if you can refrain from this proprietary habit, then,
hypothetically,
this practiced willful resistance can travel with you up the scale of physical and psychic invasion
to the uncharted territory of technological torture,
leaving the, uh, client intact within the parameters of the, uh, adverse stimuli.
And while we are on the subject of torture, you need to learn to lie.
That is, pull the wool over your own eyes.
Learn to lie to yourself.
You must fully internalize your lies, whether they are part of a cover story or an innocuous explanation for your particularly freaky endeavor.
Memorize your lies.
Practice them in front of a mirror, a long mirror.
You lie with your entire body.
Lie to yourself in front of the long mirror until you convince yourself.
Also of crucial importance, you will need your senses crackling at full capacity.
Find a way to do this.
By now, you should have already sharpened your defensive paranoia to a hair's breadth.
If not, then you are dangerously behind the curve and the only advice I can offer is to
try to notice everything and use every drop of your sensorial flood to construct a menacing,
egocentric universe.
Which, some studies show to be the most accurate model.
Of course, none of this may prove relevant right now, this minute.
Then again, it might.
And I've always thought it better to be overly vigilant in advance than to be caught with your input jack dangling in the breeze.
If you still have time, please direct any questions to PO Box 670-541 Marietta, Georgia 30066-0126.
If you missed that, we will give it one final time at the end of the show.
Good luck.
Thanks for watching!

We're not even here to discuss the so-called new war that's been going on ever since the
end of World War II.
The Holy War.
What we're worried about being Americans still.
Yes.
How is this going to affect us directly?
Because obviously, alright, you're going to have to wait longer for an airplane now.
Don't have a problem with that.
But while America is in a check-writing and law-passing mood, there are a lot of people
out there who have their agendas that they want to push.
No matter what the hell happened.
They have some agendas like, oh, I don't know, pick your favorite amendment to the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights and just cross it out.
No, sure.
And I can see self-censorship in the light of being a little less jarring.
I mean, temporary.
You have to move on with that type of thing.
I like how they're calling W the cowboy and stuff.
That cracks me up.
Because it really puts it in the light that probably people see us in globally.
Crazy Westerners.
And then you get him and his civvies up there talking some serious trash on, what was that,
with a bullhorn on a mound of rubble?
With dead people in it?
Well, I hear you.
Hymns to the American people for the anniversary of their independence.
Brothers and sisters, on this day of deathless glory, let us come united in our battle grace.
To him our fathers martyrdom.
And to him our father's death.


Let us march in a battle, death to death.
So let it be, in God we promise.
They died.
They died.
And we are free.
Take up their cross.
Deserve their crown.
Sustain this flag of liberty.
Thy band shall not be cordoned down.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
So let it be, in God we trust.
In war and earthquake, wreck of the world.
Still let the flag of freedom fly.
In peace and safety, still be strong.
For we will live.
As we would die.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
So let it be, in God we trust.
Though we'll wash the world in blood.
Though death devour.
Though time decay.
Let but our hearts go to brotherhood.
And this we shall not take away.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
So let it be, in God we trust.
Stand and join hands.
And let us sing.
Shake out all glory to the skies.
With hearts and hands, defend.




Defiant fling our purpose against destiny.
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.
So let it be, in God we trust.
Amen.
All hail the American knight.
If tomorrow all the things were gone, I have worked for all my life.
And I have to start again with just my children and my life.
On the 4th of July, there are fireworks to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
I thank my lucky stars for be riding here today.
Our forefathers declared the independence of the colonies from England.
And I thank my little brother, the King of England.

Because the flag still stands for freedom.
And they can't take that away.
And now the signal.
One if I land, two if I see.
We stand, with the power of God.
And I'm proud to be an American.
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died.
Who gave that right to me.
The Redcoats are coming.
Shot around the world.
Taxation without representation.
Most tax evaders make no use of crime those religious.
Washington's crossing of the Delaware River.
That's the right to bail out.
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend her still today.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
God bless the blue ass day.
From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee.
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend her still today.
Across the plains of Texas.
From sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston and New York.
To El Dorado first ride in every American heart.
I still have faith in Mary Bo.
And it's time to stand and serve.
That I'm proud to be an American.
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died to give that right to me.
And I'm glad we stand up next to blue and defend her still today.

Wake up!
Yeah, patriotism is usually
where did I hear this?
The refuge of scoundrels?
Well, yeah, but somewhere recently I read something about how
you know, it's fine to be cynical
about the mind control that they start on children
written with the pledge and everything
because really it is just to keep us rather
complacent with our situation, but
patriotism is very valid right now cause they came
into the country in which we live
and killed a bunch of people
Obviously they've had a hankering
for the World Trade Center for a little while
First you don't succeed
As far as patriotism, I mean
you're being patriotic about a system that's flawed
and you've got some real scoundrels at the top
and not necessarily the highest moral fiber
but, you know, you've always had the option
to move, so put up or shut
up, you know, this is what we're doing right now
and if we bring about the end of the world
it's the way it's supposed to go
You know, what are you gonna do about it?
It's the end times!
Don't you read the Bible?
I cannot believe what Falwell said about gays
and how we lost the...
We lost God's protection is what happened in New York
Because of the gays
Because of the gays
And the abortion doctors
Oh man
And the girls with blue hair and nose rings
It's what happens when you take religion too seriously
Oh, I read it from Kevin freakin' Smith
That's where I paraphrased both things about patriotism
and I read it off News Askew, which is part of his view
of society, and I think it's a good thing that he's not a patriot
I read it off News Askew.com website
and it really struck me as true
A Catholic
Yeah, that guy who came up with buddy Christ
Christianity, wow!
They're almost oxymorons
By that I mean pimpled, stupid people

This thing you know can take my thoughts away
Think of how representative the government of the United States is of the people of the United States.
Not very.
Well, the governments of these Muslim countries are even less representative of their people than our governments are of us.
If the Baptists, let's just pick the Baptists because they cause the most problems in Christianity.
They're the people that shoot abortion doctors and blow things up.
Hmm, sound familiar?
We are in the Bible Belt, so.
Yeah, exactly.
So, don't drop the soap.
Walter boy!
If the Baptists went and did something crazy, like say they blew up part of Mecca.
Oh my gosh!
Yeah, that would make people upset.
That's whatever.
That's what all the other Protestants would say.
Oh my God, what the hell are you doing?
But when the Iranians started sending teams of death squads into countries to wipe out the Baptists,
you can bet your ass that the Methodists and the Lutherans and the Catholics and everyone else is going to stand up and say,
Hey, listen, I know there are crazy little retarded cousin of our religion, but you can't just come in here and exterminate them like this.
And what are you going to do?
Thank you.
Good morning, everyone.
Great to see you.
I'm your host, Robert Glory.
We plan on making the United States the bombshell resort for almost 90,000 people, X-versions, just for all you kids who are watching cable cartoon.

In which our country chooses a lesser of two evils.
In the 80s, when the Soviets were attempting to occupy Afghanistan,
and in case you haven't looked it up on an atlas,
it's a country about the size of Texas, the elevation of the Rocky Mountains.
We decided that the Taliban was the lesser of two evils against the Russians,
so we gave them money and guns.
Much like we decided that Saddam Hussein was the lesser of two evils against Iran,
so we gave him money and guns.
You know I live a life of danger for the FBI
Keeping tabs on our nation on the line

Secret agent man

They've given me a number
But they take away my name

Maybe they have been protecting us up until now
It's a shame that they failed
So bad with the intelligence
But what, within the last year
They got that CIA spy
And before that they had the FBI spy
The FBI director retired
Because of some of this crap recently
The missing documents for Tim McVeigh's trial
That showed up a month before
He was supposed to be executed
I mean those people have their heads way up their asses
For the amount of technology at their disposal
The eye of the CIA blinked
The eye of the FBI was closed
And of course who's to say
How history will look at this
Do keep in mind that all empires that have failed
Have failed
Because they attempted to fight a war
On multiple fronts
Those were land wars generally
But the same thing applies
You have to have the majority of your resources
Preferably in one
No more than two places
And if you want to fight a war
With an infinite number of possible fronts
And if the terrorism continues in this country
People might decide
This is how America loses by the way
The terror continues
Things keep blowing up
And people decide
That the power of the government
It's influence on your life
Is no longer outweighed
By it's ability to protect you
They're going to dump as much money
As the CIA wants into intel
Human intel as they've called it
That was the first thing I heard out of politicians mouths
Was using this as an excuse
We need more people on the ground
In operations
We need spies basically
Lots of spies
Because we haven't been using spies as much as we had
Since the Cold War
Since the Cold War ended
Which was a fabricated freaking altercation anyway
I mean it was a real threat
But it was created
So screw that
Initially it was
Yeah
And weapons of mass destruction
All over the damn place
And again this is just not going to turn out well
This will be it

And I see that Waffle House jukebox
And I'm gonna walk up to the coin slide
And there's a direct line

That death is not the end
For the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of the sun is shining
And the light of salvation
Up in dark and empty skies
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember
That death is not the end
Just remember

When you search in vain
To find some lorry-biding citizen
To find some lorry-biding citizen

Just remember
That death is not the end
Not the end
Not the end
Not the end
Just remember
That death is not the end
Not the end
Not the end
Not the end

Not the end
Just remember that death is not the end.
