1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,060
No, no, no.

2
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,280
Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your subs adjusted.

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,280
We're having operating difficulties,

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,240
which has necessitated a delay in the beginning of our Sunday movie.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,620
We have such a wonderful life.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,720
So wonderful life.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,100
We have such a wonderful life.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,560
We have such a wonderful life.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,960
No trouble.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,420
Get set and get going.

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,040
Amen.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,560
Recording.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,780
Everything's going fine.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,680
No trouble.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,220
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,100
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,780
Bob?

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,140
Bob?

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,400
That's your key phrase.

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,480
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,720
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,560
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,420
This is Reverend Ivan Stang,

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,140
sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,140
With Pat,

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,340
and Mr. Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,420
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,960
Before the sermon,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,120
a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,860
living avatar of slack,

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,380
and saint of sales.

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,880
On planet...

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,860
Are we controlled by secret forces?

34
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,240
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,840
Do people think you're...

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,900
strange?

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,240
Do you?

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Then you may be on the right track.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,580
Are you abnormal?

40
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,580
Then you are probably better than most people.

41
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,540
Yes.

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,740
Your time shall triumph.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,380
Now at last the step-by-step process is revealed.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,480
This is it.

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,220
The only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

46
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,220
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging hell.

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,220


48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,220


49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,980
Stand up and fight for your own life.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,720
Stand erect for your own abnormality.

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,260
Bob is a way of life to millions.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,820
Yet half of them don't even know it.

53
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,660
He's the one true living slack master

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,920
with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,820
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,980
Now see another dimension.

57
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,220
The power of slack.

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,500
The power to take your attention on your TV.

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,060
Yes, fear the star-fist of removal no longer.

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,920
Become physically attractive overnight.

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
Attain status, luck, prosperity

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,720
by blowing them off!

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,760
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

64
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,100
To explore new ways of going over the edge!

65
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,860
And coming right back.

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,060
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,320
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,340
To turn conspiracy and kind of personality disorders around.

69
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,740
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,600
That will fool normals and get you sex.

71
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:03,920
Oh yes, dear friends, this hour of Slack number 1782 is actually a rerun of hour of Slack number 44.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,700
From the year of 1986.

73
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:25,940
Thank you.

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:58,960
Thank you.

75
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,880
Thank you.

76
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,080
The story so far.

77
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,480
In the beginning, the universe was created.

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,700
This has made a lot of people very angry.

79
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,580
And been widely regarded as a bad thing.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,100
A bad move.

81
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,380
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of god.

82
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:07,520
Though the Jatrovatid people of Veltvodil 6 firmly believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arcle Seizure.

83
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,340
The Jatrovatids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call the coming of the Great White Handkerchief.

84
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,340
Are small blue creatures.

85
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,540
With more than 50.

86
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,300
And with more than 40 arms each.

87
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,480
Who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.

88
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,620
However, the Great Green Arcle Seizure theory was not widely accepted outside Veltvodil 6.

89
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:42,800
And so one day a race of hyper-intelligent, pan-dimensional beings built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought.

90
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,100
To calculate once and for all the answer to the ultimate question of life.

91
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,580
And that is...

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,660
The universe and everything.

93
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:59,680
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated and eventually announced that the answer was in fact 42.

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,880
And so another even bigger computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was.

95
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:14,040
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so amazingly large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet.

96
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,560
Particularly by the strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface.

97
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,080
Totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.

98
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,800
And this is very odd.

99
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,160
Because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge.

100
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,260
Nothing that ever happened on Earth could possibly have made the slightest bit of sense.

101
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,460
At the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.

102
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,560
And the only native Earth people to have survived the demolition are now being shot at.

103
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,060
Behind a computer bank on the lost planet of Magrathea.

104
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,140
Along with their strange companions from Beetlejuice.

105
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,960
Who are currently singing an ancient Beetlejuice death anthem on the very sensible grounds that they are about to die.

106
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,520
This is what the computer bank is about to do.

107
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,480
It isn't the cough that carries you off.

108
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,620
It's the coffin they carry you off in.

109
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,480
And the

110
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
Toothpaste.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,560
The

112
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,560


113
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,560


114
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,560


115
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,560


116
00:08:48,560 --> 00:09:18,560


117
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,640
The saw that blinks like a lamp.

118
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:34,640


119
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:34,660
The giant.

120
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,300
This can't be the real Bob.

121
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,960
It's just a flat two-dimensional head made of dots.

122
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,460
A thousand miles across.

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,380
Boy, he's putting that pipe in a backwards universe now.

124
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,180
With a gigantic time-warp black hole pipe.

125
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,100
Boy, that was horrible.

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,540
I've never done it before.

127
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,460
never been smoked by dogs. Oh, we're back

128
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,980
in Rock and Roll Hell now.

129
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,420
Oh no, is this Rock and Roll Hell?

130
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
Oh man, I always get stuck

131
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
here at two in the morning.

132
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,380
Rock and

133
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,180
Roll Hell.

134
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,720
Get down, party,

135
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,220
shoot up, pray to Satan.

136
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,300
Rock and

137
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,240
Roll Hell.

138
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,500
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,520
Rock and Roll Hell.

140
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,200
Go out and kill some kids tonight.

141
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,520
Rock and Roll

142
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,020
Hell.

143
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,300
Rock and Roll Hell.

144
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,260
Beating, destroy.

145
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,000
Destroy your life.

146
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,320
Satan

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
and Rock and Roll Hell.

148
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,340
Rock and Roll.

149
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,780
Sex, drugs, and alcohol.

150
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,520
DJs on this show.

151
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,240
Corruption.

152
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,420
Vigilance.

153
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,060
Here is a special editorial.

154
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,460
Doctors for Bob supports

155
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,440
the Parents Music Resource Center

156
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,420
in its efforts to

157
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,880
read Rock and Roll Hell.

158
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,540
Hell yeah, man.

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,460
We're having about eight

160
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,100
kegs of the bull down in Hell

161
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,240
tonight.

162
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,060
A giant kill party by the

163
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,380
flaming lake of Brimstone.

164
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,060
We feel that today's teenager

165
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,860
has too many other pressures

166
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,140
without having to worry about

167
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,500
hate.

168
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,040
Hate.

169
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,440
Hate.

170
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,580
And now for the subgenius

171
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,120
emotional hour.

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,400
It's all emotional hour.

173
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,600
Devil-worshipping teenagers

174
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,700
stole my pill.

175
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,960
And all the gas you want.

176
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,040
Awesome on bonds.

177
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,140
You can moat.

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,520
If that's what floats your boat.

179
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, you.

180
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
I'm talking.

181
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,280
You listening?

182
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,580
You listening?

183
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,920
Or you can pout.

184
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,960
Or you can break out.

185
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,780
Get up.

186
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,100
Get out.

187
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,100
Come on, step on.

188
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,420
Step into it.

189
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,300
Step into the flea.

190
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,200
Girl, do what you please.

191
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,200
Cause you ain't no twit.

192
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,240
You ain't no twit yet.

193
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Step out of your clothes.

194
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,980
Girl, step into.

195
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,560
You'll be the latest hit.

196
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
The latest hit.

197
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:21,680


198
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:21,720
Yeah.

199
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,700
It's about time to let my hormones wake up.

200
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,180
Put off the homework.

201
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,280
Let's put on the mail.

202
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't wait a second, cause you'll stay in limbo.

203
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,720
I give my old stuff to my sister, that bimbo.

204
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,100
When I wear underwear, I'm liberated.

205
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,000
It's like the movies, M-I-P-G or X-rated.

206
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,400
I've got a lot of stuff.

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,140
I feel just like a virgin in these clothes.

208
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,640
I hold my belly button.

209
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,140
Limp won't show.

210
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,240
Step into the sleaze.

211
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,240
Start being a tease.

212
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,380
Hey, you ain't no nerd.

213
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,320
You ain't no nerd yet.

214
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,540
Step into the street.

215
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,620
Put guys into heat.

216
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,700
Be a little flirt.

217
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,140
A little flirt, yeah.

218
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,400
Wanna get to dress up.

219
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,320
Move around and prance.

220
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,980
Wanna get you.

221
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,560
Right up.

222
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
All my fans will dance.

223
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,460
They'll try to fight it, cause this is really you.

224
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,720
Just burst your lips and flare your nostrils, too.

225
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,960
I must be dreaming.

226
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,780
This is just too cool.

227
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,140
Cause in real life, I wet my lips and then I drool.

228
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,420
I really love living the life I wanna.

229
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,920
It feels so good to be a prima donna.

230
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,960
Step into the street.

231
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:46,960


232
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,080
Start being a tease.

233
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,080


234
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,080


235
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,620
Step into the sleaze.

236
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,480
Girl, do what you please.

237
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,600
Now you're not a wimp.

238
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,540
You're not a wimp, yeah.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,820
Step into the lights.

240
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,820
You know it's all right.

241
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,320
If you wanna frip, you can frip, yeah.

242
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,100
You can take your mind where it wants to go.

243
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,500
Tell the boys to come, or tell the boys to blow.

244
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,840
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream, I can make my life be like a man.

245
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:16,960
You're not a wimp.

246
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:16,960


247
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:16,960


248
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:16,960


249
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,060
Step into the sleaze, girl, do what you please, cause you ain't no twit.

250
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,980
You ain't no twit, yeah.

251
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,420
Step into the beat, put guys into heat, you're the latest hit.

252
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,300
The latest hit, yeah.

253
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,980
When I start to strut, I wanna squish my nose.

254
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,840
My body really sweats, but hey, that's how it goes.

255
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,320
I'm in a world like Glamour Girl, it's simple.

256
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,560
I'm never going back to clear a sill and pimples.

257
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,300
You can take your mind where it wants to go.

258
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,700
Tell the boys to come, or tell the boys to blow.

259
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,260
Blow!

260
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,740
Whether I'm awake or if it's a dream, I can make my life be like a magazine.

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,920
Be like a magazine.

262
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Be like a magazine.

263
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

264
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,400
You can be like that.

265
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,660
You can be like that magazine, I suppose.

266
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,000
This is the horrible Madonna parody.

267
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,500
I might as well tell you what's going on here, friends.

268
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,920
This is gonna be a real hip show.

269
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,640
This was real cool a few months ago, I suppose.

270
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,820
Madonna parody.

271
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,180
This is a parody here from Reverend Bleepo Abernathy up with the Hour of Slack show in Boston.

272
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:56,200
A little bit before that and after this, the Serious Abuse radio show from the Rat Cave, dear friends.

273
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,140
We'll be going back to that.

274
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,920
Mommy asks, oh, Dobbs head.

275
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,980
Silly pills, Bob Slack.

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,840
I want my pills.

277
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,500
Some devil works for me.

278
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Give me your pills.

279
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,260
Bob pills.

280
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,220
Bob pills.

281
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,920
Bob slack.

282
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,500
Bob, give me pills.

283
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,200
Bob.

284
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,260
Yes, that's the misconceptions of many subgeni.

285
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,900
That's your typical pink boy pretending to be subgenius.

286
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,760
Yes, he paid his $20.

287
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,680
His money was green, but he was still pink inside.

288
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,740
Yes.

289
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:35,000
It's a pathetic thing to watch as he tries to quote all the slang that he got.

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Hey, pull the wool over your own eyes, guys.

291
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
Hey, yeah.

292
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,140
Yeah, you'd pay to know what you really think.

293
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,740
Yeah, like repent and quit your job and slack off.

294
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,020
Yeah, and do something to them if they can't take a joke.

295
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,640
What was that?

296
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,060
Let me open it back up here.

297
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,300
Oh, wow, man.

298
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,720
Are we punk rock, man?

299
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,020
I thought it was punk to talk about Bob.

300
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,160
I thought it was like cool or something to talk about Bob.

301
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,580
Hey, we ought to hassle the clerk at best because she's a capitalist, man.

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,260
Hey, you believe in anarchy, man?

303
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,360
Well, if you don't, I'm going to kill you.

304
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,720
Kill you.

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Kill you.

306
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,540
Kill you.

307
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,280
We'll show you punk rock.

308
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,880
You thought it was hair and clothes.

309
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,840
You thought it was like big spikes and bracelets and leather and stuff.

310
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah, you thought punk rock came from a record company.

311
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,540
You thought wrong.

312
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,280
You thought it was like-

313
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,460
You are God participating in himself, just me.

314
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,800
Man, this guy's-

315
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,120
Wow, this guy's a real problem.

316
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,140
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

317
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


318
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


319
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


320
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,140


321
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,420
Stop it.

322
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,040
Hey, he's a-

323
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,280
This is for Derparsam for sure.

324
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,000
They find more dominance when tomorrow becomes today.

325
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,520
Responsible for this?

326
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,780
Hey, I hear the caller who stole my-

327
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,280
All right, enough of this silliness.

328
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,080
Yes.

329
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,720
Say goodnight, Stank.

330
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,060
Ah, yes, friends.

331
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,940
I'm all hooked up and ready to answer your questions.

332
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:15,340
Now, we've been getting letters and phone calls from noble subgeniuses out there asking,

333
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,660
Reverend Stank, how can I be more subversive?

334
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:28,220
How can I be of more service to Bob in bringing down the conspiracy that enslaves us?

335
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,220
And friends, I'm afraid that that is entirely up to you.

336
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,920
Now, the conspiracy will tell you how to be.

337
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,180
You can be more subversive against it, so we sure won't.

338
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,640
But I can give you one helpful hint, friends.

339
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,940
There's nothing wrong with looking normal.

340
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:59,320
If you want to be more subversive, friends, you don't have to show off about it.

341
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:07,500
If you wear a uniform, like a high fashion punk haircut or leather and spandex and whatever,

342
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,500
unless it's really extreme, friends, you're just playing along with the conspiracy,

343
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,680
joining a conformity of nonconformists.

344
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,620
You're labeling yourself as someone who the conspiracy doesn't really need to worry about,

345
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:31,820
because you're going to follow a predictable pattern, one that they've co-opted already.

346
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,100
But what kind of subversion are we talking about anyway, friends?

347
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,860
Bringing down the state? Blowing up polluters?

348
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,600
Nay, nay.

349
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,960
That only kills people, friends, and gets you in jail to boot.

350
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,600
It's stupid, but not stupid in the right way.

351
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,500
Bob said, Bob said,

352
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,720
Thou shalt kill none but me.

353
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,720
Unless they're literally about to kill you or if they insult your ancestors.

354
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,200
That's what Bob said.

355
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,620
And, you know, there's nothing wrong with technology, friends.

356
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,520
We don't need to subvert technology.

357
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,940
After all, only technology is the only thing we've got to clean up the mess we already made.

358
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,780
So who are we trying to subvert?

359
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,200
The Republicans?

360
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,380
Friends, an awful lot of subgeniuses are Republicans.

361
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:35,180
But, you know, subgenius doesn't mean left-wing pinko or right-wing intellectuals.

362
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,440
It doesn't mean anything.

363
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,460
All it means to most of us is

364
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,860
patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism, friends.

365
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,780
Every yard a kingdom.

366
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,860
Every child and dog a serf.

367
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,660
It doesn't matter what party is in control

368
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,760
as long as none of the parties really have that much control over how much you party.

369
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,920
Besides, what you're fighting ain't just a political system.

370
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,680
I mean, as political systems go,

371
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,860
the U.S. is one of the least evil.

372
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,220
Just as Jesus is okay,

373
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,820
it's just that some members of his fan club make him look bad.

374
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,920
Same goes with Bob and the Bobbies.

375
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,640
Surely some of you have met nerds on the street

376
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,720
who started trying to talk Bob at you and you were just embarrassed.

377
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, friends, see, the conspiracy is a great combination of things.

378
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,680
Work is one of the main ones.

379
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,560
That's how you're really controlled, friends.

380
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,220
You have to work for someone else to make a living.

381
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,160
Now, the subgenius actually likes to work at what he likes to work at.

382
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,820
But that's the rub and the bub, my friend.

383
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,000
The conspiracy is also ancient customs and new invented customs.

384
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,220
It's a whole background attitude.

385
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,320
The conspiracy is an attitude.

386
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,920
An attitude of hatred for anything weird.

387
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,520
So what you want to subvert, friend, is that attitude.

388
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,000
Now, some strange things are bad.

389
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,780
But all great inventions and ideas started out as strange ones.

390
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,560
So if you want to subvert the government or some manufacturer or blow buildings up,

391
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,460
that's just what the conspiracy wants you to do, my friend,

392
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,060
so they can catch you, make you look like a kook in front of millions.

393
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,080
Now, history proves that every time you overthrow something overnight,

394
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,720
ditch some old government, what replaces it always ends up just as bad.

395
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,620
We have to break that cycle, friends, and this isn't anarchy we're talking about.

396
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,500
Anarchy is just another political system, just like atheism is just another religion.

397
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,260
To truly subvert, my friend, you work alone at your own pace, casually, but with alertness,

398
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,620
to subvert the attitude of hating everything weird.

399
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,520
Remember, leftists are just as guilty as rightists in this respect.

400
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:19,340
And you don't go out subverting by being an obnoxious Bobby and forcing weirdness down the throats of normals

401
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,600
who can't possibly appreciate it anyway.

402
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,780
That just makes them hate weirdness more.

403
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,220
You should seduce them with abnormality, my friend.

404
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,240
You have to break them in a little at a time.

405
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,280
It depends.

406
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,300
And you can't indiscriminately hate all normals,

407
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,100
because that only proves that you are a normal yourself,

408
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:46,920
because you don't understand yet that half of what you call normals are actually weirder than you are.

409
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,500
Who do you want to be today?

410
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,440
Who do you want to be?

411
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,340
Who do you want to be today?

412
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,240
Do you wanna be just like someone on TV?

413
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,880
Oh boy, it's so terrible that what you said you'll see

414
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,740
is nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV.

415
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,660
But that's anarchy!

416
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,860
You're a cowboy that has to stay up late and drop the walls

417
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,140
at the médico!

418
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,460
For so many times I can't remember them all

419
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,200
And I say, who do you want to be today?

420
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,160
Who do you want to be?

421
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,000
Who do you want to be today?

422
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,120
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

423
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,220
Just like somebody on TV

424
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,460
I think I'll be a teddy boy

425
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,420
I think I'll be a hunk

426
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,000
I think I'll be a tough guy

427
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,220
And I think I'll be a punk

428
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,060
I might just be a fashion star

429
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,140
All dressed in pretty rags

430
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,940
Open my house across the other side

431
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,760
And walk around in drag

432
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,560
Who do you want to be today?

433
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,640
Who do you want to be?

434
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,120
Who do you want to be?

435
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,120


436
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,320
Who do you want to be today?

437
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,400
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

438
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,500
Just like somebody on TV

439
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,940
Oh yeah

440
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,020
Do you like to live just like a rock

441
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,740
In the middle of the sea?

442
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,580
Do you want to suffer by yourself

443
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,660
In a pool of lead for misery?

444
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,540
Do you feel like a saint in artist's clothes

445
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,380
With a rosary in your hand?

446
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,120
Do you want to be free?

447
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,460
Do you see life and dough

448
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,820
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?

449
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,660
Would you rather push the buttons

450
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,900
And be feared by all humanity?

451
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,620
Or perhaps you'd like to be above

452
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,300
Do you want to be stupid just like me?

453
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,440
Who do you want to be today?

454
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,460
Who do you want to be?

455
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,220
Who do you want to be today?

456
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,340
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?

457
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,580
Just like somebody on TV

458
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,760
Who do you want to be today?

459
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,660
This is N1A

460
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,600
Who do you want to be?

461
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,320
Just like someone on mobile TV

462
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,920
Hey man, who

463
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,360
Who do you want to be today?

464
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,100
Who do you want to be today?

465
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,840
Who do you want to be today?

466
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,660
Who do you want to be?

467
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,660
Who do you want to be today?

468
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,480
Who do you want to be?

469
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,460
Who do you want to be today?

470
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,420
Who do you want to be?

471
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,080
To use my own super cool studly self as an example,

472
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,980
now in person I don't really appear like a mad prophet of the airwaves.

473
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:50,280
I very deliberately look like an innocent computer whiz or something.

474
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,740
If a policeman stops me for speeding, I look like a regular citizen.

475
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,640
And part of me is.

476
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:04,300
And so he doesn't look in the trunk to see if I'm carrying 5,000 copies of subgenius pamphlets

477
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,360
to hand out to grade school kids, which I am.

478
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,340
Get away with murder this way, friends.

479
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,200
And that time the Secret Service came to my house.

480
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,760
They took one look and said, oh, he's just a poor humorist.

481
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,940
He isn't building bombs.

482
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,240
Not physical bombs, nay, my friends.

483
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,240
But.

484
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:34,520
Me and perhaps many of you are from that 1970s post-hippie nihilistic generation more or less.

485
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,540
And aside from not working for a living,

486
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,780
I and perhaps you are still that same devious hippie.

487
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,880
Not a commie, nay, not a pinko, but a soldier for slack.

488
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,980
A warrior against the conspiracy of the normals.

489
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,260
And so.

490
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,160
And so.

491
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,160


492
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,680
And so.

493
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:55,720


494
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:55,720


495
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:55,720


496
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:02,480
And so.

497
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,500
And so.

498
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:26,760
And so.

499
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


500
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


501
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


502
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


503
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


504
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


505
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:26,760


506
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,540
They'll recoil in fear and jealousy to see a free man or woman.

507
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,760
But for latent subgeni who are ripe to be saved,

508
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,020
you are setting a good example to be weird in your own way.

509
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,200
Achieve slack in your own life, my friend,

510
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,780
and those who are worthy will turn toward it as towards a beacon as a moth dives headlong into the flames.

511
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,140
There.

512
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,380
They're not trying to steal your slack or to imitate you, but merely to see what is possible.

513
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,240
Then and only then will they learn to pull the wool over their own eyes.

514
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,440
So you don't have to talk about Bob, friends.

515
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,900
They have to just stumble upon Bob in their own sweet time.

516
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,420
And I'm not saying be yourself.

517
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,880
Quote, unquote.

518
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,100
There are too many yourselves.

519
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,820
You might end up being your own conspiracy normal lynch mob self.

520
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:39,180
You must try to try not to achieve the development of your Bob self.

521
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,620
That in you, which is Bob-like.

522
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:52,700
And there is no rule book for this, my friend, except the one you make and the one that you buy from Bob.

523
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,120
Praise Bob!

524
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,720
Hooray!

525
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,040
Help me, somebody!

526
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,900
Pull the lever!

527
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,740
Down you go!

528
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,880
Ha!

529
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,560
Ha!

530
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,200


531
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,380


532
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,780
Ha!

533
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,140
Ha!

534
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,160
Ha!

535
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,160


536
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,180
Ha!

537
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180


538
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180


539
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180


540
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180


541
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180


542
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,180


543
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,240

Mick Jagger gods.

560
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,720
All those are false prophets!

561
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,120
They're false prophets!

562
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,080
Michael Jackson gods.

because conformity

581
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,540
and creativity

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,600
are the same in their world.

583
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,320
Imagination?

584
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,420
What's that?

585
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,120
No.

586
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,700

more kicks.

595
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,740
They hook each other

596
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,560
like drugs

597
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,760
to their blood

598
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,440

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,620
They blow their change

611
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,900
and they don't

612
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,220

They don't seem

00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,520
to age.

647
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:53,920
They don't seem to age.

648
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,740
As they decompose

649
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,020
In memory's cage

650
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
But total loss

651
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,660
Is not something to hide

652
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,900
When the last big sleep

653
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,260
Has started inside

654
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,000
Cause they're pretty books

655
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
Pretty books

656
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,620
Bending the trend

Pretty books

658
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,360
Pretty books

659
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,320
Tell them to bend

660
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,040
And break

00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,840
Nash the Slash

662
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,320
From the album

663
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,520
And you thought

664
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,520
You were normal

665
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,380
And this is the hour of slack

666
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,760
The radio ministry

667
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Of the Church of the Subgenius

668
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,000
This is your host

669
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Reverend Ivan Spang

670
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,320
Don't ask any questions

671
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,660
Just do as I say

672
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,340
Alright?

673
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,160
We're pretty sure

674
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,720
He's a psychopath

675
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,460
Now

676
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,860
How do we spot him?

677
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,340
Well if he's wearing

678
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,100
A Napoleon hat

679
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,580
It's easy

680
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,560
Otherwise

681
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,740
He'd come in all sizes

682
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,460
And shapes

683
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,780
11 year old girls

684
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,820
80 year old men

685
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,920
They all look perfectly normal

686
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,820
I keep telling you

687
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,280
This is a sick

688
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,380
And perverted nation

689
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,120
All the time

690
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,620
And nobody wants

691
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,580
To listen to me

692
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,180
Nobody wants to

693
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,460
Hear about Bob

694
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,420
Nobody

695
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,420
I try to tell everybody

696
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,360
What's going on

697
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,140
They won't listen to me

698
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,540
I try to tell everybody

699
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:52,540


700
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:52,540


701
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:52,540


702
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:52,540


703
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:52,540


704
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,640
Well

705
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,440
To tell you the truth

706
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,760
I can't stand it anymore

707
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,260
Bob

708
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,280
Bob

709
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,780
Bob

710
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,860
Bob

711
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,320
Bob

712
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,580
Take care of me

713
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,080
Bob

714
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,000
Just

715
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,860
Just do away with them all

716
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,320
I don't want them anymore

717
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,640
They're

718
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,140
They're

719
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,320
They're

720
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,540
They're

721
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:22,620
They're all

722
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:22,880
They're all

723
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:22,900
They're all

724
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,000
Illusion of my mind

725
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,680
After all

726
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,400
They don't love you Bob

727
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,040
They don't love you like I do

728
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,180
Fist

729
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,100
And the fear behind it

730
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,820
It's not just the wars

731
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,200
And the awards that win them

732
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,520
It's not just the wars

733
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,320
And the wars that win them all

734
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,220
It's not just the dull

735
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,420
And emptiness taste

736
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,820
For a smothered culture

737
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,420
That expires all around you

738
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,320
And pools of its own wastes

739
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,240
It's not just the terminal folds of Nunu

740
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,840
It's not just the child zombies

741
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
That murder their mediocriton parents

742
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,940
And then cruise the streets with bloody feet

743
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,420
It's not just those starry old vex on the park benches

744
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,520
With looks on their faces like a fucking sissy

745
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,080
those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

746
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,120
It's not just the anesthesiologist's freniki.

747
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,180
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

748
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,000
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

749
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,700
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antenna, and human excrement on your car hood.

750
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,860
It's not just that the old ways were best.

751
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,800
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

752
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,860
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

753
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,680
It's not just the widescreen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the entire planet.

754
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,040
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas,

755
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,520
the size of a man's face.

756
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,920
It's not just the size of basketballs.

757
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,760
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

758
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,360
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, non-entity son of a bitch who thinks workers are property.

759
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,440
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

760
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,740
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing that nature is an open-ditch latrine in midsummer.

761
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:58,660
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a thing I know more than you do dog grin all over his homogenized face.

762
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:07,480
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made.

763
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
It's not just the doorway to doom.

764
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,400
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on.

765
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,940
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta max.

766
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,340
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that.

767
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,400
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show.

768
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,020
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition.

769
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,880
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it.

770
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
Shout salvation and fight in Jesus.

771
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,540
You'll need to rise precious early, you sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob.

772
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,760
Not off.

773
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,920
He's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend.

774
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,040
In his back pocket.

775
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,780
Just you try it.

776
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,280
Bob is a clump of mud.

777
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,560
Bob is a tape recorder.

778
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,960
Bob is things that don't always run.

779
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,280
Bob is masking tape.

780
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,400
Bob is a ballpoint pen.

781
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,460
Bob is a rooster.

782
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,920
And Bob...

783
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,500
Bob is a hen.

784
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,440
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

785
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,940
I don't have any more of that.

786
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,460
They're saying I don't have pope bottles.

787
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,520
That's live.

788
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,400
They're squirming.

789
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:30,960
Wow.

790
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,300
They're trying to tell me where I'm going.

791
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,360
Don't.

792
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,040
Don't.

793
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,360
Don't.

794
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,780
Don't.

795
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,040
Don't.

796
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,880
We want Bob.

797
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,680
Where's Bob?

798
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,520
We want Bob.

799
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:40,980
Right now.

800
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,560
We want Bob.

801
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,760
Okay.

802
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,940
Bob's probably not going to be here in physical manifestation.

803
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,440
Oh.

804
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,760
Oh.

805
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:49,840
Oh.

806
00:41:50,940 --> 00:42:01,440
Where is Bob? He's everywhere. Check yourself and feel if you're Bob Glenn and make sure it's overactive like it's supposed to be.

807
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,620
This is the headquarters for the Church of the Subgenius.

808
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,620
Now wait a minute. No, wait a minute. I love that area.

809
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:19,920
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.

810
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,600
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained with an expert.

811
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:34,120
Men of vision, men such as you, Doctor, gathered here exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.

812
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,460
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.

813
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,120
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.

814
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,280
Well, there you have it.

815
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,900
Nothing more.

816
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,180
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

817
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,920
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women, and as such we can accomplish wonders.

818
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:09,500
Like any other church, the Church of the Subgenius has divine tenets, divine rules, divine orders.

819
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,280
The first rule of the Subgenius Church is, too much is always better than not enough.

820
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,380
Can I get it too much?

821
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,980
Can I get it too much?

822
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,500
What is it always better than?

823
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,180
What is it always better than?

824
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,220
Praise God.

825
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,800
Praise God.

826
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,920
Hello, Paul.

827
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,960
Welcome to the End Times.

828
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:42,940
In today's End Time essay, we will be covering the difference between the boyfriend and the

829
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,900
bloody head of larger society itself.

830
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:46,800
And the last is, of course, the most important.

831
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:46,820


832
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:46,820


833
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:46,820


834
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:46,820


835
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,120
As seen here in our first slide, the bloody head of larger society goes on forever.

836
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,680
There is no end, and there's no use resisting.

837
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,400
Look at those heads fall in slow motion.

838
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,840
Just beautiful.

839
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,640
Just bouncing down the celestial stairs.

840
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,680
Yes, dear friends, those are the things I want to tell you about today.

841
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,680
The road not taken, or parables about the less traveled path.

842
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,220
Ha!

843
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,640
Snarly.

844
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,020
Bob gives you the bulldozers you need to pave your own path.

845
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:32,160
Ignore those gray suited hippos and those ferret-faced fashion clones or kill me.

846
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,660
You gotta stand up.

847
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,660
You gotta stand up now and you gotta stand up for us.

848
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,860
A peace which is under hell.

849
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Stand up is made illegal.

850
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,840
Don't let them whitewash your subcontinent mind.

851
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,660
Fancy doodads and gadgets just like the 50s.

852
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,220
Some of you think I'm talking revolution.

853
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,660
Hey, if we're supposed to be moving ahead, we're supposed to be moving forward.

854
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:46,660


855
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:46,660


856
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:46,660


857
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:46,660


858
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:46,660


859
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,320
Well, I am.

860
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,980
But not stupid revolution.

861
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,660
Do machines get smarter as people get dumber?

862
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,940
Well, forget it for now.

863
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,600
That's exactly the way they want you to behave so they can have an excuse to mount their

864
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,780
gun turrets against all the supposed fringe group cyborgs.

865
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,600
Oh, no, no, now come on.

866
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,040
Keep those thoughts to yourself.

867
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:04,660
They're just one step ahead of you.

868
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:04,840
Blam!

869
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,300
You shouldn't depress anybody.

870
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,960
Blam!

871
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,360
You'll be seen as a downer spreading bad karma.

872
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,600
What's the matter?

873
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,800
You think I'm a maniac?

874
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,520
Huh?

875
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,600
You think I'm a downer?

876
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,660
A crybaby?

877
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,500
A paraloid?

878
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,640


879
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,640


880
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,640


881
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,640


882
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,640


883
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,640


884
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:16,980
You think I'm a downer?

885
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,720
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Subtranity, maybe you don't think it's fine for you to run around

886
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,380
perfectly free to go home?

887
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,080
Go on.

888
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,660
You're not going to be something you call the downer, are you?

889
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:26,880
Too many.

890
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,600
And it's too many to support and lead.

891
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,800
You need to change your individual.

892
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,860
Even if it's three years of permanent leave, I don't think that would help you get a good

893
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,140
job.

894
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Oh, but don't bomb us out.

895
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,220
We want to have fun.

896
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:45,500
You just watch that softcore porno soda commercial and work your boring job.

897
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,000


898
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,080


899
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,620
It'll be fine.

900
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:46,620


901
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:46,620


902
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:46,620


903
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:46,620


904
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,080
If it comes back to find we've turned in just another click, another waffle, not

905
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,220
feel dwarfed to get behind and find an excuse to snuff everyone who's not lying.

906
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,800
In any case, we found hospital evidence for the charge of secret ceremonies involving

907
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,120
the downer, from Blackbird and Browning.

908
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,200
Well?

909
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,720
Hello, there.

910
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,880
I'm Sarah, the Clown.

911
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,000
All you do to make me dance is press my button down.

912
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,440
I need practice.

913
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:16,600
I'm going to try my best.

914
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:16,600


915
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:16,600


916
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,780
There's a world going on underground

917
00:46:50,320 --> 00:47:10,760
There's a world going on underground

918
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,920
There's a world going on underground

919
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,960
There's a world going on underground

920
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:31,020
There's a world going on underground
