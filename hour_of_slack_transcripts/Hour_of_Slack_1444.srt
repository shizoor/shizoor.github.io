1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
I call and I call, just to make things right

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,520
Have I lost the fight?

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,800
Where were you last night?

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,760
I beg and I cry, I keep asking why

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,800
Where were you last night?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Where were you last night?

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,100
It's got to a heart, and you're too late

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,620
I'm in love, bad night

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,200
It's got to a heart, and you're too late

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,780
I'm in love, bad night

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,500
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's like?

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,480
Ooh, heaven is a place I'll learn

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,720
It's in heaven, love comes first

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,680
We'll make heaven our place, our life

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,720
It's got to a heart, and you're too late

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,360
I'm in love, bad night

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,180
It's got to a heart, and you're too late

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,180


19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,020
It's in heaven, love comes first

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,880
We'll make heaven our place, our life

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,740
It's in heaven, love comes first

22
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,180
It's in heaven, love comes first

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,820
It's in heaven, love comes first

24
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,140
And if this M epidemic don't kill me

25
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,860
I don't even have any consent

26
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,600
But I don't want your back

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:54,120
I don't want your speeches

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,180
because we're trying to make your steely

29
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,180


30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,940
But I...

31
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,460
Yeah.

32
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,040
I...

33
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,640
Look at the monkey, bunny, monkey, little red monkey acting so fidgety.

34
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,860
Look at the monkey, bunny, monkey, little red monkey, cute as can be.

35
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,720
Where is his mama, papa, sister, brother, cousin, rest of the family, little red monkey on his own.

36
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,860
Some very lonesome monkey is he.

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,340
A very lonesome monkey is he.

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:44,620
And friends, welcome to the most, or I should say the least prepared hour of Slack ever.

39
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,060
Ah, there we go.

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,440
My head.

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,560
See, you don't hear me turn my headphones up.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,720
But boy, I don't hear me at all until I...

43
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,000
Turn those headphones up.

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,500
And let's see.

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
What do we have for background music?

46
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,820
Is that right?

47
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,600
Close enough.

48
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,940
Friends, this is our Slack number 1440.

49
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,540
Recorded a little bit before Christmas and things are getting a bit hectic.

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,420
This has been appliance week for Princess Wee and myself.

51
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,640
And that every day it seemed like somebody gave us a new appliance as a present.

52
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,620
Thank you, sir.

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,380
But every day, one of our old appliances broke down totally.

54
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,800
Last night, it was the hot water heater.

55
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,740
And as one subgenius told me, dang, that's what you get.

56
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,740
Your conspiracy fooled you again.

57
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,420
Hot water heater.

58
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,080
Why are you trying to heat hot water?

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,040
It's already hot.

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,840
Let's hear it.

61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:52,840


62
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:52,840


63
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:52,840


64
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:52,840


65
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,900
Heat hot water heater.

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,540
Heat hot water.

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,160
Right.

68
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,160
So that's our problem, friends.

69
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,160
Although the Slack Friday sale has really paid off where you can get to ordain...

70
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,540
Oh, I can't talk about that.

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,680
But anyway, it paid off and hopefully will continue to.

72
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
Well, what did we break?

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,180
Your computer broke.

74
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,820
I think my computer breaking was the beginning of it.

75
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,980
That's where it kicked off.

76
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,760
No, actually, my brain cells break.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,620
My brain cells are breaking was the beginning.

78
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,060
And my skin falling off.

79
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,600
Oh, that's right.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,180
Your skin broke.

81
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,800
And me arm.

82
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,100
Your arm.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,100
Me arm is...

84
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,180
His arm.

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
His arm.

86
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,300
I'm like old Grendel in that Beowulf movie.

87
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,180
Me arm.

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
And then everything...

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,620
Yeah, and then all the trash.

90
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,040
Even the trash broke.

91
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,360
We had to take trash and fix it.

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,240
Yes.

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,100
A whole van load of trash.

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,200
You would not want to smell the church eye van.

95
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,500
Ice mobile right now.

96
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,500
It smells like the Starwood Center basement, basically.

97
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,880
It's where everything inside of it has been.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,740
For the last 12 years.

99
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,520
So we really...

100
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,160
We love the Christmas present new devices we got.

101
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,340
Oh, my goodness, yes.

102
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,020
But, you know, every time you get a new device these days,

103
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,560
it takes half a day just to do the settings.

104
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,960
We got our first tablet.

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,240
And to become acclimated to all the idiosyncrasies.

106
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
Yes, and here's the problem.

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,120
We have to be in Texas in seven minutes.

108
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,200
And that's why I didn't even...

109
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,900
Aside from that stuff by The Large that I played at the beginning,

110
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,700
the mashups,

111
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,140
I didn't prepare even any background stuff.

112
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,940
What's in the background now is things Lee Murr and I mostly did years ago.

113
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,940
But Princess Wee and I...

114
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:51,940


115
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,740
are going to read to you tonight.

116
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,000
We have two different types of things.

117
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,360
Princess Wee has a great kook newsletter that came in the mail to us.

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,680
One of the Hour of Slack subscribers sent it to us.

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,140
And we've got two or three issues now of Truman Bentley's newsletter,

120
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,380
which is like a flash from the 80s,

121
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,020
back when we used to trade with dozens of psychotics

122
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,700
who actually...

123
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,280
Hand-printed.

124
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,160
Xerox.

125
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:24,960
Hand-printed.

126
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,580
Yeah, and mailed.

127
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,860
Zines.

128
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,220
Yeah, this zine, the part Princess Wee has,

129
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,780
is all hand-written by Truman Bentley.

130
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,820
Do you want to give them an example?

131
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,860
Yes, I'll just kick right off with the kickoff of...

132
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,960
Many of you have accepted the fact that you have found your purpose,

133
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,540
which is the words of howl-ness.

134
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,080
As expressed by this newsletter,

135
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,740
many of you are basic chodes

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,640
and you know it.

137
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,180
You need to save your money that you have

138
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,860
and make from any work.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,340
It is for one purpose.

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,580
That is for you to use it to make more money with it.

141
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,960
Money has but one purpose,

142
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,460
and that is to be used to make more money.

143
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,920
By studying howl,

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,020
which is in quotation marks and underlined,

145
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,180
you can learn to utilize your money in a better way.

146
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,160
You need to shave and bathe every day.

147
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,360
If you are a woman,

148
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,540
you need to behave like Emma Peel.

149
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,640
Watch the BBC.

150
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,820
Watch the TV show The Avengers.

151
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,620
Remember that being proper in style and behavior

152
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,560
is the key to richness.

153
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,640
For being rich, you can be better.

154
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,100
Poor is not blessed or good.

155
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,500
Poor is like having athlete's feet.

156
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,880
You gotta get you a spray and ointment.

157
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,660
Fast.

158
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,600
Truman...

159
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
The words of Truman Bentley.

160
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,540
Now why he calls his religion howl-ism in that newsletter

161
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,720
is beyond me because in the newsletter I've got over here,

162
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,820
he says,

163
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,940
the international worship of God,

164
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,240
the worship of Truman is better than any and all gods,

165
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,040
is growing.

166
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,040
We, the Trumanists,

167
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,020
love to see the upset reactions of all the God-adorers

168
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,500
who despise to think a new God can outdo their fairy tale God of fraud.

169
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,640
This guy's really angry.

170
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,540
Yes.

171
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,780
But at the same time,

172
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,480
he tries to do his little shots of humor.

173
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,100
Humour.

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,120
I'm gonna read a little bit of his.

175
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,140
Oh, go for it.

176
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,820
This is easier because of my version,

177
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,200
he finally got a computer.

178
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:22,780
Yes.

179
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,100
And was able to type it.

180
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,180
Much easier to read.

181
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,780
He says,

182
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,160
I was watching an episode of the Twilight Zone.

183
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
This guy was talking about settling down with his girl

184
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,520
and having a good job and a nice life with money in the bank.

185
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,280
Money in the bank.

186
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,120
When I hear somebody say that stupid saying phrase,

187
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,300
whatever it is called,

188
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,580
I know right then and there I don't want to anything to do with that person

189
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,020
because they are messed up.

190
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,240
Stupid, nauseating, screw the bank.

191
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,940
Cash your checks at the bank they are drawn on,

192
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,280
close your savings and checking account,

193
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,100
spend all your money on Hare Krishna tambourines

194
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,460
and wax Halloween candy and harmonicas.

195
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,820
Don't contribute support, help, aid or anything.

196
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,720
Drop out as much as you can.

197
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,880
Nauseating scum runs every show.

198
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,220
This show not included.

199
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't follow their dream.

200
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,560
Don't laugh at their jokes.

201
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,940
Become highly educated and do nothing with it.

202
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,940
Despise conformity.

203
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,120
Despise anyone who tells you you must do this or you must do that.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,000
These same jerks won't even buy you a cheeseburger

205
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,360
but they want to tell you what you must do.

206
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,560
I just looked at the bottom of the computer screen.

207
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,640
There is a real Cal Rifkin, Rifkin, whatever the hell his name is,

208
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,060
face on a bobblehead doll body advertising.

209
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,780
He is next to two other baseball creeps.

210
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,380
Screw sports.

211
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,180
I hope they get prostate cancer.

212
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,220
I hope he rots.

213
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,560
In fact, what happened to singer Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper was funny as hell.

214
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,380
Don't buy sports trinkets or participate in all the right things.

215
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,380
Resist, defy, tell others to not conform, etc.

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,820
Amazing.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
It is.

218
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,060
I'll resume the handwritten portion.

219
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,960
Writing this newsletter without a computer,

220
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,440
sucks.

221
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,660
Each letter has to be formed and the concentration to do that.

222
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,680
And the time limits the free flow of thought.

223
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,320
I need a computer.

224
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,660
Send stamps and dollars to keep the newsletter going strong.

225
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,500
One day, when we build the temple of the newsletters,

226
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,600
those who loved and helped it grow shall be invited to come visit

227
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,340
and have the honor of scrubbing the Golden Throne toilet with Comet or Ajax.

228
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,400
For symbolically cleaning the commode,

229
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:53,260
you are symbolically cleaning away the past of your lame pre-Howell life.

230
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,240
For Howell is Ness.

231
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,100
And Howell plus Ness is Howellness.

232
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,640
That's cosmic.

233
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,940
This has nothing to do with Dr. Howell, by the way.

234
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
No, this is Howell.

235
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,700
Yeah.

236
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,720
As in the poem by Allen Ginsberg?

237
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,820
Like that kind of Howell?

238
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,840
More like Howell.

239
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,400
More like Howell.

240
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,000
Howell.

241
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,880
How well are you doing at that repair job you're trying to,

242
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,180
we asked you to do, Mr. Hot Water Repairman?

243
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,280
Well, the water's already hot, so I don't know what your problem is.

244
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I don't know.

245
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,640
Dr. Howell are you?

246
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,980
Now, I've got, Dave should be calling in any minute.

247
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,840
But in the meantime, friends, I'm about to finish up a 3,000-page novel

248
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,160
called The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson.

249
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,280
And I found some nifty parts to read to you from it so that you will run out

250
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,360
and read this book yourself someday, even though it's 3,000-page volumes.

251
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,640
Well, our main character, half-cocked Jack, has just stumbled upon some women

252
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,220
being slaughtered by Turks.

253
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,260
And Jack wondered idly whether the mudlarks of East London would ever believe him.

254
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,620
If he went home and claimed he had seen a live ostrich and a Turk's harem.

255
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,360
But thoughts of this sort were chased away by others.

256
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,200
One of those moments had arrived.

257
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,280
Jack had been presented with the opportunity to be stupid in some way that was much more interesting

258
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,060
than being shrewd would have been.

259
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,820
These moments seemed to come to Jack every few days.

260
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,300
They almost never came to Bob.

261
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,200
And Bob marveled.

262
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,600
The two brothers leading similar lives could be so different that one of them had the opportunity

263
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,740
to be reckless and foolish all the time, while the other almost never did.

264
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,560
Jack had been expecting such a moment to arrive today.

265
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,040
He supposed until moments ago that it had already come,

266
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,260
namely when he decided to mount the stolen horse and ride after the ostrich.

267
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:11,500
But here was a rare opportunity for stupidity even more flagrant and glorious.

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,620
Now Bob, who'd been observing Jack carefully for many years,

269
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,240
had observed that when these moments arrived,

270
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,260
Jack was almost invariably possessed by something that Bob had heard about in church

271
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,240
called the Imp of the Perverse.

272
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,700
Bob was convinced that the Imp of the Perverse rode invisibly on Jack's shoulder,

273
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,820
whispering bad ideas into his ear.

274
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,380
And the only counterbalance was Bob himself,

275
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,180
standing alongside Jack.

276
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,060
Counseling, good sense, prudence, caution, and other Puritan virtues.

277
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,500
Not that Bob was Puritan, far from it,

278
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,060
but he was known to talk that way to demonstrate his superiority over Jack.

279
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,480
But Bob was in England.

280
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,680
Might as well get this over with then, Jack muttered,

281
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,500
and gave his Turkish steed some vigorous heel digs.

282
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,280
And it gets really exciting after that.

283
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,960
Obviously it's a different Bob than the one we're talking about.

284
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,860
Yes, a different Bob.

285
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,720
Jack is more Bob-like in this.

286
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,180
He's very Bob-like in this book,

287
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,700
although he ends up being a slave for about half of it.

288
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,560
Half-cocked Jack.

289
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,380
Yeah, that's his name.

290
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,720
It's a literal description of his infirmity.

291
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,280
You'll sink with your water.

292
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,880
But it's a great book, or three giant volumes.

293
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,320
Whatever happened to...

294
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,360
I wonder if Dave had another one of those crises that come over him just before the...

295
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,200
I sure hope not.

296
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,540
I hope he's all right.

297
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,160
Is he the one that only has so much on his phone card?

298
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,320
Right.

299
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,060
Oh, okay.

300
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,080
He only has so much on his phone card.

301
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,100
Oh, here's a short line from The Broke Cycle.

302
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,280
Paris was a city of stone, the color of bone, beautiful and hard.

303
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,160
You could dash yourself against it and never leave a mark.

304
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,160
It was built, so far as Jack could tell,

305
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,620
on the principle that there was nothing you couldn't accomplish

306
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,940
if you crowded a few tens of millions of pets,

307
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,200
peasants together on the best land in the world,

308
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,760
and then never stopped raping their brains out for a thousand years.

309
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,220
I thought that kind of sums up Western Civ.

310
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,240
Yes, I think it sums it up nicely.

311
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Did you have some more Truman Bentley-isms or Bentley Truman-isms?

312
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,440
Well, I believe there are a few more Bentley-isms here that could be shared.

313
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,220
No pretty James Bond pussy galore film woman

314
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,480
is going to want to smooth on a negative chode acting dude.

315
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,780
If you are a drag, a lame-o, smelly, unwashed slob bum,

316
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,360
then you cannot expect pretty women to want to break off some Kit Kat for you.

317
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,460
The core desire of all women is to be with a howl.

318
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,200
No woman wants to be in a sweaty box with a fly-covered loser.

319
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,360
Get out.

320
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,640
You, if you have an extra computer, send it.

321
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,560
Some themes come back in waves over and over throughout the newsletter.

322
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,080
Oh, speaking of waves, I think we've got one.

323
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,600
I think we caught a wave.

324
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,640
Is it a new wave?

325
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,820
It's a head wave.

326
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,120
Oh, it's an old Dave.

327
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,800
Oh, that's my favorite Dave.

328
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,500
Two of those foreheads with the ripples in them.

329
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,040
When they have, what's the name of that disease that produces gigantism?

330
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,560
And you get to be over seven feet tall and 300 pounds.

331
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,360
Gigantism.

332
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,080
Gigantism.

333
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,940
It makes like a scallop shape on your forehead.

334
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,020
And then if you intermarry too many times, the scallops turn to shrimp and you die.

335
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,700
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,340
Ew, what a way to go.

337
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Now, don't make fun.

338
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,380
These are the legends of Dave's people.

339
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,600
Oh, okay.

340
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,880
This is true.

341
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:09,860
I'm sorry.

342
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,280
I didn't mean to show disrespect.

343
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,880
No, I never saw it before, but there is a giant's grave out here.

344
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,800
It goes back to the days of the Indians telling the colonial settlers that there were giants

345
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,620
buried over there.

346
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,020
And for over 200 years, people have gone, yeah, that's where the giants are buried.

347
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,780
And there were even elaborate theories on the internet about that they were Swedes and

348
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,260
Vikings who had intermarried rather than becoming part of the tribes when the last little ice

349
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,900
age happened.

350
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,180
There were giants on the earth in those days, in those Daves.

351
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,880
Real giants.

352
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,380
Smoked a big pipe too.

353
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,440
Well, you know, you find a mastodon skull and you'd figure it was a cyclops.

354
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,720
Or you might figure it was one of your neighbors burying their friends.

355
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,420
Well, a really big friend with one big hole in the middle of his skull.

356
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:03,580
Well.

357
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,260
They didn't, you know, if you haven't seen an elephant, you wouldn't know it was a nosehole

358
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,640
instead of a giant eye socket.

359
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,040
A solitary nosehole.

360
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,360
Well, the elephant skulls look like cyclops skulls from the front, especially if cyclopses

361
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,620
are assumed to have tusks.

362
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:27,660
Well, we can't assume very much about cyclopses, or cyclopses, because the simiads, as they

363
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:35,560
were, C-Y-N-E-A-D-S, as they were once called, may return to the earth someday and take it

364
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:35,740
back.

365
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,720
But they're not real yetis as we know them yet.

366
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,760
The simiads, did you say?

367
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,060
I think.

368
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,260
I might have the wrong mythological beef.

369
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,180
Oh, I thought you were talking about the scientific stuff like cyclopses and giants.

370
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,460
I thought he was talking about something related to synovial fluid in one's joints.

371
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,200
Synovial fluid, if it's extracted and placed in their brains, though, produces some pretty

372
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,620
dangerous results.

373
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,100
Not to them, but to the people around them.

374
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,400
That sounds like a really bad idea.

375
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,820
What other things were the doctors doing around you when you were in there, Dave?

376
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,980
Oh, making and taking measurements, learning to pronounce the words right.

377
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,020
I talked to them, and they said I wasn't communicative, you know.

378
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,400
And they just didn't understand what the hell I was talking about, so I had to instruct

379
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,840
them in language skills and certain various ways.

380
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,420
And, uh...

381
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,100
How did your doctors react to all of this, Dave?

382
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,180
A bar stool on the head and a couple pokes in the eye usually calmed me down for a while.

383
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,060
Sometimes I used electroshock on my feet.

384
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,320
Ow!

385
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,020
Well, they're being thoughtful when they do that.

386
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,860
Yeah, they don't want me to run away, but they don't want to hurt me, I guess, too much

387
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,360
or something.

388
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,780
They didn't want to hurt you?

389
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,480
What kind of doctors are those?

390
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,700
Yeah, really.

391
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,980
That's what I told them.

392
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,920
I said, look, you know, you're doing half a job for twice the work here, and you're getting

393
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
very little results.

394
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,460
I need a pummeling.

395
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,000
Or as you used to say, beat me to a pulpit.

396
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,440
I'm praying for some pain.

397
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,060
Yeah, I was reminded of that old, old song.

398
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,820
The old cowboy song.

399
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,280
Old LCD standard.

400
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,240
Just like that old-time Bob religion, you know, it's the opposite of...

401
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,480
Well, I don't want to say it and get into any arguments.

402
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,680
The opposite of any argument.

403
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,620
Anything good, clean, sane, or decent, yes, I know.

404
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,260
We know.

405
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,180
That sunk in about year three or so.

406
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:51,280
When we realized Bob wasn't going to be unlocking that dungeon basement door anytime soon.

407
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,320
No, but we're hoping that Bastille will be stormed, at least not, you know, overcast.

408
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,100
It better happen quick, because the hot water heater's leaking down there in that dungeon

409
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,620
basement.

410
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,060
It is.

411
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,200
It is.

412
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,420
The Bobby souls, or...

413
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,020
Well, the water's rising.

414
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,440
The water's rising, friends.

415
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,820
Oh, man.

416
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,980
Maybe I shouldn't be telling everybody that that's what's happening to the souls

417
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,020
of people who bought subgenius memberships.

418
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,680
They're not, like, completely drowned yet or anything, and probably the guy from the

419
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,280
repair place will be there tomorrow.

420
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,840
Yeah, I mean, this would...

421
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,060
Bob said these can...

422
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,360
These soul canisters were insured for...

423
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,500
It's like, how did G. Gordon Gordon put it?

424
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,260
If...

425
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:37,260
If a volcano erupted and my basement was filled with hot lava, the souls would be fine.

426
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,000
Right.

427
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,700
But they didn't say anything about a water leak.

428
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:40,940
Water.

429
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,240
No.

430
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,340
Or, you know, sludge.

431
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,060
We know they're safe from lava, but I don't know about water.

432
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,280
Melting snow might be different.

433
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,320
Much like the Witch of the West, there is a form of hydrophobia, or fear of water going

434
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,980
around in the collective souls that have already been huffed, re-huffed numerous times.

435
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,420
That would explain why they smell that way.

436
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:00,620
Yeah.

437
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,500
Well, it's a bureaucratic error, usually, is what causes the first unholy emissions,

438
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,600
as they call them in the business.

439
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:09,840
But...

440
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,120
Man, that smell permeates, too.

441
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,640
It's bad.

442
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,720
Really bad.

443
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,060
Yeah.

444
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,980
It leaves, like, a great ooze on your hands sometimes, and, you know, like a mummy's curse

445
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,440
thing, you know, things start flying around the room, and you have dreams.

446
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,340
Little elves are talking you, talking you to go to the mall with the large cannon or

447
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,440
something, you know, or...

448
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
That's crazy stuff.

449
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:37,040
But seriously, you know, if those souls get smudged or stinky, the aliens won't give us

450
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,820
nearly as much money for them, or, well, money, quote, unquote.

451
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,000
They won't give us as much safety and impunity from the end of the world.

452
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,300
Impunity.

453
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,760
If the souls, you know, if the souls that Bob ultimately pays them with...

454
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,440
Are tainted.

455
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,280
...are stepped on, you know, tainted.

456
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,580
Right.

457
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,420
If the admin costs don't somehow exceed the actual cost...

458
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,240
...of production of the salvation required or...

459
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,400
Which always happens.

460
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
...specified, well, did in the past, as you said.

461
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,420
What was it, Princess, where you said Neegi's Law was at work?

462
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,120
Yes.

463
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,240
With all of our old appliances.

464
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,380
I was afraid to say it, but...

465
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,700
But Bob's Law was working with our new appliances.

466
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,540
Yes.

467
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,560
Which all work, even though they were somebody else's old appliances, most of them.

468
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,780
But they're new to us.

469
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,180
Yeah.

470
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,560
And they're wonderful.

471
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,680
And a lot newer than the appliances we had.

472
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,740
Unfortunately...

473
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:33,960
Unfortunately, our physical shells are not in such an easily replaced condition.

474
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:42,460
Well, I think we need to have the urgency, get out there to the subgenia and the non-subgenia

475
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:48,840
out there to promote health of appliances, heating equipment, and things like that for

476
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:56,020
all of those people so callously enveloped in all of this, as well as their mortal shells,

477
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,720
which seem to be scuffed up like bad shit.

478
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:58,980
But I don't want you to look at any of this yet, constantly decreases their corset

479
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:58,980


480
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:58,980


481
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,800
and shoes, and return to their original luster or at least something like that, you know,

482
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,980
with their wearable condition.

483
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,560
Well, this is a major think-through about this.

484
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,280
Will Bond ready to follow suit withiggle?

485
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,260
When do you think going to force the

486
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,800
next Walt Disney School for you and Paul in the Christmas Season with a choice of

487
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:17,800


488
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,700
Many years.

489
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,120
Yeah.

490
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,240
I think that brought you to a bad place.

491
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,200
Ah, yeah.

492
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
I think Bob wants to get back into the food market, and to share some yummynent shafts

493
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,700
with Stacy brevellins, Matt zooming right into these mark-nùles tree nedzberger ice 99.

494
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,920
where, you know, having two faces, one on the back of your head,

495
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,000
especially this time of the year, you know, for some of the celebrants,

496
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,120
it's an important thing to look both ways before crossing the street.

497
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,640
So this way you can always, you know, keep an eye on your own ass,

498
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,440
as they like to say, without federal regulations,

499
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,280
and keep your nose firmly in the future where it shouldn't be.

500
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,460
Well, didn't they put you in one of those schools for the kids with the two faces,

501
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,360
this one on the back of their head and the regular one?

502
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,220
Well, that was a big part of re-education.

503
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,500
Everybody had to have that.

504
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,800
I just like that.

505
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,260
Especially, like, Mom, the Mom figure, Connie.

506
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,980
And I think she sold a lot of rugs doing that, you know?

507
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,700
I mean, being there, like, it wasn't like the other kids at Montauk

508
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,100
or the other places where they had mind-control experiments.

509
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,040
I was one of the kids who was safely in the hands of...

510
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,160
You were in town.

511
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,600
Yeah, I was in town.

512
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,980
They didn't have to brainwash you.

513
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,300
You were ready for...

514
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,640
You were ahead of the game there.

515
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,600
Your brain was already washed.

516
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,060
Yep.

517
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,680
Washed clean of all social anomalies, all kinds of specifics.

518
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,980
I mean, the details were in there at one time,

519
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,860
but now they're just, you know, it's like somebody took an eraser

520
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,760
and shoved it in my ear.

521
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,120
You're a lucky man.

522
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,180
You're a lucky man.

523
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,060
You know, most people don't get anywhere near that close

524
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,800
to Bob's state of consciousness.

525
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,180
They have to have lobotomies or car accidents or drug overdoses,

526
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,920
something to really wipe out.

527
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,380
Almost everything.

528
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,400
I enjoy especially the details of Bob's brain

529
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,900
being cryogenically kept in a jar in the basement there

530
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,360
where there are so many dark tumors right now.

531
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,040
And if you'll just please just step this way

532
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,440
and out of the way of the foley Bob dummy.

533
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,860
That really is just a dummy, folks.

534
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,720
That's not really Bob.

535
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,620
It's a clever replica.

536
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,600
Yes, yes.

537
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,620
Turn the light on four times.

538
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,780
Here it says, watch your head.

539
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,720
It's the lowest.

540
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,340
And here's the basement.

541
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,400
It gets a little wet here.

542
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,220
What, they build this place for dwarves?

543
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,660
I mean, I have to stand on my tiptoes to touch the ceiling,

544
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,760
but it's pretty short, low ceiling in here.

545
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,160
Yeah.

546
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,840
Well, most of the specifics of this place were generally worked out

547
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,000
in the year 2572 in the Axiomatic Age,

548
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,800
back in the time when the Thebans,

549
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,180
the other great cretins of history ruled the Mediterranean basin.

550
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,640
You mean it was a chapel before it was an insane asylum?

551
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,160
Of St. Dymphna, the protector of the insane.

552
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,460
St. Dymphna?

553
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,980
No, St. Dymphna, the protector of the insane,

554
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,540
for a brief time before being taken over by the one true church,

555
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,040
as we've come to call it.

556
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,460
Yeah, the church for the truly sane.

557
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,360
Huh?

558
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,780
Yeah, that sounds so ironic, of course.

559
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,740
Oh, wow.

560
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,060
But really, you know, the foundations underneath the facility

561
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,440
that Dave is talking about, they found skeletons of giants,

562
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,380
just as mentioned earlier.

563
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,060
Real giants.

564
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,500
Yeah, humanoid cyclops giants, about 18 feet tall.

565
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,240
I mean, they weren't nothing crazy or ridiculous,

566
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,680
not King Kong size.

567
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,560
You know, that'd be like 25 feet.

568
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,220
These were eight, biggest one was 18, 15 to 18 feet.

569
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,680
Wow.

570
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,700
And they were also tall.

571
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,940
Not only did they have a lot of legs, but they were very, very high.

572
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,620
Yeah, very high.

573
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,160
In those days.

574
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,100
They only needed one eye.

575
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,460
They were so high.

576
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,020
Two eyes would have been, you know, a duplication of effort.

577
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,540
Pointless.

578
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,800
And right where the pineal gland used to be.

579
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,740
They didn't need two eyes to see in 3D, you see.

580
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,380
If you were a true subgenius, a true son and daughter of the Yeti,

581
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,340
you'd be able to see in 3D with just one eye.

582
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,680
The great Snavely Eklund has shown us how well you can drive

583
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,480
with only one operative eye and a tank of nitrous in the back of your car

584
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,860
with a hose running to the front seat all the way from Little Rock to Dallas

585
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,420
with about an inch of nitrous left by the time he got there.

586
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,840
And he was still alive.

587
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,280
Proof.

588
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,200
You only need one eye if you've got a tank of nitrous.

589
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,360
And if you're Snavely,

590
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,440
you'll probably survive and keep that one remaining correct eye.

591
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,040
And if you are other people,

592
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,960
you could end up in the middle of someone's living room

593
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,180
as a couple of other friends of ours do.

594
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,320
That's right.

595
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,520
Yeah, but they only had one or two balloons

596
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,920
and they were driving a car across a neighborhood.

597
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:18,180
They weren't driving a pickup truck with a tank,

598
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,280
a medical grade giant, you know,

599
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,580
all month long tank of nitrous and inhaled it successfully.

600
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,320
No, those amateurs, who I won't name,

601
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,200
but they've been on subgenius stages before in the past.

602
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,940
Absolutely.

603
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,020
They did decide to do a hit of nitrous while driving

604
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,760
and they awoke in someone else's bedroom.

605
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,140
They were still in their car,

606
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,000
but they were in a bedroom in their car.

607
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,500
Did they go to jail for that?

608
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,580
I think they drove through the living room window

609
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,540
and the people that were watching TV

610
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,560
just had a real...

611
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,840
Really big surprise that evening.

612
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,380
Yep.

613
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,940
Kids, you know, if you're going to blow your brains out on drugs, please stay home.

614
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,760
Or, you know, maybe get on the roller coaster ride at the state fair.

615
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,400
That's fun.

616
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,960
Unless you're me.

617
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,060
It's going to be okay.

618
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,940
This music in the background.

619
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,060
Oh, yes.

620
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,000
This music.

621
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,100
What is that music behind the rolling reptile?

622
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,320
It's the mysterious Christian Blatter again.

623
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,760
This is another one of those Blatter shows.

624
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,320
It's the same one we did about a month ago.

625
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,700
It's interesting.

626
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:47,880
It's digital or it's electronic music, but done on analog keyboards and stuff.

627
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,380
Not programmed in.

628
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
It's actually fingers touching strings.

629
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,720
Like the Devo's did back in the Devo days.

630
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
In the Devonian.

631
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,560
Yes, there's real meat involved in cutting the cursor.

632
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:12,040
There's no individual, you know, screwing around with plans and programs and stuff like that.

633
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,420
Especially no sampling because he's tasted the wine already.

634
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
He knows what to head.

635
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:24,780
Well, and the other thing you can do is insert one of those long lobotomy needles down up the nasal.

636
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,220
Oh.

637
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,360
Or the eye, the corner of the eye.

638
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,840
You can get to the brain.

639
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,420
And if you know just where to wiggle it,

640
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,660
ooh, you can tickle people with your poke around the parts of their brain.

641
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,020
They'll suddenly feel like one of their legs is on fire.

642
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,180
And they'll feel like their hand is 40 miles away.

643
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,860
And it's like what they used to talk about LSD.

644
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,920
If you can get, you know, I'm talking about safety, kids.

645
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,400
This is empty.

646
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,280
You want to make sure you dip the needle.

647
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:01,600
Needle in peroxide or alcohol or something before you insert it up into your brain, your forebrain.

648
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,060
And, of course, don't try to reach all the way to the back of your brain.

649
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,320
If you do that, you'll forget how to breathe.

650
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,040
Promise.

651
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,220
Yeah, no breast clonking or otherwise messing with your pineal gland because that's already being taken care of,

652
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,540
at least in the stupor wing of the building.

653
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:16,780
Right.

654
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,660
We're taking care of that with this show right now.

655
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,280
Right.

656
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,440
Well, we're hoping to anyway because there are millions and billions.

657
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:24,780
Billions.

658
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,220
There's millions and millions and millions of people out there.

659
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,040
Not listening to this show.

660
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:32,980
Right.

661
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,120
Well, I'm acutely aware of that.

662
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,560
And we can't help those people because they can't, won't help themselves.

663
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,700
Bob helps those who helps themselves.

664
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,080
To another helping a pie.

665
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,020
Damn good pie.

666
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,020
Did I mention we watched Twin Peaks?

667
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,500
We started watching Twin Peaks again.

668
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,320
It just doesn't seem that weird anymore.

669
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,260
Seems like a documentary about any ordinary small town that I've ever been in.

670
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,740
Yeah, it's like all the weird wore off.

671
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,740
Yep.

672
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,820
Or it wore off onto everything else.

673
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,300
Yes.

674
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,540
The shock value is definitely gone and they replaced it with reality shock.

675
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,360
Right.

676
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,920
In which there is no more reality because there's so much shock.

677
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,120
In which case I must reconsider and ask that these four people, if you want to call them that,

678
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,480
be sentenced to immediate enclosure.

679
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:23,940
Yeah.

680
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,580
In a place that they don't like.

681
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,840
That's what I say.

682
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,520
And the whole time it was Bob that killed Laura Palmer.

683
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,420
Or tried.

684
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,300
But then they went and replaced Bob with her dad, Leland Palmer.

685
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,380
And then the show went way downhill after that.

686
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,000
He'd be humping on that coffin.

687
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,660
Next thing you know, they jumped the shark.

688
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,360
Just turned silly after that.

689
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,020
It was just silly.

690
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,380
Whatever.

691
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,100
After they explained Bob.

692
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,300
Yes.

693
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,460
Bob.

694
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,240
Oh, he's a demon that possessed this girl's father.

695
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,860
So the guy goes out and kills people.

696
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,360
So?

697
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,860
What, are you going to make a TV show about that?

698
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,100
Yeah, really.

699
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,500
What's it?

700
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,960
Well, you know, 13 weeks, that whole thing is gone there.

701
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,300
Except for the coffin humping, which, you know, you get millions and millions of replays

702
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,420
on your Facebook and so forth.

703
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,140
Yeah.

704
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,740
Yeah.

705
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,300
Yep.

706
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,700
That's all.

707
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,780
That's all YouTube is.

708
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,200
Is cats and coffin humping.

709
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,180
Yep.

710
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:28,860
Funny cat stuff and coffin humping serial killer dads.

711
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,020
Oh, yeah.

712
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,800
And also choking on olive pits, I guess, is a new one too.

713
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,500
Oh, really?

714
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,700
Is that a new trend?

715
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:34,960
Yeah, I guess.

716
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,000
Is that trending?

717
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,580
Well, they did that in Breaking Bad.

718
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,160
So all the kids are doing it now, choking on olive pits.

719
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:40,600
Yeah.

720
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,220
And in the holiday celebrations, there's a lot of, you know, olives around and they're

721
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,480
trying to be fancy and have the ones with the pits in them.

722
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,020
I'm going to be cool like that one guy that died on that one TV show.

723
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:50,940
Yeah.

724
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,100
I'm going to turn blue and get real high before I die.

725
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Now I'm going to be on TV.

726
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,600
They'll talk about me on Rush Limbaugh's show.

727
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,080
They'll call me a gun control hero.

728
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm an anti-gun control hero because I choked to death on this stupid olive pit.

729
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,160
Rush Limbaugh's my favorite show.

730
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm sorry if I wrongly characterized fans of popular talk radio shows, unlike this one.

731
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,400
Couldn't be less like this one.

732
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,180
Oh, friends, if you could only see Reverend Stan.

733
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,280
Oh, yeah.

734
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,680
I'd hate to put down, yeah.

735
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,500
Oh, my God.

736
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:35,140
You know, it's offensive to we southerners when people do that sort of, you know, redneck

737
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:42,920
thing as if everybody from the South was some kind of troglodytic throwback who, you know,

738
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,780
believes everything they tell themselves in bed at night.

739
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,260
Huh?

740
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,380
Yeah.

741
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,100
With some good cracking snapper with no teeth, chawing at your ear about some stupid thing

742
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,460
he heard of 2,000 years ago, which ain't no good in any other place in the world but there.

743
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,760
Well, and the thing is, people act like, oh, we're all southerners like that.

744
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,000
No.

745
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,820
Everybody's like that.

746
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,480
They just don't have the same accent.

747
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,820
I thought we were going to start talking about Tennessee Williams and Faulkner and stuff

748
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,340
like that.

749
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,520
Oh.

750
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,140
Instead, no.

751
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,760
It was actually kind of before my time.

752
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,020
It was all Crum and S. Clay Wilson and Gilbert Shelton and Robert Williams by the time I was

753
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,640
in high school.

754
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:34,500
They forget all those Hemingway dudes and old-timey Fitzgerald .

755
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,180
Oh, my God.

756
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,580
The reason I know that's all that-

757
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,300
You are on a university radio station at this present moment.

758
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,760
How dare you attack the great John F. Kennedy.

759
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,460
I like the giants of American literature, especially one swell foop without your foot

760
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,160
in the can.

761
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,760
It's just a hard . . . you know, I don't . . .

762
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,980
I like the giants of American literature, especially the ones who leave skeletons in

763
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,720
our basements.

764
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:08,480
Giant, huge, 18-footed, 18-foot-tall, millipede, Cyclops monster men.

765
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:16,020
It's the English professors that I get upset about and it's because they're so easy to

766
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,000
a fool. I didn't read

767
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,940
any of those novels

768
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,060
that I got straight A's on my essays

769
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,120
about. I just heard

770
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,080
I listened to whatever

771
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,000
kind of

772
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,440
highfalutin baloney

773
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,800
the English teacher was

774
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,280
attributing to these various

775
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,900
great American and

776
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,560
British novels and things.

777
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,180
I'd hear him say that

778
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,940
and I'd just reword it slightly

779
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,860
in an essay and because I'd said

780
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,600
what he said, he'd give me an A+.

781
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,700
Even though it was a bunch of nonsense.

782
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,020
So kids, here's the thing.

783
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,000
You don't need to study.

784
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,860
Just listen to what the

785
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,520
teacher says and tell him what he

786
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,880
wants to hear. You don't

787
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,680
have to know or remember

788
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,900
any of it. Only long enough to

789
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,820
tell him what he wants to hear. And you know what he wants

790
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,560
to hear. You know,

791
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,960
pi to 195 decimals.

792
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,040
Sure, whip it out.

793
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,860
He's not going to ask you again.

794
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,900
And you've been there a couple times. You know what the

795
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,780
sucker wants. A lot of them want to be loved

796
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,420
by the students. That's all they want.

797
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,820
They just want love. They want your

798
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,760
attention, your affection. Hey, and you know, that's

799
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,820
going to cost them a little bit of seniority. Things happen

800
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,620
in there and maybe next year they'll get tenure

801
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,460
and stuff if they get more students saying

802
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,880
this class was great. The guy gave

803
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,860
me an A and I was an idiot.

804
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,060
Right.

805
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Well, that's how schools work now.

806
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,380
Everybody's happy.

807
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,460
Everybody's flunky.

808
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Nobody can read. They all give each other

809
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:45,840
A's.

810
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,040
And everybody's happy.

811
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
And they go to get a job

812
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,240
and they take

813
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,980
to go, I don't

814
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,860
really know what I want to do, so I'll join the army.

815
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,860
We know it was, didn't we

816
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,600
know somebody who

817
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,840
his kid took the test

818
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,920
to see

819
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,460
if you're smart enough to be

820
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,780
in the army

821
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,800
and flunked. And this

822
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,600
was somebody who just graduated from

823
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,680
a fancy schmancy

824
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,220
Ohio high school.

825
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,980
And could not pass the test

826
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,200
to get in the army.

827
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,840
The army!

828
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,980
Do you happen to know this school district

829
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,020
this student received his

830
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,020
poor education?

831
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,240
No, I don't remember.

832
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,120
Do you know?

833
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,760
No, I don't know. It's not ringing any bells.

834
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,940
You would not want to say it because it is a rumor

835
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,060
and if you were to say it was X, Y,

836
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,240
or Z high school, then perhaps

837
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,380
they could sue you.

838
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,920
Well, it could be worse. It could be Texas or Kansas.

839
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,520
But...

840
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,020
Oh, yeah.

841
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,120
I guess we'd all be like that down there

842
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,100
right away, wouldn't I?

843
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,860
You know, they'd all be substandard

844
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,960
and therefore subgenius, I guess.

845
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,320
But how important

846
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,840
is it to have

847
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,680
correct grammar in this day and age?

848
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,600
Obviously, it doesn't

849
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,720
help you to get a job

850
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,620
as a proofreader for the newspaper

851
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,560
or the websites

852
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,000
because they let anything get by.

853
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,640
Anything, just about.

854
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,080
Even in the headlines.

855
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,420
I'm a grammar nerd.

856
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,140
I'm a grammar Nazi, you see.

857
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,540
Pity us grammar Nazis

858
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,820
because there's so few of us left.

859
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,340
We're a dying breed.

860
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,780
Well, I will not pity you

861
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,160
because we're so well hated.

862
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,240
You've accused me of being a retard

863
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,740
numerous times and yet I

864
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,420
am also a grammar Nazi to some degree.

865
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,180
And, you know,

866
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,340
I just went off on people

867
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,260
sometimes like, no, that's not

868
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,560
the way to close a quote.

869
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,560
That's stupid.

870
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,120
That's stupid.

871
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,480
That's stupid to people.

872
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,400
You don't tell them that they're dumb

873
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,660
because they made a mistake.

874
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,720
Many other people, maybe once at one time,

875
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,520
I said, irregardless isn't a word.

876
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,840
Irregardless isn't a word.

877
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,160
And they just looked at me like,

878
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,900
Dave, please calm down.

879
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,420
You're under too much stress right now.

880
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,280
Well, just a couple of nights ago,

881
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,040
Princess Wee was furious

882
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,600
because in her, she was

883
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,260
sending out a newsletter about

884
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,440
Starwood or something.

885
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,980
She wanted to use the phrase,

886
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,960
gift your friends with a ticket to Starwood.

887
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,800
Well, the top

888
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,660
grammar Nazi of the club went,

889
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,920
you can't say that.

890
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,160
It's not gift, it's not a verb.

891
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,680
And I lost my temper.

892
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,540
I said, fine, fine.

893
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,620
I'll just change it.

894
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,660
At least the grammar will be right.

895
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,960
It won't be as cool, but at least the grammar will be right.

896
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,300
But then I sided with the other

897
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,440
grammar Nazi and said, Princess Wee,

898
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,420
frankly, I'm one of those people when I hear somebody go,

899
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,660
and then you can gift your friend with,

900
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,460
I just want to scream.

901
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,280
That's a,

902
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,300
a phrase that people started using

903
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,360
about 10 years ago.

904
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,740
Somebody must have said it on some

905
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,180
Saturday Night Live thing

906
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,740
or something, some billboard

907
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,980
or, you know, gift.

908
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,380
Suddenly it was a verb

909
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,300
and everybody was saying it.

910
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,220
But that's okay.

911
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,720
That's okay because it's all good.

912
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,320
I'd like to do some things to some people

913
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,980
and then say, well, is it still all good?

914
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,660
He said it was all good.

915
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,020
Look at what I'm showing you.

916
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,760
Is it all good?

917
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,820
Look at this picture of this child

918
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,980
with this being done to it.

919
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,460
Now tell me, say that phrase again.

920
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,700
I love that phrase. It's all good.

921
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,760
Well, if you wanted to do that,

922
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,020
the response, all is well,

923
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,280
would not be that good either.

924
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,140
So, you know,

925
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,080
you have to at least fornicate your pillow

926
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,320
with that every night just before you dream off.

927
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,820
I mean, I could,

928
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,760
I could just as well say,

929
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,200
it's all tragic.

930
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,200
That'd be just about as accurate.

931
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,880
Not everything is tragic.

932
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,860
Every now and then something really good happens.

933
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,280
Well, according to the great yogis,

934
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,360
all is suffering

935
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,400
because of fear of potential

936
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,080
suffering.

937
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,020
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

938
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,340
The only thing we have to fear is

939
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,960
fear itself.

940
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,820
And large, large alligators in the backyard.

941
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,440
And, yeah,

942
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,700
and fascist troops knocking the door.

943
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,560
And thinking the wrong thoughts.

944
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,760
These are all the only thing we have to worry about

945
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,420
is worry.

946
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,560
Well, Dr. Sinister

947
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,080
just walked in, completely uninvited,

948
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,860
just sat right down at the mic.

949
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,060
What you gonna do about it?

950
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,700
Joel did that earlier.

951
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,240
Like, okay, Joel, your show's over.

952
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,600
Well, I guess not for him.

953
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,600
Yeah, now we've got Dr. Sinister here.

954
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,500
And then Dave goes and calls in

955
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,760
as if just, oh, let's just call up

956
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,800
and interrupt Prince of Wales.

957
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:42,800


958
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:42,800


959
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:42,800


960
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,180
Princess Wee's interesting reading

961
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,420
of that kook newsletter.

962
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,420
Now, the only reason anyone knows that I'm here

963
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,420
is because you told them.

964
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:48,980
That's right.

965
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,020
I was in ghost mode.

966
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,800
I was sitting in front of a microphone

967
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,100
with headphones on.

968
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,960
Well, mainly I just wanted to hear

969
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,740
what Lonesome Cowboy Dave was saying.

970
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,380
No one else knew that until you.

971
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,220
I was just gonna ask Dr.

972
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:01,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

973
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,640
I'm sorry, too.

974
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,800
Don't be sorry, Dave.

975
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,960
I might have just added sound effects for you or something.

976
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,480
Or nothing.

977
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,520
I'm sorry about everything.

978
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
Well, I thought that Dr. Sinister

979
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
was at least gonna talk a little bit about

980
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,540
the ghosts

981
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,680
of the former CPN studios there,

982
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,460
which are now CSB Studios.

983
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,980
The ghost of Bobby Jackson walks these halls.

984
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,000
That must be an inside joke

985
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,580
for Clevelanders or something.

986
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,100
I just read this in the Plain Dealer today

987
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,080
that he died last week.

988
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,100
He was the host of a jazz program on CPN.

989
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:38,820
Oh.

990
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,720
And it was a good one, too.

991
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,620
Somebody died?

992
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,820
Imagine that.

993
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,680
Imagine that.

994
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,780
What a terrible thing.

995
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,440
What if that happened to me someday?

996
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,280
Oh, thank goodness that one.

997
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,740
I don't have to...

998
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,700
Every five minutes,

999
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,920
I go through that realization.

1000
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,200
Well, what am I worried about?

1001
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,160
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1002
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,700
It's father for fun.

1003
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,360
That's where humor comes from.

1004
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,780
More, more, more, more, more, more, more.

1005
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,040
Ah, mortality.

1006
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,520
Cool, man.

1007
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,800
That's when a huge 100-ton weight

1008
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,300
like in a Monty Python thing

1009
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,360
falls down on the guy.

1010
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,360
After he sings that.

1011
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,060
He's wearing a tuxedo

1012
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,320
and he has a real long nose

1013
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,760
that's pointed up at the end and stuff

1014
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,360
and a pair of like real small bifocals.

1015
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,480
Kind of like a...

1016
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,520
Oh, never mind.

1017
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,400
Well, you know,

1018
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,900
the difference between those clever Monty Python shows

1019
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,440
and reality shows now

1020
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,220
is that now,

1021
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,020
they really do drop a 20-ton weight

1022
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,000
on some jerk.

1023
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:46,660
Yes.

1024
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,520
Who's, you know,

1025
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,520
who's signed a release

1026
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,240
to have that be done.

1027
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,540
And they sell dead parrots and everything

1028
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,860
and then people come back

1029
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,200
and they complain, you know,

1030
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,280
you said you used to sleep

1031
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,100
and stuff like that.

1032
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,000
It's just pining for the fjords.

1033
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,280
Yeah.

1034
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,800
Yeah, and they have people

1035
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,660
that come in sometimes

1036
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,360
and not...

1037
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,820
Well, they don't come in

1038
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,500
and we see them now on the streets

1039
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,920
hitting themselves on each side

1040
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,680
of the head with bricks.

1041
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,800
No, those are their...

1042
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,060
Smartphones.

1043
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,780
Oh, yeah, okay.

1044
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,460
I was wondering what they were doing.

1045
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,380
Listen, there's some certain video games

1046
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,480
where you have to beat your head

1047
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,860
in time to music.

1048
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,480
Pun, pun, pata, pun, pun, pun.

1049
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,920
Oh, no, no, it's pata, pata, pun, pun, pata, pun.

1050
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,680
Oh, no, it's good.

1051
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,020
You sound like an evil music teacher, man.

1052
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,020
I wouldn't know.

1053
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,240
I never had any music teacher.

1054
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,480
Well, you can imagine

1055
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,740
a mean old lady going,

1056
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,240
pata, no, it's pata, pata, pata,

1057
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,580
not pata, pata, pata, pata, pata, pata.

1058
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,740
Not pata, pata, pata.

1059
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,220
It's pata, pata, pata, pata, pata, pata, pata.

1060
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,040
And that's usually

1061
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,360
when they expire one day.

1062
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,660
You come to lessons

1063
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,640
and stuff like that.

1064
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,600
Oh, Mrs. Hopsburg

1065
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,700
already passed away.

1066
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,040
She's gone the way

1067
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,660
of the Grand Dukes and Dutchies.

1068
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,160
You know, you have to get

1069
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,700
into an argument with a bicycle

1070
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,180
or some other freaking appliance.

1071
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,380
Let's go.

1072
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,940
I think Christian Blatter owes an explanation to the Devo's.

1073
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,540
Yeah.

1074
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,020
The Devo's owe an explanation to who?

1075
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,240
Kraftwerk or somebody?

1076
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,480
Yeah.

1077
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,920
They were always talking about David Bowie.

1078
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,980
Now, who is this that we're listening to?

1079
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,900
An unknown Christian Blatter.

1080
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,220
Christian Blatter.

1081
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,020
Yes, a subgenius.

1082
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,740
Named Christian.

1083
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,380
Yeah.

1084
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,040
Well, who knows?

1085
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:40,660
Right.

1086
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,500
Well, I'll be wrong.

1087
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,520
I haven't known me with that name.

1088
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,900
Bob.

1089
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:01,520
Bob from the Devo's was telling me one time, he was talking about David Bowie and how great David Bowie was.

1090
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,360
I was going, what does that have to do with the Devo's?

1091
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,860
And he said, well, Devo is the thinking man's Dave Bowie.

1092
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,560
What?

1093
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:10,800
What?

1094
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,360
I just never, I don't, that doesn't, I don't.

1095
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,100
It depends on what you're thinking about.

1096
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,120
I guess so.

1097
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:18,380
Yeah, really.

1098
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,860
Music critics can take a lot of leaps, and it's kind of like, which direction am I going to go here, you know?

1099
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,120
And let's go north and create some sort of analogy that doesn't go with anything.

1100
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,220
Now, here's some inside gossip about Devo, okay?

1101
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,200
I was helped on one of their music videos.

1102
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,880
There was a set of an alleyway.

1103
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,520
And Sprite, there was different.

1104
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,660
There was graffiti Sprite painted on the set.

1105
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,020
And including a praise Bob, I think.

1106
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:54,980
But very, Jerry Casale insisted that the phrase three way is best be seen clearly.

1107
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,040
And I kind of looked at him funny.

1108
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,620
He goes, well, you know, that's really what Devo's all about.

1109
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:08,920
I mean, if you could like sum up what Devo's all about in one phrase, frankly, just between you and me, that's really it.

1110
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,340
Three.

1111
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,000
Three is best.

1112
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,880
Are they talking about chili?

1113
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,000
No, he's talking about chili.

1114
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,540
Yeah, yes, Dr. Sinister.

1115
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,340
That's right.

1116
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,520
That's all there is.

1117
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:26,520
In the world of Malay or perhaps in this clan, he envisioned a world where there were three sexes.

1118
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:40,400
And there was an obfuscating third unit, which kind of was an attractive middle force for these other two sexes, which are very, very, very difficult to understand.

1119
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:58,060
I could tell you another Devo gossip story having to do with that very thing, which the self-same Jerry Casale boasted to me loudly in a restaurant so that everybody was kind of turning their head and going, whoa.

1120
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:10,100
It was a story of a groupie that the day after he was told that this groupie that had serviced him in some way was, in fact.

1121
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:15,820
A post-operative transsexual and had been born a boy.

1122
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,360
Even better than the real thing.

1123
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:24,000
And Jerry loudly proclaimed, and I said, no wonder it was so dry.

1124
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:33,360
Oh, that is a very, very unusual story.

1125
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,420
Here's another Devo restaurant story.

1126
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,580
Sitting in Spago's in Los Angeles.

1127
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,060
You can tell.

1128
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,420
At one time, I was.

1129
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,080
A more prosperous sort of individual.

1130
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:51,440
Sitting in Spago's in L.A., Mark Mothersbaugh poured out fake sugar and cut it into lines.

1131
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,380
And just left it on the table.

1132
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:58,400
And we started getting some really dirty looks.

1133
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:02,780
They were probably envious looks, this being rich restaurant in Los Angeles.

1134
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,960
Right, Los Angeles, yeah.

1135
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:04,540
Yeah.

1136
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:10,400
But, I mean, the funny thing is Mark Mothersbaugh wasn't doing any drugs at all in those.

1137
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,740
At least in those days.

1138
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,960
I don't know about now.

1139
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,920
But in those days, he was pretty straight edge.

1140
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,700
And so, he could afford to draw that kind of attention.

1141
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,400
Because he was just pranking.

1142
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,760
But I think the other guy we were with was very upset.

1143
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,480
Because he probably had the real thing in his pocket.

1144
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,480
Oh, well.

1145
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,660
So, there's my rock star gossip.

1146
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,720
I've gone and I've shown my age.

1147
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,580
And then, did you know Frank Sinatra had one of those colostomy bags?

1148
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,460
I had to clean his colostomy bag at one time.

1149
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,860
And then, Gwar, they're all morphodites.

1150
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,340
Every one of them.

1151
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,860
I walked into a room and Mick Jagger was in bed with Paul McCartney.

1152
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,460
And Guillermo del Toro.

1153
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,360
That was strange.

1154
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,520
He was only about eight.

1155
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,320
Well, the three way is best.

1156
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,780
Yeah, three way is best.

1157
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,320
There you go.

1158
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,520
That's the moral of all rock bands.

1159
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:06,780
Baby chastisers.

1160
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:10,640
You know, that puts a different kind of slant on the whole thing.

1161
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:18,860
When you realize that infantilism is a very, very important part of transsexual behavior in the rock and roll business.

1162
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,520
It is not.

1163
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,920
Oh, now he made poopy again and we have to clean it up again.

1164
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,140
Where's the diaper read?

1165
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,340
And I guess that makes him very happy.

1166
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,800
Where's the diaper ration ointment?

1167
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,760
I meant that.

1168
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,180
I wasn't being facetious.

1169
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,920
Where is the diaper ration ointment?

1170
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,140
I misplaced it.

1171
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,080
It wasn't my pocket.

1172
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,640
I think it's a ratio of seven to five.

1173
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:40,640


1174
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:40,640


1175
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,960
You know you want bag bomb.

1176
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,980
What are you messing with that stuff for?

1177
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,520
That's true.

1178
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,960
Bag bomb is all you really need for anything.

1179
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,020
Right.

1180
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,220
Especially you want bag bomb from the Pleistocene era.

1181
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,280
You want something that goes back a little bit.

1182
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,660
So when you reach behind yourself there, you know history is behind you.

1183
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,500
I'm sorry to be resonant.

1184
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,680
At least official anyway.

1185
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,760
I'm not looking at the right documents right now.

1186
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,840
My head's upside down.

1187
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,260
Well, why don't you use the eyes in the back?

1188
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,200
You know, that's the way you can always watch your back.

1189
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Well, you know that the great god Kronos could look both backwards and forwards in his head.

1190
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:30,720
And on the island of Crete here, many, many Cretans have adopted the same look, the style,

1191
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:39,400
and the casual elan, let's say, of an early replica of a dothead.

1192
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,040
Oh, yeah.

1193
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:40,580
Right.

1194
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,760
That's right.

1195
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:41,780
That's right.

1196
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:43,820
That's right.

1197
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,220
That's right.

1198
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,100
That's right.

1199
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:46,200
I mean, that's the way it is.

1200
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,200


1201
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:52,560
Well, I hope Miss Tori does her portrait of Lonesome Cowboy Dave while listening to this

1202
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,040
show.

1203
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,600
We have a friend who is talking about, she was kind of stuck for subject matter.

1204
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,580
She wanted to do a painting.

1205
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,540
I said, well, do a painting of what you think Lonesome Cowboy Dave looks like.

1206
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,640
So I figured she didn't really, there aren't that many pictures of Dave out.

1207
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,240
Unless you go to supermarkets a lot.

1208
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,100
And you see him at point of purchase, all those magazines with Kim Kardashian.

1209
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,220
But most people don't know that that's Dave.

1210
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,160
He doesn't go by the same name.

1211
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:25,120
If you do a search, I'll just bet you would find images of the Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1212
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,120
If you did a search, I'll bet you would find it.

1213
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,600
You could Google it.

1214
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,540
Yes, Google it.

1215
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,300
Google Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1216
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,580
Oh, I can do that right now, except that we got to get off the air in a second.

1217
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:39,260
You had to remind her that her assessment was correct, except there is no more hair.

1218
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:47,480
Yes, you may not have actual hair, but you have a hair aura, Dave.

1219
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,240
It's really pretty thick and full.

1220
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:57,020
People on the radio never look like you expect them to look, unless you're very, very highly trained psychic.

1221
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,440
And here's the number to call right now.

1222
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,520
I have my pencil poised.

1223
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,160
It's the charge of the sub-G's.

1224
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,200
I forgot the address.

1225
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:06,940
Oh.

1226
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,240
Constant.

1227
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:09,240


1228
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:09,640
Sarnet?

1229
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,640
What is it?

1230
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,960
What is the address of the church of the sub-G's?

1231
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,460
Oh, you guys haven't memorized all that, have you?

1232
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:19,240
No.

1233
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,840
No, you are.

1234
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,500
Oh, that's right.

1235
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,780
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack with the church of the sub-G's.

1236
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:33,820
For more information, you can go to subgenius.com or write to, drop us a self-addressed stamp envelope to that post office box.

1237
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,240
That's post office box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 410.

1238
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,240


1239
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,720
44118.

1240
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,400
I'm typing in Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1241
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:49,160
God, what do you mean?

1242
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:49,980
Yahoo search.

1243
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,740
Amazon.com, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Para-Ubu, MP3 downloads.

1244
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,520
See, they have the song and not me, the character.

1245
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,260
And then it says subgenius hour.

1246
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,920
Oh, and there are pictures of Dave.

1247
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:06,920
I told you.

1248
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,980
There's the double mean baby head from the video I made.

1249
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:19,500
There's Dave's song, the president's on the rag, or what was the name of that?

1250
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,940
The president's on the phone.

1251
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:22,540
Yeah.

1252
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,440
Yeah.

1253
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:34,760
Oh, and then there's something called the Just Dave Band with a song called Lonesome Ornery and Mean.

1254
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,900
So, you know, that's it.

1255
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,820
That's the internet for you.

1256
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:45,160
Well, with that, we really need to wrap up because this is the end of the hour of slack.

1257
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,260
And it's time to wrap this baby up.

1258
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:47,760
Yeah.

1259
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,180
Buenas noches.

1260
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,160
Todo cual.

1261
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,500
Okay.

1262
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,380
Okay.

1263
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,000
Mulky, pokey, pot and tame.

1264
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,100
Okay.

1265
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,480
Mulky, pokey, pot and tame.

1266
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:56,700
Yeah, send me an email.

1267
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,140
Send me an email so I can see if I'm still emailable.

1268
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,600
Reverend Stang is looking at a cat on the internet.

1269
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:01,780
Oh, yeah.

1270
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,140
Did your computer turn on and go online?

1271
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,820
It turned on and I was...

1272
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,520
I was capable of emailing myself, but I don't know about anything else in the mind myself.

1273
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,640
Okay, yeah.

1274
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,120
If you like emailing me tonight, that would be really swell.

1275
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,420
And if not, well, screw that, man.

1276
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,820
I don't care.

1277
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,580
You know.

1278
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,240
Okay.

1279
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:24,280
I wrote it on my hand, even though writing on your hand is what causes cancer.

1280
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,880
And Alzheimer's.

1281
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,220
Yeah.

1282
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:26,620
Oh, that's right.

1283
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,780
It's Alzheimer's, not cancer.

1284
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,740
Yes, it's the Sharpie.

1285
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,040
Licking postage stamps causes cancer.

1286
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,640
Right.

1287
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,160
It's writing on your hand that causes Alzheimer's.

1288
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,400
Get your urban legends together, dude.

1289
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:36,800
I did both.

1290
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:36,800


1291
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,180
I did both, and that's my problem.

1292
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,220
See, the postage stamps didn't cause cancer back when they made the glue out of horses.

1293
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,080
Right.

1294
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,420
Yeah.

1295
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,860
It was nutritious then.

1296
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:44,260
It just made you...

1297
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,600
It just eventually turned you French from consuming horse products.

1298
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,120
It make you me.

1299
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,280
Oui, oui.

1300
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,500
Oui, oui.

1301
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,280
And with that, I say doo-doo and goodbye.

1302
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,600
Goodbye, Dave.

1303
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:58,540
And I hope there's no cussing on this record I'm leaving on.

1304
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,380
Bye, Dave.

1305
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,960
Stronger than the people that we are, set flight.

1306
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,240
They ignite.

1307
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:06,760
They ignite.

1308
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1309
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1310
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1311
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1312
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1313
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1314
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1315
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1316
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1317
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:06,760


1318
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,500
Let's move forward.

1319
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:07,500


1320
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,120
This is our final hour.

1321
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:15,700
Let's all hold our hands.

1322
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:21,580
As the world falls apart, together we'll stand.

1323
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,720
Let's stand together.

1324
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,180
Let's all hold our hands.

1325
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,880
Let's all hold our hands.

1326
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:34,340
As the world falls apart, together we'll stand.

1327
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,260
They're all ready.

1328
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:36,640
Yeah.

1329
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:36,780
You ever heard of Queen of Lies.

1330
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1331
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1332
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1333
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1334
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1335
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1336
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1337
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1338
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1339
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1340
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1341
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1342
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1343
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1344
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,780


1345
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,800
Goodbye.

1346
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,420
Submarines, Submarines, 666-Fantasy.
