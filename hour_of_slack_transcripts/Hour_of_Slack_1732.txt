From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.
All right, Mac.
You got it?
Yeah.
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.
Handle it gentle now.
All right.
I've got it.
Here.
All right.
One, two, four, three.
The subgenius power of slash.
I'll crawl in first.
Good, though.
Okay, now, let's get to work.
Here.
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.
Six grenades.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
Welcome, futurists, cyberphiles, and the rest of you dateless wonders.
And now, to push this convention into hyperspace,
the man who put the star in Star Wars,
a real bird on the Darth Vader's saddle,
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Yes?
You got it, Bob.
Hello and welcome.
Our topic today is UFOs.
Of course, that's just the start.
Throughout recorded history,
human society has been haunted by reports of unidentified flying objects in our skies,
many of which have defied all attempts at scientific explanation or understanding.
What are these phenomenon, and how can they be explained?
With me today is Terence McKenna,
a philosopher and thinker of note in the area of altered space,
and the world's most famous UFO expert.
He's been studying the state of consciousness in alternative realities.
Yes, well, the ordinary approach to the UFOs
has been to view them as visitors or intruders from a nearby star system
that have come in metal ships for reasons of trade or scientific investigation or military conquest.
Or missionary activities.
Or missionary activities.
Let me tell you, you're not the missionary type.
You never last.
And incidentally, you want to do mankind a real service?
Tell me.
Tell me some funnier joke.
And therefore, it is threatening.
And this is one of the reasons that I think it relates to the psychedelic experience.
Because the psychedelic experience is like a UFO encounter on demand.
You know...
Whoa, another acid flashback.
Whoa, another acid flashback.
Whoa, another acid flashback.
Whoa, another acid flashback.
Half your yellow will lift you into orbit.
Real rocket man.
I'll take two.
That would probably kill a horse.
I said I'll take two.
Oh, whatever.
They decide to have this curious, symmetry-breaking kind of experience.
What I have tried to say to the UFO community is...
I don't want my mom to die!
You need some help?
Let him go, Ralph.
He knows what he's doing.
We will not really have a deep understanding of what the contact experience is
until we include data from the psychedelic experience as a legitimate data to be included when looking at the problem.
The UFO phenomenon is a modern manifestation of pixies, elves, fairies, sprites, demons, whatever you wish to call them.
Angels.
Angels.
Mm-hmm.
And I'm gonna kö Alban,
friend and partner.

Attention please!
We have just received a new bulletin
that Mothra must attack Zucca City
Mothra!
Mothra!
Mothra!
Mothra!
Angels?
Angels?
In the past we had a professional class
for dealing with these go-betweens, shamans
and they mitigated these comings and goings
and had a lore and a mythology about them
Mothra!
Please, we don't want to hurt you
We want to reason with you
I'm a psychoanalyst
This is my pipe
We want to help you
As we have lost contact with our shamanic roots
the things which go on at a low frequency
out in the wilderness and deserts of this planet
have become something like that
either like invasions from another world
or virtual impossibilities
I think that the flying saucer is knocking on our door
to remind us of the depths and strangeness on this planet
I'm going to visit
You!
This little6
Dear, I spoke
This little6
I talked to my readers
I have seen an almost complete 하면ography
Is bringing these people here
kind of interplanetary discourse.
Yeah, right.
Take this kind of data and deal with it
the same way we might deal with our lunch or our toothpaste.
And not think of it as being some terrible possibility
of an invasion of the lizard people from outer space.
One possible view of the flying saucer
is that it is a kind of projection
from the consciousness of the planet,
that it is dire,
that it is in fact a kind of alchemical object
haunting human historical time
with a symbol of totality,
the kind of totality that our religions
and our mystical yearnings
are so at pain to concretize for us.
What?
This was Jung's view.
Huh?
The Swiss psychologist Carl Jung,
who in 1953 wrote a book
called
Flying Saucers,
a modern myth of things seen in the sky.
So in the fall of 53,
for three or four months altogether,
I drove all around the country
interviewing people who had been mentioned
in the early Flying Saucer books.
I'm getting this book on UFOs.
Did you know they're real?
But there's a huge comic conspiracy to cover it up.
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.
So naive.
Who's naive?
I didn't say anything.
In the fall of 1953,
which was the time that I got into the UFO field,
so he got into it a year or so before I did.
Huh?
Carl Jung saw in their circular form,
in their scintillating, shining, alchemical, brilliant,
a symbol of human wholeness
to interpret them psychologically,
to interpret them as one would interpret a dream.
I hope that if you all haven't seen a flying saucer,
that eventually,
you will see one.
If you haven't seen one,
my advice would be
not to look for them in outer space
or even in another dimension.
If you look deep inside yourself,
there you will see them.
In a way, this kind of explanation is very satisfying.
However, it is not satisfying to the person
who has immediately undergone a very strange experience.
Unless such a person,
unless such a person,
starts waiting,
how could such a personpoint to the air won't know

was built?
Now, we must look at ourselves 참lex.
So, you may think that this was a страшing legend...
...for America.
But you've never seen better for ourselves.
All that would seem to be 분� contracted

Clinical quality,
is a leanedONT!
What corkes anticipating
in 700 hundred and five thousand of years
have a superstitious degree of
宮es dIallo di downs.
Take a breath.
to what is termed your world situation.
As all of you know, your planet at this time
is experiencing a period of great unrest.
For instance, imagine, just as a possibility,
that some naive, well-meaning alien should come down
and try to address a joint session of commerce.
Who's naive?
I didn't say anything!
Well, what good would it do?
So naive.
There would be a sensation on all of the tabloids
and newspapers for a few weeks,
and hand you back the Monday Night Football.
And so what good would additional information
or inspiration be that came from outside?
Let's assume then for the moment
that we are being visited by these aliens,
as I presume you assume.
What's the next for them? Why are they here?
Why are they bothering with us?
Well, it's a very interesting planet,
this particular time in its history.
I mean, maybe there's only once every 500 million years
that a particular planet goes through this phase of civilization.
Last time this happened was several years ago,
several million years ago.
It's happening again.
They all gather around,
like a volcano ready to go off.
There's a volcano waiting to erupt into the Pacific Rim.
That's really hot, isn't it?
Yeah, it looks like we're watching fireworks, doesn't it?
But we're not.
That's what's coming out of the center of the Earth.
Wow.
Here are all the dogs.
There's no dogs.
There's nothing living on Earth.
Not even dinosaurs and Pia Star monsters.
Nothing.
There's nothing but land and volcanoes
and the molten lava coming out and shooting up at 2300 degrees.
Burn it! Send it to hell!
We left the Earth, and we could see...
I could see a hurricane down in the Gulf area from the craft.
I took photos, but none of that.
I took photos of the Earth, leaving the Earth.
I took photos of approaching the Moon.
This is in 1956.
Can you imagine how I felt?
This is before any of the astronauts went anywhere to speak of anything.
I think the Russians got the other side of the Moon photographed.
And incidentally, the slides that I have, the overlays, fit right on top of that
long before we ever got there, which in itself is evidence that I've been there.
But I'm not trying to prove that I've been to the Moon.
I don't care too much about that.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Where are we then?
Well, this is technically what we call Deep Space.
Well, it's technically what I'd call Sodor.
Oh, look, come on, cheer up, everyone.
We are 15 million light years from the nearest space route.
There is no intelligent life around here anywhere.
How these aliens did this, I don't know.
But I was in their control, and they helped me do all this.
We took a picture of approaching the Moon.
We landed on the intersection where there was dark and light sort of area.
And we were there.
And we did see things that they claim are not there now.
So I can't prove anything.
Thirty-five years ago, we thought the whole space story was going to be imminent.
It was going to be really quick.
Everyone is going to accept the idea that there are higher civilizations,
that we're going to learn from them, we're going to interact with them.
No way.
Hasn't even begun.
How can they deal with us?
Who can they deal with on this planet?
The UN?
We're just beginning to cooperate at the UN level.
We haven't even begun to communicate with one another and to be civilized.
That's true.
We're very, very barbaric, and it's frightening.
From PR News in Washington, I'm conducting nuclear tests that begin in Warsaw, Poland.
This is Foreign Poland Overseas on the European, US-European Global PR News.
PR's report reports on outrage over Louisiana.

The official Twitter account of the gas chamber responded that, quote,
Inside a gas chamber there should be silence.
It's not PR News.
Hundreds of dignitaries gathered in the unified death camps.
PR's report reports today, France, in Paris, last week, in Alaska, this morning, in Germany.
The fight is still raging.
An Iraqi commander says this is PR News.
Now I'm talking about the kind of stories that leap off the wall.

From all over the campground, an uneasy understanding begins to set in that these are the final

Until we truly find Master of the Dream,
who mostly omits to simule.
I know Nice, this home,
universe itself distorts and twists like a thousand wriggling snakes as one passes the
impassable barriers all systems go proceed to check out
oh what a great day that will be my friends when the heavens fall a great day in the morning
when the prophecy the ancient prophecy of chicken little will be revealed and the sky itself will be
falling in the shape of mighty ships so large that they create gravitational anomalies on the earth
the first of its groanings and heavings on a day of difficult parturition now Ivan staying himself
is here things are certainly looking up as soon as possible
himself is actually not my last name no well but an affectionate Cog Norman you see we're hoping to
be absolutely comfortable here and ready to deliver our hard-hitting below the belt message
actually we have reason to be much less confident this oh I see and that is your recent electronic
discovery right
perhaps you should mention it again since repetitio est mater studiorum
tell them yet another time and the lesson will sink in as they always do so
what is the dealio with this electronic treasure trove of newest revelation well
that hideous strange alien hybrid baby
robot radio thing when I when it electrocated me by accident or design or
whatever your own I had my own immaculation dr. how don't you remember
and it it did something to you it did something to I went into the spirit I
was lifted up by the stark fist of Jehovah actually it didn't feel like that
it was more like a jumble of sensory impressions
that indicated that the original note from Bob that said the it said quote the
world ends July 5th 7 a.m. July 5th 1998 there was some question about the bottom
number well it turns out that that was part of a phone number it may still be
valid that was my next question apparently the seven and five was were was a reverse
proposal of what meant to be five seven now which would indicate a date of May
7th but then damn legume thumped my chest and brought me out of it before I
could get the year so we've we've been thrust into kind of a muddle I mean I'm
gonna get up tomorrow at 6 and go down there and do the countdown and wait for
the saucers
I'm glad we did a
fake
one yesterday for the film cameras cuz they're realer than real if it's like
last year there's only only about seven or eight subgeniuses are still alive at
7 a.m. and there only one was female
count your blessings well it was Susie the floozy you know so that that's that
counts for a lot more than just one female and actually counts for more than
two breastages
but the aliens that were disappointed as you can see on YouTube actually the
19x day cross-section ends with some special effects not everybody's seen
that yet
actor and with subtitles alien footage is involved right there's alien footage
although frankly it looks kind of like that old movie laser glass but anyway
anyway friends we still we one thing we do know X day is a couple of days away
from coming any and it could be any second could be now but it wasn't I
rather that or now that could be I don't want you come up here yes you may
although doctor how we were gonna try to record your song or two now you're
giving contradictory yeah I was telling him to come up and yet we're gonna
record a song why don't he come up and then later on we'll record the song okay
yeah
yeah

Alright, well you can go back home to your own punches and congregations and spread the
word about Skipper Bob-Dot.
Dr. Onan Kanabite at X-Day Drill number 20. You know, it was the last one I was at.
I can see why he has so many titles. That's a lot of words to remember.
Yeah, Reverend Uncle Doctor. He's an uncle.
Yeah.
As long as...
And now they're starting to call him Poppy and Gramps and Uncle Bunny and all those cute
little names that little children make up when you don't know who they are.
They come, some of them have like machetes and they're wearing armbands and...
Now Dave, you're an uncle, aren't you?
Yes.
And a grandpa.
At least I have nieces and grandnieces.
Do they call you Uncle?
My grand...
Is Uncle Lonesome Cowboy Dave coming to dinner tonight?
And he's gonna puke right on the plate just like he always does and leave a dump his head
in the ashtray.
Uncle Lonesome Cowboy Dave is funny.
We love him.
He's a grotesque monster.
He's a man without vision, without plans.
He knows not what the...
Uncle Lonesome Cowboy Dave is really old, isn't he, Daddy?
Yes, he's pretty old.
What?
What was that?
I think it's...
What was that?
I think it's Dr. Sinister lurking around the studio.
Uh-huh.
That's him.
He's lurking around.
He's lurking around.





He's lurking.
Well, I thought it was some kind of trade band serial music to the...
Lingering like a fart in a phone booth, as they say.
It is.
It's actually a miracle that I got a recording of that sea chanting that Unann led.
I think that's on my...
It was shot on my iPhone and my digital recorder had timed out or something.
It had stopped.
Occasionally, phones actually make good recordings if you're in the right environment.
That was actually a terrible recording and you can hear the fans clearly, but I'm not
at my regular studio in Texas and I don't have sound soap filter.
You have no regular studio.
So I couldn't...
Everything you do is ad hoc, ad...
Both.
Both.
It's both.
Both, yeah.
Also, like in a magazine.
I remember when you were...
I think you were a...
I think you were a...

I think you were a...



It was like 25 years ago.
Something way, way in the distant past.
We get real drunk and high and then we record this stuff on little cassette recorders like
a Walkman or whatever, and then we spend $100,000 mixing it with an orchestra and so
forth and making...
Sweetening it up and then nobody...
Yeah, sweetening it...
And then nobody hears it.
Put a little oil on the junk...
We play it on a college radio station and that's it.
There you go.
$100,000 right down the drain.
Hey, we got...
But we're famous and got rich this week, Dave.
I may have told you about this in another reality, but Boing Boing website suddenly started glowingly reviewing the subgenius membership pack.
And this is something that you need to leverage.
All right.
You need to use that online momentum and ride that wave, man.
And the world needs the gospel of Bob Dobbs now more than ever.
Now more than ever.
Well, yeah, that's their problem, not mine.
All right.
What am I supposed to do?
You could, you know.
I'm having a hell of a time just filling those 200 orders.
We never got that many.
Well, that means you're going to have to hire help.
Well, as someone so aptly said, Reverend Stang is the only cult leader.
It was Palmer Vreede.
Palmer Vreede, he said.
Reverend Stang is the only cult leader.
He's the only cult leader who wrings his hands when too many people join.
Yeah, he gripes when too many people.
Yeah, but we were out of stock in the first half hour.
We're not used to that.
You think maybe a couple hundred people might have seen the movie?
I mean, is that a possibility?
No, no, no.
This writer, actually a really good writer named Corey, now Reverend Corey Doctorow.
Yes, I know.
He ordered.
You explained that.
Yeah, he ordered.
I'm glad to hear about it.
Well, it did come at an inconvenient time, but it certainly is needed and wonderful.
Actually, it was a perfect time.
We were dead broke and did deep in a hole.
And now we've filled the hole in a little bit.
I did have to spend about half as much as we made just reprinting stuff.
But it's great.
There's 200 new saved souls out there.
And each one of them.
Well.
Well, one tenth of each one of them is going to order a book or a pen or some other thing.
So I had to have those things ready for next week.
But, of course, I can't give the title of the article in Boing Boing because it gave
the price of our product, which I can't say legally on public supported airwaves.
But it basically said.
For a fistful of dollars.
The subgenius membership pack is the best.
Beep.
Beep.
Dollars I've ever spent.
And.
But that is just his opinion.
That is just his opinion.
He took pictures of all almost 30 pieces that go into that thing.
Yeah.
And described them all and gushed over them.
And he implied that you get a free book of the subgenius when you pay for a membership, which is not.
Not true.
No, he paid extra for that.
The normal.
But he did get it autographed to him because I knew who he was because I read his book.
Little Brother.
It's a really good sci-fi book.
It's a great sci-fi book.
Kind of a juvenile book.
Yeah, but it made me cry.
That's the best audience.
You know, it's a valuable audience, the juveniles.
But they're still impressionable.
You can still twist them to your way of thinking.
Maybe.
So would you twist a young adult in my book, Neighbor World?
No.
Because they have.
They had to make me ask questions when I started taking these competitions and stuff like that.
He said, what is the genre and category slash a bunch of other things like that.
Yeah, good luck with that one.
Yeah, right.
You know, Kurt Vonnegut had the same problem and so did Joseph Heller.
Dave, honestly, if you think about it.
He's a religious fanatic.
No, Joseph Heller who wrote Catch-22.
Oh, Catch-22.
Yeah, Catch-22.
Catch-22.
Chicken catch.
Thanks, my dear.
Then they were gone.
I'm sorry, Mr. Yosari, and I'm sorry.
How can I do that?
How can I do that?
Catch-22.
Well, if you're a true catch-it-all, then you can hunt down anything.
You can catch 22 all day long.
Man, I'm loving this music.
I think it was a very powerful atmosphere.

Oh, that, that was great.

That was really, really interesting.
So, yes.
Next time, we're shooting that see you through the window.
That's great.
We'll see you there.
10, 1, go!
10, 2, 1.
Let's do it.
50 feet blindly thinking.
Well, I know, but Gone with the Wind, famous.
But it was still a big deal.
And Rod Serling wrote that screenplay,
and I learned to type by transcribing my reel-to-reel recordings I made in the theater when I was 15.
I went to see that movie four times to get the parts where I'd had to change the little four-inch reels.
I need to ask you a question real quick here.
That's how much of a nerd I was.
Yeah, friends.
That's how I learned to type.
This is from Planet of the Apes, the original?
Yep.
Okay, what am I hearing in the background there?
Is that a jawbone or a vibra-slap?
Both.
It's both?
Yeah.
Okay.
That's all I figured.
Jawbone.
Sounds like a vibra-slap to me.
Oingo Boingo was big on using bone and jawbone sounds.
They used a lot of bone-sounding percussion.
So, Reverend Sting, I...
It's all from Brazil.
And you all have to mispronounce the names of the different types of mahogany they use on it.
I used to use some toilet paper or a little toilet paper tube.
You know, you get a nice volumetric sound out of that there.
I was just thinking the same thing myself, Dave.
Yeah, because, you know, who needs all them Brazilian woodlands instruments?
This is a kazuba, you know.
It makes all kinds of different sounds, and you can only use them for one purpose.
What if you do?


You can't do it in a polka.
You can't have every polka sound like that.
You'd get thrown out of Cleveland.
Mm-mm.
So, does some people dearly wish to be thrown out of Cleveland?
If only, if only they could be thrown...
True story.
I once had a dream that took place inside of a video game where you could cast a spell
to banish your enemies to Cleveland.
Yeah.
Like, that was an actual spell.
Nowadays, it would probably be Detroit, don't you think?
Well...
Don't tell everybody.
Cleveland still has the reputation of you never hear of you again, but did you guys
see Jim Jarmusch's new movie, speaking of which?
Oh, I keep...
I did.
Brother Love sure has.
Brother Love did.
He really liked it.
He loves talking about himself in the third person.
Yeah, I heard Brother Love's review of it on the radio one day, driving to whatever
passes for work at the post office.
I wanted to...
I actually wanted to...
I wanted to show you something I literally found in a dark alley recently.
I literally found this in a dark alley.
This book.
It's a voodoo spell book.
Wow.
Full of curses and haxes.
Dr. Snake's voodoo spell book.
I literally found it in a dark alley, just lying there.
Can you raise the elder gods over the air?
I don't know if it's even safe to do that.
We've only got two more minutes to do that.

Read one, click.
Two more.
Tan bala we do.
All of the names and numbers.
Princess, we know tons of voodoo practitioners.
I do.
From Starwood.
I know them personally.
Have you ever been in Nolens?
Yeah.
There's some real fun down there.
Oh, hell yeah.
They'll go right to those weird cemeteries that have the graves up above the ground.
Yes, I know.
I'd love that place.
They'll have a picnic right on top of somebody's body or something like that.
Oh, you can do that at Lakeview Cemetery here with the Lakeview.
Yeah, but every once in a while the vultures chase you.
They chase you out.
That's what they call them now, vultures anyway,
because you only pick on carrion, whoever the hell that is.
I don't know.
Okay, Dave, we're at the 9.58 point of the time zone.
Don't rush on my account.
I have to say, no, I'm not, believe me.
Okay.
We're the hour of slack.
That's it.
This is the hour of slack from Church of the Subgenius,
and if you want to know more about it,
any of this stuff, including this upcoming festival next week
that we hardly talked about,
even though it will either kill you or save you,
all of you listening,
that's all out there at subgenius.com.
I'll just leave it at that, I guess.
You poor, poor...
Yes, they can read about the fun things that are coming.
Oh, and Starwood.
X-Day and Starwood.
After the world ends, then Starwood,
that'll be on my escape saucer,
which will look just like Wisteria Campground
in Southern Ohio near Athens in Pomeroy.
Starwood, where President Vermin Supreme will be.
That's right.
Vermin Supreme.
President Vermin Supreme's going to be there.
Dr. Howell's going to be there.
All those bands that I don't know the names of.
John Shirley, the author.
Yeah, the weird subgenius.
Horror author John Shirley.
And, uh...
Is that my phone?
I think it's the dogs.
Yes, the dogs and the pill.
It's time for the pill.
Okay, friends, I've got to take my pill.
Thanks.
Praise Bob.
Now, the...

And that was the psychoskeletons.
Look them up.
And now,
special little piece
by Bob Walkenhorst.
One of the coolest
Christmas presents
I got this year
was my daughter gave me
Johnny Cash
live at San Quentin.
And that was cool,
but the real cool part
was sitting down
with my 12-year-old daughter
and listening to Johnny Cash
in concert all the way through.
The neat thing about,
one of the,
I mean,
there's a million
neat things about it,
but they were actually
filming the night
that he shot,
that he recorded
that album at San Quentin.
And it was a BBC concert
that,
that they were filming for.
And you listen to the,
the music
and he just has such a great
I don't give a shit attitude.
It's so admirable.
He,
they're,
so they're filming
a BBC special
and Johnny pulls out
two songs
that he'd written
that day.
Or actually the day before.
And the band
had just like heard once.
And Johnny's saying stuff like,
somebody give,
give me my notebook.
I need those lyrics.
And so I'm trying to picture
Johnny Cash,
you know,
sitting on stage
with a lyrics notebook.
Lots of great creativity happens
when you don't really care
that much
or worry that much.
So,
so in the spirit of
Johnny at San Quentin,
we're going to play a song tonight
that I wrote at 6.30 this morning.
And Norm and Jeff,
Norm Daylor on bass.
Jeff Porter on guitar and drums.
They've never even heard this song.
I think this song
was actually supposed to be
Merle Haggard's song,
but it got sent to
my cosmic mailbox by mistake.
Now don't go turning the lyrics around
because I won't miss it.
This song came about
because Jeff and I get together
every week and record.
We're working on Jeff's CD.
Norm's joined us several times.
And Jeff and I often walk in
and whine
about all the difficulties
of our lives.
And we often end up
looking at each other
and I'll say,
I'll come in one week
and I'll say,
Jeff,
all I want to do
is play guitar.
And then Jeff will come in.
He'll have had a hard week
and Jeff will come in
and he'll look at me
and he'll go,
Bob,
all I want to do
is play guitar.
So tying this all up,
I was reading
Johnny Cash's biography.
And in the biography,
Johnny was bitching
about having to go
to record company meetings
and interviews
and all that stuff.
And Johnny actually said,
all I want to do
is play guitar.
Johnny understands, man.
Or he did.
He still does.
This is called Broken Radio,
written less than 24 hours ago.
All the songs I sing
are sad ones.
Expectations of me
are all bad ones.
I couldn't have less
to live up to
if I tried.
I'm an accident.
Go report one.
My obituary
will be a short one.
He played guitar
till the day he died.
All I want to do
is sing a few
songs of aching love
and a couple
of old hymns
for the folks back home.
And a last chance
for a slow,
true dance
with your one
true love
here on my
broken radio.
All my memories
are in the past.




They weren't good ones.
Coulda, shoulda, woulda ones.
But there's a couple in there
I wouldn't trade.
Like the night
when I first met her.
Would I forget her
or regret her?
Ask them ghosts
dancing on my grave.
All I want to do
is sing a few songs
of aching love.
And a fast one
for the youngsters
that I know.
And a last chance
for a last dance
with your one
true love.
Here I am






here on my broken radio.
Here on my broken radio.
