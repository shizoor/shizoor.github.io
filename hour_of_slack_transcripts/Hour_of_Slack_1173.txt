What? What?
It's dear.
I'd say you were going mad.
Yes.
The door was open in the vestibule.
I closed it, leaving the stairs beyond in darkness.
Then they know it's time to sleep.
And they sleep.
The Self-Genius Power of Life.
Oh, isn't that terrible?
Why?
You see, we found dress to drool in the book.
Huh?
What was funny about it is that the bitch made 12 glam books.
That is funny.
Doesn't make any sense.
Unless you've seen the end of the Atlantic, I guess.
All right.
That's right.

Please don't go away from me.
Get out of my way.
I've got to go to the bathroom.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Hey, Rob.
Be sexy.
I'm sober.
Sleep change.
Get dizzy.
Hey, Rob.
Hey, Rob.
Get dizzy.
Be sexy.
I'm sober.
Sleep change.
I'll give a rub.
Be sexy.
Friends, as Michael Pilmer has said over and over again,
what happens at Devotional 2008 stays at Devotional 2008.
And then another funny thing happened followed by two things that were pretty amusing.
And the whole thing ended with something that was just hysterical.
I'm gonna show you something.
I'm gonna show you something.


I'm gonna show you something.
My name is Rob.
If I'm gonna get one more extra exec, are you willing?
I'm gonna get another one already.

Oh, that's out of my mind.
Exciting.

Go, go, go, go.
We'll see what I do.
Faster, faster.
Oh, really stepped on my foot.

When repeated over and over and over, nobody can catch up.
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid
Whoop-dee-doop-dee-doo
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid
Mongoloid, he was a Mongoloid
Whoop-dee-doop-dee-doo
Only three feet tall
Those aren't the words, that's something else
Anyway, so Bo's a Mongoloid
And he had a regular job
Went to work every goddamn day
And he brought him the bacon
And he worked hard for a living
His head was horribly disfigured
People would say, he don't look right
But I don't want to get sued or nothing
So I'm not gonna
I was gonna, you know, bushy him
I was gonna throw him in the bush
We got stick-a-bushies at work, you know
And I like to push people around
I like to beat up people that I think
You know, I could beat up
You know, I'm only, you know, five foot three
But, you know, once in a while
I see a guy, I can kick his ass
Anyway, there was this Mongoloid
And I thought, well, actually, you know, beat my ass
But I took a swing
I did, I tried to take his lunch
I got arrested, but
Yeah, he was a total Mongoloid
You could just tell
Because, you know, his head was great big, you know
And anyway, he worked there at the place
And, yeah, I mean, you know
I got fired
But I kept showing up for work
Because, you know, I work for a living
Not really, but, you know, I tell people that
And it's great, you know, I go there
And if I see somebody that's, you know, like a kid or something
You know, I can push him down
I try to take his lunch money or something
You know, like that
I got beat up by an 11-year-old
One time
I try to stay under 11 years of age
When I assault people these days
You know, you never know
I got beat up by
I was trying to rob an old lady of the crutches
I was very severely injured after that
You gotta be careful
You don't know
You don't know whose background these people are
But anyway, this Mongoloid
He was a Mongoloid
Yeah, he, you know, he showed up early
Went to home late
He was a great guy
But look at his big head
He's a Mongoloid, man
Anyway, I was gonna kill him
He could dance
But anyway, that's pretty much what happened
What else happened?
He was a Mongoloid
Did I mention that earlier?
He was a total Mongoloid
Oh, he looked kind of
I went there with him
It's like, supposed to look Chinese looking or something
I don't know what that's supposed to be
And it was weird
Like, he didn't look
No, he wasn't
He wasn't normal like me
You know, I'm a regular guy
And he's got a big head
So I'm like, I'm gonna kill him



I took a swing at him
And he grabs my fist
And wrenches it behind my back
And jacks my arm up
And I'm screaming in pain back there
And he says, why'd you take a swing at me?
I said, because you got a big head
And he jacks my arm up
And damn, just snaps it off at the elbow
And I'm at the crying
And he pushes me down behind the bush
And goes to work
And then I start planning, you know
To do bad things to him at his home
So I go to his house
You know, and I break in
I see his wife there
And she beats me over the head with a broom handle
And I'm bleeding, they're bleeding
That they dragged me off into the driveway
And I'm like, what?


And I crawl back
I crawl back to the Motel 6
Because that's where I got a room
And, oh man, I swear if I got it
If I see another mongoloid
I don't know
I'd probably leave him alone this time, frankly
I've seen, I've had enough of that
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh!
He was a mongoloid
He was a mongoloid
He was a mongoloid
He was a mongoloid
Angeloid
He's a mongoloid
ad��를

He's a mongoloid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
He was a mongoloid
And I say he was a mongoloid
What do you mean?
I knew that.
Shut up.
Shut up.
That's not funny and don't do it again.
He's a mongoloid.
Mongoloid.
Mongoloid.
Damn, that was turned on, was it?
A New Mexico woman was named final arbiter of taste and justice today,
ending God's lengthy search for someone to straighten this country out.
Eileen Harriet Paul Glace will have final say on every known subject,
including who should be put to death, what clothes everyone should wear,
what movies suck, and whether bald men who grow ponytails should still,
get laid.
I vote yes to that one, friends.
Clips from the 1996 movie Schizopolis,
the sandwiched version of Devo's Mongoloid by Johnny Future
at myspace.com slash future7.
We murdered the intros and this is our Slack number 1173,
our annual devotional report.
The 2008 devotional was held last August and on,
uh, John Hell's show.
Last December, we held fourth with Reverend Mongoloid
and puzzling evidence about the Mongoloid-a-palooza in San Francisco.
I ranted at both places, uh, both years,
and, uh, all the music in this show,
save one piece, is from this year's Devo cover compilation album,
not necessarily beautiful, but mutated.
Uh, stay tuned for the address for that.
But now, back to the devotional of Zero,
Zero 8 in Cleveland, Ohio.
The point is, friends, Devo is, well, they're not ageless.
Only Bob 3 is ageless.
But they are immortal!
Devo cannot die!
Because it's not just a band, it is, in fact, a philosophy.
And for some people here, it's probably a religion.
I, I, it certainly is for me.
It's one of my religions.
I certainly worship at the Temple of Devo, as they call it.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
missed their calling being
television comedy, doing
a television comedy show.
I honestly have always thought that
the personalities in that
band should be doing improvised
TV comedy.
But they wanted to be rock stars.
I guess there's more girls that way.
Televangelism maybe?
Another interesting
story was my friend
should I say who?
No, I think not. But someone we know in
Madison, Wisconsin, when she was
a young lady, was
on the front row of the Devo concert
and Mark jumped
down off the stage while singing
Girl You Want
and started doing some
heavy petting with my friend
on the front row.
Such heavy petting
that he was actually
inserting body parts
into body parts
sort of underhandedly, shall we
say. You know, I'm just not
fully recreating
the Devo concert. I gotta work harder.
Well, I'm letting you know this.
Next time when you run through the audience, you stop
and do this part.
The prankster
aspect of that band
has always been a really big
part of it.
The whole thing is
a gigantic prank, really.
It is.
That's why I worship at the Temple of Devo.
I'm an unabashed
absolute old
school Devo fan.
And even though I've
seen them at their worst in the middle
of music video productions when
everybody had been awake too long
and cold, wasn't getting paid
enough, there was terrible pressure
and still I remain
the same ardent fan
that I was the first time I saw.
Got a message from
my honey
Got a message from my girl
Wants you to
help me
and roll me a
scribble
I know
I said you'd be coming back
And I said you'd be coming back
To see me, that she would give me some to be also
Gonna get up from the low, I did you know
And leave this cold wild world
Oh, I ain't got a love that's free
Just like the old accident
Now baby, look at me
It's all here to be
Let's try to open her up a little
I'm coming with the trouble
Let the sound of the horn on her head to be
Give me a little supper
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, come on now
Got a surprise from my honey
I got a message from my girl
Let's just pick up a pen
From the old accident

beside her bed, and she wrote me a scribbled note, said she'd be coming back to see me,
and she'd be visiting me real soon. She was gonna get up from the low, white bed, and
leave this cold, white room. I saw her sweet face trembling, as she tried to open her eyes.
I jumped with the joy of a grateful thought, this game of baby gave me a surprise today.
My baby gave me a surprise, covered by PuffTube, and you can find them at myspace.com
slash puff tube, taken from Reverend Toth Whitehouse.
While there's not necessarily beautiful, but mutated CD.
Meanwhile, puzzling evidence, reminisces about live Devo concerts of your and today.
And I kept thinking, man, those guys must lose five pounds a show.
When they did, they came out and did the yellow, yellow, uh, Devo's?
They came out at the break and did that thing.
It's a great effect, but you pay for it.
Yeah, exactly, because I knew how much work, and they were sweating like monkeys.
Those guys all weighed 90 pounds.
And we know why.
In those days, yeah.
Well, yeah, in those days, they were moving fast.
Well, I've noticed when they perform now, they play it just as fast as they used to,
but they only bounce up and down every other beat.
They're all pushing 60.
Yep.
And look like prosperous businessmen, most of them.
Those were, those were the days.
And then we went to see them in Dallas, and they, see them when they had the, uh,
it was the Gates of Steel Tour, I think, where they had the big, um,
big set.
They had that booth.
It would break.
That was the big, really impressive.
Bob Mothers Bar is still wiring.
The rest of those guys look like they've been eating at Spago's frequently,
in between movies, store, and jobs.
The password is, Bob and I are the same age.
If any of you feel the pressure down there.
Uh, no.
They don't, they don't need to, but they still need to call.
The devotionals in Dallas.
And Ohio are a kind of a holiday for the, the Ohio.
So Jesus and the devotees and so forth.
Every August?
Uh, yeah, it's not the same weekend every, but it's been almost every August.
Right after, uh, X day and Starwood for the pagans.
Then you go to the devotional.
It's a string of insane holidays there in beautiful Ohio.
The Rust Belt friends.
Very true.
I'm going to go down.
Down, down, down.
Nobody's in the street.
I'm going to go down.
Down, down.
Nobody's in the street.
I'm going to go down.
Down, down, down.
Nobody's got to be loose.
I'm going to go down.
Down, down.
Nobody's in the street.
That's a hit moon in a 55-dollar moon.
It didn't mean to do that.
But a sidewalk wanted to do this.
Such a good one.
He had to lose it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.


Hmmm..
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.






Yeah it's here!

Hmm..
And that's a hit moon in a 55 car.
Yeah, that's a hit moon in a 55 car.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's a hit moon in a 55 car.
The heavy haul.
Thank you.
Thank you.
World War Room did Auto-Modown
with the great Saint Byron Werner on vocals.
Just amazing there, friends.
You know, we love Rural War Room,
and you can too via myspace.com
slash Rural War Room Records.
And now, back to a season in hell
on Pirate Cat Radio with Dr. Howell.
But Bob also said...
That music in the background is by Mark Mothersbaugh.
Believe me out of it.
That's a little...
He's called the Babacato.
It's done on his Fairlight scene part, I think, one time.
Yes, it's an old one.
A venerable one.
I made a little music video of it.
Well, just some animation to go with it.
All right.
Can you make it full screen?
Be seen?
Yeah, actually, the shot that we're looking at in the studio
now has...
Untold billions of Dobbs heads in it.
It's a psychedelic pattern that is composed of
nothing but Dobbs heads
worked by the computer.
That took a little while.
Well, the rendering takes a long time.
The actual animation is surprisingly fast.
We used telepathy.
Really, too.
Manipulate the images, but then you...
Saves time.
Yeah.
But like I say, the rendering takes a while.
That's the expensive part.
Damn, Premiere.
I use a program called Artmatic.
I'm not kidding.
It's really...
Artmatic?
It's Macintosh only, though.
Anyway, friends, now it is up to us,
or rather you,
to carry on that tradition of making up
new replacement traditions.
New improved traditions.
I can't tell you what those might be
because I'm old and I've already done
my new improved tradition.
But the young must replace the old, my friends.
And that would be true even if science and medicine
somehow manage to defeat the aging process.
And here's why.
Even if you could live forever, you really wouldn't want to
because the old can't bear to see the increasing stupidity
of humanity.
And that's another reason that Devo cannot die
because they are predicated on the fact of the world
getting dumber.
And that ain't gonna stop, judging by the newspaper.
I'm not kidding.
And the TV and the radio and everything else.
A de-evolutionist is certainly real.
Nobody reads books anymore.
Internet thoughts are only one sentence long.
And that sentence is always missed better.
I don't mean to be a junior high English teacher about it,
but as friends, as you age, you get both dumber and smarter.
Your brain works slower, but you've seen
a lot.
You've seen the same...
It's painful.
It's painful to see the same mistakes being repeated and worsened.
Most people, as the great sage Nemzlow said,
most people don't make the same mistake twice.
They make the same mistake thousands of times!
And I have this younger friend of mine,
Reverend Nicky Deathchair.
She had...
Actually, her name is...
She got married.
She's Reverend Nicky Deathchair Wild.
She had a power dome in the art show last night.
It was the death metal power dome.
It was black.
It had studs and skulls and spikes all over it.
Anyway, Nicky is 20 years younger than me.
And she's gonna live to see 20 years worth more dumbness.
And she can have it, my friends!
I don't want to...
I honestly really don't want to see the world that my grandkids' kid is going to have to
deal with.
It'll seem normal to them!
And that's where it all gets kind of weird.
When I was very young, in the late 60s, there was a science fiction book by John Bruner.
It was a big award winner called Science Fiction.

It was called Stand on Zanzibar.
Now, by chance, that book happened to be the sci-fi book that turned out to be hideously accurate.
It was set more or less in these times.
And what seemed like a horrible, nightmarish science fiction thing in the 60s just seems like the news now.
I mean, it really is.
If you run through the news, it's about like that horrible...
And that book seems so horrible.
It was horrible in the 60s, and now it seems normal.
We got used to it.
And I don't want to have to see what my great grandkids consider normal.
I don't want to have to hear about the last mountain gorilla dying in some zoo.
I don't want to go back kind of into an old cloves-of-the-mill sales minds Claudio,
suddenly trying so hard to get out publicij it's on one.
I'm a two plus two equals four man.
I'm a mechanical man.
I'm a mechanical man.
I'm a mechanical man.
I'm a mechanical man.
I'm a mechanical man.
I'm a mechanical man.
Two mechanical arms.
Two mechanical legs.
I'm a two plus two equals four man.

Me work well.
Me want what you want.

Mechanical Man was created there by Rural War Room,
also found at myspace.com slash ruralwarroomrecords
with Byron Warner and Donovan Soot.
And now, back to the devotional.
Obviously, the fact that you're here,
you know, you can handle new things.
Look at the band that just played.
They took those old Devo tunes and twisted them,
changed them and made different,
completely new things out of them.
Same tune, but yet it's a completely different tune.
Weird covers and new styles.
And friends, you know, sure,
we're here for an 80s band.
But look how damned weird it continues to be.
That is...
why Devo cannot and must not die,
because it truly is, friends,
duty now for the future.
Praise Bob and praise the Devos.


Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Yeah!
Celebrate the golden age
in which we're living
Your opinion counts
and freedom is key
Sadly, this has led to art
and sport and politics
Being led by people illiquid to breathe
There was a group who could have saved us from this ignominy
There was a group whom they were roundly ignored
They saw the future and they pointed out the problems
If the people took the point we'd now be reaping the rewards
Devo was right about everything
Devo were telling the truth
Devo was right about everything
Devo showed us love
If you have ever raged against conformity
Or hate the way our leaders treat us with scorn
You see society refreshed before your very eyes
Devo was on your side before you were born
Devo was on your side before you were born
Devo was right about everything
Devo had proved the world wrong
Devo was right about everything
Come and see it with us everyone
Devo was right about everything
Devo called it correct
Devo was right about everything
And the such deserve some respect
How many people here tonight believe that De-Evolution is real?
And we just came to remind you
Are we not men?
We are not people
Are we not men?
We are not people
Are we not men?
We are not people
Right then
Devo was right about everything
Devo was never in the wrong
Devo was right about everything
Devo don't care for this song
Because it says we were right about everything
And if that's true then we really all do
So in 30 seconds turn this music up
And go around and do what Devo would do
We're gonna do it for Devo
Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo Devo
I know you don't have to look very far for the evidence
Devo was right
Back in the previous century
Back in the 80s
I was in my 20s
I heard that band, the D-Fox.
They were talking about how, well, about de-evolution.
That humanity was no longer evolving forward, but was actually sliding backwards.
I thought that was real funny, because I was a snide 20-something.
Well, now I'm a snide 50-something, and it's not so funny anymore, because it was really true!
People were getting literally dumber!
And the ape side was taking over, but unfortunately it was the pantroglodyte instead of the bonobo side of the ape family that was taking over.

Look away.

slack by the collar
and scream in it's face
and say this is my life
and
and I will you may make me take that pee test
you may make me clock in at 8 30 in the morning
but you can never have what's inside my perverted
sick
demented head
your perversions are your own my friends
and praise you for it
hang on to your sickness
hang on to your weirdness
hang on to what they call your perversions
because that's all I got to say about that
all that counts
they don't have any of that
they can't have it
they can't understand slack
they'd love to take yours away
even though they don't know what it is
but you can hang on to it
just you know
fuck them if they can't take a joke
praise Bob
praise the spud boys
praise the beast land barons

Space Junk
a odd business
It's a lot of data to do.
Bad junk in my yard.
Got some bad junk up in my yard.
You know, actually, somebody thought,
don't want to take on this, so I'll tell you the truth.
I'll make it to you.
It's too true to talk about.
It happened in my yard and in space.
I collect spacesuits for real.
Anyway, some old boy from the news things,
they came over, hey, man, can we look at your spacesuits
and put them on TV and interview you?
And out of context and stuff,
and just make you look like a fucking lunatic.
Yeah, that sounds great. Come on over.
So anyway, I mentioned it was back when the mirror was crashing,
and I said, yeah.
Somebody said, are you worried about the mirror crashing
and hitting your house?
Why would anybody be worried about that?
Chances aren't very likely.
So anyway, yeah, I wish it hit my house.
It'd be worth a lot of money.
And they do the news.
Hello.
Oh, man, the hopes this mirror will crash into his yard.
Oh, that's going to look good on the news.
Space junk.
Space junk.
Space junk.
Hey, man, you're kissing space junk.
Oh, it'd be gay.
Fuck off.
Oh, yes, your friends.
Praise the Spud Boy.
Praise.
Praise the devotional.
