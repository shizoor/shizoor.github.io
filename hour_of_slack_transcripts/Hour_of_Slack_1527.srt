1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Test, test, bleep, test, test, test, test.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,960
Ah, yes.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,720
Your friend.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,240
We're back.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,620
I thought we were.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,720
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen?

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,400
Yes.

8
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,320
I know what's coming.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,380
Have I got to beat you to make you understand?

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,440
No.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,380
What?

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,180
Our slash.

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,040
Our slash.

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,180
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,680
That much I know.

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,540
And at the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,560
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,520
In this temple lodge of the church of the subgenius of Little Rock,

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,320
and before we begin this sacred spouting,

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,080
I think that we should all bow our heads.

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,240
And let's all have a minute of noise.

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,800
Ah!

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:56,860
Ah!

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,060
Ah!

25
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,020
Ah!

26
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,540
Ah!

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,020
Ah!

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,500
Ah!

29
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,540
Ah!

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,840
Ah!

31
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,540
Ah!

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,620
Ah!

33
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:09,620


34
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,040
Have we started yet?

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,320
Oh.

36
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,620
Well, that officially happens at 7 a.m.

37
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,540
Test, test, test, test.

38
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,280
So that would have put it at 6 a.m.

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,460
That's one.

40
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,840
Is that right?

41
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Let me tell you, we'll be on our way.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,320
5 a.m.

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,440
5 a.m.

44
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,200
We'll be counting down.

45
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,180
5 a.m. is the time.

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,520
Of course, that's the time this show is normally drawing to a conclusion.

47
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,540
And you hopefully will be able to work the end of the world in just before the show ends.

48
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Time marches on.

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,140
Just because the world is ending doesn't mean we shouldn't.

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,720
Right.

51
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,700
Just because the world is ending doesn't necessarily mean that the show doesn't have obligations,

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,300
as does the show that comes on after this,

53
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,940
because it's only the world as we know it that's ending.

54
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,960
The world as we don't know it will continue on.

55
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,580
We're...

56
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
Eons, centuries, decades even.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,740
Gee, thanks for letting us know that, Phyla.

58
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,640
Mightily zooming along in a way that we never thought possible.

59
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,720
And bouncing energy off of this space.

60
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,640
Because it will be the future.

61
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,960
And we'll enter the thousand-year millennium

62
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,760
into the weakness of the eternal void.

63
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,840
So often spoken of by those people who come to my front door when I don't want them to.

64
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,440
July 5th, next day.

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,600
Pleasure ships are on their way.

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,200
Quit your job.

67
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,720
Keep your slack.

68
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,280
Chair dust.

69
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:20,880
Got your back.

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,440
Hail Connie.

71
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,000
Hail Bob.

72
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,620
On your knees.

73
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,220
Self-righteous love.

74
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Give it up.

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,400
Give it in.

76
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,860
Find yourself.

77
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,460
You get it, kid.

78
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,440
New religion radio.

79
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,860
Hell Pope gonna blow.

80
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,020
Pay to find out what you know.

81
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,560
Pass the pipe.

82
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,180
Take a trick.

83
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,340
I'm telling you, this is my joke.

84
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,420
Spirits see, steer clear.

85
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:32,940
A tournament.

86
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,460
A tournament.

87
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,560
A tournament of lies.

88
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,940
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives.

89
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,180
And I decline.

90
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,660
It's the end of the world as we know it.

91
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,320
It's the end of the world as we know it.

92
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,920
It's the end of the world as we know it.

93
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,060
Bob feels fine.

94
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,380
It's the end of the world as we know it.

95
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,380


96
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,580
Are we going to start the hour of slack somehow?

97
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,040
At sunset?

98
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,020
Oh, uh...

99
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,980
This is your mic.

100
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,100
It's past time to start the so-called hour of slack.

102
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,380
That's not plugged in.

103
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,560
Although I could plug it in.

104
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,320
Oh, yeah, yeah.

105
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,700
Here, look.

106
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,420
I can do this.

107
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,160
All this talk about plugs is just subterfuge, ladies and gentlemen.

108
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,040
That one cuts in and out.

109
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,780
We don't want to.

110
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,460
I just use that to establish authenticity here.

111
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,960
Actually, it's completely automated.

112
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,200
The problem is every time you add another headphone, they all get quieter.

113
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,700
Quieter?

114
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,280
Quieter.

115
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,940
I can hear quite a lot, including a background rumble, unless that's just me.

116
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,760
That's the oncoming train of slack.

117
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
Train of thought.

118
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,440
Oh, no.

119
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,800
Horrible, scary train of thought.

120
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,460
Yeah, most of my train of thoughts are pretty scary.

121
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,040
Here, let's start things off.

122
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,760
It's 2 o'clock.

123
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,600
Yes, it's beyond 2 o'clock.

124
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,440
Really?

125
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,200
You're just now saying it's 2 o'clock?

126
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,300
No, it is exactly 2 o'clock.

127
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,600
All right, I'm off.

128
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm quite off.

129
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,340
It's okay.

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
No one's ever mentioned that to you before?

131
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,020
And now, oh, no, wait a minute.

132
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,760
Yes, it's the hour of slack from Caffeena's here in the middle of Wisteria

133
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,420
at X.

134
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,420
Day 18.

135
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:38,860
Yes, dear friends, I and Reverend Ivan Stang are here with Priestess Pisces

136
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:47,160
to inaugurate a series of mind-ripping bobcasts done from this historic site

137
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,340
in situ at Caffeena's, where the elite meet and greet and eat,

138
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
except that they...

139
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,920
The food stops the moment our show starts.

140
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,680
That's neat.

141
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,420
No, no.

142
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
It's all wheat.

143
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,500
As the week goes on, there will be more food.

144
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,520
And again, I think I said it earlier,

145
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,360
if you buy one of those beautiful purple and silver mugs,

146
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,980
you can get free refilts.

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,960
I saw that.

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,020
That was offered to me.

149
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,540
Your free Caffeena's mug.

150
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,580
The only problem is that when one takes off into space,

151
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,260
one needs to keep the load.

152
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,820
And so I can't burden myself with it.

153
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,480
I understand that.

154
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,760
But remember, most of the hour of slack listeners,

155
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,420
which includes most of the subgeniuses here at Wisteria,

156
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,080
who don't ever watch us,

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,700
they can't grab that mug.

158
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,180
And those listening by internet can't grab that mug

159
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,400
because they didn't come.

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,380
Perhaps they can't come.

161
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,900
Perhaps that's why they're...

162
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,420
Or what?

163
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,020
Maybe they're...

164
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,020
Maybe we're the ones who can't.

165
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,080
Well, now, let's...

166
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,960
They're all having fun.

167
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,780
I can do just fine.

168
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,320
Thank you very much.

169
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,740
And we're sitting at this picnic table

170
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,360
at Tarzan's radio station

171
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,720
doing a show again.

172
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,900
Yes, in one sinuous movement,

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,180
Lord Greystoke arose from the branch

174
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,400
on which he had spent the night in easy slumber.

175
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,560
I hate having to say doing a show again,

176
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,000
but even worse is the phrase,

177
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,600
here we are at X-Day again.

178
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,540
Again.

179
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,480
Did I say that?

180
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,280
You have to say that.

181
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,420
I didn't say again.

182
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,700
I've said again.

183
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,260
I didn't use again.

184
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,040
I did.

185
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,860
I've been saying it's X-Day again

186
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,440
18 years in a row.

187
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,540
I'm tired of saying it's X-Day again.

188
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,440
Yes, dear friends.

189
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,380
I'd like to someday on some sunny July 5th

190
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,480
simply say it was X-Day after all.

191
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,200
It was X-Day again.

192
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,860
Come and gone.

193
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,060
And woe to the naysayers.

194
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,900
Woe to the naysayers.

195
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,460
Of course, you know,

196
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,140
those naysayers,

197
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,920
you know what's going to happen.

198
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,220
The world will be destroyed

199
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,040
like one of those,

200
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,920
it'll look like Neo-Tokyo

201
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,840
at the end of Akira.

202
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,880
But there will still be one pink guy

203
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,780
standing on his soapbox

204
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,920
screaming about how some guy,

205
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,860
whether it's Obama or somebody else,

206
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,420
that's the reason there are no more rats

207
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,660
for us to eat.

208
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,820
It'll be Obama's fault.

209
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,360
They're just trying to find the goat.

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,620
When in reality,

211
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,820
the reason those guys

212
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,400
will have no more rats to eat,

213
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,900
is Bob.

214
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,760
Bob is the one.

215
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,280
Bob is the one who did not give them,

216
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,900
who didn't leave them enough rats to eat,

217
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,140
and they're forced then to eat themselves.

218
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
Those rats aren't half bad, actually.

219
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,620
Bob ate all the rats.

220
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,180
Bob probably did eat all the rats.

221
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,360
You know, I mean, it's possible.

222
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,080
They're not bad, honestly.

223
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,500
Try it.

224
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,480
At the end times,

225
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,000
there won't be ketchup, though.

226
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,940
That's the thing.

227
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,660
Okay.

228
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,680
Ketchup doesn't survive the end times.

229
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,300
Now, on the other hand,

230
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,080
on the other hand,

231
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
Manx Darkpaw's saucer

232
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,680
actually has a ketchup factory in it.

233
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,720
So when you guys leave the planet

234
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,300
and you want ketchup,

235
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,840
seek out Manx Darkpaw's saucer.

236
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,480
But if you wanted ketchup on your French fries,

237
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,520
I don't know whose saucer has the French fries.

238
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,380
That's the problem.

239
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,540
Possees, you might want to cause some sound effects

240
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,640
by slipping that condom over the end times.

241
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,480
The mic is also called a wind stream.

242
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,980
All the subs at Wisteria liked X-Day a lot,

243
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,380
but the pinks who lived just north of Wisteria did not.

244
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,120
So we were driving up here and I saw this truck

245
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,720
and it had pink camo.

246
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,600
And I'm really confused why pink camo exists.

247
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,440
Like, are they trying to raid Barbie's dream house

248
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,740
or is Lisa Frank under attack by the blue meanies?

249
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
And you need the pink camo

250
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,640
and a green camo.

251
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,240
And a yellow camo.

252
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,240


253
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,240


254
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,480
To save the rainbow pooping unicorns.

255
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,660
Slow down, I'm taking notes here.

256
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,240
Are the misfits launching a co-op offensive

257
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,960
against Jim and the holograms?

258
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
Because you know that would be truly outrageous.

259
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
Well, let's keep up with current events.

260
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,960
You know, I subscribe to several news feeds,

261
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,560
but I really can't say I'm up

262
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,400
on every little change in the Neosphere.

263
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,980
But all that's going to be smoothed over

264
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,180
and a blank slate

265
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,620
when X-Day comes down.

266
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,760
day rolls over the quaking

267
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,000
citadels of man.

268
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,260
But how? Pink camo.

269
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,080
Pink.

270
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
I can't think of anything

271
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
more. It's

272
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,180
pink camo.

273
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,700
On the way up here I saw, and probably you saw,

274
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,000
a pink church.

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
It was a church and it was pink.

276
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,880
What more

277
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,300
needs to be said than that? Did you see it?

278
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,360
It looked like an angel food cake

279
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,760
in color. I wanted to go in there

280
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,500
and worship. It looked so appetizing.

281
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,800
There wasn't enough time.

282
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,520
I wanted to go in there and worship by

283
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,080
devouring the inhabitants.

284
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,580
You know when you say pink church, I'm imagining this giant

285
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,380
I want to be a cannibal redneck when I grow up.

286
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,600
It's a traditional church. It looks

287
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,320
as if it's a Plasticville

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,160
model from a train set.

289
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,280
And it's pink. I bet every

290
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,020
Saturday they give out

291
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,280
pink salad. Do you remember that

292
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,240
from your childhood? Or is that a southern thing?

293
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,100
Pink salad. They served

294
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,940
that crap at my elementary

295
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,260
school. What's in there? I didn't like it

296
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,420
even.

297
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,320
Even then. It's like cool whip

298
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,740
and jello and fruit.

299
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,500
Like I said, I don't know if that's a southern thing or what.

300
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,080
It's a Pobucker thing.

301
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,360
It's like, what do we have left

302
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,100
in the refrigerator? We've got

303
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,320
jello and cool whip.

304
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,340
Well, these benighted souls

305
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,440
don't know that they're supposed to make pudding

306
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,120
and put fruit in that,

307
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,340
which far exceeds any

308
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,200
Pobucker

309
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,600
cool whip. But then you need a trifle.

310
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,720
You need the trifle.

311
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,100
Exactly. Alcohol.

312
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,860
And that's really trifling. All the way down.

313
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,340
Lovely decoction of

314
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,580
alcohol, pudding,

315
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,300
fruit. You never get to the

316
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,880
bottom of that.

317
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,340
A little bit of cake. But it's not pink.

318
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,240
And it's not pink salad.

319
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,480
Angel food cake. You don't see

320
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
that much anymore. You know, when Bob called upon

321
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,300
us to destroy the world of

322
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,120
the pinks, he didn't mean the color

323
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,520
pink.

324
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,300
You know, it's more, it was

325
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,220
an attitude or something.

326
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,120
I believe.

327
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm worried about, you know,

328
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,160
the sort of racist

329
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,200
possibilities of killing only

330
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,920
pinks. I'm one of,

331
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,860
you know, if you're talking about colors,

332
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,500
I'm one of those.

333
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,320
I'd hardly say that your color was

334
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,420
pink, Stang. I just want

335
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,060
to drown a pink in pink salad. Is my countenance

336
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,200
crimson? It might be

337
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,820
from telling these outrageous

338
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,060
slanders and prevarications, but

339
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,280
our coloration is

340
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,380
more beige.

341
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
At the best of times. Unless you have

342
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,880
sunburned, and then, yeah.

343
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,140
I like to be the devil's advocate.

344
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,540
And Bob is the devil's

345
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,500
devil's advocate. You know, the devil,

346
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,240
we were talking about this the other night,

347
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
has pulled me out of jams before,

348
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,020
just as you were saying

349
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
how he'd pulled you out of jams.

350
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,280
So, I'm not

351
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,420
going to slander him too much. But how did you get that much jam to get stuck in?

352
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,560
It was actually

353
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,420
honey and feathers, weren't you saying?

354
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,980
Yeah, yeah. The first

355
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,720
X-Day drill.

356
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,160
Well, what turned out to be the third

357
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,380
X-Day drill, and what the pinks

358
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,660
called 1998, I was,

359
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,340
for some reason, people,

360
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,340
well, we didn't have the bob dummy

361
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,100
then. They had to take

362
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,300
their anger out on somebody when the saucers

363
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,440
came, so I got dunked

364
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,040
in honey. I got strip-naked,

365
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,340
honey poured all over me, and then a bunch of

366
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,320
pink feathers.

367
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,580
And then thrown into the rancid

368
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,400
scummy pond.

369
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,500
Yes.

370
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
And it was a guy

371
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,480
dressed as the devil.

372
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,300
And maybe it was the devil himself

373
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,620
wearing a devil mask.

374
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,140
He came and rescued me

375
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,440
from those redheads

376
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,080
and the crowd of 300

377
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
jeering mockers.

378
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,500
Yeah, you've got to watch out for those redheads with the freckles.

379
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,100
But what about your friend Thayton,

380
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,160
Prince of Darkness?

381
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,060
Oh, you're thinking Reverend

382
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,500
Mickey Mephistopheles.

383
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,240
Yeah, he's another one of your

384
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,020
demonic pals.

385
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm sure he'll be here for Starwood.

386
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,440
He goes,

387
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,600
he got scared at X-Day.

388
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,260
Oh, Mephistopheles.

389
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,720
X-Day scared Thayton

390
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,520
that one year.

391
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,840
I was greatly helped in the desert

392
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,920
by Mephistopheles once.

393
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,200
Really?

394
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,720
Really.

395
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,580
Helped me a great deal.

396
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,220
Normally it's Jesus that helps people in the desert.

397
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,420
Is it? Does Jesus help people

398
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,600
or does Jesus simply set them

399
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,340
on the proper path?

400
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,320
I've read it.

401
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,940
Jesus sets you straight, but you still have to find your way

402
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,000
down from the church spire or out through the desert.

403
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,920
But there's something none of these holier-than-thou

404
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,980
Joes never figure on.

405
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,780
Well, I want to hear about the devil saving you

406
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,740
in the desert.

407
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,480
Well, it was when

408
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
I was in a

409
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,580
I was in a

410
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,880
a show.

411
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,640
It was that thing,

412
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,660
The Secrets of Uranus.

413
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,380
I may have told you about it.

414
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,180
Was this at Burning Man?

415
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,260
It was at Burning Man.

416
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh, well, of course the devil's at Burning Man.

417
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,660
Well, he was part of it.

418
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,100
It was all about

419
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,300
how God was constipated

420
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,200
and couldn't release his load.

421
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,400
And Sigmund Freud and the devil

422
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,260
were there, but

423
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,020
I had to say the crucial lines

424
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,340
that ended the whole show.

425
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,740
And I was down in this little wooden shack

426
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,000
with an actual

427
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,080
hunchback guy pulling levers

428
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,100
and glowering at me.

429
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,040
There's a lot to this story.

430
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,180
Too long.

431
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,800
But at the appropriate time,

432
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,780
I said, well, I'm ready to say my lines.

433
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,180
Nobody told me about it.

434
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,780
There isn't any microphone in here.

435
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,480
And I thought I'd had such a great time

436
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,140
up to then that now it was all going to be ruined

437
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,880
and it was all going to be my fault.

438
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,680
And there wasn't anything I could do about it.

439
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,500
So I ran out of the structure

440
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,220
and I ran around it just looking for a loose microphone.

441
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,260
And Mephistopheles said,

442
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,920
Here, here, Dr. Hal, up here.

443
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,560
Here's my mic.

444
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,240
Here's my mic.

445
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,400
And so I did.

446
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,620
I did.

447
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,300
Say the last lines

448
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,280
and everything went off to perfection.

449
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,800
Did Jesus hand you a microphone, son?

450
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,240
No.

451
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,840
Jesus wasn't in that.

452
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,820
Who handed you a microphone?

453
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,660
It was all split foot.

454
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,920
They had Jehovah in this show,

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,840
but not Jesus.

456
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,440
Although once when he threw a red robe over his shoulder,

457
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,940
the father resembled the son a little bit

458
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,060
to my mushroom resonating brain.

459
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,500
I thought that was...

460
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,540
I do remember you telling me about that

461
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,140
because I remember the moment...

462
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,380
It was...

463
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,480
It was...

464
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,480


465
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,480


466
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,480


467
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:52,820
It was incredible.

468
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,420
I was hoping that you'd been rescued

469
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,300
literally by a fork-tailed devil

470
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,060
out in the desert in Tucson.

471
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,000
That time you went looking for the mating

472
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,260
Sonoran Desert toads to lick.

473
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,400
That was a different occasion.

474
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,960
And I did come to the mating ground of those toads,

475
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,680
but there was no devil involved.

476
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,580
But...

477
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,380
It's true.

478
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,660
Dr. Hal has actually found his way

479
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,480
to the mating ground of Sonoran Desert toads.

480
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,860
It's an incredible place.

481
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,820
And those are the kind that you can lick.

482
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,220
No, you can't.

483
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,240
Well, you can lick all of them.

484
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,220
You can't and you should never lick a toad.

485
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,460
If you tell people they should lick a toad and they die,

486
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,900
it's your fault for spreading misinformation.

487
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,020
But they're probably going to die on next day anyway.

488
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:37,720
Toad lickers.

489
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,360
Well, maybe so.

490
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,820
But on the other hand, it's irresponsible to tell people...

491
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,720
You rub the sweat off and dry it and smoke it, right?

492
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,240
It's not sweat.

493
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,780
You have to squeeze the venom glands

494
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,020
until they spurt out the liquid inside.

495
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,100
Oh.

496
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,740
It hurts the toad.

497
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,560
Yeah, it does.

498
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,480
Yeah, that's what they say.

499
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,660
In fact, the toad is...

500
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,200
They like it.

501
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,360
Ooh, ah, oh, Lord.

502
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,900
Yeah, exactly.

503
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,120
Squeeze me some more, Dr. Hal.

504
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,940
You squeeze the bubo on the toad.

505
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,020
Squeeze my bubo.

506
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,300
Oh, oh, oh, squeeze it again.

507
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,300
I favor squeezing it onto a clean sheet of glass.

508
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,140
How many times have they asked me to do that?

509
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,620
You have such huge bubos.

510
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,860
A clean, sterile sheet of glass.

511
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,700
The spurt goes there and let it dry.

512
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,100
Then you scrape it with...

513
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,460
May I palpate your bubo, little toad?

514
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,080
Then you take this scraped off stuff,

515
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,860
which has the consistency of rubber cement,

516
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,080
and you rub it on the toad.

517
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,220
And it's quite smokable.

518
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,800
And you put it in a pipe in which you have never smoked anything else.

519
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,360
The pipe must also be sterile and clean.

520
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,380
And then you light it.

521
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,520
But first you have to make sure that your body will be in a place

522
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,060
where nobody will do anything with it for half an hour or so.

523
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,200
And off you go.

524
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,760
Yeah, just lean back and talk to Bob for half an hour.

525
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,480
With...

526
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,480
It's the most intense thing, but it's over in half an hour,

527
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,040
unlike...

528
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,520
Like other trips that go on and on for days.

529
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,280
Well, it's DMT type of chemical.

530
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,440
It's the only one secreted by a vertebrate animal.

531
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,980
And that animal is Bufo alvarez,

532
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,080
the Colorado river toad of northern Mexico,

533
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,080
southern Arizona, New Mexico, and California.

534
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,980
Daddy, look, she has big bubos.

535
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,920
And you know what...

536
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,520
Daddy, why are you squeezing that little Mrs. Toad's bubo?

537
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,080
There were some educators, some nature educators,

538
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,380
who were arrested in California

539
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,060
because they were...

540
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,020
Because they illegally possessed these illegal toads.

541
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,080
And their names...

542
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,340
How do you make nature illegal?

543
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,740
They freely confessed that they smoked the venom of Bufo alvarez.

544
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,220
And their names, you should be interested in knowing,

545
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,000
were Bob and Connie.

546
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,440
I saved the newspaper article.

547
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,120
Yes, they were martyrs for toad venom combustion.

548
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,200
Hmm.

549
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,960
Friend, don't be a martyr for toad venom.

550
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,260
Just do it.

551
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,520
As Stang just toad you.

552
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,920
Toad away, toad away.

553
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,500
Toad away, toad away.

554
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,960
Where do you go when you're toad away?

555
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,720
And now a moment of silence.

556
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,860
For Peter Bergman and Phil Austin of the Firesign Theatre.

557
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:31,420
Now only half of Firesign Theatre is left in these straightened times.

558
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,080
These terrible end times that came according to the prediction.

559
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,340
We are deprived of them and all sorts of others

560
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,260
who were help in less pressing times.

561
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,080
Ah, yes, the tribulation times.

562
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,380
Actually, I keep reading on the internet that America has been destroyed.

563
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,260
And usually one guy did it.

564
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,240
Obama.

565
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,200
I think they're giving him a little too much credit.

566
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,240
And it worries me sometimes.

567
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,860
It's like, am I hallucinating?

568
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,520
I went down to the supermarket.

569
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,040
I want my country back again.

570
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,620
And everything looked normal.

571
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,420
I mean, the supermarket was still there.

572
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,480
People were shopping.

573
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:20,060
People of all ages and races.

574
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,720
And sizes were shopping.

575
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,040
All phantoms.

576
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,300
Most of them in little carts since they're determined to become obese.

577
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,060
They're too large to move under their own power.

578
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,420
Just like in Wall-E.

579
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,780
The Walmartosaurus was so huge and heavy that if it were to leave its shopping cart,

580
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,160
its bones would be crushed under its own weight.

581
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,100
And would soon die from asphyxiation.

582
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,020
On the floor of Kroger's or wherever.

583
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,880
No, Walmart.

584
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,840
Walmart, okay.

585
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:05,120
I am offended by those Walmart shopper mocking photo collections where they show all these

586
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,440
horrible wretched po-buckers at Walmart because I'm a Walmart shopper.

587
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,420
I'm sorry to say, but by golly, a stack of 100 blank CDs is 10 bucks cheaper there than

588
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,020
it is at Mom and Pop's.

589
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,700
Little hideaway shop.

590
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,440
Well, is this a wall of shame?

591
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,940
And Mom and Pop's is 40 miles away.

592
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,460
Walmart's just around the corner.

593
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,380
What's a feller supposed to do?

594
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,280
These are like pictures in some Italian restaurant of the beloved customers, only it's the Walmart

595
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,940
customers.

596
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,820
No, there's websites that...

597
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,640
Oh, websites.

598
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Elites post pictures of poor people who are badly dressed.

599
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,240
Now I know what you're talking about.

600
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,000
They're trying...

601
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You see, the internet is all about shaming.

602
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,620
Yeah.

603
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,780
They're either trying to build you up or shame you.

604
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,000
And they're trying to make you look like a poor, poor, poor, poor, poor, poor, poor, poor,

605
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,000


606
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,360
poor.

607
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,360


608
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,360


609
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,780
A lot of people are about how terrible these po'buckers in Walmart are and how badly they

610
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,060
dress.

611
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,840
Well, I mean...

612
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,880
Well, they were never thinking that they would be on some sneering joker's website.

613
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,320
And that guy is probably the stereotype at home in his tighty-whities eating potato chips,

614
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,700
you know.

615
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,040
If anyone saw him, he would be far more horrendous than some poor Walmart shopper.

616
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,940
But just remember, the greatest thing about the internet is everything is on the internet,

617
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,980
and the worst thing about the internet is everything is on the internet.

618
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:19,980


619
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:19,980


620
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,260
And it all has equal weight.

621
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,620
Falseness and fury, hatred, deformity, all get...

622
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,440
A deadly internet.

623
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,380
Yes.

624
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,380
I think that if America is destroyed, it will be because of the internet.

625
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,960
I think the internet is making everybody stupider,

626
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,740
because anything you want to believe,

627
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,580
you can find a hundred thousand other people who believe the same idiotic crap.

628
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,240
It's definitely...

629
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,860
And the next thing you know, it's household knowledge.

630
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,300
It's definitely making everybody stupider,

631
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,780
because that's what people use everything for, to become stupider.

632
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,100
But the danger is...

633
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,420
But everybody knows that that Amtrak station is a secret camp

634
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,460
for the government to round up all of the good American citizens

635
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,400
so that they can brainwash them and make them make goods for the Chinese and the Russians

636
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,180
when the world takes over the Americans.

637
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,300
And then, you know, you have to worry about the lizard people.

638
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,620
You don't understand.

639
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,260
It's the lizard people.

640
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,840
The lizard people are coming forward.

641
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,820
And they're going to round us up in camps.

642
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,100
Actually, as usual, the lizard people are the good guys.

643
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,620
Right.

644
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:23,880
Yeah.

645
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,180
They always get that kind of crap.

646
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,700
And that's what they learn from the internet.

647
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,120
Oh, I want to believe that vaccines caused autism of my child

648
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,840
rather than all my drinking while he was in the womb.

649
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,100
And they can find out, wouldn't we all know, obviously,

650
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,140
astrology causes autism.

651
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,320
Well, the problem with the internet is it's hackable

652
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
and it's also vulnerable.

653
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,760
Everyone thinks the power will never go off.

654
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,040
But if the power goes off, you're screwed.

655
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,160
You said astrology causes autism?

656
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,420
And finally, it's the imposition of a monoculture,

657
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,360
which is dangerous in any case.

658
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,160
Palmistry must cause chronic masturbation.

659
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,520
Well, I'm sure you can find several articles

660
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,560
that will say that very thing on the internet,

661
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,040
so it must be true.

662
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
Well, I've said it, so it must be true.

663
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,580
Well, it...

664
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:17,840
Well, it's true.

665
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,880
And we've recorded it.

666
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,560
And we're on the internet.

667
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,560
Yeah, it's done.

668
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,240
There you go.

669
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,120
So there you go, folks.

670
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,980
Palmistry causes chronic masturbation.

671
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,520
And palmers for to saken,

672
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,700
sundry stranders,

673
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,940
inferny hoes,

674
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,600
booth and sundry launders.

675
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,540
Where can I find somebody who can help me with my palmistry?

676
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,460
On the internet.

677
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,300
It has to do with...

678
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,740
You see here?

679
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,460
Well, okay, it depends on...

680
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,520
Not the map of Michigan,

681
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,320
but this right here and then that.

682
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Those lines on your hand?

683
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,840
This bump represents your spleen.

684
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,620
And this one represents your nephritic ducts.

685
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,700
We're not talking about the map of Michigan.

686
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,020
No.

687
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,600
Your feet are down here by your laugh lines.

688
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,360
Right, right, right.

689
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,860
Oh, because your hand forms a map of Michigan.

690
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,200
Yes, yes.

691
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,840
Michigan is the one state that is lucky enough

692
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,980
that they can show you where they live.

693
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,760
Here's a map of Texas.

694
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,580
Looks like shooting a fangirl.

695
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,040
Yes.

696
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,500
All them Yankees.

697
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,860
Right, right.

698
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,600
But no, no, no.

699
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,540
You see this line here?

700
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,520
That's the one about...

701
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,160
That's the one about your sexual taste.

702
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,880
And then this one here is the one about

703
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,200
what kind of lube you should use when you're masturbating.

704
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,460
Michigan for champions.

705
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,560
I can't see the lines of my palms through this hair.

706
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,360
Does anybody have a comb or a razor?

707
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,940
Then I can get my palm done.

708
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,740
Oh, we can cut for Sooners and for suckers.

709
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,700
And actually, actually for the females,

710
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,780
you'll see there's a little pattern right here.

711
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,860
And on females, that pattern tells us things.

712
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,660
And that's how we...

713
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,400
That's the connection, you know.

714
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,940
There's little swirls there,

715
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,580
they're a match up to, you know,

716
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,900
the pattern that you're doing as a female.

717
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:52,980
Oh.

718
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,680
Like a jigsaw?

719
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,300
Right.

720
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,960
Every woman's pattern is...

721
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,820
And just like every male's hair...

722
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,280
Did you learn that on the internet,

723
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,060
on that all women's Facebook page?

724
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,140
No, no, no.

725
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,980
Secret women's Facebook page

726
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,180
that I'm not supposed to know about,

727
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:11,860
but I've seen it.

728
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,640
I've seen it.

729
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,880
And all they do is just talk about their husbands snoring.

730
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,920
No, we talk about more than that.

731
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,000
They just sit there and sip about their husbands snoring.

732
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,380
And we all snore.

733
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,040
No, no, no.

734
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,140
We talk about more than that.

735
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
Snoring is a serious problem.

736
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,760
We all talk about our lady parts.

737
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,500
Nobody told me about the all men's internet page

738
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,360
or Facebook page until you did.

739
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,120
Yeah, well, actually,

740
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,080
you accidentally told me about it,

741
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,980
and then Hal mentioned it,

742
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,460
and I realized,

743
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,500
oh, I wasn't invited onto this men-only

744
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,780
such genius Facebook page.

745
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:39,980
No, they don't, you know,

746
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,880
it's, it's, it's,

747
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,720
the thing is,

748
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,380
is that they're jealous of your,

749
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,880
your, your gift.

750
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,740
It's actually about athletes...

751
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,860
It's a, it's a bunch of,

752
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,900
what did you say?

753
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,800
It's a bunch of pink softcore porn, actually.

754
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,560
Yeah, that's what...

755
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:55,980
I mean...

756
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,960
It's the same old tired tropes of misogyny and...

757
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,840
Yeah, you know, I mean,

758
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,140
it's, it's, it's, it's, you know...

759
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
Not the good porn.

760
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,140
No, no, no, no, no.

761
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,320
It's, it's, it's basically

762
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,620
a lot of, of, of silicone sports illustrated.

763
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,780
Plastic.

764
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,860
It's too plastic, man.

765
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,120
Then there was the subgenius

766
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,820
post pictures of your own.

767
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,840
Dick page.

768
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,780
Yes, and many have done that.

769
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,720
That made me so insecure,

770
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,460
just looking at it.

771
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,440
Many have done it.

772
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,280
That I was against it.

773
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,560
You know, you don't have to feel bad

774
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,060
that they have more peni than you.

775
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,020
I mean, it's okay.

776
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,660
No, I, well, that's...

777
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,120
They're spoiling their political careers

778
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,500
and their chances of becoming

779
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,760
a Supreme Court judge.

780
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Well, I mean...

781
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,920
Right.

782
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,940
I don't, yeah...

783
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,260
That's not the gavel there.

784
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,120
Well, it could be.

785
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,020
No, truly, there was a...

786
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,900
They sure didn't bang on things like that.

787
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:46,900


788
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,640
A secret Facebook page where

789
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,780
exhibitionist subgeniuses were...

790
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,300
I guess they're still doing it.

791
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,020
No, no, no, it's gone.

792
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,100
They get up in the morning with the...

793
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,160
The same one is still doing it.

794
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,500
A tentpole and go,

795
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,360
oh, I better take this picture right now.

796
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540
And they're all so proud of their

797
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,540
one gigantic, huge dick.

798
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,120
One!

799
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,360
Well, they might enjoy it while they have it.

800
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,420
You know, that might have been, you know,

801
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,160
an issue, too.

802
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,800
I mean, they may have been, you know...

803
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,100
They didn't want me on there

804
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,500
because then they'd feel outnumbered.

805
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,600
But I have to ask this, you know,

806
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
as a female subgenius,

807
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,020
I have a really important question

808
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,340
about this multi-peni question,

809
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,120
which is how many boxes of condoms

810
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,820
do you have to buy for one sex act?

811
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,700
Well, I got a vasectomy a long time ago.

812
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,560
Oh, okay.

813
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,380
That's actually why I only have one nut.

814
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,960
Well, no, I'm just curious

815
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,460
because for the other subgeni with multiple...

816
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,660
I mean, do you get the 36-pack?

817
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,620
I mean, and how many...

818
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,720
I mean, it seems like a lot of work.

819
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,360
I just retract most of them.

820
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,720
Oh.

821
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,880
Most of them are so tiny,

822
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,680
they're hardly...

823
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,100
Hitler has only got one ball.

824
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,740
I didn't realize that they were retractable.

825
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,360
Himmler has two, but very small.

826
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,520
Or rather, Goebbels has two, but very small.

827
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,300
Himmler is somewhat similar.

828
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
And Dr. Goebbels has no balls at all.

829
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,200
You know, there's a second...

830
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,200
There's a second stanza of that.

831
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,880
Yes, I didn't do that right either.

832
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,340
How does that go?

833
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
The secret beefcase.

834
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,740
Gehring has two, but very small.

835
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,340
Himmler...

836
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,440
Himmler is somewhat similar.

837
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,960
And Dr. Goebbels has no balls at all.

838
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,980
I refuse to go all the way to Berlin

839
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,660
so that a one-testicle madman can pin a...

840
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,740
Oh, I'm not wearing my decoration.

841
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,000
You have decor?

842
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,800
Yes, I won the Fleur de Lis award at Burning Man,

843
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,020
and I really worked to win this thing.

844
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:43,880
A Fleur de Lis?

845
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,340
Yes, the horror film.

846
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,000
The Fleur de Lis.

847
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,000


848
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,000


849
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,060
The Fleur of France.

850
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,980
In the French Quarter at Burning Man.

851
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,740
They tried to throw us out of there.

852
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,960
They didn't know I had special connections.

853
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:56,980
Horror.

854
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,860
Horror flower?

855
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,740
The French Quarter where they build their...

856
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,560
The fake New Orleans and balconies and...

857
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:03,880
Oh, okay.

858
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,720
I thought you said something else.

859
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,280
I thought you said horror flower.

860
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,340
I say the French...

861
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,060
The horror flower of France.

862
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,180
The Fleur de Lis.

863
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,060
It was branded on My Lady de Winter by Louis XIV.

864
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,680
I was going to say the horror flower of France

865
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,340
had a different name.

866
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,280
And that name is?

867
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,100
I don't remember her name.

868
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,580
But, yeah, she...

869
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,980
You know, I didn't really...

870
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,260
You know, that's not my thing, man.

871
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Well, I...

872
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,760
The thing is, it's not like there's an office with a time...

873
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,140
Yeah, you know, I mean, it's...

874
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,960
The business cards are, you know, a little different.

875
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,980
And, you know, there's not a...

876
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,440
It's not really in the phone book.

877
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,440
I mean...

878
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,740
You have seen the Fleur de Lis before?

879
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,280
Oh, yeah.

880
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,360
It's a cocktail to the acanthus leaves

881
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,220
on the top of...

882
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,740
The Corinthian columns?

883
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,300
Yes.

884
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,000
And the closest thing to the venerated lotus

885
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,100
that we have in Western art.

886
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,220
Yes, Fleur de Lis are all over

887
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,200
classic architecture on the East Coast.

888
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,600
Oh, I'm all over Fleur de Lis.

889
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,300
I'm...

890
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,740
I'm just over it, man.

891
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,440
I'm over that.

892
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,940
Well, now you seem to have a book here,

893
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,540
The Sexual Relations of Mankind.

894
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,860
Yes.

895
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,240
By Professor Mantegazatz.

896
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,760
Oh, cool.

897
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,140
I have a pretty good section marked here.

898
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,320
Oh, well, perhaps you'd better share it

899
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,920
with our listeners.

900
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:26,940
Oh, wow.

901
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,620
I happen to know that there has been introduced

902
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,220
into Europe and is in use there today

903
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,060
an ampelang

904
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,480
that is not so cruel in character

905
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,940
as that of the dyax,

906
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,940
but which is equally well adapted

907
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,760
to purposes of debauchery.

908
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,760
It is said that already at Paris

909
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,540
they are binding the member

910
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,340
with a...

911
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,520
with downy strips

912
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,200
from the feather of a goose

913
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,340
and that rings and India rubber stars

914
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,540
are for sale

915
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,040
for equipping the masculine lance

916
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,360
and rendering it more pleasing

917
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,280
to the daughters of Eve.

918
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,780
In addition to the desire

919
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,720
for increasing voluptuous pleasure,

920
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,980
not the least of the motives

921
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,180
behind such diabolic inventions

922
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,060
is, we are inclined to believe,

923
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,020
the whimsical temptation

924
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,060
to try out new things.

925
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
And to play with organs

926
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,960
which during life's fertile period

927
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,680
are the object of so much curiosity

928
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,280
to both sexes.

929
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,020
And then there's an article here

930
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,320
about the world's first cock ring.

931
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,600
What year was this?

932
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,460
This is a pretty old book.

933
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,780
Let's see.

934
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,060
I think it was published...

935
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,320
Yeah, 1935.

936
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,460
1935.

937
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,260
Okay, this quote is from

938
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,800
18...

939
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,160
71.

940
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,800
Alrighty.

941
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,940
They blank out this guy's name,

942
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,200
but it's the number two

943
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,620
and a letter B.

944
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,780
Mr. Blank.

945
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,640
2B.

946
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
A married man of 59 years,

947
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,480
September 1871.

948
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,600
A week ago, for the purpose

949
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,020
by no means original,

950
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
he inserted the penis

951
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,120
into a nuptial ring.

952
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,740
Upon his visit,

953
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,840
he was found with the ring

954
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,440
fastened below the glands

955
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,640
of the prepuce.

956
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,600
A considerable tumescence

957
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,900
was perceptible.

958
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,980
The prepuce was in a state

959
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,340
of paraphimosis,

960
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,760
and the strangulation

961
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,660
exerted by the ring

962
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,040
had produced an uneven ulcer

963
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,940
quite deep on the upper side

964
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,680
of the penis,

965
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,340
superficial in the lower portion.

966
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,800
Urination difficult,

967
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:35,960
but still possible.

968
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,200
Had no ability to put it

969
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,060
on the internet, too.

970
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,020
The ring was sawed in two,

971
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,120
after which cicatrization

972
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,720
was rapid.

973
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,120
They call it scarring.

974
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,780
And two days later,

975
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,980
the patient left cured.

976
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,580
Yes, I'll bet.

977
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,520
The gangrene of the penis

978
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,120
from mechanical causes is rare.

979
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,680
Oh.

980
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,140
Let's be thankful for that, at least.

981
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,060
Of course, from non-mechanical causes,

982
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,660
it's not rare.

983
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,320
That's a good question.

984
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:04,940
We've got to watch out.

985
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,360
I was in the pond,

986
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,860
and I felt some little thing

987
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,740
attach itself to my thigh,

988
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,400
which I had to dislodge.

989
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,180
That was a candiru toad.

990
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,440
Something like that.

991
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,580
It wanted to get,

992
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,280
more friendly.

993
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,560
I had to knock him off.

994
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,920
Suds had made friends

995
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,140
with the woodland creatures

996
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,420
when we first arrived.

997
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,940
It was the strangest thing ever.

998
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,520
They were all hopping around

999
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,760
like in a Walt Disney.

1000
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,100
Little furry, adorable creatures

1001
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,260
would come up to him

1002
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,820
and try to nestle in his pants leg.

1003
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,680
Yeah.

1004
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,440
You know, and just,

1005
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
it was really cute.

1006
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,640
Give him some popcorn.

1007
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,260
Well, we gave him a cashew,

1008
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,860
and then we just said,

1009
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,860
you, you,

1010
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,380
adorable woodland creature,

1011
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,120
your new name is Cashew.

1012
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,180
Cashew on demand.

1013
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,120
Absolutely.

1014
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Well, you see,

1015
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,800
all one needs to do

1016
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
is show a might of civility

1017
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,540
and friendliness

1018
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,720
here in nature's wonderland,

1019
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
and all these stories

1020
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,520
about evil creatures

1021
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,940
simply melt away.

1022
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
They aren't rape bears.

1023
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,740
They're affection bears.

1024
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,840
They're love teddies.

1025
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,880
Here's a good one.

1026
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,960
In 1868,

1027
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,800
M. Guilbeau communicated

1028
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,640
to the Society of Hospitals

1029
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,340
the cases of a man

1030
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,580
of 50 who had inserted his penis

1031
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,680
all the way to the base

1032
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,360
into a series of seven

1033
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,700
very strong and tight brass rings

1034
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,740
for the purpose, so he said,

1035
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,000
of procuring for himself

1036
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,080
moments of pleasure.

1037
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,300
These rings remained in place

1038
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,900
for 11 hours.

1039
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,800
Yo.

1040
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,580
The penis was already

1041
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,120
indurated, cyanotic,

1042
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,500
extremely swollen,

1043
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,340
and of a gangrenous hue.

1044
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,760
After any number of attempts

1045
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,660
to get them off,

1046
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,160
the rings were finally,

1047
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,060
finally sawed in two,

1048
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,240
one after another.

1049
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,380
Within a week,

1050
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,820
all local traces had disappeared.

1051
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,820
So all that stuff

1052
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,600
about grabbing the brass ring

1053
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,820
is only so much...

1054
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,920
In conclusion, I may...

1055
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,560
This is the conclusion of the chapter.

1056
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,440
In conclusion, I may mention

1057
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,620
two well-known cases.

1058
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,600
First, that of the soldier

1059
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,520
whom Larry found with his penis

1060
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,240
snared in the tube of his bayonet.

1061
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,580
What about Moe and Curly?

1062
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,420
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1063
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,340
That of the man

1064
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,140
in the back of his bayonet.

1065
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,460
The man in the bathtub

1066
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,000
who was found with his penis

1067
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,660
up the faucet.

1068
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,200
Wait, wait, wait.

1069
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,040
He put his...

1070
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,420
He put in the...

1071
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,360
In his...

1072
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,020
Wait, wait.

1073
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,780
In a bayonet?

1074
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,400
A bayonet tube.

1075
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,760
You've heard...

1076
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,020
They say fix bayonets

1077
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,980
in the military.

1078
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,000
I...

1079
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,740
Oh, he was fixing his bayonet.

1080
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,900
Is that what they call it now?

1081
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,480
Yes.

1082
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,480
Is that what the kids

1083
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,400
are calling that now?

1084
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,780
There's a reason he put it

1085
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,660
in the bayonet, which...

1086
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:40,820
Well, you know,

1087
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,980
I don't want to shame him.

1088
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,080
Well, this is on the internet,

1089
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,960
so go ahead.

1090
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,980
And shame him.

1091
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,920
But I would imagine

1092
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,500
that the tube of a bayonet

1093
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,820
really isn't that large

1094
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,780
of an orifice.

1095
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,820
So, I mean,

1096
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,680
I suppose he was

1097
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,100
a fairly lonely fellow.

1098
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,300
Lonely Corporal Hitler?

1099
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,020
Think how many bayonet tubes

1100
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,880
I would need.

1101
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,520
Well, you could get

1102
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,380
some custom manufacture.

1103
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,160
You could use

1104
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,280
one of those pan flutes.

1105
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,740
They're all, you know,

1106
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,780
it's all there for you.

1107
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,240
Um, uh, this is, of course,

1108
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,280
entirely speculative and...

1109
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,020
No, no, no, no.

1110
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,140
Not that I'm suggesting

1111
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,860
that you put anything

1112
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,680
in the orifice

1113
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,320
of any musical instrument.

1114
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,320
I'm not suggesting that at all.

1115
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,840
I don't...

1116
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,100
Please, you know,

1117
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,240
don't put your parts

1118
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,280
in a flute

1119
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,180
or a tuba

1120
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,660
or a trombone.

1121
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,000
It would be really unacceptable

1122
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,920
to somehow

1123
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,800
put something, you know,

1124
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,340
inside your sousaphone

1125
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,220
or your French horn.

1126
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,620
I never do.

1127
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,480
You know,

1128
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,120
that's not appropriate behavior

1129
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,000
at all.

1130
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,120
I mean, that would not

1131
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,180
be acceptable and...

1132
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,160
It's sometimes necessary.

1133
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,520
And, uh...

1134
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,560
I know there was

1135
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,800
the one time at band camp

1136
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,360
and that's okay,

1137
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,920
but no, no,

1138
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,260
please do not put

1139
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,740
body parts,

1140
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,780
especially not in

1141
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,480
brass instruments.

1142
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,960
Speaking of band camp...

1143
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,580
Oh, yeah,

1144
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,780
speaking of band camp,

1145
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,660
that's a good point.

1146
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,900
Those of...

1147
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,640
If you don't know already,

1148
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,980
the Church of the Subgenius

1149
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,460
is now releasing

1150
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,100
in digital format

1151
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,800
amazing material

1152
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,380
at subgeniusfoundation.bandcamp.

1153
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,720
If you're interested,

1154
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,180
you can check it out.

1155
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,180
We can't give prices

1156
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,580
on this community,

1157
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,060
supported radio station,

1158
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,600
however.

1159
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,460
However, you'll find it there.

1160
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:48,740
Actually,

1161
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,860
it's a buck a song,

1162
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,040
ten bucks an album,

1163
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,600
and I'll have to cut that part out

1164
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
for the broadcast version,

1165
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,120
that's all.

1166
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,160
As you can see,

1167
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,380
it's reasonably priced.

1168
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,060
These aren't millionaire prices.

1169
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,340
They're even within the reach

1170
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,060
of Joe Subgenius.

1171
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,400
Absolutely reasonable

1172
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,060
and acceptable.

1173
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,840
Yes,

1174
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,700
he's no normal dude.

1175
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:12,880
Dude.

1176
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,800
And his cousin,

1177
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,820
Joe Lunchpail.

1178
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,620
Yes,

1179
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,560
they're not batshit crazy

1180
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,680
like subgeniuses are.

1181
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,580
Then there was Joe Bob Lunchpail Genius.

1182
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,980
Oh.

1183
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,420
He was a confusing fad.

1184
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,080
Well, it's hard to keep the many progeny

1185
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,900
of Typhon

1186
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:28,880
separated.

1187
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,240
Look at that.

1188
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
She's over there shooting the moon.

1189
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,620
What?

1190
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,980
She was over there shooting the moon.

1191
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,080
What gun can send a bullet that far?

1192
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,500
No, no, no, no, no.

1193
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,080
It was an amazing...

1194
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,440
That's all right.

1195
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,160
...amazing moonshot.

1196
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
That's okay, Pisces.

1197
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,540
Don't worry about it.

1198
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,180
Well, the moon's pretty tough, really.

1199
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,600
I mean,

1200
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,140
and that's okay.

1201
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,900
I mean,

1202
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,800
I wouldn't feel too bad for the moon.

1203
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,220
After all,

1204
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,380
we did stab it with a flag and...

1205
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,800
And left bottles of astronaut pee up there.

1206
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,660
Yeah, yeah.

1207
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,180
I mean,

1208
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,360
that's like the worst kind of trucker bomb ever

1209
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,840
when you really think about it.

1210
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,300
I mean,

1211
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
but at least nobody has to mow the moon,

1212
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,620
you know?

1213
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,520
Not yet.

1214
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,580
Well, soon.

1215
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,160
Soon.

1216
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:11,700
I mean,

1217
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,100
they might have to on the other side of the moon

1218
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,880
we can't see.

1219
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,080
Oh, no.

1220
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,280
There aren't any gardens there anymore,

1221
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,540
but we can set some growing.

1222
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,520
Not anymore.

1223
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,300
Well, yeah, I guess.

1224
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,140
I'm trying to remember what the...

1225
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:26,520
Who...

1226
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,000
What style were the gardens on the dark side of the moon?

1227
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Well, they were like hothouses

1228
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,620
in elegant, now ruined cities.

1229
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
The uses of sulfur.

1230
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,300
But,

1231
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,060
lunar soil is great for growing anything.

1232
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,380
It has been proved with the soil

1233
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,900
that was taken back from Apollo expeditions.

1234
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,420
It made plants grow practically instantly

1235
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,520
and grow huge.

1236
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,160
And now that we know there's water up there,

1237
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,660
not only within the lunar regolith,

1238
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,160
but as freestanding water in deep craters,

1239
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,620
which the sun has not touched,

1240
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:03,880
why,

1241
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,940
we can have our farms of kale and alfalfa up there.

1242
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,360
Or frop.

1243
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,400
Or frop, exactly.

1244
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,520
You take a good,

1245
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,280
good-sized crater and you roof it over

1246
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,900
and pump some air in there

1247
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,540
and you've got plenty of solar energy.

1248
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,840
You're all ready to go.

1249
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,820
Moon frop.

1250
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,100
Yes.

1251
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,000
I don't know about moon frop.

1252
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,980
Stang would have to explain to me a little more about...

1253
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,820
Well, when you smoke it,

1254
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,580
it would draw you in a tidal fashion toward the moon.

1255
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,060
Ah, moon frop.

1256
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,360
Well, we're done.

1257
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:40,660
We're done.

1258
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,680
Oh, you have more of the book?

1259
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,280
Yeah, I was distracted.

1260
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,980
I didn't hear anything you guys said

1261
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,840
because I was reading that love's most shameful phase,

1262
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,600
shameful above all,

1263
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,020
is sodomy,

1264
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,880
which a man may practice either upon a woman

1265
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,920
or upon a person of his own sex.

1266
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,140
Here we go again.

1267
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,560
Sodomy with a woman is sufficiently common

1268
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,080
and is born of a curious desire for new experiences

1269
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,840
or is resorted to with a Malthusian objective in mind,

1270
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,500
that of...

1271
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,240
limiting the progeny.

1272
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,500
It is impossible to draw up even approximate statistics

1273
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,120
as to this vice

1274
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,260
for the reason that it remains hidden

1275
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,660
among the mysteries of the marriage bed

1276
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,120
and where it is indulged with with the consent of both parties

1277
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,240
never comes before a court of justice,

1278
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,880
which would be highly embarrassed

1279
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,960
at having to deal with such a case.

1280
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,460
This guy's a real drag.

1281
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,480
And we seem to have driven most of the audience...

1282
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,960
away with these scientific musings and revelations.

1283
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,100
The woman in this variety of sodomy is passive.

1284
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,980
The act is a painful one to her

1285
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,600
and she yields to the shameful proceeding

1286
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,860
only out of weakness or a passion for sacrifice.

1287
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:58,720
No.

1288
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,980
I don't think we chased them off as much as I think they may have had to, you know...

1289
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,020
They got hot and had to run off and try that sodomy stuff.

1290
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,360
Yeah, yeah, you know, I mean, you know, sodomy...

1291
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,200
Well, I'm all...

1292
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,260
I want to try some of this tribidism they was talking about

1293
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,360
and this sodomy and...

1294
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,280
Tribidism, huh?

1295
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,720
What was that about amperangs and sticking goose quills up your wee-wee hole?

1296
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,720
Well, aren't you...

1297
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:21,860
I'm not fine.

1298
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,100
Aren't you due for such a procedure?

1299
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:24,560
I love it tonight.

1300
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,140
The medical profession has its plans for you, Stang.

1301
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,680
They plan to introduce something, I understand.

1302
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,180
You know, in the old days...

1303
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,380
They have been sticking things up my wee-wee.

1304
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,920
They stuck the camera up there.

1305
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,460
And a clapper...

1306
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,220
A bloater boy.

1307
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,120
You could stand there with a little clapper going,

1308
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,740
take two, prostate inspection, bap, like that.

1309
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,880
It's amazing what they can do these days.

1310
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,840
Jesus Christ, that guy hurt like hell.

1311
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,720
It made you feel like you had to pee all the time.

1312
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,980
In the old days, they could break up the stones in the bladder

1313
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,480
by a procedure known as sounding a calculus by percussion.

1314
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,960
In this case, a steel rod is inserted through the urethra

1315
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,560
and then when it finally reaches the stones in the bladder,

1316
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,340
they strike the other end.

1317
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,900
They strike the other end with a hammer.

1318
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,980
And in the steel engravings depicting this procedure,

1319
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,780
the patient always has a contorted expression on his face.

1320
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,540
A cow.

1321
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,000
I had a contorted expression on my face in calculus class too, so it's alright.

1322
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,200
Oh, there you go.

1323
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,540
It's called sounding a calculus by percussion.

1324
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,020
But today, in our modern age of moon rockets and microchips,

1325
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,980
we have completely different ways of going about this,

1326
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,480
as Stang is to find out shortly.

1327
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,320
Oh.

1328
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,080
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1329
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,860
So much for Ars Medica.

1330
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,860
Bob has, I have an appointment to meet Bob.

1331
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,100
Yes.

1332
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,160
After X Day.

1333
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,600
After all, we located the human soul in the, uh,

1334
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,140
Unfortunately, it's located in the bladder and it has to be removed.

1335
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:56,740
Uh huh.

1336
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,680
The gigantic soul.

1337
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,400
There's a picture of it.

1338
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,060
Benign aphasia of the soul, they call it.

1339
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,920
In the Revelation X, there's a photo.

1340
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,160
But why are they doing, they never took the Dobbs hat out of my retina.

1341
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,440
That's to keep you from having hot sweat.

1342
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,440
They're gonna spot and fall off.

1343
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,240
I mean, why are they taking the Dobbs hat out of your, you know, your innards?

1344
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,460
They didn't take it out of my retina.

1345
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,620
We must all be cleansed and prepared.

1346
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,760
Is it a really big Dobbs hat down there?

1347
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,260
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

1348
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,720
I was born with a really large Dobbs hat.

1349
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,720
Oh, yeah, my, the one on my retina is pretty small.

1350
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,220
In the wrong place.

1351
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,740
I mean, it's not.

1352
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,580
No, you don't even, no, girls don't have Dobbs hats.

1353
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,980
No, I have a Dobbs hat in my retina.

1354
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,320
Well, yeah, but that's an eye Dobbs hat.

1355
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,440
That, that, uh, that's different.

1356
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,220
That's not, it's flat.

1357
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,020
It's a two-dimensional Dobbs hat, right?

1358
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,440
These are theological critiques.

1359
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm talking about a big Dobbs hat with a large pipe.

1360
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,740
And it's blocking things.

1361
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,600
Oh, that kind of Dobbs hat.

1362
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Yeah, yeah, the, the, the Dobbs hat that grows in your, near your bladder.

1363
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Oh, oh, we just have saucers.

1364
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,980
Not Dobbs hats.

1365
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,460
You don't have Adam's apple, neither.

1366
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,000
No, no, no.

1367
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:10,540
We have little,

1368
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,300
That makes it hard to go.

1369
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,920
Yeah, we have these spaceships with these really cool entry doors.

1370
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,420
Oh, right.

1371
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,140
Right, I've seen pictures of those colorways.

1372
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,420
And, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, the, the, it's a, it's a really, we don't have Dobbs hats, though.

1373
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,000
Seems like that would hurt.

1374
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:34,200
We have, we have really cool spaceships and, and, um, they're, they're really safe and warm and comfortable spaceships.

1375
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,080
And I hear that many,

1376
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,060
And everybody wants to get on board, don't they?

1377
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,380
Yep, everybody wants to get on board that spaceship.

1378
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,860
Get in that spaceship.

1379
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,960
But it is, it's, it's a one-seater, though.

1380
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,440
You know, you can't fit more than one.

1381
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,720
I don't know, man, I've seen some weird pictures on the internet.

1382
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,140
No, no, no, when you're putting more than, there is no true two-seater.

1383
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,960
If you try to make the spaceship that we, that we have a two-seater, it's really cramped.

1384
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,800
I don't know.

1385
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,380
I'd be willing to try Pisces.

1386
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,340
Ha, ha, ha.

1387
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,140
Yeah.

1388
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1389
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,060
Boy, this is a great show so far.

1390
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,940
Yeah, it certainly had its brush with low comedy.

1391
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,320
Um, but,

1392
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,620
No, we were doing educational stuff until everybody ran off to try the things we were explaining to them.

1393
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:34,060
And, and they're totally missing, we could be giving really good lessons here and, and, and teaching them important information, but they couldn't wait till the end of the class.

1394
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,980
You know, we taught them, you know, they learned about the basics and they have to try it.

1395
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,800
You know, some people just have to try it instead of listening to the full instructions.

1396
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,780
It's like the guy who puts together the furniture and refuses to read the instructions.

1397
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:57,760
We're here trying to give them the instructions, save them a little time, you know, so they don't stub in the body parts.

1398
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,240
Right, they hear about the prairie squid and they run off into the woods to find one, but they missed the part about the de-beaking.

1399
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,540
And there's nothing you can do about that.

1400
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,500
And they come back singing in a high voice.

1401
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,480
And they're all angry because,

1402
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,460
Dang it, Stang, you didn't tell me that I was going to have to do this extra step.

1403
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,900
You know, as well as I do, that no, that people don't read instructions.

1404
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,660
But do...

1405
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,460
People, yeah, people, sure. I actually do read the instructions.

1406
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,540
But do they read the schedule?

1407
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,000
That's why I'm the one pushing the buttons here.

1408
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,740
Right.

1409
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:26,880
Let me see.

1410
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,000
It takes time.

1411
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,540
I'm not really good at button pushing.

1412
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,940
Well, I am, but not that kind of button.

1413
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,180
Yeah, I know a couple of people whose buttons you've managed to push.

1414
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:37,780
I don't need to.

1415
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,380
Me too.

1416
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,180
I don't even know how.

1417
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,260
I know, I know.

1418
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:41,940
Oh, man.

1419
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,420
That's what X-Day's all about.

1420
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,180
Getting really, really bent out of shape.

1421
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,880
Everybody hates it.

1422
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,620
By the end of it.

1423
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,520
It's all my fault, again.

1424
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Hey, it could be Burning Man.

1425
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,460
Well, that's not totally my fault.

1426
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,340
That's not my fault.

1427
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,000
It gets even worse.

1428
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,420
That is totally not my fault.

1429
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,460
You get even more bent out of shape because of the sand in the crevice.

1430
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,040
I, I...

1431
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,840
That was a great band.

1432
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,680
Yes, you'll never go hungry there because of the sand-witches there.

1433
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,400
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1434
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,360
I've never heard that.

1435
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I think we're going to do a quick swap out and...

1436
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,720
Swap out?

1437
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,100
Yep, we're going to swap out here.

1438
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,440
We are?

1439
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1440
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,620
We're going to put a different beautiful...

1441
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,140
We're going to put another voice on here.

1442
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,860
Very good.

1443
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,680
You were about to say a different beautiful uber-femme, weren't you?

1444
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,140
I was going to say...

1445
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,300
But you didn't want to sound vain.

1446
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,460
No, no, I was going to say boobs, but that's...

1447
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,940
Balloons, balloons, and not a gray one to be seen.

1448
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,100
Boo-boos!

1449
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,780
Audience, more boo-boos to squeeze the poison out of.

1450
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,300
Have you ever seen a gray balloon?

1451
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,280
Of course not.

1452
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,540
There is no such thing.

1453
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:47,560
So welcome to our next contestant, which is, of course, Reverend Baby Bear here.

1454
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,040
And she's bought a beautiful green balloon.

1455
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,880
No, this is actually for sound effects.

1456
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,060
I'm making my own sound effects for the radio.

1457
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,760
Very good.

1458
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,640
Wow, Philo would love that.

1459
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,900
That would make Philo so happy.

1460
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,360
That's not even the most annoying one.

1461
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,700
That one was pretty good.

1462
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,840
Don't let all the air out of it yet.

1463
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,840
This is the sound of creatures metamorphosing, werewolves changing.

1464
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,700
The squeaky sound of a balloon.

1465
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:27,300
You'll hear, if you listen for it in cartoons, you'll hear the balloon squeak sound effect.

1466
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,100
And you'll realize, I've been hearing that my whole life.

1467
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,680
For Are We Not All balloons, Mir Bek.

1468
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:35,680


1469
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,960
There are two bags of unfulfilled appetites.

1470
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:45,820
Humans, they are ugly bags of water held up by sticks.

1471
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,780
Yes.

1472
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,940
Do you have a bunch of Monster High stickers all over your console?

1473
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,260
He do, and look at this.

1474
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,060
I've just handed Baby Bear the official Monster High sticker book, which I've been using

1475
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,380
to identify all of my equipment.

1476
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,560
Boy, you can stick those stickers everywhere.

1477
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,780
Other people put their initials on there.

1478
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,660
But when you find camera...

1479
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,820
I've got cameras and recorders laying around that have Monster High toy franchise characters

1480
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,480
on them.

1481
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,700
Those belong to me.

1482
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,760
I like how they add slightly different angles to their face and cheekbones to try to pretend

1483
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,220
like they don't look all exactly alike.

1484
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,280
Right.

1485
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:22,660
Well...

1486
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,440
Well, some of them have little fangs and...

1487
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,040
The dolls are very slightly different from one to another.

1488
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,660
You know, the weird thing about the Monster High franchise is it...

1489
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:34,960
Well...

1490
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,680
Well, the weird thing about the Monster High franchise is it teaches mostly young girls,

1491
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,280
but sometimes old perverts, that it's good to be different.

1492
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:51,100
You should celebrate your freaky flaws, or as we say in the church, exploit your abnormality.

1493
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,640
That's a really big thing in the Monster High plots.

1494
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,760
They're cartoons and so forth.

1495
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,060
Yes, secret propaganda.

1496
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,900
And bullying is bad and so forth, and it's cool to be a weirdo and cool to be a monster,

1497
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,940
but there's one thing that rings just a little odd.

1498
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,260
Uh-oh.

1499
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,040
I'm a little hollow about that.

1500
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,420
Uh-oh.

1501
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,120
And that is that every single one of those girls, although they are monsters technically,

1502
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,520
are hot.

1503
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,980
They're all skinny.

1504
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,280
None of them are overweight.

1505
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,600
So, in that...

1506
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,920
There is a special one.

1507
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,580
Ghoulia.

1508
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,160
Is she overweight?

1509
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,680
She's the special student who happens...

1510
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:29,200
She doesn't...

1511
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,780
But she's also the smartest girl in school.

1512
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:41,240
She's a zombie, so she's kind of slow in some ways, but she happens to be the best

1513
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:41,620
hacker.

1514
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,320
I'm way behind you in following these episodes.

1515
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,020
I haven't seen these recent ones that you speak of.

1516
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,920
They just had a bunch of old Bratz dolls, and they just didn't know what to do with

1517
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,220
them.

1518
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:52,500
They monstered them up.

1519
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:52,500


1520
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:52,960
Yeah.

1521
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,800
But it's a big improvement over Bratz, because it's monsters.

1522
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,840
Yes, it is.

1523
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,040
Absolutely.

1524
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,660
Wait, is that one...

1525
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,480
Is that Draculaura?

1526
00:52:59,640 --> 00:52:59,920
Yeah.

1527
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:00,680
Is that one me?

1528
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,160
That's you.

1529
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,520
Yes.

1530
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,060
Yes.

1531
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,600
Draculaura.

1532
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,720
Yes, we think that one resembles you.

1533
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,920
I had them all...

1534
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,640
I actually read the names of all the subgenius correspondences.

1535
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,000
All right.

1536
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,960
You might as well tell the names, since you're looking at their pictures.

1537
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,260
Yeah.

1538
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,080
Maybe there was Draculaura because of physical resemblances.

1539
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,740
She's small and kind of squeaky.

1540
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,220
Okay.

1541
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,900
I'll take that.

1542
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,140
And 16,000 years old.

1543
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,160
Yeah.

1544
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,200
We don't need to talk about that in public.

1545
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,200
Or 100 years old.

1546
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,600
I'm sorry.

1547
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,140
16,000 years old.

1548
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,920
I think it was just we who corresponded to Laguna Blue because they look alike.

1549
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,180
Pantiera also looks sort of like Ghoulia.

1550
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,360
Because of the glasses.

1551
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,900
And I've changed my mind.

1552
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:49,100
I've decided that Pisces is Abbe Abominable, the daughter of the Yeti.

1553
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,560
Who is...

1554
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,340
Because she's tall.

1555
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,940
Who is Robecca?

1556
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,820
Popes Lilith.

1557
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,740
Oh, okay.

1558
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,300
Susie the Flusie corresponds to Operetta.

1559
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,460
Oh, that makes sense.

1560
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:00,860
So she does.

1561
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:00,860


1562
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,180
Well, she has red hair.

1563
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,700
Well, I'll be.

1564
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,380
And is hideously scarred underneath this mask.

1565
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,220
And theatrical.

1566
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,680
Right.

1567
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,300
So...

1568
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:20,360
Oh, Fat Man D was the sassy urban werewolf girl, Claudine Wolfe, just because she's

1569
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,680
sassy and urban.

1570
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:22,800
And a werewolf.

1571
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,440
Yes.

1572
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,340
Well, you didn't want to...

1573
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,140
She can't be here this time because it's a full moon.

1574
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:28,960
That's right.

1575
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:29,040
That's right.

1576
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,020
July 1st is the full moon, everyone.

1577
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,920
You can go out and cavort under the lunar beam.

1578
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,280
It's good for you.

1579
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:39,300
The full moon.

1580
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:46,720
Even a man who is pure at heart and says his prayers by night may become a wolf when the

1581
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,160
wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.

1582
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,780
Yeah, there's two different versions.

1583
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,100
How old is she?

1584
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:55,720
Um...

1585
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,940
There's only one version written by Claudine.

1586
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,540
Oh, Curt Seodmack.

1587
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,460
Can I have stickers?

1588
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,000
Yeah, I want stickers.

1589
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,520
Who also wrote...

1590
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,160
Go ahead, Draculaura.

1591
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
I want a Draculaura one.

1592
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,220
Daughter of the vampire.

1593
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:07,860
Yes.

1594
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:14,260
Curt Seodmack also wrote, when the house is filled with dread, turn the bedsteads head

1595
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:14,860
to head.

1596
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:15,500
Oh, I ruined it.

1597
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,340
How could I fail at getting a sticker off of a sheet?

1598
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:20,820
I've had that problem myself.

1599
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,360
It's...

1600
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,680
Poor shoddy workmanship.

1601
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,300
Yeah, it's like the backing comes with the sticker.

1602
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,100
Peel off another one.

1603
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,000
Where was this made in?

1604
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,580
In Dobstown?

1605
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,460
In Taiwanaland or something.

1606
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,240
Just tear off another one.

1607
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:33,720
Glandlandistan.

1608
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,140
I got it.

1609
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:35,900
I figured it out.

1610
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,600
It's in Sadd-Sakistan, over the border.

1611
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,040
Glandlandia?

1612
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,760
No, Slaklandia.

1613
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,440
Glandlandistan is...

1614
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,400
Is that your Minecraft?

1615
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,780
We can have a little play.

1616
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:54,000
We can cut out the figures of these monster girls and you can put them on these little

1617
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,200
cute sets.

1618
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,160
If you have...

1619
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,760
To save this background.

1620
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,260
If you're sent to state prison and have enough time...

1621
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,740
Not state prison.

1622
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:03,820
Too scary.

1623
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,480
All right.

1624
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,220
But I mean, who has time to cut out a million little statues of monster teenagers?

1625
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:09,620
They're pretty cut.

1626
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,220
Oh.

1627
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,040
No child, no modern child has that kind of skill.

1628
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,540
They don't teach them scissors and coloring.

1629
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,940
They're not allowed to use scissors anymore.

1630
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:20,040
They don't even know what the word stay in the lines means.

1631
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,380
Their scissors are plastic.

1632
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,220
There's no blades.

1633
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:24,440
As you're pointing out, kids these days can't sign their names.

1634
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,640
Not kids, adults.

1635
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,220
Because they can't...

1636
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:26,740
Yeah, they can't sign their names.

1637
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:26,740


1638
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:26,740


1639
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:26,740


1640
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:26,740


1641
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,360
Adults that come out of school can't sign their names because they don't...

1642
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,620
They don't use writing instruments.

1643
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,600
Yeah, they...

1644
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,700
Oh, but come on.

1645
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,500
Nobody signs their names.

1646
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,580
They make a loop and then squiggles.

1647
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:38,860
Right.

1648
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,380
They make a pharmacist's squiggle these days.

1649
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,320
But the point is they can't.

1650
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:42,980
The techies do.

1651
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,520
I have a friend who makes a little Pac-Man eating marbles for his signature.

1652
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,400
That's how he signs forms.

1653
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:51,960
Now, which?

1654
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,220
What?

1655
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,000
He makes a little Pac-Man eating, going down the line of dots.

1656
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:56,360
Eating marbles.

1657
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:56,720
That's how he signs forms.

1658
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:56,720


1659
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:56,720


1660
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:56,720


1661
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:56,720


1662
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:56,720


1663
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:56,720


1664
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,080
He makes a signature.

1665
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,180
Well, I heard this poor old patriot telling me about...

1666
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:10,940
He used to try to sell replicas of the Declaration of Independence at gun shows.

1667
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:18,340
And he said these kids were just staring at his Declaration of Independence things and

1668
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,520
they asked him, what is this?

1669
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,840
What's a Declaration of Independence?

1670
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,660
Can't you read it?

1671
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:26,900
A wasp again?

1672
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:28,740
What?

1673
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,020
What?

1674
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,240
What?

1675
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,140
A wasp.

1676
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,920
It might sting Baby Bear over her heart.

1677
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,640
Dr. Howell, you're not doing your job.

1678
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,880
I still actually have a scar on my tattoo from where I got stung by a wasp last year.

1679
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,540
Yes.

1680
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,100
That was a terrible thing.

1681
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,220
We don't want that to repeat.

1682
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:43,980
A scar on your tattoo?

1683
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:44,600
Yeah.

1684
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,260
Well, it's more polite than saying on my boob.

1685
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,140
It's right there.

1686
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:48,700
Look.

1687
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:48,920
See?

1688
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,360
It's all bubbled up.

1689
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,240
It's a weird scar.

1690
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,180
It won't go away.

1691
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,460
It's become part of the thing.

1692
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,580
That happened last year.

1693
00:57:54,580 --> 00:58:00,200
You have to add another one down at the bottom to make it balance, make the design balance.

1694
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:00,640
No.

1695
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,220
Don't let another wasp anywhere near there.

1696
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:03,940
No.

1697
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:12,440
I got stung last year because I was in charge of putting the tarp up or back down over the

1698
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,760
speakers at the main stage.

1699
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,680
Weren't you tracking on this thing?

1700
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,500
As I was climbing up the scaffolding when they were showing me, yeah, you just go up

1701
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,380
there and do this.

1702
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,080
It's easy.

1703
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,500
Yeah.

1704
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,240
Just go on up.

1705
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,560
Oh, but you do need to watch out for wasps.

1706
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,500
You do need to watch out for wasps.

1707
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:35,520
As they said that, it flew directly into my chest, stung my boob, went down my shirt,

1708
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,540
but then managed to fly out without stinging me again, which was lucky.

1709
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:38,940
That bastard.

1710
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:40,260
Yeah.

1711
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,220
Well, I think he ended up in my room later that night.

1712
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:46,740
It was painful.

1713
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,020
Dr. Howard, you're not doing your job.

1714
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:52,280
Remember I told you the reason we fly you in is because mosquitoes love you so much.

1715
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:52,640
They do.

1716
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,360
That causes them to leave me alone.

1717
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,460
That's because I'm so all-fired delicious.

1718
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,260
I can't help it.

1719
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,700
Mosquito magnet.

1720
00:58:59,140 --> 00:58:59,460
Yeah.

1721
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:04,160
And I lost that insect pen that I had.

1722
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,740
I must have left it somewhere, maybe down at the pond or on the grass or something.

1723
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:14,680
Now, I have no protection against the swarms of buzzing night flies that disturb me.

1724
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,180


1725
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,660
It's over.

1726
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:16,680
Yeah.

1727
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,100
Well, we'll see.

1728
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,980
Anyway, my point was modern-day wasps can't read the Declaration of Independence because

1729
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,980
they don't read cursive.

1730
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:25,660
Yes.

1731
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,720
They're not taught cursive.

1732
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,620
They can't write it, and they can't read it.

1733
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,620
White Anglo-Saxon Protestants?

1734
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,880
Wasps?

1735
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,540
No, just the insects.

1736
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:35,520
Oh, okay.

1737
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,580
No, just people who work in the high-technology industry in California.

1738
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:48,780
They all tend to be about seven feet tall because they're all grain-fed, super slender,

1739
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,920
long-headed.

1740
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,960
They never have round heads, always long, doliose or something.

1741
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,140
encephalic heads but this increased height is certainly noticeable especially when they come

1742
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:04,220
in and sit down right in front of me at a concert at the very last minute no matter where i sit even

1743
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:10,900
if i'm standing on an apple box then some eight foot guy comes and stands are we are we stereotyping

1744
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:17,720
tech nerds into a new race i believe they are i i observe them all the time you know they that is

1745
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,600
one thing we started talking about how they can't sign their name but uh what else do they do they

1746
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:31,660
eat cereal standing up that is one of their uh horrid yeah and abhorrent yeah um and of course

1747
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:37,980
they uh never look where they're going but that's the old old stereotype they're trying to read

1748
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:42,280
their google glass here's something that happened look where this really happened in san francisco

1749
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,780
a maniac had a gun and he got on a bus wanting to kill somebody his plan was to just get on the bus

1750
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,920
and kill somebody with the gun so he got on the bus

1751
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:58,900
and he brandished his weapon and uh nobody saw because they were all looking at their screens

1752
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:07,440
so uh eventually he got behind somebody who was getting off the bus and uh shot the guy in the

1753
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,060
back of the head and everybody looked up but then there was nothing to see so they looked back down

1754
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:20,060
there was no witness uh you know the the bus camera has a grainy video of this but uh everybody's

1755
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:21,140
bent over

1756
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,060
looking at the small portable electronic device

1757
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:34,660
and with the end of that motor the hour of slack must come to an end start me up again sting start me up again

1758
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:41,740
because we've recorded about an hour's worth all right an hour's worth of babble it was all awful

1759
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:48,660
you've been listening to our slack number one thousand five hundred and uh yes about penises and uh

genius.com and uh

1761
01:01:54,080 --> 01:02:01,780
so let's now um move to uh um something more elevating and talk about 100 year old monster
