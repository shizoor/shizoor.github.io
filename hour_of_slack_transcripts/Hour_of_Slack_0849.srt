1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
Time for Pastor David Epley, your Good Shepherd prayer partner and your personal friend.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:15,640
In the next 13 or 14 minutes, something good, good, good is coming your way.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,560
So don't leave this radio station. Let's have a good time together.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,660
He's all I need.

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,080
He's all I need.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,640
Ah, yes.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,620
Ah, yes.

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:45,460
And now, the S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S of Genius Hour of Slack.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:58,120
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ and since I've been listening to it.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,060
End of the break.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,120
The very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,120
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,040
In this temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock,

14
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,900
and before we begin this sacred spouting,

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,840
I think that we should all bow our heads and let's all have a minute of noise.

16
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,400
Ah!

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,460
Ah!

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,120
Knowing that God has given us charge,

19
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,400
and we're going to take charge of that home right now

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,340
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

21
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,840
I send the angel of the Lord.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,060
I send right now power, the very glory of God into that home.

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,320
I move back the foul spirits of opposition,

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,220
the lying spirits, the binding spirits,

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,780
I speak authority to you in the name of Jesus Christ.

26
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,560
Don't ask any questions. Just do as I say. All right?

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,640
There's, I mean, the teaching of Jesus Christ,

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,380
the authority, the commandments,

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,180
to strap a bomb to your chest, to abuse children,

30
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,820
to go and kill anyone, to blow yourself up,

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
but that's what we're here on earth to do.

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,320
And once we get a hold of the peace that is in that,

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,980
oh, folks.

34
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,700
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,260
Jesus.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,960
Jesus Christ, we've got to get this cleaned up.

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,460
Look at the...

38
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,120
Someone called Jesus?

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes.

40
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,140
Yeah, we called him, but he couldn't come and help us clean

41
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,900
the splatter from the stain.

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,400
Oh, no, Jesus is gone now.

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,700
He's gone. He can't help us.

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,360
No, he's living with the sissies.

45
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,540
Oh, but look who's here, Sissy Man!

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Oh, here he comes.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Where did you get that silly suit?

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,940
And how did you get that silly attitude?

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
Wait, you're not a man at all?

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,780
You're a...

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,720
Now, let's just see you drop them pants.

52
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,920
I've never seen anything so ridiculous in all my life.

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,360
You're a sissy boy, ain't you?

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,100
Ain't you?

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,120
Yeah, it's all right.

56
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm a silly boy.

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,700
I'm not that.

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,280
I've one time seen a sissy tortured by the Cheyenne.

59
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,320
He never screamed at once.

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,160
He was a sissy, but as they cut pieces of his flesh off,

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,240
he never cried out.

62
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,820
He was a strong man, that sissy was.

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,380
Yeah.

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,280
He had taken the Sundance.

65
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,060
He had done the Sundance ritual and had his breasts impaled with the tusks of a dog.

66
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,140
And in the after hours, he enjoyed a martini and perhaps whipping up some lettuce and throwing at his children.

67
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,840
Little Big Sissy.

68
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,300
Big Little Sissy.

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,580
Good evening. I'm Adele Arakawa.

70
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,540
I'm Jim Bannerman.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,940
9 News reporter Ginger Delgado has meth labs like that fellow.

72
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,680
Yes, Jim.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
It's a job that is so dangerous,

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,160
it could eventually explode, cause fires or worse, cause life.

75
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,640
And because of that, he has decided to share his cancer.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,760
He will not reveal Bob since he was 12, since 17.

77
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,940
I think if an person first introduced it to me, it would be really good.

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,120
Why?

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,420
Because I'm brown.

80
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,900
Today, Bob is dying of his teeth.

81
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,940
In short, an explosion has ruined his life.

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,960
He now says the quick high he got was worth it.

83
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,600
You know, it's fun for a minute.

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,380
No one should say.

85
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,700
He wants to keep making the same fatal mistake.

86
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,500
And his meth labs growing at an alarming rate.

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,340
Authorities in 31 drug labs.

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,300
The next year.

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,720
This year.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Authorities say this year.

91
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,620
And last year, here in Colorado.

92
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,680
Uh, yes, dear friends.

93
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,060
News of Bob's cancer, cut up by Fernanda Nande-Lee Murr,

94
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,880
preceded by some of the new remastering of our old collage album,

95
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,380
Media Barrage No. 4.

96
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,880
Media Barrage No. 5.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,460
The old school sub-tape by puzzling evidence.

98
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,940
Byron Werner, Yours Truly, Lies, Glass Madness, Doctors for Bob, Dr. Philodrumon,

99
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,620
and G. Gordon Gordon with more coming up.

100
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,260
Friends, I've finished recutting Media Barrage No. 5.

101
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:19,800
And this show, this hour of slack number 849, will be a mix-up of the last third of that show

102
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,900
with miscellaneous news.

103
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,640
A new or newish stuff that has also accumulated.

104
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:32,340
We'll even be hearing from subgeni who foreswore Bob and forsook the church.

105
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,300
Such as the subgenius-hating Reverend Buck Naked.

106
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:42,840
And even the original pre-non-fame Saint Janer Hypercletes.

107
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560
The prototypical subgenius saint.

108
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,860
We're pretty sure he's a psychopath now.

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,880
How do we spell it?

110
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,180
Spot him.

111
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,540
Well, if he's wearing a Napoleon hat, it's easy.

112
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,100
Otherwise, they come in all sizes and shapes.

113
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,160
From 11-year-old girls to 80-year-old men.

114
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,980
And they all look perfectly normal.

115
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,120
I keep telling y'all, this is a sick and perverted nation.

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,640
All tired.

117
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,920
And nobody wants to listen to me.

118
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,620
Nobody wants to hear about Bob.

119
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,700
Nobody...

120
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,040
I try to tell everybody what's going on.

121
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,640
They won't listen to me.

122
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,840
Well, to tell you the truth, I can't stand it anymore.

123
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,360
Bob.

124
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,200
Bob.

125
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,920
Bob.

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,580
Bob.

127
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,320
Bob.

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,000
Bob.

129
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,080
Bob, take care of me.

130
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,500
Bob.

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,640
Bob.

132
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,060
Just do away with them all.

133
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,400
I don't want them anymore.

134
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,480
They hold a problem and illusion in my mind after all.

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,920
They don't love you, Bob.

136
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,300
They don't love you like I do.

137
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,160
.

138
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,480
.

139
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,960
.

140
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,280
It's not just the wars and awards that win them,

141
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,420
it's not just a dull and empty distaste for a smothered culture

142
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,600
that expires all around you in pools of its own wastes.

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,120
It's not just the terminal foals of Nunu.

144
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,440
It's not just the child zombies that murdered their mediocrity and parents

145
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,140
and then cruise the streets with bloody feet.

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,160
It's not just those starry old becks on the park benches

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,280
and you know what's going on

148
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,380
their faces like those who shuffled out of the boxcars of Belsen and Auschwitz.

149
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,160
It's not just the anesthesiologist for knee-deep.

150
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,440
It's not just the heaving pink meat masses that grope and clutch all around you.

151
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,900
It's not just the dino bones for Wotan.

152
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,640
It's not just the broken headlights, snapped antennae, and human excrement on your car

153
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:10,940
hood.

154
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,740
It's not just that the old ways were best.

155
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,140
It's not just the bastardization and perversion of every honest means of self-expression.

156
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,940
It's not just the killer shit ganja from the dark side of the bush.

157
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,120
It's not just the penoid snipers locking and loading on every high-rise rooftop.

158
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,300
It's not just the wide-screen technicolor corporate daisy chain that has defiled the

159
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,280
entire planet.

160
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,920
It's not just the...

161
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,900
It's not just Mongo in the Congo with fa-fa-fas the size of basketballs.

162
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,360
It's not just the prophets crying lonely and alone in the wilderness.

163
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,800
It's not just the indignity of having to work for some bland, nun-entity son-of-a-bitch

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,220
who thinks workers are property.

165
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,900
It's not just the blueness of the wound cleansed by evil.

166
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,600
It's not just the battling eco-freaks who want to go back to nature without realizing

167
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,920
that nature is an open-ditch latrine and no one can get out of it.

168
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:10,920


169
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,020
It's not just the

170
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,380
that gets stuck in midsummer.

171
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,580
It's not just some asshole with a pipe and a shit-eating I-know-more-than-you-do-dog-grin

172
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,060
all over his homogenized face.

173
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,220
It's not just the horrible feeling of being entrapped inside a regimented, devolving world that you certainly never made

174
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,680
It's not just the doorway to doom

175
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,400
It's not just wanting to know what the hell is really going on

176
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,580
It's not just the missing H's or the stolen alpha-beta-max

177
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,600
No, dear friends, there is more to it all than that

178
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,440
Bob ain't no nickel-dime bum show

179
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,540
I put it to you, he's on the square and a corking fine business proposition

180
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,200
He's the grandest thing yet, and don't you forget it

181
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,000
Shot salvation and fighting Jesus, you don't need to rise precious early

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,160
You sinner there, if you want to diddle the almighty Bob

183
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,120
No, he's got cough mixture with a punch on it for you, my friend

184
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,740
In his back pocket, just you try it

185
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,940
I'm just a clump of mud

186
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,360
I'm just a clump of mud

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,060
Bob's tape recorder

188
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,740
Bob is things that don't always run

189
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,660
Bob is masking tape

190
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,520
Bob is a ballpoint pen

191
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,300
Bob is a rooster

192
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,100
And Bob is a hen

193
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,820
Bob!

194
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:47,980
Bob!

195
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,600
Where's Bob? We want Bob!

196
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,400
Right now! We want Bob!

197
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,620
Okay.

198
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,400
Bob's probably not gonna be here

199
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,640
in physical man's station.

200
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,560
Oh,

201
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,740
where is Bob?

202
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,260
He's everywhere.

203
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,020
Check yourself and feel of your Bob

204
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,360
gland and make sure it's overactive

205
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,800
like it's supposed to be.

206
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
This is the headquarters for the

207
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,600
Church of the Subgenius.

208
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
I represent a group of scientists

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,040
who work with but one purpose,

210
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,520
to put an end to war.

211
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,320
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without

212
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,200
experts of superior ability.

213
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,620
Men of vision,

214
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,360
men such as you, Doctor, gathered here

215
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,000
exchanging information daily,

216
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,140
putting aside all thoughts of personal

217
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
success. We hope to

218
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,680
achieve exciting new techniques,

219
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,460
leap years ahead of the others.

220
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't think I need tell you how effective

221
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,240
our voices will be when the world learns of our

222
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,000
achievements. Well,

223
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,540
there you have it.

224
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,200
Nothing new, perhaps, but then,

225
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,100
what is?

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,220
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated

227
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,140
men and women, and as such,

228
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,280
we can accomplish wonders.

229
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,080
Back any other church! Back any other church!

230
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,220
The Church of the Subgenius! The Church has divine

231
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,240
tenets! Has divine tenets!

232
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Divine rules! Divine rules!

233
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,420
Divine orders! Divine orders!

234
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,760
First rule of the Subgenius! First rule of the

235
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,660
Subgenius! Too much!

236
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,020
Too much! It's always better than not enough!

237
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,920
Can I get it too much?

238
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,320
Can I get it too much?

239
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,940
Is it always better than?!

240
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,140
Is it always better than?! Praise Bob!

241
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,580
Praise Bob!

242
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,980
Bob, Bob...

243
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,240
Bob, Bob...

244
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,740
Bob?

245
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:39,980
Bob?

246
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,000
Bob?

247
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,060
But let's leave things of this world behind

248
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,580
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack

249
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,180
from the Church of the Subgenius.

250
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,760
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart.

251
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,160
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs.

252
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,060
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations

253
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,820
where mommy and daddy get up in the morning and go to work

254
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,260
and they kiss the kids goodbye.

255
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,960
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye.

256
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,780
Kind of a simultaneous goodbye and hello.

257
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,980
Then they get home about seven o'clock,

258
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,080
ticked off, to use a polite term,

259
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,500
after a long drive back out to the suburbs.

260
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,540
They get home, they kiss their kids hello and goodnight,

261
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,320
and they go to bed.

262
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,740
And the other churchgoers,

263
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,840
I just dare to say the breakdown of the family

264
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,680
is because the kids see a little tittering stupid sexy gags on television

265
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,640
or because of the new permissiveness

266
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,760
where men are allowed to do things with other men.

267
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,860
That's a bunch of holy hooey, I say, my friend.

268
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,940
I say, why not legalize pornography and ban work?

269
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,240
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

270
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,940
Most of these kids these days grow up, they don't have parents.

271
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,140
They got some kind of robot scarecrows.

272
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,840
Oh, friend, let there be slack.

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm not gonna lie, I think I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

274
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,520
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

275
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,720
Great unwashed, the hoi polloi,

276
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,680
venom, the conspiracy, the mediocretins,

277
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,640
the bootlifts, the sames, the conformers,

278
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,160
mall people, bankers, wankers, and blankers,

279
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,960
hires and smilers, credit heads, and the slackless ones.

280
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,060
In short,

281
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,720
the remnants of man.

282
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,100
The witless principles who are the false prophets.

283
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Smith, I'll get us a contract we'll never forget.

284
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,860
Wild thing, man.

285
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,820
Single guy.

286
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,740
I know that Bob, I know that Bob is a good cause.

287
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,420
Bob took me inside his heart.

288
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,300
And I accepted him into my life.

289
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,420
And I'm here to testify, friends, what that man has done for me.

290
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
If you can really call him a man.

291
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,420
Many people say he's almost like a god.

292
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,500
I don't think so.

293
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,140
Of course, I don't know Bob, but I do know Bob in certain ways.

294
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,760
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

295
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,740
Yes, Bob, he filled me with a sort of a spirit.

296
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:36,740


297
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,280
A spirit I never knew I had.

298
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,840
I knew it wasn't coming from him.

299
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
It was coming from inside me.

300
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,680
Bob was giving it to me.

301
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,200
He was laying hands on me from afar.

302
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,280
He might have been up in that great big jet plane.

303
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,560
Or he might have been down on Skid Row giving some bum a haircut.

304
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,360
But all I know is, it was Bob.

305
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,720
It was Bob.

306
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,040
Bob.

307
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,280
Yeah, he's smiling.

308
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,520
You never see Bob frown.

309
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:21,260
You know that behind that amazing smile there lies a mind like a steel trap.

310
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,360
I'm sure he makes mistakes like what he did with those young women that time.

311
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,440
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

312
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,460
I know that Bob will do.

313
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,320
All of us fine in the long run.

314
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,180
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

315
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,120
In our lives.

316
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,580
In 1981.

317
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
And in 1984.

318
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,720
Hi little brother.

319
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
And in 1991.

320
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,080
And in 1995.

321
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,440
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

322
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:12,400
And in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.

323
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,480
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.

324
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,840
And we'll go and join the exes from God only knows what strange planet they come from.

325
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,240
If they really even come from a planet at all.

326
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,720
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.

327
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,600
Lighting our lives with the technology.

328
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,300
And the spirituality.

329
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,460
And the mentality.

330
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
Of planet X.

331
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,040
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.

332
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,720
And see that there's a place for us in the world.

333
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,240
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob or the left hand of Bob.

334
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,380
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.

335
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,160
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

336
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,240
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

337
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,160
And it's Bob.

338
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,260
Bob.

339
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:05,820
Bob.

340
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:05,820


341
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,220
Bob.

342
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,440
Yeah I can hear him.

343
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,100
I can hear him talking off there in the distance saying.

344
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,120
Doug's right Virgil.

345
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
We are different.

346
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,460
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

347
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,120
Even Doug Smith.

348
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,500
It's the good news son.

349
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,980
Ah yes dear friends.

350
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,400
Those are the things I want to tell you about today.

351
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
The very many things.

352
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,920
The things that Bob knows.

353
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,700
The things that you know and when you know.

354
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,320
That you know it.

355
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,680
Because everybody does have that gland.

356
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,880
That mystical Bob gland in their feet.

357
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,120
That one that tells them what to do if they don't even think with it.

358
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,440
But somewhere along in the past.

359
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,180
Man got confused.

360
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,120
And decided to start thinking with his brain.

361
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,100
And when that happened.

362
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,700
Ah dear friends.

363
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,960
That was a very sad time in the history of man.

364
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,660
Because when man stands on his brain and thinks with his feet.

365
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,240
Then he'll know exactly which way to go and how to find Bob.

366
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,540
You got to massage that foot gland.

367
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,720
And the only way to massage it is to walk on it.

368
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,520
Yes sir.

369
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,800
Ah dear friends.

370
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,380
You got to walk on the foot glands for Bob.

371
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,380
Because when you're walking.

372
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,200
And Bob's a talking.

373
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,920
Then you'll know.

374
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,100
All you need to know about what to do after the holocaust.

375
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,220
After the aliens come and take us.

376
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,640
And give us all the information.

377
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,600
And all them giant pills.

378
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,360
And all them fantastic machines that's supposed to run our lives.

379
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,780
And that big white stone that everybody's going to know personally.

380
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,640
In their very own home.

381
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,640
Ah yes dear friends.

382
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,300
That stone.

383
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,720
That's the stone.

384
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,280
That's the stone that you think you might know.

385
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,740
And you think might help you.

386
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,780
But by God dear friends.

387
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,100
That's the stone that's going to ruin your very life.

388
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,740
That's the stone that's going to make you think that niggie.

389
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,020
Is on your side this time.

390
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,900
Because that stone is going to rule all things.

391
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,580
You think you know who big brother is.

392
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,520
Dear friends.

393
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,700
I want to tell you tonight.

394
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,700
You don't know.

395
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,560
You don't know nothing.

396
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,840
I know.

397
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,120
And.

398
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,440
Among other things.

399
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,820
Bob.

400
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,620
I'm doing pretty well.

401
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,300
With those pills you sent.

402
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,960
Pretty well.

403
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,060
But.

404
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
But I can always use more.

405
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,560
And.

406
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,060
It's because.

407
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,060
Of Ohio.

408
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
And red trucks.

409
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,400
And they're all gone.

410
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,060
Bob.

411
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,740
But that's okay.

412
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:49,960
I know.

413
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,480
Yes.

414
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,900
Yes.

415
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,280
Yes.

416
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,440
Ah yes.

417
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,440
Oh no Kim can.

418
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,100
Can stand.

419
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
Up to the mighty fifth of Bob.

420
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,260
I've seen him walk through construction sites.

421
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,740
Banging the shit out of them old.

422
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,100
Chemical toilets.

423
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,620
Throwing them down saying.

424
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,800
You're God damn workmen.

425
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,720
You're men.

426
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,840
You don't have to God damn shit in the closet.

427
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,340
In a smelly hole.

428
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,420
Why don't you fucking just.

429
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,080
Pull down your pants and take a dump.

430
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
Right here on the damn construction site.

431
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,240
Feed the damn worms.

432
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,360
Yes.

433
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,840
Friend.

434
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,160
Bob is a natural man.

435
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,220
And he's made the car.

436
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,220
Directly in front of me.

437
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,960
Have a flat tire.

438
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,140
A blowout.

439
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,660
And say wait a minute devil.

440
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,320
I'm sick and tired of you always pushing me around.

441
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

442
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,180
Nobody else wants to do it.

443
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,500
But I'm gonna do it.

444
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,220
Because I feel like I can.

445
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,980
Listen let me tell you something.

446
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,940
The devil may say you can't.

447
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,940
And people may say you can't.

448
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,280
But yes you can.

449
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,080
You can.

450
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


451
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


452
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


453
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


454
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


455
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


456
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


457
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


458
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


459
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


460
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,080


461
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,600
You can defeat your enemies.

462
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,060
You can defeat your giants.

463
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,940
That's why we miss it so many times concerning the things of God is because we want to see

464
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,960
it before we believe it.

465
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,660
See someone has made the statement well seeing is believing.

466
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,660
No I want to turn that around you see according to the Bible believing is seeing.

467
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,000
Now see the world system just exactly 180 degrees opposite from God's system.

468
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,060
God says believing is seeing.

469
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,060


470
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,080
Speak.

474
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:41,580
Bob sometimes it gets so hard to talk Bob.

475
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,340
It gets so hard.

476
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,080

477
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:49,580

478
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,540
Blur.

479
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,240
Roll.

480
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,380

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,720
Feet.

484
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,000
Roll.

485
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,660
Profits.

486
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,040
Roll.

487
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,040


488
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,040

501
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,700
Know.

502
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,460
Is there a tutti on duplicated ball?

503
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,160
Bob Triple.

504
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,740
Joe Glass.

505

512
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,040
Bye Mad Hatter.

513
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,360
Big bang on the inside of my head, Bob.

514
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,620
And, you know, and look at me.

515
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,480
Real red, Bob.

516
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,660
This man has something to say.

517
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,020
When I come up here this morning, I knew that Bob was straight.

518
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,760
Bob.

519
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:52,560


520
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,160
Bob.

521
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:54,780


522
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,340
You see now, Bob, I'm feeling fine.

523
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,800
It's too hard to deal with you.

524
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,220
The reality, Bob, is real hard.

525
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,680
Bob.

526
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
I can't get out.

527
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,940
I'm stuck inside.

528
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,640
I have to stop.

529
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm stuck in my brain.

530
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,220
I'm holding my mind.

531
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,780
I'm at myself holding nothing to find.

532
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm in.

533
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,380
I'm in.

534
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,440
I'm in.

535
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:27,540


536
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,840
I'm a bad guy, Bob.

537
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,860
Bob.

538
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm stuck inside.

539
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,740
Bob.

540
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:32,740


541
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,660
I feel like I want to deal with these things.

542
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,740
Bob.

543
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,580
I need it.

544
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,720
Send someone to kill Bob.

545
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,360
Bob.

546
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,540
Bob.

547
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,360
Paul, who are those humanoids that are out in the truck area?

548
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,020
Those?

549
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,820
Yes.

550
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,860
That's the team from Dallas.

551
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,320
There's big guys there in the jerseys.

552
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,060
They have big X's on them.

553
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,320
Oh I see, yes.

554
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,480
They seem to be getting creamed as they say.

555
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,960
Oh, there's the funeral.

556
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,680
There's the church bells signaling the toll of the dead for this portion of today's feature entertainment game.

557
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,220
Oh I see. And who is this young man singing these awful songs?

558
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,240
Looking around this town for Bob Dobbs. Looking around the sky.

559
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,580
Been so out of luck and money I've been waiting to die.

560
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:51,880
Looking around this town for Bob Dobbs. Hoping he'll help me out.

561
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,620
I've been down and confused so long now.

562
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,040
I've been down and confused so long now.

563
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:14,080
I just wanna shout Bob Dobbs! Bob Dobbs! Bob Dobbs! Where are you Bob Dobbs?

564
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:24,660
We were at the Hall High School library today and we put lots of subgenius literature in all of the books.

565
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,040
Bob can stop the aliens from coming.

566
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,040


567
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,620
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

568
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,760
Bob can save me, but will he?

569
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,660
Well, don't count on it, Buck.

570
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,420
Hey Bob.

571
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,580
Hey there.

572
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,400
What's the matter?

573
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,420
Oh, we can sit here and talk about this.

574
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,140
You know, it's Henry.

575
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,640
It's Bob.

576
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,980
That's why you need to send us money.

577
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,220
We're here at the Septian Church.

578
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,460
Church.

579
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,800
Bob, keep working miracles in your life.

580
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Bring us in the Lord.

581
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:02,740
Amen.

582
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,460
Love,

583
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,660
Jesus.

584
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,060
Crying and singing and praying for Bob Dobbs,

585
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,620
hoping he'll lend me a hand.

586
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,880
I've been down, confused, and broke for so long,

587
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,560
I can barely stand.

588
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,540
I'm screaming, Bob Dobbs!

589
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,820
I'm screaming, Bob Dobbs!

590
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,220
Help me out, old Bob Dobbs!

591
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,640
Hear me shout out, Bob Dobbs!

592
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,280
Help me out, old Bob Dobbs!

593
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,100
There were like long lines of people like weeping and glistening in the rain.

594
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,620
That's because they were carving onions!

595
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's because their sores were opening!

596
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,200
That's the way we want our music.

597
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,420
We want the third nostrils to open.

598
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,680
We want everyone's pores and their nervous glands

599
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,540
to open simultaneously.

600
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,620
Yes, I know.

601
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,240
If you can, okay, can you get with it, baby?

602
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,020
I'm getting with it now.

603
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,720
Okay, it's like a rhythmic thing.

604
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,040
It's not a melodic thing.

605
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,180
It's not a tonal thing.

606
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,580
Okay, I'm sinking up right now.

607
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,360
Okay, sink in because it's gonna flatten your cracky, woman.

608
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,760
And it's gonna make you dance like you've never,

609
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,920
well, I don't know if you've never danced before.

610
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,000
But you're gonna dance all over Stang's tail.

611
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,880
You're gonna pull his neck off.

612
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,800
You're gonna, I forgot what you're gonna do after that.

613
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,820
Well, I'll just wing it.

614
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,020
How's that?

615
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,680
Yeah.

616
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,380
Um, I feel that it's, uh,

617
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,720
people like me are not represented.

618
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm very disturbed by-

619
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,840
You are very disturbed,

620
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,540
and I'm gonna recommend that you get some help

621
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,120
for your problem.

622
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,440
You are very disturbed.

623
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,020
Ah, you bitch!

624
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,460
You're very disturbed.

625
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,620
You're disturbed too, you bitch!

626
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,300
How dare you trick me like that!

627
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,480
All right.

628
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,260
Now go ahead and say what you want to say about drugs.

629
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,760
What are you gonna do, everyone?

630
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,040
I say you're gonna play these cheap little tricks.

631
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,560
Well, ma'am, it's not a cheap trick.

632
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,580
Everyone listening to you knows you're very disturbed.

633
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,340
How do you know?

634
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,160
You ain't the one who told me you're very disturbed.

635
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,720
Well, ma'am, all I know about you is that you sit here

636
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,860
and you scream all these epithets,

637
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,060
and you're, you get way out.

638
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,480
You must be on something yourself.

639
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,360
I started to talk, and you said talk,

640
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,200
and the minute I said I'm disturbed about drugs,

641
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,360
I...

642
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,060
Well, ma'am, go ahead and tell me

643
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,200
what you want to say about drugs.

644
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,820
Drugs?

645
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,780
What, what did you want to say about drugs?

646
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:32,940
Drugs?

647
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,860
Well, you're not gonna write me.

648
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,460
Ma'am, you've called me every name under the book,

649
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,420
and you're still on the air.

650
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,920
I didn't call you every name.

651
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,080
Well, just about.

652
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,820
Well, you've been doing the same to me.

653
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,720
Uh, I have not at all, ma'am.

654
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,680
Go right ahead and say what you want to say about drugs.

655
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm disturbed about...

656
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,540
You certainly are.

657
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,240
Me.

658
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,540
Can I say anything?

659
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,580
You're gonna, every time I say I'm disturbed,

660
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,380
you're gonna say you certainly are.

661
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,100
Well, go right ahead and tell me

662
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,060
what you want to say about drugs.

663
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,140
How can I?

664
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,020
There's tremendous resistance I'm to get.

665
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,580
No, ma'am, go right ahead.

666
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,960
I haven't resisted anything you've said thus far.

667
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,920
You're still on the air.

668
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,680
You're playing games.

669
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,080
Yeah, I'm on the air, and I...

670
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,840
Well, that's true, and so go right ahead

671
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,540
and tell me what you want to say about drugs.

672
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,540
I have to keep fighting with you,

673
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,100
and you're not giving me an instant

674
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,820
to say what I want to plan to say.

675
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,520
Well, ma'am, uh, I...

676
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,500
If what you've said is not something

677
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,720
that you planned to say, then I feel sorry for you.

678
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,400
You really need help.

679
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,520
You need help, too, you son of a bitch.

680
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,060
You want to be kicked off the air.

681
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,000
All right, fine.

682
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Now that you've gotten that out of your system,

683
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,840
tell me what you want to say about drugs.

684
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,400
Tell me.

685
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,400
All right, what do you want to say about drugs?

686
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,620
I'm very disturbed.

687
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,420
Mm-hmm.

688
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,060
Oh, thank God.

689
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,220
I'm very disturbed by the fact that people like me

690
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,520
are not included in...

691
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,300
all the statistics.

692
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,160
Uh, and, uh, who's a person like you?

693
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,060
Someone that gets on and calls people names

694
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,120
and cusses at them?

695
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,560
Is that the kind of person you are?

696
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,200
I've done it.

697
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,460
You've cut me off many times.

698
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,440
This is the first time.

699
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Well, is, is, is...

700
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,420
What do you mean?

701
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,060
Is that the type of person you are?

702
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,640
Is that...

703
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,940
I don't have control.

704
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,540
Well, you're damn right you don't have control.

705
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,620
You don't have control of your faculties.

706
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,920
You don't have control of your senses.

707
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,680
So do you.

708
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,980
And, ma'am, what you need to do

709
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,020
is go out and get some help.

710
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,220
But at least I gave you an opportunity,

711
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,980
and all you did was cuss and swear

712
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,580
and carry on.

713
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,500
Uh, I feel sorry for you,

714
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,460
but go out and get some help.

715
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,500
Call Carla Perez.

716
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,740
Perhaps, uh, Carla is expert enough

717
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,500
to give you some help.

718
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:34,840
What?

719
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,040
Riverland Rivers.

720
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,660
Lord God.

721
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,080
Man.

722
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,460
Garden.

723
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:37,760
Tree.

724
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,100
Garden.

725
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,460
Tree.

726
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,340

766
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,400
Woman.

767
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:04,760

768
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,180

778
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,460
notamment There is a lot of

779
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
dar podemos talk about on the

780
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,520
the protein on the

781
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,400
People of America are

782
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,320
an intést菁isha

783
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,440
and we also need some

784
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,440


785
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:36,440


786
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,420
Pot

787
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,420
myself with a baseball

788
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,460
Hey, Carl.

789
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah, Grave-a?

790
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,260
Look at Barry back there.

791
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,120
He's playing those drums like a crazy Mennonite.

792
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,700
Yeah, for that, he was surely burning hell.

793
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,200
Yeah!

794
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,280
Hey, Grave-a, that guitar sure sounds great.

795
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,560
Yeah, thanks, Carl.

796
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,480
I carved it from our old back door.

797
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,860
Those knobs are kind of shiny, though.

798
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,420
Yeah, don't tell the person.

799
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,160
Okay.

800
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,500
Out in the field for 40 days.

801
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,540
Plowing and planting and raking the hay.

802
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,240
My mule Ezra is pulling the plow.

803
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,160
I got him from Carl for some eggs and a cow.

804
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,660
I work all day out in the sun.

805
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,320
But after the meal, we start to have some fun, I say.

806
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,360
Come on, Greta, and light the lamps.

807
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,280
We're making lots of noise, but we don't got no amp.

808
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,080
We are an Amish band.

809
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,860
We are an Amish band.

810
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,700
We'll help you build a barn.

811
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,100
We just don't give a...

812
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,040
We don't give a damn.

813
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,400
We are an Amish band.

814
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,720
We are an Amish band.

815
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,880
You know, it's because I'm too lazy to get out of bed

816
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:20,000
and actually go into the living room and use my regular phone.

817
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,080
Oh, okay, you're on the cellphone, huh?

818
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,380
Yeah, because I'm too lazy.

819
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,260
Wow, that's cool.

820
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,300
All America's on a cellphone because you're too lazy.

821
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,900
That laziness, I think, is very, very...

822
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,780
Cellphones have changed everything.

823
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,600
It's kind of provocative.

824
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,720
Who reads my phone calls...

825
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,240
Provocative.

826
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,420
You know, slackers are attracted to that level of laziness.

827
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:40,880
What the heck is he trying to get?

828
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,240
So weird happening out there.

829
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,400
Not that I'm a slacker.

830
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,420
I'm actually...

831
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm slacking just for you.

832
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,400
What's that?

833
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,360
I'm slacking just for you.

834
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,740
Okay, good, good.

835
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,600
Well, I'm really just a slack abuser.

836
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,420
It's really nice.

837
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Not a slacker, per se. It's just that when I find slack, I try to use it to its fullest extent.

838
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,300
I just want to tell her when she turns her suit toward the...

839
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,900
When you turn your suit toward the command center, the signal comes in better.

840
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,700
Yeah.

841
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,360
That's what it is.

842
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,040
You're lying on your back. You should be on your side.

843
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,120
Then you can look out over the top of the...

844
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,060
Then we can hear the phone better.

845
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,620
Cockpit.

846
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,140
And see the Earth below us.

847
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,200
How do you guys know these things?

848
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,200
Because we're right up above you.

849
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,820
High above Berkeley. In the crack.

850
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,120
Because we're on the internet, you know, and you can find anybody on the internet now.

851
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,340
And folks, remember, we are going to find the end of the internet on this show.

852
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
I looked for like four hours.

853
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,560
Yeah.

854
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,760
To try to find the show?

855
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,080
She was looking for the end of the internet for four hours.

856
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,200
Imagine that. She used up four hours of her life.

857
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,040
She'll never get back.

858
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,880
Oh, you were looking for the website that you can download the show from?

859
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,280
Oh, that was... Okay, you ready again?

860
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,100
Mm-hmm.

861
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,120
All right, it's matrix.csustan.edu

862
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,540

866
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,040
If you go there,

867
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,380
you should be able to find

868
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,860
quite a few of the

869
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,560
more recent shows.

870
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,860
And Don's shows

871
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,560
are there too.

872
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,080
Over the Edge. Much to his chagrin.

873
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,920
But don't tell him, because he doesn't like that.

874
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,820
Well, when you tell him,

875
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,080
just say comma and their mp3 files.

876
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,680
Just remember...

877
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,100
Yeah. You know, so...

878
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,300
He's kind of a perfectionist in this stuff.

879
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,080
Does it have a w-w-w

880
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
in front of matrix?

881
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
No. It's just http

I wonder when

889
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,640
they're gonna make the flash obsolete.

890
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,980
Well, I mean, they already

891
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,360
have aliases that you can,

892
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,560
you know, obtain

893
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,600
through various

894
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,200
commercial methodologies.

895
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,280
Puzzling evidence,

896
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,440
Dr. Philo Drummond,

897
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,180
who's also heard in the background here,

898
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,980
the Swingin' Love Corpses did this music

899
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,260
and the music heard earlier

900
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,140
in the background.

901
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,900
And Dr. Halberg from KPFA

902
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Berkeley. We heard a bunch of

903
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,060
clips from movies that were posted

904
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,640
by Udnu Monet

905
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,520
and Tesla Coil

906
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,160
and probably other members

907
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,040
of alt.binaries.slack

908
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,000
that I can't remember. That drugs,

909
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,020
the cut-up drugs thing

910
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,320
was from the National Cynical

911
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,820
Network,

912
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,820
nationalcynical.com, and the

913
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,720
Amish band thing

914
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,860
was from the Electric

915
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,960
Amish at

917
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,960
I don't know who

918
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,740
did the

919
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,400
peanut butter and

920
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,240
jelly thing.

921
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,760
Hello, Paul. Welcome to the

922
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,300
End Times.

923
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,120
In today's

924
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,300
End Time essay,

925
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,700
we will be covering the difference between

926
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,280
the Wolfram

927
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,700
and the Bloodyhead Blanca Society

928
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,160
itself.

929
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,060
As seen here in our first slide,

930
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,940
the Bloodyhead Blanca Society

931
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,580
goes on forever.

932
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,980
There is no end, and there's

933
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,740
no use resisting.

934
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,040
Look at those heads

935
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,660
fall in slow motion.

936
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,980
Just beautiful.

937
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,600
...down the celestial stairs.

938
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,360
...within my house.

939
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,320
The only way to get it there,

940
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,040
by God, is with Bob Dobbs.

941
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,040
They tell you in the

942
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,760
first paragraph.

943
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,080
...so I say to people,

944
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,820
fourth, an Arnold Palmer's

945
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,560
head shall materialize in the space

946
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,520
above your sleeping parlor,

947
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,780
and it shall indeed be bloody.

948
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,580
It shall be dripping

949
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,720
with the residual blood

950
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,040
formed earlier in the day

951
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,300
when he was

952
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,600
without the word of Bob.

953
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,500
What are we gonna do about

954
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,340
the Bloodyhead of Arnold Palmer?

955
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,880
What the hell are we

956
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,020
gonna do about the Bloodyhead of Arnold Palmer?

957
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,120
That's what I wanna know.

958
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,920
His crimson head.

959
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,840
I've seen it in my nightmares.

960
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,440
I've been seeing

961
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,480
omens and signs.

962
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,900
We've gotta do something

963
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,860
about the Bloodyhead of Arnold Palmer.

964
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,740
These guys are

965
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,380
talking bad on Bob.

966
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,320
Neither them or the Christians

967
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,580
we gotta start with.

968
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,260
We gotta do something

969
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,160
bad

970
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,600
to make up.

971
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,620
Oh my God.

972
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,320
Shit.

973
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,240
...that they can keep awake and be under your bed

974
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,080
and inside the water and shoot in the waves

975
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,840
and rays up at you all the time.

976
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,760
But those UFOs, they're flying all over your house.

977
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,620
That's right, then they know about Bob.

978
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,060
And they're gonna be dropping it.

979
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,580
Doctor

980
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,260
for Bob.

981
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,660
For Bob.

982
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,960
How well do you play

983
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,060
your game? How well could you play?

984
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,900
Chances are you'll never know

985
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,600
unless you're fitted with the proper equipment.

986
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,780
Proper equipment

987
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,180
now provided by

988
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,740
Lemur in the form of this

989
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,960
lever.

990
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,080
Finally I did what I should have done in the first place.

991
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,060
I got acne.

992
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,320
Lever

993
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,900
Starring Barbara Beaumont

994
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,120
Hugh Billingsley

995
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,780
Tony Billingsley

996
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,000
and

997
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,940
and Gerry the Beaver

998
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:07,660
and Gerry the Beaver

999
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,660


1000
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,660


1001
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,800
and Gerry the Beaver

1002
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:07,800


1003
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,040
Oh, uh...

1004
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,060
I uh...

1005
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,660
What?

1006
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,280
I uh...

1007
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,220
I uh...

1008
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,900
Honestly?

1009
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,200
Uh...

1010
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,120
Hey Wally, guess what?

1011
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,660
Beaver, you got dropping again?

1012
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
I didn't say you had to

1013
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,280
It's just that he should do something to repay it

1014
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,300
There's no rule against my school

1015
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,640
Yes Wally, gee Wally

1016
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,680
Yes, yes, gee, gee

1017
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,340
Okay, I

1018
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,320
Hey Dave, what's the number?

1019
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,260
3-2-5-3-2-5-9-5-2-3-8

1020
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,960
Hello?

1021
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:01,960


1022
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:12,560
2-3-2-5-9-5-2-3-8

1023
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,660
Hello? 2-3-2-5-9-5-9-5-2-3-8

1024
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,260
Hello? 2-3-2-5-9-5-9-5-8

1025
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,600
Hello, Julie?

1026
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,400
Yeah

1027
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,660
This is Wally

1028
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,480
Yeah, well, um, you know, Julie, uh, Wally Cleaver

1029
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,520
Well, um, well, uh

1030
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:42,100
Yeah, well, um, um, well, uh, uh, or something

1031
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,500
Oh, man, what?

1032
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,560
Shh, shh, shh, shh

1033
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:45,840
What?

1034
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,020
I mean, oh, yeah

1035
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,940
This is cool

1036
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,140
No girl in the world is gonna settle for a liquid diet

1037
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,680
That's a gentlemanly thing

1038
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,400
Yeah

1039
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,700
Okay

1040
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,480
Can't, yeah

1041
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,420
Hello? Hello?

1042
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,600
Hello?

1043
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,080
Hello?

1044
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,160


1045
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,420


1046
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,740
Hello?

1047
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:06,940
Hello?

1048
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,040
Hello?

1049
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,300
Hello?

1050
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,140
Hello?

1051
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:10,340
Hello?

1052
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:11,860
Hello?

1053
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,660
Hello?

1054
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:13,660


1055
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:13,660


1056
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:14,720
Hello?

1057
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,220
Oh, yes

1058
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,620
Ah, I get it

1059
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:16,620


1060
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:16,620


1061
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:16,620


1062
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,520
I can, I can do this

1063
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,260
While I'mstore

1064
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,100
I have the advice

1065
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,100


1066
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,100


1067
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,760
Ah, don't let this California

1068
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,940
Have the awe

1069
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,720
I mean, men

1070
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:35,720


1071
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,900
I'm so, so nervous

1072
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm giving it my all

1073
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,500
We prob now

1074
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:41,600
I think there's a

1075
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,620
You here, baby?

1076
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,040


1077
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,180
What tell?

1078
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:44,220
I'll tell you

1079
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,600
clearly stated that he was a Libra, is often found quite earnestly inquiring about it with a last shake from another planet.

1080
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,440
A billion light-years from that very location, in a place called boundary virtue, is the joint trench of spot for active meditation.

1081
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,500
Very full of life and stents, more deep, high floors are disgusting for the finer merits of the most recent patch of Saint Seiya episodes.

1082
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,660
As an escortian non-Freudian, he's made the rouses of the trench again, and mocked the fridge again,

1083
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,700
a retrograded, not-so-human jellyfish was four inches deep in his small dish,

1084
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,400
which, like the cafeteria bacteria, is selected, collected, and piled high in a petri dish.

1085
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,060
Five minutes from now, nowhere near the trench, a captain priest in a French,

1086
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,360
a professional food with a doubt his mind and a whole list of truths,

1087
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,900
suddenly set his dog aloof, so he went through, yelling through his boots and pears like a freak hailing Ernst,

1088
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,880
while the jellyfish man does what he can to get a coup off his pubes.

1089
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,900
A cross-faced, another, and completely underrated,

1090
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,900
a savage is the willing aim, a poor, of an octopus with a cucumber wrapped in duck tape.

1091
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,220
Meanwhile, in his oiled briscoe, on sausage,

1092
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,500
tears ruin the perfectly good mascara of a drag queen named Sonia,

1093
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,160
whose friends used to call him Fred back in ROTC.

1094
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,140
As the cylindrical midget made him class two,

1095
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,100
who was often seen to stand in sunshine steel

1096
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,080
and scream at the top of his little midget lungs

1097
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,000
as the wrong man had done in the disasters yet to come.

1098
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,220
Just that second in Washington, a beaten-line for Linux

1099
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,160
was giving a horribly boring speech to a group of teens,

1100
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,940
one of whom was well-to-do, a certain group of women,

1101
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,720
I am online, by breaking Bushmere's face,

1102
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,960
didn't know how to steer away from the cool of the tone of Sunday.

1103
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,440
Around the corner on the dark side of the moon,

1104
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,700
in an oblong room, a genius-lily named Tuesday,

1105
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,960
tuned in joystick-friendly,

1106
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,240
a slice of pizza with an amazingly well-to-do white guy named Go-Di.

1107
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,440
I'm going to go to bed.

1108
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,620
I'm going to go to bed.

1109
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,320
I'm going to go to bed.

1110
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,720
Ah, my good friends.

1111
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,460
Well, that was the El Queso All-Stars.

1112
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,200
You can find out more about the El Queso All-Stars

1113
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,840
at mp3.com, www.mp3.com, slash,

1114
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,880
Enterbulator.

1115
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,220
That's spelled E-N-T-U-R.

1116
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,220
Bulator.

1117
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,340
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1118
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,560
And I heard my mama.

1119
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,260
I heard my mama say.

1120
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,280
What's she saying?

1121
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,120
I heard my, I heard my mama say.

1122
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,100
Talk to your mama.

1123
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,740
Oh, I heard my mama.

1124
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,960
Tell me, mama.

1125
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,120
She said, Jess, get off of the bathroom.

1126
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,140
That's the tense time today.

1127
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,660
.

1128
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:47,660


1129
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,420
.

1130
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:00,960
.

1131
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,280
.

1132
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,420
.

1133
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:16,980
.

1134
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,820
.

1135
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:18,840
.

1136
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:18,860
.

1137
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:18,860


1138
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,240
Let's go outside.

1139
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,660
Let's go outside.

1140
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,240
We can go downtown.

1141
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,420
We can go downtown.

1142
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,080
We can go downtown.

1143
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,640
We'll make that thing you like that.

1144
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,640
We'll make that thing you like that.

1145
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,380
I'm actually trying.

1146
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,240
I'm actually trying.

1147
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,360


1148
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,480
I'm actually trying.

1149
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,420
It makes the world gonna wonder.

1150
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,760
Deja vu.

1151
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,720
Deja vu.

1152
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,700
So you're here to save the world?

1153
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,180
I know you're out there,

1154
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,080
I can feel you now.

1155
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,400
I know that you're afraid.

1156
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,400
You're afraid of us.

1157
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,380
You're afraid of change.

1158
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,260
I don't know the future.

1159
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,420
I didn't come here to tell you

1160
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,440
how this is going to end.

1161
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,880
I came here...

1162
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,680
to tell you how it's going to begin.

1163
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,100
I'm going to hang up this phone,

1164
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,080
and then I'm going to show these people

1165
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,200
what you don't want them to see.

1166
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,760
A world without you.

1167
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,520
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.

1168
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,920
A world where anything is possible.

1169
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,300
Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.

1170
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,200
A world without you.

1171
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,240
A world without you.

1172
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:50,160
A world without you.

1173
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,080
A world without you.

1174
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,760
I'll fuck this place.

1175
00:51:43,800 --> 00:52:02,040
I'll fuck this place.

1176
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:27,600
I'll fuck this place.

1177
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,480
I'll fuck this place.

1178
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:50,720
I'll fuck this place.

1179
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,440
I'll fuck this place.

1180
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,400
For your meal, I'd give three chickens and my best black sundae pants.

1181
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,040
For your meal, I'd let you do-si-do my wife at der square dance.

1182
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,820
For your meal, I'd give you eggs and cheese.

1183
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:23,740
I would get down on my knees.

1184
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,440
I would do all of these.

1185
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,100
Come on, mister, pretty please!

1186
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,420
For your meal...

1187
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,940
For your beauty

1188
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,760
For your beauty

1189
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,920
I can talk about Bob.

1190
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,020
Bob can do anything for you.

1191
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,080
He can do anything for anybody.

1192
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,560
There's only one problem.

1193
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:56,220
If you're having a problem with your cash flow,

1194
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,060
if you're having a problem with your spiritual life,

1195
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,420
if you're having a problem with your car,

1196
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,320
how about sex?

1197
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,860
If you're having a problem with sex,

1198
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,760
if you're having a problem with your car,

1199
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,080
if you're having a problem like we had today

1200
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,320
where the tire went flat,

1201
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,840
and there's a problem, there's a debt,

1202
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,820
a hole that needs to be filled in your life,

1203
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,480
there's only one thing that you can do.

1204
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,880
That's reach for your wallet, reach for your checkbook,

1205
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,180
and send the money to P.O. Watts,

1206
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,680
140306.

1207
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,580
140306!

1208
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,460
140306!

1209
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,440
140306!

1210
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,660
Dallas, Texas,

1211
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:28,940
7,

1212
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,320
7, 5, 2, 1, 4!

1213
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,180
7, 5, 2, 1, 4!

1214
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,940
This will all come to you

1215
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,500
if you send a dollar to the church

1216
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,540
of the subgenius

1217
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,120
P.O. Box

1218
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,660
140306

1219
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,880
Dallas, Texas,

1220
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:50,980
75214.

1221
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,900
This will enable us

1222
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,800
to continue with the marvelous operations

1223
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,120
which we've known about

1224
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,400
and we've done.

1225
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,320
We've tried to spread throughout

1226
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,480
the western hemisphere

1227
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,100
and change this

1228
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,520
CFR,

1229
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,800
trilateralist-oriented

1230
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,040
goal-reachers

1231
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,360
of the beyond-noids

1232
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,520
getting here in this.

1233
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,120
Send,

1234
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,500
you will get sex,

1235
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,860
this is a subliminal message

1236
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:23,340
brought to you in care

1237
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,040
of the Subliminal Message Corporation.

1238
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,180
Sex,

1239
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,840
money, Bob,

1240
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,060
these three concepts

1241
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,260
will always be linked in your mind.

1242
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,180
Sex, money, Bob.

1243
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,260
Sex, money, Bob.

1244
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,520
Sex, money, Bob.

1245
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,420
Yes, this is a continuation

1246
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,220
of the flow spew

1247
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:51,280
that the doctors of feel-good-ice now got for us here.

1248
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,920
You would have been told

1249
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,460
which Bob to tune to in your area.

1250
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,400
And this is not a burned-out radio station.

1251
00:55:59,400 --> 00:55:59,400


1252
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,660
It is a plant-oriented call, ladies and gentlemen.

1253
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,500
This is a spouting of spewing

1254
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,560
and thumping of graven images.

1255
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,900
This is a spouting of spewing and thumping of graven images.

1256
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:09,900


1257
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,380
Spewn-eyed,

1258
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,480

1259
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,280
nortonese mule-word.

1260
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,380
Nortonese Mule-word.

1261
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,020
You're listening

1262
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,060

and gold, gold, good, crescent, onyx, stone, river,

1280
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:09,740
Shut up!

1281
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,260
Black-throated green warbler.

1282
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:19,800
One.

1283
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,560
And do you know what happened?

1284
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,260
And do you know what happened?

1285
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,880
Again, that...

1286
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,500
And do you know what happened?

1287
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,920
And do you know what happened?

1288
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,260
And do you know what happened?
