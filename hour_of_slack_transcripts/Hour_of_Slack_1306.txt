Chapter 5
Ye have heard that it hath been said,
Thou shalt hate the
SOUL GENIUS
Our own
Which will live
in infamy.
Last night Japanese forces
attacked the
SOUL GENIUS
Our own
I'm talking to you tonight
I'm talking to God
The Holy God
The Holy God
The Church
Praise God
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a praise?
시청 from ad rom
can I get an amen?
thank you children
thank you
thank you
thank you
some of you may not be familiar
with the church of the sub-jesus
some of you may not know the heart
of the sub-jesus
some of you may not know the purpose
the divine
the purpose of the church
the purpose of the church
the purpose of the church
is to have what?
slack
can I hear that again?
Can I get some slack?
Can I get some slack?
Can I get some slack?
Ah, Dr. Perkins.
Ah, yes.
I know the pipe to one is coming.
Your pants are on the floor.
And I don't mean Santa Claus.
Neither.
For as the new century approaches
and the great black slabs come down from space
and the piped one shall come
and he shall do battle with the horned one
and with the hoofed one
and with the car-driving one
and with the sleigh-riding one
and with the mailman
and the milkman
and with Dave
and he shall in the end triumph all.
Is he not the smoker?
Is he not Bob?
Dogs, yes.
He has come for you.
Where are we, Bob?
The code is broken.
Trouble?
Big.
Security?
I have the lid on tight.
Well, take it off for me.
The message is
Mars needs women.
Mars needs...
It's a gag.
It's a prank.
It's a fake.
I don't think so, sir.
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing
I've ever heard on KFJZ
and since I've been listening to it.
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob
for this brief minute of slack
from the Church of the Subgenius.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang
with the sorry truth.
Now, friend, look around you and face facts.
The world is composed mostly of jerks.
All kinds of ignorant,
dangerous, thoughtless louts
are in positions of power and influence
while some of the most deserving people you know
are slugging it out in a thankless cycle
of brain-breaking labor and mental paralysis.
Checks and balances?
What a joke.
Friend, if you want to get slack,
then you better uphold the Great Covenant, yes?
Before you were born,
you swore you'd help in the great battle against them.
That's right, them.
The normals, the mediocrities,
the Barbies and Kens,
the pink boys,
the somnambulites,
the Ks,
the stage men,
the time servers,
the Philistines,
the witch-burners!
Those who have made slack?
Taboo.
That's right, friend,
there's only two races in this world,
us and them.
Whose side are you on, eh?
Let there be slack.
Oh.
See www.subgenius.com
This is a very important statement.
I want you to hear it.
The internet made me so goofy and lethargic
where I couldn't think, I couldn't study,
I couldn't control any...
I was just like,
marriage.
Bad news.
If you were in here this morning
and you're dealing with the internet
and you're hiding it
and you think you're doing a good job of hiding it,
you're not hiding it from the Lord.
And it's corrupting you.
Well, no, I've got it under control.
Because Jesus said,
this is how you deal with it.
Fornication and pornography.
Yes.
Uncleanness and licentiousness.
Yes.
Gushing and there's sexual pus and junk all coming out of it.
That's his desire.
To be sexually boozed.
Oozing 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
Licentiousness.
Just unbridled, uncontrolled sexual excesses.
That was something he invented.
Next is worshipping oozing sexual excesses.
Can you worship your brand new shiny sexual pus?
You bet!
Can you worship fornication?
Yes.
And in our society, how easy it is to worship pornography.
So much.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
for psychiatry help?
Yes, it's an emergency.
Did anyone bring the...
Oh, you've got them.
Oh, wonderful.
Howdy, friends.
Well, we got the results
of the auction.
The results are
Ms. Miniver bought up
almost all of those
two big wagons, remember?
She bought them up
and now...
That was at the sheriff's auction.
That was at the sheriff's auction.
And now she wants to sell
the things that she got
because she got too many things.
So we're going to sell them
to you today.
Now, call in
if you want any of these items.
We'll work out the bidding later.
So let me just read them to you.
Give them a number, Clem.
Okay, now,
she's got there
some throat hoods.
Fancy plain or all white.
Now, if any of you
want any throat hoods,
they're going to go for
two and a quarter, I believe.
Now, there's long sweat hoods
and fancy plaid duck blankets
and running suits.
Thank you, Jesus.
Yes, sir.
She's also got a crate
of Dr. Rose's obesity powders,
some duck hats,
and a genuine
Humpty Dumpty folding egg crate.
Inside that
is a metallic hen's nest,
a folding egg tester,
and spring-level poultry punch.
Now, I know that
the poultry punches
that we've been getting recently
haven't been up to snuff.
And I know that
you hate to see your chickens cry.
Stop hitting those chickens.
So, let's try to use
these, I think this one
that Miss Hemiston has here
is going to be worth our while.
Now, she's also got
some dull finish gum hats.
Thank you, Jesus.
If you want them.
If you want them.
Amen.
If you want to have them,
all you can have
cream strangle food.
Cream strangle food.
It's killing.
Remember, it's killing.
And, of course,
men's dongala nullifiers
for sloughing around the house.
And I guarantee you,
if a dog,
if a dog gets his chompers
into a nullifier,
he will not,
I repeat,
he will not do it again.
Of course, if your foot
is in it at the time,
I can't guarantee
he won't be hurt.
But, that's the way it goes.
Now, we also have
some soft rubber urinal bags.
And Mrs. Hemiston tells me
that there is one toilet mask.
I don't know if you,
what you're going to do with it.
Yes, Mrs. Hemiston.
It might be hard
for her to part with this.
She might hold on
to this particular item.
But, now,
in the north part of the country,
around the Midden Hills,
I know that you men down there
need some tongue scrapers,
levelers, and ditchers.
Now, she's got tongue scrapers,
levelers, and ditchers.
And she's also got
a new improved Acme sweep grinder
and a model pee hauler.
So, come on down.
Pick up your right-hand-only
tongueless sulky plow.
Put it in your
boss gasoline peanut roaster.
Wear your star miner's lamp.
And pick up your
reliable worm cakes,
pleasant and effective,
with your manure
and potato hooks.
And sometimes,
when nothing's going right,
when our days are monotonous,
in a dream like before,
we go on our way
to Mar-a-Veur,
to Mar-a-Veur,
green like the sea,
as green as,
as green as,
and as blue as,
as green as,
and blue as,
as blue as,
and blue as,
and blue as,
as green as,
as green as,
as green as,
so
bob's got bob's got all the the special the special medicines and the herbs and the
and for every uh and the sanctified pills and for every pamphlet order that which we get we um
we distribute four pamphlets for free that's right many of these pamphlets go to go to the
people in haiti you know that then in haiti there there's children starving and and there's a false
prophet so running things down there and some of these pamphlets go to lost the cuban airdrops

hey cats listen to me there's a place down in texas where the hip people meet
they got lots of slack come along you will see it's the place called the church
Watch off the sup, Jamie.
Yeah.
That's right, ladies.
You want to live forever, you've got to sleep with Bob.
But hey, after all, isn't there a little Bob in all of us?
The place called the Church of the Sub, Jeannie.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's ready to have a great time entertaining his friends.
Right, Bob?
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Oh, well.
Oh, yes, friends, and this is hour of slack number 1,306 thrown together in a hurry because of a day-long power outage.
Also, Reverend Sud's best out.
Yes, of course.
As always, we see one minute notice after another.
Then we offer to look at.
��
Madness Motors by Reverend Taylor Jessen,
FiresignTheatre.com, and SealandRecords.com.
Those have proved most motivational, friends.
Just as Monty Python influenced many of today's satirists,
the Firesign Theatre is what most of us subgenius radio old-timers have in common.
We owe them much slack.
Anyway, what we heard, going backwards,
the last song was by Inviso Bob, whoever that is, from Bob Songs 5.
Before that, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh diddling his old Fairlight in 1984.
Before that, Baby Stang and the late Dr. X,
Lamont Duvaux from Media Barrage 4.
The instrumental was Reverend Sodi from Music for Imaginary Monster Movies.
The catalog listing, including Dongala Nullifiers,
was Phil Proctor from Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour No. 1.
Lemur did the internet cut-up and the title.
The piped one, Cometh, was from an ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland in the 90s.
And at the top, we heard Pope David Meyer's very first sermon.
Now, a timely little Hitlerian piece from Firesign Theatre's Radio Hour Hour about Der Schnifter.
Germany, 1937.
Yeah, right.
Spätzl Fitz und Stimmen Salamander nicht gewachen.
Ja.
The Fuhrer is going blind.
Is this blood or urine in my spine?
His left eye is clouded by viscera.
What?
Listen, I heard this in Birkelschwagen.
Ja.
Fair little Stumpfer.
Birkelschwagen?
Birkelschwagen.
No, no Stumpfer in Birkelschwagen?
No, this is the Wagoneer Stumpfer.
He goes in and out.
Oh, the Wagoneer Stumpfer.
Yeah, from Brummswagen to Wessenbecken.
He goes back and forth, you mean?
No.
He just goes back.
Just wait until you meet him.
He's got a mule and it's turned around the wrong way.
He's a real stinker.
Dumb worker.
Why are you telling us what he was talking about?
Because he was spreading a rumor.
What are you from?
South Germany?
What is this?
And the rumor was all concerning the head man, Der Schnifter.
He said Der Schnifter.
Number eins.
The Schnifter is on little black pills.
That contains strychnine and atropine.
What do they do with him?
With him?
They wheel him around.
And all he can do is move his right, his left hand.
He can't ride with his right hand anymore.
And only he can...
Is he a little slapper or what?
Or he has only a mule to go back from one city to the other?
I'm just telling you what I heard, Hans.
You can make anything from it what you want.

I knew now that my every impulse was to kill Bob.
But I had thought of one idea.
It was worth a try.
If I tried to kill Bob, I had to act like the doll.
Anything was worth a try.
Act like the doll.
But I didn't dare act the doll.
Yes.
I had to act like the doll.
Yes, yes.
And I had to kill Bob.
Yes.
Yes.
I had to kill Bob.
Yes.
Kill Bob.
Yes.
Kill Bob.
Yes.
I had a chilling urge to get out of my clothes and get out fast.
Yes.
Yes.
It's true.
Yes.
It's all true.
Yes, I understand that.
I had to admit it.
Uh-huh.
And I live near San Francisco.
Yes, naturally.
Well, I guess that about does it.
Goodbye.
With each invention of a better life,
a better kind of boat,
and a better kind of spear,
the pursuit of whales was carried further from shore.
When at last in the 1860s,
Svend Foyn perfected the harpoon with a bomb in its head,
he opened the last century of whaling.
Yay!
He patented his bomb on Christmas Eve
and wrote in his diary,
I thank ye.
Ye.
Thee.
I thank thee.
Oh, Lord.
Is that a T there?
Let me see.
Lord.
Lord.
Thou alone hast done all.
Two L's in that.
Yeah.
All.
You're normally such a slacker.
It's the first time you've heard us.
Are all four of you guys in here?
Is Phil in there?
He just, yeah, yeah.
Can we?
Doing with four?
Yeah, all four.
Okay.
What are we doing?
How do we?
This is, this is.
Oh, yeah.
They'll do the comedy.
How about this is Phil, Phil, Pete, and Dave
of the Firesign Theater.
This is, okay.
This is Phil.
Phil.
Let's take it again.
Oh, Pete and Dave.
Okay, there we go, yeah.
All right, you over here?
You just shut up.
This is Phil.
Phil.
Pete.
And Dave of the Firesign Theater.
And we're listening to
The Hour of Slack.
Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack.
Because we're subgeniuses.
And we're slacking off.
The Hour of Slack.
The Hour of Slack.
The Hour of Slack.
The way it all works in the universe.
The way it's all put together
in a special mathematical way
by who knows what all.
And no one can decode it,
but we can sure make it work our way
if we just, if we just cleave to Bob,
cleave to the words of Bob
and the foundation that's trying to help Bob
and his ministers.
You cannot help Bob
without helping the ministers of Bob.
Oh, my God.
Woo-hoo!
Praise!
Oh, Lord!
It feels all right.
Oh, yes.
Put your hands up.
Praise the Lord.
And friends, we got special fancy drop box weave
handsome trimmed horse suits
and fancy wool drop box weave Kentucky horse suits
with bound ear and eye holes
if you want to wear them on Sunday.
Also, we can find running boots, knee and arm boots
and quoits for 40 cents a set,
rubber string bag bladders,
handmade dog whips and dog couplers
and grass suits.
We only have a couple of minutes
before we have a station break,
so we've got to get the fashion show in.
Here.
This model is wearing a special fancy drop box weave
handsome trimmed horse suit
with bounded ear and eye holes.
It's very pretty, don't you think?
I think it's really, really one of the most attractive
models this year.
Very, very nice.
Great.
Here, Jeanette is wearing a fancy wool drop box weave
Kentucky horse suit.
Oh, she's really...
Very pretty.
Plaid fro-hoods.
Very pretty.
Very pretty.
You see, removable.
That's removable.
She's taking it off now.
Ah.
Wonderful.
That's very nice.
Very nice.
Pastel here is wearing a knee and arm boot
combination of pounded brass
and tin couplings.
Very good.
She's lifting her arms now.
And she's flexing them.
Very good.
That's wonderful.
Very good.
My wife knew it, but the kids didn't.
Now.
I don't know if she's masculine.
You know.
Fred here is wearing running boots.
Oh, there he goes.
Well, they were very nice.
Very nice.
Very nice.
Very nice.
Very good.
The showing of grass suits will be delayed until after this message.
Oh.
This part of the Firesign Theater Radio Hour Hour is brought to you by Andy Chrysler Motors.
The makers.
The makers.

The makers of The Prince of Darkness.
New for Andy Chrysler Motors.
For 1970.
The Prince of Darkness.
Something to believe in.
So, do this.
The next time you go to your drug store, get an extra package of drugs.
Buy two packages instead of one.
Drugs offers extra effectiveness because it can give quick relief from that sparkling
effervescent headache.
Bob Drugs.
Listen.
I'm not a drug addict.

I'm a drug addict.
Well, now, there ain't no use talking about it, Grandpap.
I know he is coming here.
Bob.
Yes, sir, Bob.
That crazy fellow on the radio.
That's the one.
He ain't coming here.
He is, darn it.
How many times do I have to tell you?
See, he's gonna fly here.
Grubbing it out.
Sassy fresh.
Well, he is.
Sassy fresh.
Paid him good money, too.
I hear.
Doggy, don't you ever listen to nothing?
Well, what's he coming here for?
Well, that's the thing we don't know.
That's just about what I figured.
All we know is that it's a drug.



And that's something terribly important.
Oh, yeah.
I just bet it is.
The whole thing sounds like a pigeon-toed pipe dream to me.
I don't even believe there was any Mr. Ham-Pat here yesterday.
Well, all right, Doggy.
Just a second.
I'll put...
Wait a minute.
Here comes Lom.
He'll tell you.
Why would I want to believe him any more than you?
He's got bigger pipe dreams than you.
Oh.
Hey, Lom.
Come in here and tell this Grandpap.
The fact is he called up long distance on the telephone here yesterday.
Abner talked to him.
Heard his voice.
Yes, sir.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Not before I know it.
No, sir.
Not before I know it.



Not Milford Avery Spears.
No, sir.
E. Bob, sir.
No, sir.
Stubborn-headed old goat.
Look at him.
Two-pound package?
Well, now, you surely don't need that much.
Well, you can have that much if your conscience will let you.
You know what you're doing, though, don't you?
You're just taking that right out of the mouths of some young'uns.
It's fuss.
It's got plenty.
Don't hurry up and do something about this situation.
We're going to have an awful lot of deaths laid at our doorstep.
Somebody else is dying for a won't of it.
You know, that's a funny thing, Abner.
You take the generality run of women folks around here, and they're all anxious to do
what they can to help out, but there's always some amongst us that's got to be greedy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sir.
Doesn't want to have any slip-ups, you know.
Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
What I'm doing, you see.
She's been bed-ridden for a couple of months.
She just ain't doing no good at all.
Got the rheumatism.
Oh, she's feeling something wonderful.
Yeah, she's been on a funeral list for, oh, two months, and I know of.
That's all very interesting.
Yeah, she just loves it.




She loves to have somebody drop in on her.
That's fine.
Especially if they can entertain.
She loves entertaining.
Well, she does, doesn't she?
Yeah.
What did you say?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Oh, that's all, brother.
That's all.
Do you mind if I use your telephone?
No, help yourself.
At least if I've got anything.
Oh, hello?
Listen, Bob.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I think you're crazy.
Yeah, but, but, but, Bob, I tell you.
Well, if it means that much to you, Bob, sure.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.
Well, is he coming or ain't he?
Yes, he's coming, and from the way he talks, it looks like he intends to get here if he
has to crawl all the way on his hands and knees.
I'm sure he's coming.
I'm sure he's coming.
I'm sure he's coming.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.






By the way, Bob, I swear to God you woke me up.









Thanks, Bob.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.


Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You've got to have a
plane that will
be able to
build it when you destroy it.
Arriba!
Arriba!
Up up and away!
Arriba!

Arriba!
El Monte!
Hey, they know how to do things down there in a big way.
I'm very glad that the
Irish intellectuals took over
this country and were able
to effect a permanent revolution.
And a permanent
wave! That's right, a permanent wave
of revolution.
Pondre la vache! Permanent wave of revolution.
I think they invented
the whale scarer too.
That was a big help.
All them whales were swimming up the Gulf of California
but they got them scared away now.
Hey man, did you see someone else?
They ain't gotta go swim up into the Colorado River
no more. Is that the oil that they used to
keep the whales away from you?
They were bad for the whales?
That was about two inches high.
Was it lowered? Yeah man, it was
lowered so much, man, there wasn't
hardly nothing there no more.
They cut the seat, man. Yeah man.
They got furry deck. Yeah man. Oh, far out, man.
You know what I'm doing now? You got the cubes
that always read seven?
Cubans always read seven.
Buy yourself one whale of a
car, buddy, read the giant
ads. From stem to stern,
she's a flat 100 feet, ladylike
lines on a he-man hunk of gar.
Performance figures were generally sidestepped
but a number of three-color billboards and
full-page ads were headed, performance?
Ask the fella behind the wheel!
And featured an apparently authentic
testimonial, one of the Indianapolis speed kings
behind the wheel of the mammoth convertible.
A larger than average man, he was incredibly
dwarfed by the immense dimensions of the
car. His tiny face, just
visible at the top of the wheel, was
split in a grin of insanity,
like a toothpaste ad, a madman's
laugh frozen at the nightmare peak
of hilarity, and it was captioned,
Getting the feel of this big
baby has been one real thrill,
believe you me. Despite
their roominess, power, and road-holding potential,
the big cars did prove impractical in the city
because their turning arc, for the
ordinary 90% change of direction, was
greater than the distance between the street-angle
buildings, so that by 5.30, all
four of the sleek red devils
and devil rockets were wedged at
angles across various intersections around
Columbus Circle, each a barrier to
thoroughfare in four directions, and causing
quite a snarl indeed until cranes and
derricks could be brought from the East River.
Thanks to Firesign Theatre for that.
The instrumental before that was
The Psychoskeletons featuring
Reverend Basil Story. The old
Lum and Abner show with Bob was
found by Reverend Smelly Bacon.
Firesign did the fashion show
and the harpoon with the exploding
head, Faster Love from The Large.
I Had to Kill Bob was from
Le Mer, and the song Be Over



Be is by Uncle Reverend
Dr. Onan Canobite, and that's
just part one. Now
let's go back in time to an old
WCSB broadcast with me
reading What Is Dobstown
by Reverend New Monet
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave
reading between the lines.
What is Dobstown?
What is, then,
Dobstown?
It is the stuff that
dreams are made of.
It's what makes Tinkerbell
and the Lost Boys fly.
It powers the
Starship Enterprise.
It's the hidden
code in Windows and Mac
OS, though not yet available in
Linux. It's the general
oblivion, crazy when the moon dance
strikes the cornea of your head.
Dobstown. It's the
cancer-causing, teeth-staining,
smelly, pukey habit.
It's the drug that helps you find
God. It's the lonely
night before that never, never ends.
Dobstown.
It is your brain
on drugs.
It's learning to work as a team and as
a slave. It's where there is a
lake in which resides the sword
Excalibur kept by
the Lady of the Lake, Connie Dobbs.
And if you think it's hard to pull
that stone from out of that sword
out of that lake, it's easy to pull a
fig from a donkey's anus.
Dobstown. It is where all
the flowers have gone.
It is the home of
John Dillinger's real penis.
Dobstown. It is a mystery, wrapped
in an enigma, smothered with
sautéed mushrooms and onions in a savory
gravy. Dobstown.
It is John Dillinger's
penis, savaged
in muscular gravy and surrounded
by mushroom people.
Dobstown.
The home of both Lemurians
and Cenobites.
My proper home. I'm going
back someday. I've got
to get back to my home.
Dobstown.
It's near the coast
of Hanalei and
the land of Fredonia.
Dobstown.
It's the world's largest producer
of manna, ambrosia,
frap, and the green stuff
that Dave injects into the brain
to reanimate dead tissue.
Spiritual bliss with open
lame burly every night from
midnight to dawn.
Dobstown.
It's the residence
of J.R. Bob Dobbs, part
of the year. It's creamy
and crunchy. It tastes great and
is less filling. It is margarine
and it is butter.
But if it were to fall into enemy
hands, it would mean the destruction
of us all.
Ah yes, dang, but
it is the downfall of us all.
And it tastes bad on bread
because man, those that
go don't come back.
They're losers. Losers.
No man, those who graduate from
Dobstown come back changed.
In a new form.
You can't see them like
you can see others. They don't move
or talk. Graduated like the chrysalis
to the elf, all the way up
to a higher being.
They grow and grow.
Their tiny skin's hardly large
enough to pop them as they begin
expanding into that
new form.
Dobstown!
It's where
UFOs are not just
a fact of life. They're the law.
Of course it's a law
here. Of course it's a law.
Everyone needs to
live by laws, by rules.
We need to have our
lives doubled by...
Dobstown!
It's where the bad little
girls and boys go.
It's where something is happening
all the time, and most of it
unsolved.
Some of it
is so hard to locate.
Many of the people from the
Saucer Ship Emblem itself have been
sucked out and left here.
Dobstown.
I didn't
want them to be oblique.
I was trapped there down in a chair
and started asking me questions about
Dobstown.
I gave them literally
the location of the
website.
Dobstown.
It's Nwatsbod spelled backwards.
It's Brigadoon without the haggis.
It is surrounded by the seven cities
of Cibola, which are its slums.
And it has a ferry
to Monster Island.
And what a delightful
view of individuals you'll never
find there.
The ferries of Monster Island.
Tiny little happy people
who do things for other people.
Who live for other people.
So big are their hearts
and so tiny is their stature.
They...
Dobstown!
That's where Amelia Earhart
crashed, friends. It's where the
Tunguska meteorite came out
after bouncing around inside the earth for a while.
Yes, she
said,
Bob Dobbs,
the young
ten-year-old J.R. Bob Dobbs
from his slingshot
was once a
sling shot
by a
young
ten-year-old
J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And that was

shot by
the
In a fit of rage?
No, he didn't even know he was doing it.
It was just, you know, I mean, he picked up a...
Other kids might pick up a pebble or a cat skull for their slingshot.
Yeah, a cat skull, that makes a lot more sense.
A tiny black hole, a singularity.
A singularity.
A glowing essence of nothingness sucking in all that is not Bob.
And that is what he shot into the Tunguska plains of Siberia.
And then past the event horizon, the little thing itself went and then became like a bigger thing?
And it went into the earth, Bob's tiny black hole did, and it bounced around like a cue ball on a pool table.
Back and forth until finally it exited at the place we now know as Dogstown.
Dogstown, friends.
It is where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.
It's where you are better than you were in high school.
It's where you get all the pets you ever wanted.
It was never a colony of France.
It is where science and magic are the same things.
It is the unfolding of miscalculations.
It is the dawning of the height, weight, hair, and eye color of Aquarius.
It is the fizzling, crackling...
It is the dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic...
It is the divergence.
It is where the early worm gets away.
It is where the grave-dickers leave their shoes in the middle of the night.
Dogstown!
It is for when you're too lazy to kill yourself.
Dogstown!
Where there are no lawyers and where the government never tries to be helpful.
Dogstown, friends.
It is where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death.
Dogstown!
It's between the dark and daylight.
When the night is beginning to lower.
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter.
It is where the lamb and the lion lay down and have sex together, friends.
Dogstown!
It is proof that hell is full and the dead walked.
It is where the earth is.
The fabric is what created.
Like yourself, what created backed you to thousands of other threads.
That is our caustic solution for you as members of this solemn group gathered together, squandered and quashed and pushed under heavy stone so that you may not know the truth that we speak.
And yet here we are, speaking it to you.
Dogstown is not a place where a man or woman dwells, but a place in the heart as big as that mighty elephant yoke and twice as tasty as all the trees that you could imagine.
Now, imagination is not a place you want to stay.
It's not a place you want to bring the kids, grandma, ride the ferris wheel with.
It's not the kind of place you want to leave for a better home.
It's a place you visit over and over again.
With your pants on, your pants off, and your heart ripped right out, hanging from your chest.
Dogstown.
Where Bob comes home after an easy day's work.
And where you can come home too, friends.
Where you'll be home!
Where you'll finally realize why.
Why.
Why.
And why.
And why you can find out more about beautiful Dogstown when you join the Church of the Subgenius.
The world's only first, true, last, final, one, true religion.
Because it admits it is full of crap.
It is the only one that's not full of crap!
I can try to end age.
I know it's coming each time.
I can tell it.
You tell it.
Used customers say each time.
You're complete garbage too!
Now you are!
Zero waste kunneЕ
word-for-word to me.

Can you really get me any if you get negócio this much.
But why it can she meet.
I can't go on.
Excuse me.
creature stomps its feet and paws at the ground. Dobbs grins. He smokes. The creature charges.
Dobbs whips out his pipe and gives it a little conk on the noggin as it runs by. And after that,
it sits and pants like a little puppy dog.
Oh, use me, Jesus. Use me. Before the antichrist, the mark of the beast takes over.
Save that soul close to hell. Fail believers with the Holy Ghost and fire.
That one is sick. I command that blindness, deafness, sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure,
stroke, cancer, arthritis, hemorrhoids, every disease to come out, body, coat, the pits,
whip, lung, jeez, and stain. I say in the name of Jesus Christ, rise up and walk.
God put money in that empty purse. Don't ever let it be broke again. That one again,
my ministry today, God, I'm going to command on Isaiah 45, 11, give it back to him.
104, bless the home.
The farms, the cattle, everything they're hanging, try to take the touch, let it be blessed.
I felt the warmth of Jesus.
Yes, I want to heal this old Lord. Yes, I'm healed. Oh, yes.
You know you're healed.
Oh, I better. It feels better. Yes, Jesus.
Well, that's about it for another happy, friendly flumeroo here on the thin,
thin, thinning.
Sure has been wonderful just sitting around and scoring the old tunes.
The tunes of the tunes at the top of the box.
Limbing the flam and making a custard out of your mind.
Yes, yes. The last stand of the last band.
Yeah. Yeah, well, it's a fine time. It's a swell time for all that.
But it's time to go.
Is it time to go?
Can I tell a band story before we go?
Sure.
A band, so wait a minute. Is a band on this radio station?
No, no, a band, not a radio band, but a band that played in the 40s.
Oh, I dig. I'm happy to hear John.
Yeah.
If you're not, I'll break a record over your head.
All right.
78.
78.
I'll break really good.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
They used to take a lot of pills sometimes.
And it kept them up late at night.
Solid.
You're talking about those mean little whites.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
And the blacks were there, too, man.
Everybody was there.
It was a real show.
It was together, man.
Just little guys.
Vicky had a very good time.
Had a nice lunch on the beach with a nice can of Coors beer.
Best time I ever had in 1960.
Thanks a little.
Stop that harmonica.
September 6th.
I went to the beach.
It's a famous look.
Yeah.
Also available by the Fireside Theater Radio,
Hour Hour, are two record albums that they made on Columbia Records.
One of them produced by Cyrus, who's here today with us today.
Brother Cyrus.
And it's a pleasure to see them with his head back on.
Yes, that's gold.
His head was over to one side, but now it's back in place.
It's well now.
He gave us his watch.
Thank you, Jesus, for giving us his watch.
He can talk again.
Listen to him.
He can talk again.
But you're losing your voice, brother.
He can talk again.
Kneel in front of the altar.
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
My voice is going out, too.
Thank you, Jesus, for giving me this sore throat.
Thank you, Jesus, I know that I'll be able to carry on your radio ministry.
Thank you, Jesus, for giving me this deep sleep.
Thank you, Jesus, for all the affection you've given me.
Thank you, Jesus.
And that I know.
Take it.
There, there.
Take it.
Then it's going to be better some day.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
Why is everybody left in a chair?
Here's Mishman.
Oh, you're here, too?
Here's Mishman.
Oh, boy.
I'll follow you anyway.
Oh, I'm Jesus.
Into the joys of heaven.
This is the coming of Jesus.
I'm coming, too.
Are you really?
I'm coming, too.
I'm coming, too.
We're coming together.
Oh, boy.
Oh, sweet Mishman.
This is living.
This is religion.
Oh, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
Oh, my boy.

Joyce is back now.
What happens in those moments of religious ecstasy, folks?
None of us knows here in the radio ministry.
It passeth understanding.
It passeth belief.
Memory.
Sure is nice.
That's what I got to say.
Thank you, Jesus.
Going to be all right.
Turkish peasants say the flu sweeping Europe and the Middle East is lunar flu brought from
the moon by U.S. astronauts.
Clock, clock, clock, clock, clock.
News Radio.
I'm torching nearly every county of the state.
I'm vicious.
Fox News.
Detained.
Bank burned down.
All journalists, including Americans.
Two photojournalists were killed covering Texas.
We deeply regret the loss of all life.
Fox News.
You report.
We decide.
You can do incredible tricks automatically.
Specially designed.
Bob's wife, Connie, and the conspiracy.
There's obviously a connection there.
You seem to have penetrated a simple analog in the allegory.
There's no doubt.
There's no doubt.
There's no doubt.







What you're saying is that the words Khan and Connie and the Khan and conspiracy all are
composed of the very same letters of the alphabet.
You see, it is necessary for the subgenius to embrace the conspiracy and even to have
carnal relations with the conspiracies to a certain degree only in the interest of avoiding
it eventually and finding slack.
We hate to do it, but carnal relations are carnal relations.
Somewhere slack has to be.
where you find them.
And what about the rest of the world?
I don't care about them.
We don't care about them.
We want them to care about themselves.
And then through caring about themselves,
they can care about us.
True subgeniuses.
Well, they have plenty of things to care about.
We know that everyone
must love themselves
before they can love another person.
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
You know, the ones who
buy lots of stuff.
Well, you can do that, too.
If they buy what they want, that's the important thing.
You're talking about prosumers who are professional buyers.
Just like Homer Simpson says,
Donuts of the world beware,
it's judgment day.
Yeah.
He didn't say that.
Wait a minute, he didn't?
Well, it says that right here in the script.
Are you one to challenge the script writer?
No.
That's been done before, and those people aren't around anymore.
If you know what I mean.
Also,
we,
we had an anonymous message
that some callers were going to come down,
and I guess they're here now.
We're going to interview these folks
right here on the air.
As soon as we get them to come in.
Sure, when you're a big kid, you can drive,
you can come down to the show.
I've heard that if you have at least three shows
on your hard drive, your computer will run faster.
Now the ball gags are placed.
If you've downloaded at least three shows
from
one server,
you can get a free copy of the show.
I like to just say
quiveringbrain.com
If you go to
www.quiveringbrain.com
and find the link for the Puzzling Evidence
show.
Is that Puzzling Evidence plus P show?
Is that the one you're...
They're all there, even the ones without P.
Oh.
P and Slack, same stuff.
It can be.
I just want to know
three things. P, damn,
damn ass.
What does that have to do with anything?
That's what I've got to find out.
And that's your challenge
here at the last waning few minutes of the show.
Rewinding the show here, getting ready for the end.
I'm going to put away my stuff.
No, you can't call
because you've already called.
Because your mom said so, end of show.
End of show.
You have to hang up and call back to call.
And be sure to write in to this radio ministry
if you have any results
of our healing.
Tell us what happened.
Tell us if you were healed.
Tell us if you were split and mended together again.
Yes, mistress.
And support this radio ministry
with contributions
from the very depths of your heart
in your pocket.
Friends, the Bible says money is not unimportant to us.
Money!
Oh, money!
No, it's not important.
Thank you, Jesus.
Yes, it is not no more important than Jesus says
in Isaiah 1, 17, 6.
They was the pigs and they was coming after us.
I'm going to give away my money.
Thank you, Jesus.
I'm going to give away my money.
I'm going to do it.
Here's your wallet.
Here's your wallet.
Give it to me.
Give it to me, brother.
Give it to me, brother.
Here's my wallet.
Give me the full money.
Here's my credit card.
Give me the money.
Here's my wallet.
Here's my wallet.
Green cabbage.
I got green cabbage.
I'm going to buy myself a devil rocket.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you.
Thank you.
But you can forget about the money because this show is all free.

There's even stuff about things that aren't free there.
Thanks to Reverend Maynard Brainerd for the Fox News segment
and the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley with Dr. Howell and Philo Drummond
with the puzzling one himself.
On YouTube, you might want to see Puzzling Evidence TV for hours of ancient subgenius history
and or my Rev Stang channel to which I recently added hours and hours of subgenius videos
and photos.
You can also watch the films dating back to 1973.
And never for a second forget to praise Bob and Doctors for Bob who did the music in the background.
And the music we'll end with is from Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm.
