1
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,440
10.05

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,280
Let's begin with the Great Divine Director's call.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,940
We'll give the preamble,

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,140
and then we'll make invocations before the altar, before the decree.

5
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,460
Great Divine Director's call together.

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,800
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,300
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,580
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:03,720


10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,200
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,180
In the name of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,060
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,860
This is for weak people in the audience.

14
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,160
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,080
It's not even my hand.

16
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,520
It's weak.

17
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,940
This is for you.

18
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,960
This is for you.

19
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:56,120
This is for you.

20
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:29,760
This is for you.

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,060
This is for you.

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,300
This is for you.

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,500
This is for you.

24
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:11,460
This is for you.

25
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
This is for you.

26
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,540
This is for you.

27
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:51,600
This is for you.

28
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
This is for you.

29
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,860
Yo, I said I'm calling you, heh.

30
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,460
So where's my frump, Stang?

31
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,380
Let's go with it.

32
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,540
Stang, where's my frump, man?

33
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,860
You're on that award again, don't you?

34
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,960
The Hey Stang Award.

35
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:13,800
Hey Stang.

36
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,300
Hey Stang.

37
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,040
See my butt plug, Stang?

38
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,120
See my butt plug, Stang?

39
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,320
See my butt plug, Stang?

40
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,320
So Bob took some of us along to that giant sex toy store in Oklahoma

41
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,860
intent on buying some naughty birthday apparel for Connie,

42
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,080
but in usual Dobbsian fashion,

43
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,180
he started giggling like a demented 12-year-old,

44
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,820
dry-humping the rubber butts,

45
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,540
putting butt plugs on his head like devil horns,

46
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,480
and laughing like some mental case,

47
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,840
running around the place with crotchless panties over his suit,

48
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,700
spitting pasties at everyone,

49
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,220
and he finally drank half a bottle of Hotsey McGonigal's lavender love lube

50
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,020
and shot the rest on the floor behind him like James Bond's old Aston Martin,

51
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,600
making the staff who were chasing him slide all over the place.

52
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,840
But as we made our way,

53
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,660
he gave us all zebra pattern vibrators,

54
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,120
so it turned out okay,

55
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,400
or at least as okay as it gets when Bob is at the wheel.

56
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,280
My God.

57
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,960
Experienced or not,

58
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,900
you won't want to miss Gay Rap on Wednesday, March 23rd at 9 p.m.

59
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,360
when we'll discuss connecting sex,

60
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,000
love, friendship, and how to get some.

61
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,480
It's just a matter of inserting yourself into the situation.

62
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
Men cruise men,

63
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,340
and an active element of cruising is eye contact.

64
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,280
So, if you haven't been getting what you want,

65
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,000
then maybe you haven't been going to the right place.

66
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,880
After all, you can't get cherry pie at the hardware store.

67
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,460
So, clue in to some down-to-earth strategies

68
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,460
for finding out what you want and getting it.

69
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,120
On Gay Rap, this Wednesday at 9 p.m. on...

70
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,820
The Self Genius Hour of...

71
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,180
I don't mean to insult you, but you know, as a medical doctor,

72
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,200
I am trained to think skeptically.

73
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,080
While you're teaching your colon to work right on its own,

74
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,420
while you're not using it,

75
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,420
clean out your colon.

76
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,400
Science-minded researchers all over the world, like myself,

77
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,940
are just beginning to uncover the treasure trove

78
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,500
your colon has to offer,

79
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,420
training your colon to work properly on its own.

80
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,200
You see, your colon has muscles

81
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,580
that need to be stimulated to stay healthy.

82
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,160
Stimulate those muscles.

83
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,980
They start working right on their own,

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,260
the way a snake moves.

85
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,420
Now, my program teaches your colon

86
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,320
that stuff gets scrunched up and compressed in there,

87
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,040
sort of like an accordion.

88
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,240
Some people are carrying around an accordion in their colon.

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,900
Do you have dry mouth?

90
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,940
I sure do!

91
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,500
It protects your teeth, bites infection,

92
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,960
and lubricates your food.

93
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,580
But what happens when you run out of saliva?

94
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,360
Help me, I can't talk!

95
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,300
For personal dryness upstairs,

96
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,180
it's Salavex.

97
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,720
Wow, I can spit again!

98
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,020
Salavex is more than saliva in a can.

99
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,860
Salavex improves consumption efficiency by 50%.

100
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,680
No more halfway cures,

101
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
like coating your throat with cooking oil

102
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,860
to have that extra piece of cake,

103
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
or bowl of kitty litter.

104
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,880
After a night out, my tongue tasted like carpet.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,020
It was embarrassing.

106
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,000
Now with Salavex, I can eat a whole box of crackers

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,580
or lick my life partners.

108
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm a salvex.

109
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


110
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


111
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


112
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


113
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


114
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


115
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


116
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,400


117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm a salvex.

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


119
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


120
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


121
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


122
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,080


124
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,520
All night.

125
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,060
It's like having a salivation army in my mouth.

126
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,380
Now I can suck a

127
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,000
lollipop

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,620
for as long as I want.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Salavex tastes like your own saliva.

130
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,280
That's because at Salavex's state-of-the-art production facilities,

131
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,660
we use salivation philanthropists

132
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,300
who make Salavex all day.

133
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,160
Salavex.

134
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,340
When it comes to personal dryness upstairs,

135
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
we're deadly serious.

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,740
Salvex.

137
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,220
We Christ.

138
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
We're deadly serious.

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,420
No water.

140
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,020
That's why we should stop using tobacco.

141
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,740
People get sick from health problems,

142
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:21,740


143
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,020
More health, 절대.

144
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,020


145
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:22,880
Time pictures.

146
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,880


147
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,880


148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,880


149
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,880


150
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:22,880


151
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,540
If you wanted to know how to stop running,

152
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,560
their parents know the details.

153
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,560


154
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,560


155
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,560


156
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,560


157
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:23,560


158
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,360
So, I had a problem with the truth,

159
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,620
at a number of times.

160
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,660
So, again,

161
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:25,900
everyone's cringing and giggling.

162
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:25,900


163
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:25,900


164
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,380
The thing is that

165
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,300
Turn out the lights.

166
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
Shut the doors.

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,800
But we don't love them, boys.

168
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,940
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

169
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,120
Aye.

170
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,820
Aye.

171
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,100
What was it?

172
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,980
Where are we?

173
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,100
Uh.

174
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,240
Eh.

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
Eh, friends.

176
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,700
That was G. Gordon Gordon there at the very end of that thing from X-Day.

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,940
Remixed by Asko, a.k.a. So-So Dada.

178
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,240
So-So Dada put together that whole first ten minutes of the show.

179
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,940
That's really horrible.

180
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,460
And it's a great help, though, because yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

181
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,780
I'm working on this book, this new book.

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
I like putting in very long.

183
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:35,100
So this show, Hour of Slack number 1044, is not a rerun, but it is truly thrown up.

184
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,640
Thrown together.

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,680
Before Bob's throne.

186
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:51,280
And we will borrow, therefore, some radio synesthesia from WCSB in Cleveland, for instance.

187
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,900
And we'll barrage you with...

188
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,200
That there now is no yoritarian orality.

189
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,820
And

190
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,860
Norrellian

191
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,540
preferences

192
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,400
And there will be some live revival recordings from

193
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Winterstar of 2006.

194
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,300
But first, the worldwide message,

195
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:09,980
tribe.

196
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,240
Praise Bob!

197
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,720
Looked up in the house, trippin' in the house with God

198
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,000
Long gone, what if we're three in the same?

199
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,520
You promised when we're meeting your name

200
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,800
You will be with us, you will be here as well

201
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,540
To sing your praise, perhaps compelled

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
Righteousness, the truth of your soul

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,340
Love and faithfulness, yours to own

204
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,240
Those who praise your name gain blessings

205
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
We're walking in the light of your presence

206
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
Stick up your hands, stick them up, get them up in the air

207
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
Raise them up, up in prayer

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,440
Stick up your hands, stick them up, get them up in the air

209
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,860
Raise them up, up in prayer

210
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,940
You getting busy?

211
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,700
You getting busy?

212
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,340
Who's in the house?

213
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,240
God's in the house

214
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:15,840
I heard you talking about Devo

215
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,580
Yeah, Mark Mothers ład

216
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,560
Yeah, Mark Mothers ład actually

217
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,620
I was thinking of Devo

218
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:22,680
I was thinking of Devo

219
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,460
earlier because it turns out Disney has

220
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,400
bastardized them. Oh yeah,

221
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,500
Deve 2.0. What

222
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,800
on earth is that? Do you know anything about that?

223
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,600
Well, it's, you know,

224
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,400
the Devo Corporation is a

225
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,440
subsidiary of Dobbs Co. and

226
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,240
they'll do anything for a buck.

227
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,560
So when Disney came to them and said

228
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,200
how about

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,520
this? Devo, only

230
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
it's kids. It's like

231
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,420
little kids doing all your great hits.

232
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,520
It'll be a whole new audience. And I'll

233
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,240
take 15% just for

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,860
discoverer's feet.

235
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,580
How on earth did Disney come up with that idea?

236
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,400
The important thing

237
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,940
is the message of Devo

238
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,380
resonates with some of

239
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,700
these kids because what

240
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,000
Devo's basically saying is that

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,180
everything's full of crap, folks.

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,640
It's time to De-evolve.

243
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,320
But

244
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,260
it's kind of like Church of the Subgenius.

245
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,140
You're getting screwed every day

246
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,260
but you can learn to enjoy it because some

247
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,140
ways are fun. And now

248
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,440
...

249
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,200
...

250
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,720
...

251
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,300
,

252
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,820
...

253
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,540
...

254
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,220
Finish college. Get all the education

255
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,220
possible. This isn't such a smart

256
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,300
idea as it may seem. Drop out

257
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,900
from college. Don't go back.

258
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,060
It's a plain and simple fact. Earn

259
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,100
more now. Learn more later.

260
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,940
There was a horse

261
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,520
from Custer's last harem.

262
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,180
In a moment, I'll tell you about an odd

263
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,700
way to dress a horse.

264
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,360
Dying in a cited

265
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,840
car cab in New York City.

266
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:08,840


267
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:08,840


268
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,380
Come on

269
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,660

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:11,660


272
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:11,660


273
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,480
We might have a

274
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,800

275
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,960

379
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,580
Yes.

380
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,840
Hey, would you get that?

381
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,580
Hello?

382
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,200
Hello.

383

Hello.

384

Hello.

385
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:29,700


386
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:29,940
Hi.

387
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,540
Hi.

388
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,420
Oh, I'll call you back, baby.

389
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:31,620
I'll call you back.

390
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:31,620


391
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:31,620


392
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:31,720
Hey, what?

393
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,380
Hello.

394
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:43,900
Hello.

395
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,140
Hello.

396
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,140


397
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:44,860
Hello.

398
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,260
Hi.

399
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:45,900
Hi.

400
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,200
Hi.

401
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,140
Brr-brr-brr.

402
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,340
Hey.

403
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,200
She sent her son to Orleans County for Christmas break and she never got him back.

404
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,440
News 8's Ty Chandler reports on one mother's fight to reunite with her child.

405
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,100
This is my son Cole, and this is my-

406
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,260
close as Rachel bevel aquia can get to the two men in her life these days I

407
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,360
can't call him on the phone no I can't write him a letter no I can't send him a

408
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,380
present no I can't have any personal contact with him at all except during

409
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:22,640
these supervised visits and it's just it's just so hard to to have that wall

410
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,660
between us means my baby her baby is actually 10 and he lived with her and

411
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,820
her husband in Columbus Georgia her son's father stays in Orleans County and

412
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,220
last December Rachel put her son on a plane to see him something she's done

413
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,140
many times before but this time she wouldn't get him back this is the

414
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,480
longest we've ever been apart Rachel says her ex filed for full custody she

415
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,520
thought that would be an easy fight since she cared for her son Cole his

416
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,640
entire life but Rachel walked out of court stripped of just about all her

417
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,340
parental rights when Orleans County Judge James punch learned of her

418
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,400
involvement in the

419
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:57,640
statute of limitations

420
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:57,640


421
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:57,640


422
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,880
performance group called the Church of the subgenius that pokes fun at

423
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,340
religious and political groups court transcripts support her claims I read

424
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,040
through the transcript a million times and he just says it's obvious that I

425
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,380
shouldn't have my son obvious ACLU director Barbara de leo didn't want to

426
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,360
comment on this case directly but she says there is no getting around the

427
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,760
freedom of speech it's a very challenging issue to think that that

428
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,260
because somebody engaged us in constitutionally protected activity that

429
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,880
there are personal ramifications for it Rachel thinks judge punch used her to

430
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,100
make a political statement I'm a good mother and you can't play games with

431
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,020
people's lives like this now Rachel says she's been allowed to see her son three

432
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,240
times this year all brief supervised visits we tried to reach judge punch

433
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,920
previous times and he refused to comment on this case and we learned today he is

434
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,100
out of town so what's next for the mom Rachel well her life in Georgia is on

435
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,200
hold she says she's not leaving New York

436
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,240
without her son

437
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,200
she'll be back in court next month and in front of a new judge since judge punch

438
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,700
recuse himself last week

439
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,260
she's

440
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,940
child

441
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,800
she is

442
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,280
child

443
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,760
yeah

444
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,300
yeah

445
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,320
child

446
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,380
yeah

447
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,740
she's gonna say

448
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,900
yeah

449
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,620
yeah

450
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,520
she's gonna say

451
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,780
yeah

452
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,380
yeah

453
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:43,640
yeah

454
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:05,300
Mary had a baby which apparently was against the rules

455
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:19,120
since she was smarter than the rabbit men they threw at her.

456
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:32,180
And Miss Magdalene had her baby taken away from her

457
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:46,800
by a man too crazy to see past his own lies.

458
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,580
To my surprise, she just smiled

459
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,460
said it was just a conspiracy

460
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:12,180
and she was much bigger than they could ever be.

461
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,340
Hey! Hey! Hey!

462
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,440
Hey!

463
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,220
Hey! Hey!

464
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,840
She's gonna take back her baby

465
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,800
She's gonna take back her child

466
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,800
She's gonna take back her child

467
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:46,400
She's gonna take back the child

468
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,340
Crow Winters did that song, and that's about all I know about it.

469
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,140
Isn't that strange?

470
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,940
I don't know whether that was which.

471
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,760
Well, anyway, friends, we thank you.

472
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,700
And now back to Radio Synesthesia.

473
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,880
If you want, you can drop me a line.

474
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,980
I now have an email address open for all of you out there.

475
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,040
You can write to me at sinister at WCSB.org.

476
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,040
So don't spam me, though.

477
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,020
If you do, I will find who you are.

478
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,220
I'll find out where you live.

479
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,180
I'll find out where your family lives.

480
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm not saying anything.

481
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,420
I'm not saying anything's going to happen.

482
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:53,500
Anyways, before I get myself into trouble, here's somebody who has taken the bait.

483
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,820
Hello, you're on the air.

484
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,320
Hi, Dr. Sinister.

485
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,660
Oh, hello, Reverend Stang.

486
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,020
Yeah.

487
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,860
I wanted to warn you that I think that the cowboy will be calling about 11 o'clock.

488
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,380
Uh-oh.

489
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,240
This could get interesting.

490
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,600
I guess so.

491
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,760
God, that would be great.

492
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,300
You know, it depends on what you mean by interesting, but I don't know.

493
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,420
I always find...

494
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,800
I always find it interesting.

495
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,980
You know, we like to keep it surreal up here.

496
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:27,240
I was just copying over the show in which Reverend Magdalene called in and described her custody problems.

497
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,920
Any news on that?

498
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,660
No, nothing really new.

499
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:41,320
I believe that the judge did let her visit with the child, despite her affiliations with Church of the Subgenius.

500
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,520
Do we know when her next court date will be?

501
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,100
No.

502
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,860
Have we?

503
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,140
No, it's funny, though.

504
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:58,580
I've done sort of other radio talk shows four nights last week in a row, four different radio outlets and podcasts talking about it.

505
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,440
A lot of people are really interested in that.

506
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,820
You know, I can't blame them.

507
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,960
It's serious stuff.

508
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:15,800
I mean, you know, this is when the big ugly side of civilization can intrude upon the worlds of those of us who like to think we are kind of...

509
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,120
You know, we've been in the world for a long time.

510
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,120


511
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,120


512
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,120


513
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,120


514
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,220
We've managed to dodge the uglier sides of the system.

515
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:19,240
Right.

516
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,140
We haven't been caught up in the wheels of the giant machine yet.

517
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:23,820
Right.

518
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,880
But then, you know, just like that, it can happen to anybody.

519
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,460
Yeah.

520
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,300
So, you know, let this be a lesson to everybody.

521
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,420
You know, don't get too comfortable.

522
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:32,900
Have your experience ready.

523
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,940
Yeah, don't get comfortable.

524
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,820
I mean, you know, anything could happen to you at any time.

525
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,500
We've got another caller here on the line.

526
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:39,820
6873515.

527
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,220
Hello.

528
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,640
You are with us on the air.

529
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,120
Oh, boy.

530
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,160
Just ignore me and just go right to another caller.

531
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,960
Oh, yeah.

532
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,720
Well, there's nobody here.

533
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,020
Oh.

534
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,980
How humble.

535
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,860
Yeah, really.

536
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,080
I mean, like, what's the point of calling if you're not gonna...

537
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,200
Just to tie up a line so that Bernie doesn't use it.

538
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,080
Oh, that's okay.

539
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,640
Hey, you know what?

540
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,020
It's been a while since I heard from Bernie.

541
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,500
Yeah.

542
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,000
If...

543
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,060
You know, there are certain...

544
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,880
I mean, he can get away with a lot on this program that he couldn't get away with anywhere else.

545
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,520
Yeah, you give him a lot of leeway.

546
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,000
I do.

547
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,460
There are just certain places where I'm just not gonna let him go anymore, though, because

548
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,680
he's already said everything he had to say about them.

549
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
And he just repeats himself.

550
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,700
Yeah, I'm really surprised that you haven't heard from him.

551
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:16,700


552
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,120
I mean, this has been the...

553
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,280
Shall we say the more eccentric people have really been active this week.

554
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:32,520
I think that the government rays have increased in power or something, because the...

555
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:32,740
Yeah.

556
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,580
You might say it's been a kook holiday lately.

557
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,040
Anyway, you found...

558
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,120
If you look at all.slack, it takes about two seconds before you go, good lord, there's

559
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,400
more...

560
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,560
Way more inmates than doctors now.

561
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,300
Yeah.

562
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,700
Hey, can I ask you guys to hold on for a second?

563
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:46,780
Sure.

564
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,420
Hold on for just a little bit, and I'll be right back.

565
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:49,920
Thank you.

Truth is bitchy

579
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,880
This is the Meredith Ynott

580
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,400
For King Henry II of England, it was always good to be on your toes.

581
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,960
All because he could curtsy better than anyone else.

582
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,260
They are at Lea.

583
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,940
In a moment, I'll tell you how Leo VI always ate his queen.

584
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,520
Standing up, they are at Lea.

585
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,060
Well, number one, number three, number four.

586
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,120
Number five.

587
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,720
Number two.

588
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,540
Oh, Lamont, you really think so?

589
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,440
Of course, Margo.

590
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,560
Number three.

591
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,160
On Tuesday, June 15th,

592
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,200
Two, two, one.

593
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,280
Alan Greenspan sat before a Senate committee

594
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,000
One, two, three.

595
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,480
at the Capitol building

596
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,000
Go!

597
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,240
Greenspan.

598
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,180
Greenspan.

599
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,120
When my house

600
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,640
has only onestean

601
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,260
I suddenly get cross-eyes

602
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,040
abrest раб秋

603
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,360
Green spam.

604
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,620
Green spam.

605
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,280
Hey hallo.

606
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,680
Yeah.

607
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,060
Hello.

608
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,100
Hello somewhere.

609
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,100


610
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,180
bunch of lemur, friends.

611
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,340
All those sounds

612
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,980
from a doctor

613
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,660
or mister. He's not a doctor or a reverend. He's just mister.

614
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,040
Fernand and Andy Lemur. All of those sounds

615
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,100
are in our new book, The Bobliagraphon.

616
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,580
To give you more

617
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,680
enjoyment

618
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,360
pay more

619
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,920
yes

620
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,480
see how much more

621
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,300
millions of dollars more

622
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,240
millions of dollars more

623
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,060
and that's

624
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,320
not all

625
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,000
yes, pay more.

626
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,860
I think I'll take the pill.

627
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,040
Anyway, what was I supposed to talk about?

628
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,600
Sex.

629
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,700
Okay.

630
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,320
I don't remember what I put in that program book,

631
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,860
but it doesn't matter because you've already read it in the program book.

632
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,820
Something about the tantric temper tantrums and so forth.

633
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,260
Well, okay, you heard the concept. We don't need to elaborate on it.

634
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,500
Take the ball and run.

635
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,820
Actually, I did have some things to say.

636
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,960
The Church of the Subgenius is all...

637
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,700
It's a sexy cult.

638
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,120
The Raelians don't have anything on us.

639
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,040
But my real topic was, as far as sex goes,

640
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,980
what I wanted to talk about was bragging.

641
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,820
Is it more important than the sex?

642
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,920
I sometimes think it may be.

643
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,260
You want more sex?

644
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,520
Because I certainly, you know, you...

645
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,560
Well, you know, just because Bob said it,

646
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,100
just because it happened to you doesn't make it interesting.

647
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:53,060
Now, whereas some can hurt other people's feelings by bragging about who they have done,

648
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,540
others can only hurt people's feelings by bragging about who they've declined to do.

649
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:04,360
And so I'm not going to go into any of that.

650
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,960
I've heard anybody's feelings.

651
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,400
But I've actually had people who seem surprised going,

652
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,560
Sex in the church?

653
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,640
The Church of the Subgenius?

654
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,480
I thought y'all were a bunch of nerd boys.

655
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,040
And...

656
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,360
No, that was the 1980s Church of the Subgenius.

657
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,080
We build it and they will come, you might say.

658
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,820
And we started talking about what a sex cult this was,

659
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,160
and how if you came to our yearly celebration at Brushwood called X-Day,

660
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,740
no matter how ugly or stupid or lonesome you were,

661
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,040
you'd find somebody even uglier and stupider.

662
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,680
And you can find your true Yeti mate.

663
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,880
And in the realm of sex, we...

664
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,940
Somebody said, we stand on the shoulders of giants.

665
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,640
But that's not really the way it is.

666
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,100
It's more like we're on piggyback on giants.

667
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,780
We're humping furiously against the backs of the neck of giants, my friends.

668
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:06,700
We were in San Francisco recently, and there's a pretty strong subgenius thing going there.

669
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,880
There's a radio show that's been on for 20 years.

670
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:18,160
But the PC subgeniuses in San Francisco were amazed to hear that out in this part of the country,

671
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,900
and in Texas, we were having subgenius get-togethers where there were matings!

672
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,700
And little Getty children were being bred.

673
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,160
Breeding true, friends!

674
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,940
At the right times, according to the Bob and Connie almanac.

675
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,740
You know, you have to do these things exactly on a timetable.

676
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,240
And...

677
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,880
And some...

678
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,960
Like I say, they're in San Francisco, so they're kind of PC, and it is all...

679
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,240
The girls got completely bored with them.

680
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,580
But they were kind of upset because we've been...

681
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,240
We preached that you should recruit people from other religions by using sex.

682
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,180
That was...

683
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:02,240
The Children of God used to do that. Remember them?

684
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,340
I think they've changed their name and moved from country to country.

685
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,140
We haven't done that yet, because we haven't gotten to that point.

686
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,740
But we're getting close.

687
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,000
And we'll tell you more about that later.

688
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,720
You see, friends, one of the many, many scientific beliefs in the Church of the Subgenius is that

689
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,700
the true subgeniuses are descended from the Yeti of the Himalaya, the Sasquatch, the Bigfoot,

690
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,720
and so forth.

691
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,660
And we've fallen very far from our pure-blood Yeti ancestors, as we call them.

692
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,100
Watered down from the one true family of the Yeti, because they were...

693
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,860
There weren't that many of them.

694
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,140
They were a group of subgeniuses.

695
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,140


696
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,140


697
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,820
They were all related.

698
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,020
That's why we say, ancestors.

699
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,620
Their names were Smith, by the way.

700
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,020
That's why there's so many Smiths around.

701
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,140
So we tell our minions...

702
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,460
That's it, minions.

703
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,420
I like that word.

704
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,440
The believers and the disbelievers and mockers that fill our pews.

705
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,640
The pew packers.

706
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,240
We basically go, look, okay, as far as sex goes, go ahead and use the humans.

707
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,320
Use them.

708
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,000
But don't miscegenate!

709
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,820
Don't get one pregnant.

710
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,400
And don't get impregnated by one, boys.

711
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,920
You don't want to produce a half-subgenius, half-human thing.

712
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,760
The half-breed is such a lonely creature.

713
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,220
I feel so sorry for the one-penis.

714
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,940
My heart goes out to you.

715
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,500
Especially the female.

716
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,820
But Bob taught that...

717
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:36,880
You know, some of our rival cults and our beloved fellow new-wage religions talk about...

718
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,800
They talk about...

719
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,380
They talk about a laid-back, own-chanting universe.

720
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,880
According to Bob, it's a squirting universe, friends.

721
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,900
An oozing and squirting universe that's always trying to procreate.

722
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,620
Even if it's just trying to procreate trouble.

723
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,140
It must squirt!

724
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,500
And Bob is the squirt essence, you might say.

725
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,740
A balance of unbalanced forces.

726
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,980
It's the exact science of random chaos.

727
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,500
That's very popular these days.

728
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,500
You don't have to know much math to do that.

729
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,880
And other cults talk about...

730
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,640
Oh, what was it? Wilhelm Reich and his orgone accumulators.

731
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,780
Where, you know, you could sit in a box and it would sharpen you up or something like that.

732
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,780
Well, that's based...

733
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,640
That's a silly superstition based on orgosmonic radiation.

734
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,760
Which is created whenever mutants such as ourselves have sex.

735
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,260
Not for procreation, but just for fun!

736
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,880
In fact, it kind of...

737
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,740
It can mess up the orgosmonic radiation if somebody's getting pregnant.

738
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,620
So natural and unnatural do not even enter into the question of subgenius sex.

739
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:59,100
We do not care if it's boy, girl, human...

740
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,560
Well, subgenius...

741
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,880
As long as you're not making little babies, we don't care what species it is, friends.

742
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,060
Yeah, the only thing that enters into it is fun.

743
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,000
And regardless of what's being entered into.

744
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,440
Bob, I'm not going to do any demonstrations so you can relax.

745
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,480
Bob prophesied the third sex.

746
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,160
That there would be a third sex.

747
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,940
In all of our ads, if you look through the little pamphlet, it says,

748
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,520
Have intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else!

749
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,080
Bob didn't say it had to be an earth woman.

750
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:48,480
If you can show me somewhere in Book of the Subgenius where Bob said it had to be anything from this planet.

751
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,640
That's why we await the Alien Kama Sutra.

752
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,720
On X Day, July 5th, 1998, which is yet to come, by the way.

753
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,700
We don't really know what year this is.

754
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,620
We don't even know what planet this is.

755
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,000
I know which one it's not.

756
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,260
But...

757
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,240
Maybe we shouldn't get into that.

758
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:06,720
Yeah.

759
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:16,500
Yeah, on July 5th, 1998, Bob prophesied the aliens will come and rupture up the dues-paying believing subgeniuses

760
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,380
and smite all the normals and disbelievers, which at this point is most of the earth.

761
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,880
So we've got all the elements that you expect in a major world religion.

762
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,480
Punishment of disbelievers, that's number one.

763
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,640
It's not that...

764
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
Look, we don't love Bob so much.

765
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,240
The whole thing is we love the idea of him.

766
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,920
We love the idea of everybody else burning in hell.

767
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,240
It's just like any religion.

768
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,080
But it's not all sex, friends.

769
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,280
Sometimes it's love.

770
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,920
And as the great subgenius Nenslow said,

771
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:54,260
in every relationship, there's one mean person and one nice person.

772
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,980
If you want them to be the nice person, you have to be the mean person.

773
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,240
That may explain the behavior of some of your friends.

774
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,080
Anyway, it's not enough of the sex.

775
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,680
That's boring.

776
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,520
Nobody cares about that.

777
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,180
Oh, that's tedious.

778
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,500
Tedious sex talk from Winterstar of 2006.

That's Rosencomet.com.

781
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,280
And I should mention that Text Day is coming up

782
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,960
at the High Rock Ranch outside of Austin, Texas on May 7th.

783
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:48,600
They shall be lifted up there, friends.

784
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,680
And you can find information about those kinds of things at subgenius.com.

785
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,060
Text Day.

786
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,720
You can see pictures from last time.

787
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,700
Bob will be there, I've been told.

788
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,220
Bob will be at Text Day.

789
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:11,220
And here to talk about Bob is, singing about Bob is, Artemia Selina.

790
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,780
I

791
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:32,200
I do not know where my friend is kind of

792
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,640
Just gives you thrills

793
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,920
Bob, Bob, Bob

794
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,960
Will lay you to waste

795
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,360
Bob, Bob, Bob

796
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,960
Will get you spaced

797
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,420
Bob, Bob, Bob

798
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,140
Will do you in

799
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,800
Bob, Bob, Bob

800
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,220
Is a sin

801
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,320
Bob, Bob, Bob

802
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,540
Will make you rush

803
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,720
And make you cuss

804
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,240
Don't tell me no lies

805
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,540
You hypnotize

806
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:23,480
Bob will make you skinny and pale

807
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,280
And also put you

808
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:26,520
In a bad mood

809
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,320
In hell

810
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,680
You're not my friend

811
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,960
You just let me down again

812
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,960
That special porno

813
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,020
Not TV guide stuff moronski

814
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,560
Is foreign magazine stupid white man

815
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,160
Is not for easy find

816
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,920
Must get from Pope Black

817
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,540
Pass through many hands

818
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,100
To reach smelly Mercado

819
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,760
You know here of Sanjina's smut network

820
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,400
Not all smut on electric picture box

821
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,640
Bob makes search for rare bits

822
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,320
You think sweaty pic of Connie's nether beak

823
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Just fall from sky

824

Doom ass

825
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,820
You even pay it up

826
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,540
Pull over side of Van Allen belt

827
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,180

828

saucer license, infidel.

829
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,080
Hell Pope Huey did that.

830
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,840
Yes, Hell Pope Huey.

00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,860
time continues.

852
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,060
Troll.

853
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,560
I think probably what they'll do is just lay down

854
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,100
a kind of a gas that'll put everybody to sleep

855
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,080
in a state of suspended

856
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,960
inanimation for a long enough period

857
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,880
of time to do what they want to do

858
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,040
and then they'll figure out what to

859
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,220
do or not with us.

860
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,640
As if they hadn't already done that

861
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,580
since World War II, Dave.

862
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,900
Do you realize that time could stop?

863
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,900
I know. I've been breathing the same air.

864
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,700
For the equivalent of, you know,

865
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,140
for the equivalent of thousands of years.

866
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,700
I mean, of course, that would have no meaning.

867
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,160
Whatsoever.

868
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,020
We're just saying that there's a time

869
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,120
Nobody would ever know the difference.

870
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,940
that might be more explosive

871
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,640
if we don't keep our, you know,

872
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,020
feet down there where they're supposed to be.

873
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,360
How many times have the aliens stopped time on us?

874
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,160
Right. If they stop it just for

875
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,160
what we would call a fraction of a second at a time,

876
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,560
we hardly notice.

877
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,960
No, I mean, if they stop time

878
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,560
for like, you know, a million years

879
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,040
at a time, or what would be the

880
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,920
what would feel like a million years at a time to us?

881
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,640
We'd never know the difference because everything would stop

882
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,000
and it would just come right back on just like that.

883
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,860
That's happened every time.

884
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,980
Every time I took the other half.

885
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,540
That's what will happen.

886
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:28,960
Anyway.

887
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,640
I got a question for Reverend Stang.

888
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,900
Is the Bob Newhart show part of the conspiracy

889
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,680
or part of the subgenie

890
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,800
because they use the word Bob so much?

891
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,460
Well, you know,

892
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,880
Bob is the most common name

893
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,060
in the English language.

894
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,880
And every single time you hear it,

895
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,020
it doesn't necessarily mean something cosmic.

896
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,520
I mean, we even have a Bob here.

897
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,660
In the case of the Bob Newhart show,

898
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,520
every time you heard

899
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,000
the word Bob on that show,

900
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,500
you're supposed to take a big slug

901
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,040
of your beer.

902
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,920
Can I tell you something

903
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,220
that just happened to me?

904
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,280
I had to do an interview with a person

905
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,580
in a normal job environment

906
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,340
and she kept referring to me as Bob.

907
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,480
And I was getting paranoid thinking that maybe

908
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,860
she'd been cruising the internet

909
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,740
and confusing me with this person

910
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:16,920
somehow or something.

911
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,760
I don't know how I thought that

912
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,220
or something.

913
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,500
And I said, no, my name is...

914
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,160
I was Dave for the 15th time.

915
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,580
And she said, but you look like a Bob.

916
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,540
And I said, well, what's wrong

917
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,520
with looking like a Dave?

918
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,180
And she went into this long description

919
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,240
about Bobs and how they look so wonderful

920
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,260
and how they're so trusting looking

921
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,240
and nice and friendly and Dave's aren't.

922
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,920
Boy, is she all mixed up.

923
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:42,540
No kidding.

924
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,040
I was going to say.

925
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,120
What's her name now?

926
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,720
She's a lady.

927
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,400
Yeah, I'll go.

928
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,460
I'll tell her my name is Bob

929
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,360
and she'll say,

930
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,400
oh, you look like a Bob.

931
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,860
You're so trustworthy looking.

932
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,500
No, she'd say you look like a Doug.

933
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,940
Twiddling that mustache and so forth

934
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,200
and I can sell her something.

935
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,700
I think she was a willful person

936
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,300
who couldn't get names straight

937
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,220
and so she invented this lie of,

938
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,400
well, Bobs are wonderful.

939
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,660
Right, she heard you.

940
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,240
You know how a one-syllable name...

941
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,920
I mean, she just got mixed up

942
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,560
between Bob and your real name, Dan.

943
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,940
She can't help it.

944
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,840
She just gets confused.

945
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,300
Some people are that way, Dan.

946
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,300
Beautiful.

No man ever, ever loved a boy any more than I love you.

There isn't any language.

1016

In fact, this is Bob song number one.

1028

Oh.

1034
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,880
Hey, Lee.

1035
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,620

00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:53,540


1063
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,360
Uh-oh, on the other hand we get a UV shake.

1064
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,380
Got a.

1065
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:14,680
A man with more yellow,完成 salir del cielo.

1073
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,820
I happen to be a narcotics agent for the British Crown.

1074
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,160
Ah.

1075
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,640
Yeah.

1076
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,080

00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,420
Well, that's an interesting theory.

1081
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,080

Sure, I don't know.

1085
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:52,620

The Flintstones have the Rambles too.

1097
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:00,020
They all sing yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

1098
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,000
They are mad.

1099
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,080
They are the American family.

The Flintstones have the Rambles too.

1101
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:18,060
