1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
Thought and word and deed

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,260
For causes we would die for

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,160
And reasons to believe

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Oh, I'm so sorry.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,080
This was KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas, but...

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,920
But, but, well, I guess it still is, dear friends.

7
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,660
Oh, yes, welcome to the harvest, dear friends.

8
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,260
It's that reaping of eardrums that we call

9
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,060
the...

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,740
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,500
At number 208 this time,

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,620
and while we are yet still in the midst of

13
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,580
pledge drive fever,

14
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,900
we're gonna nonetheless strive to bring you

15
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,160
between our legless beggings,

16
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,100
our beggings that you call 823-7490

17
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,020
and pledge,

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,060
we're gonna strive to bring you

19
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,880
the true slack for which you've spent your whole life

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,140
toiling and toiling away.

21
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,300
For, my friends, we do not just ask,

22
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,200
nay, we give.

23
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,060
For four years we've been giving you oral slack.

24
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,560
And for what?

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
For what?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,020
What do we get out of it?

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,940
You think we get paid to do this show?

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,220
Nay, nay.

29
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,440
In fact, we spend money on this show.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,660
Well, maybe we break even

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,300
if we somehow get two memberships

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,460
out of each month of broadcast.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,340
And see, most weeks we just get

34
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,880
those free information letters.

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,300
And what we send out is this sort of

36
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,380
tongue-in-cheek catalog.

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,060
Some of the recipients of those

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,320
may not understand that the products advertised

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
are, in fact, real.

40
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,920
And consequently, neither us nor the station

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,320
is exactly making out from doing this

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,340
death or at least mutilation-defying show.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,440
So?

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
Why do we do it?

45
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,460
Eh, because we'd, we'd, we'd, honestly,

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,000
we'd feel too guilty if we didn't share

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,400
all the cool stuff

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,660
of which the subgenius church gets in the mail.

49
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,140
And therefore, don't you think you should feel guilty

50
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,500
in return, dear friend?

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,740
And, and like write us a check for $30 or so

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,140
here at 823-7490, some peddling amount like that.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,220
Because otherwise we'll think of you as

54
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:36,140
scavengers, leeches, parasites, and gimme bobs.

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,040
Veritable slack vampires drawing off our precious supply

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,520
of life-giving slack.

57
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,860
But you see, if we think of you that way,

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,080
we'll gradually start programming the show that way.

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,380
And the next thing you know, it'll all be top 100 album hits.

60
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,420
We don't know.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,720
We'd rather that you think of us as faithful friends

62
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
who call you up faithfully every Sunday night.

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,580
And so since you're about to call 823-7490 and pledge,

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,200
we're gonna trust you not to tell an embarrassing secret.

65
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,260
The upcoming top secret ears only tape

66
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,400
in which we deign to grant you this penetrating look

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,100
behind the scenes on hour of slack production techniques.

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,600
The way this magical web we weave is really done

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,760
when first we practice to deceive.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,120
Ah, yes, and please dear friends, call 823-7490,

71
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,600
speak to Will O'Dobbs, or the mighty Reverend St. Trickster Shaman.

72
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,620
Yes, a mysterious character that you can speak to in person,

73
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,220
in real time, not tape time.

74
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,800
Not like what you're about to hear.

75
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
At some point in the future,

76
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,800
yes, all we have to do is flip in this little secret,

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,100
wait a minute, that's not the secret tape.

78
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,720
Where, where's this, where's the secret tape?

79
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,680
Oh.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,860
I'm gonna start all over again.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
I've got to start this damn show all over again.

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,420
Ah, I'm gonna start all over again.

83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,420


84
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,420


85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm gonna start all over again.

86
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,040
Hold on just a second.

87
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,760
I can't leave this mobile studio out here with the lights on.

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,660
All right.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,860
There's always a light to the station.

90
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,200
Light, light, light, light.

91
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,120
At least I've got this little portable thing

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,000
so that we can start the show whether I'm in the studio or not.

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,480
And here we have the, here we are finally

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,260
in the K&ON studios.

95
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,400
As you can see, oh, oh, the guard dog's trying to get out.

96
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,540
As you can see here, or would be able to see if the camera was working,

97
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,220
this huge bank of cassette and reel-to-reel decks

98
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,340
that are brought in each night for the hour, slack,

99
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,980
by the zombies, by the very Will O'Dobbs.

100
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,460
But, I mean, I'm not gonna lie,

101
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,620
tonight I wanted to do a thing where I,

102
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,040
a little how-to bit.

103
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,160
You know, a lot of people go,

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
how do you do this hour of slack thing, man?

105
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,040
And, it's computers is basically what it is.

106
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,080
Not only is the show written pretty much by computer,

107
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,820
of course, you know, there's some human interface there,

108
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,980
but it's also actually, believe it or not,

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,380
recorded and acted by computer simulation,

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,940
the simulation of human voices, dear friends.

111
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,740
And we use this Beast 9000 computer here,

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,680
excuse me, Will.

113
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,180
You can see with the, this booger has a 40,000 K RAM

114
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,760
and a 50,000 K U.

115
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,340
And essentially, we just type in the script

116
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,940
and fine-tune the machine until we get

117
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,340
the desired lifelike effect of human speech.

118
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
And we can program that.

119
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,060
We can program in the voices of any subgenius ranter.

120
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,100
We've got about 25 people in the files with a,

121
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,300
well, we've been doing this for so long

122
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,940
that we've built up quite a library

123
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,420
of human-like vocal utterances.

124
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,940
And I will show you all,

125
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,100
oh, shoot, we're gonna have to,

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,740
we're gonna have to tune this guy out here.

127
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,660
Hold on just a second.

128
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,680
And I'll show you how we do a sample hour of slack show

129
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,700
without having to fly in people from all over the country.

130
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,760
Let's see if we got the,

131
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,220
first we type in the message here on the computer,

132
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,060
like so, just for an example here.

133
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,580
And then, I have to, hold on,

134
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm gonna hurt your ears as I move you

135
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,740
to the back of the computer

136
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,460
where you can hear the pre-processed sound.

137
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,700
This is what it sounds like

138
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,140
before we actually add the human vocalizations.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,640
Yeah.

140
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,340
This is the sound.

141
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,480
This is the sound of the bass,

142
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,820
and we are converting it onto online data.

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,840
Convert to sub-entry mode.

144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Then the database is transferred to the district memory

145
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
by a general computer.

146
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,320
And retrieve the line of radar

147
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,220
by special hardware.

148
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,200
These computers are the ones that can actually think.

149
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,080
So some experts still prefer to use the word mimic

150
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,160
to human brain.

151
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,780
There, there we go.

152
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,320
See?

153
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,800
That part is easy.

154
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,020
That's the easy part.

155
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,000
What we do next then is select this little portion here

156
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
and call that one Doug.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,580
That will be the puzzling evidence voice.

158
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,160
And this section here will be the howl voice.

159
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,040
And now see, we have these voices,

160
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,720
digital samplings of these people's voices

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,900
and a huge database of syllables.

162
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,320
The tricky part is,

163
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,420
let's see, we add here the human emphasis simulator

164
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
with a pleasant and informative vocal tone.

165
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,200
And that will take care of them.

166
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,240
See, now we add sound effects with fractalization

167
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,040
and set the extemporaneous spin-off mode on

168
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,280
at 75% speed.

169
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,040
Use the general knowledge access file for,

170
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,660
now this, that is where we get the metaphorical bounce back,

171
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,840
we call it, so the voices appear to actually be interacting

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,520
with the sound effects before they say it.

173
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,980
And so let's, here, turn it on, listen to this.

174
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,900
You heard what it sounded like at first,

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,900
and here's the final version.

176
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,400
This is the show database,

177
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,840
and we're converting it onto online data.

178
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,000
Convert to sub-entry mode.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,620
Then the database is transferred to the district memory

180
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,940
by a general purpose computer.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,640
Then retrieved along a radar sweep line

182
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,020
by special purpose hardware.

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,660
These computers are the ones that can actually think,

184
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,460
though some experts still prefer to use the word mimic,

185
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,720
the human brain.

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,840
That means this bird is in your brain.

187
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,640
Or, conferra wise,

188
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,960
that a large brain is now inside a bird.

189
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,120
Some birds are little more than nature's flying brains.

190
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,620
Boing me.

191
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,600
Boing away.

192
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,180
Virtually nothing else exists in these organisms

193
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,440
except a large brain and a pair of wings

194
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,560
to steer it about through its environment.

195
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,540
How fun.

196
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,520
Natural selection has reduced this creature

197
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,620
to its present-day grotesque appearance,

198
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,560
but a perfect example of adaptability

199
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,520
and evolutionary speciation

200
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,960
in the marvelous Darwinian tapestry

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,400
we call life.

202
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:31,140
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

203
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,200
Yeah.

204
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,060
No, no, no, stop.

205
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,840
All right.

206
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,380
Apparently some of you folks haven't gotten the message.

207
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,160
This is a pledge drive.

208
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,000
It still is.

209
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,460
We really do, well, the station,

210
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,880
needs you to call,

211
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,300
make that offer,

212
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,020
that small offer,

213
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,300
of thirty to a thousand dollars.

214
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
Well, heck, I mean, we'll take five.

215
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,060
But you won't get as much goods in the mail

216
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,420
with five.

217
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,720
In fact, you might not get any goods in the mail with thirty.

218
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,540
Depends on how well everybody else does

219
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,140
on their pledge drive shows.

220
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,040
Now, last week we had to do pledge drive,

221
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,480
and we raised about half of the money that we require.

222
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,980
If we can't get some more calls coming in tonight,

223
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,540
we're just gonna have to do this again next week.

224
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,460
However, as an incentive,

225
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,020
now, last week,

226
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,120
we read, we sang out in praise

227
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,780
the names of those who pledged.

228
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,960
Tonight, we're not gonna do that to you,

229
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,900
because it hurt us, believe me,

230
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,100
just as bad as it hurt you.

231
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,260
Instead, we have, we have this incredible electronic,

232
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,300
very expensive electronic device here

233
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,780
called the Punishment Tube.

234
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,860
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

235
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,120
I have the Punishment Tube.

236
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes, I'm afraid, I'm afraid that everyone who calls in will...

237
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,840
It leaves the tip all red and raw.

238
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,540
That's right.

239
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,840
It does, and we're going to do that to Will

240
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,800
and Reverend Trickster here,

241
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,860
for everyone who calls in will also

242
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,400
speak out your name through...

243
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,540
The Punishment Tube!

244
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

245
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,900
Oh, that's right.

246
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,780
See, I have to get back about five feet

247
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,060
from the microphone in order to read your name through...

248
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,780
The Punishment Tube!

249
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,900
...when you call in.

250
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,720
So, please do.

251
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,520
I mean, it's worth it.

252
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,260
Spend 30 bucks to hear your name read out through...

253
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,460
The Punishment Tube!

254
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

255
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,060
And, uh,

256
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,020
uh, uh, uh, see, it's fun, man.

257
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,840
It's a, it's a fun and cool thing.

258
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,740
But, uh, you know, yeah, we're, I mean,

259
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,940
obviously, we're talking about money tonight.

260
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,340
This is a money show,

261
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,580
an evil kind of subject.

262
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,000
But, yeah, it's a wondrous subject, isn't it?

263
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,240
We're talking big, big money.

264
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,600
But there, there is more to life than money,

265
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,840
isn't there?

266
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,380
Isn't there?

267
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,480
I mean, after all, as, as God Jr. said

268
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,940
in that one bestseller,

269
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,400
man does not live by bread alone.

270
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,960
He lives also, uh, well, by woman.

271
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,020
Woman.

272
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,500
Good.

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,200
But, indeed, also by spiritual upliftment.

274
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,440
As illustrated in this long, hate-filled rant

275
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,820
about work, which I'm about to read.

276
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
Uh, this rant by St. Palmer Vreedes

277
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
of the Dobbs Co.

278
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,700
Board of Directors.

279
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,260
A pleasant little rant here called

280
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
Working for a Living.

281
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,560
It's been quite a while since I did any work,

282
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,020
so my memories of this subject are rather dim.

283
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,160
All I can really recall is that I've always regarded

284
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,040
work with blind, cold hatred

285
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,480
from the time I was a small child.

286
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,400
I believed to the depths of my soul

287
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,480
that the world owes me a living,

288
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,020
and whenever I had the misfortune to find myself at a job

289
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,740
paperboy, short-order cook, heraldic researcher,

290
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,780
blimp pilot, movie star, hitman, televangelist, whatever,

291
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,280
I felt that a horrible joke was being played out on me,

292
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,420
an evil betrayal of cosmic proportion.

293
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,040
Inevitably, though, I would soon be fired,

294
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,480
or even better, let go by my eternal nemesis,

295
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,820
the boss,

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,260
and would find myself back once again

297
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,080
at my preferred occupation,

298
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,520
staring at a blank wall and drinking

299
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,380
endless cups of strong black coffee.

300
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,480
Actually,

301
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,380
the world could care less about any of us.

302
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,400
To our planet, we're beneath notice.

303
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,580
Mere microscopic blobs of protoplasm,

304
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,060
short-lived food tubes crawling around on its crust,

305
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,120
moving the dust back and forth.

306
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,360
The real trick is to convince other humans

307
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,120
that a living is owed you.

308
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,920
Once you get enough gullible suckers to accept this patent nonsense,

309
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,720
sit back and wait for the bucks to roll in.

310
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,480
If it works for organized religions, stock exchanges, and governments,

311
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,540
it should work for you.

312
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,920
No matter how absurd or illogical your scheme is,

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,320
there will always be at least

314
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
three hundred people that'll take it seriously enough

315
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,940
to send you all their money,

316
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,060
and even die for you if you so desire.

317
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,240
Don't believe me?

318
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,180
Then send a $1,000 check or money order made out to me,

319
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,080
Ivan Stang,

320
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,920
care of this show,

321
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,320
and get in on the ground floor of

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,960
my very own personal monetary self-improvement program,

323
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,300
Something for Nothing.

324
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,020
A most big-time financial transaction

325
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,260
is Gradierte Leira,

326
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,880
who just bought her glazed-down

327
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,580
'll importantes headset on sale by the

328
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:33,320
Wee getting

329
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,180
misery and ruin

330
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
to all.

331
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,560
How did I come by this civilized outlook?

332
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,820
Think about it.

333
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,780
We all get just so many hours in our brief lives and then we die.

334
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,300
What's an hour of your life worth?

335
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,760
How much do you get an hour anyway?

336
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,780
.003 cents?

337
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Minimum wage?

338
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,440
Five bucks? Ten? Fifty? Five thousand?

339
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,560
Whatever the amount,

340
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:09,060
it can never be enough to compensate for those irreplaceable minutes you spent doing something you never would have done at all

341
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:17,100
if some jackal hadn't taken advantage of your basic natural needs and bribed you with spurious promises of big pay.

342
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,100
Third world or first world, it's still the same con game.

343
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,700
In all actuality, most of your so-called desires are probably synthetically induced implants

344
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,540
produced using a vast spectrum of drugs.

345
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,140
The only way to get them is to use the same kind of brainwashing techniques

346
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,100
that you've been given by the very same pimps that hired you.

347
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,180
They're so skilled at this that you can even be aware of this subjugative mind control and not even care.

348
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,220
You might even like it.

349
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,700
If so, you're exactly where they want you.

350
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,680
On their leash, begging for treats.

351
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,420
Just be careful when they jerk your chain.

352
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,820
Sometimes your neck can snap.

353
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,540
And don't even expect your owners to give your family a chance to get you a job.

354
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,440
Or even a simple I'm sorry when they toss your broken body out into the street.

355
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,540
No need to go into the boredom, the harassment, the awful working conditions, the politics.

356
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,920
Those come with the territory.

357
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Oh sure, you need things.

358
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,280
Just like the station does, friends.

359
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,140
Sustenance, shelter, clothing, medicine, comic books.

360
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,440
You know, work or die just like any living creature with simple dignity.

361
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,100
Once these basic necessities are met, however,

362
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,780
how much more do you want?

363
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,280
How much more can you possibly consume?

364
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,160
As much as your net worth.

365
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,560
And then some.

366
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,660
Credit's easy to come by.

367
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,000
As long as you work.

368
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,920
Yes, the only true work of art may well be the art of work.

369
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,300
But never forget the one thing even a Type A top ape can't buy back with his wages.

370
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Time.

371
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,800
Dear friends, they can never replace the time they take from you.

372
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,980
You can't even listen to their lies.

373
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,760
No matter what your job is, if you wouldn't be doing it anyway without that paycheck spurring you on,

374
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,980
you're being extorted, cheated, robbed of your very life.

375
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,480
I tell you, the tiniest diseased amoeba that lives in the lowest intestinal tract

376
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,140
of the most miserable disgusting leech in the scummiest puddle in the world

377
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,720
will have more freedom than you without ever being conscious of it.

378
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,580
Tick.

379
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,540
Tick.

380
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,720
Tick.

381
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,060
Tick.

382
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,940
It's so easy.

383
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,900
Minute after minute.

384
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,300
Gone forever.

385
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:47,380
Some jobs are so disgusting that anyone attempting to take them on as a vocation deserves swift execution.

386
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:55,520
Military officers, politicians, real estate agents, stockbrokers, rock stars, most types of lawyers,

387
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,440
producers of those cute baby movies,

388
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:05,840
armaments manufacturers, stand-up comics, advertising executives, nuclear power engineers, and TV talk show hosts.

389
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,480
I'm sure you can add a few of your own favorite parasitic categories to this list without too much effort.

390
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,220
Not that there aren't legitimate types of work.

391
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,460
Hunters, gatherers, farmers, moon astronauts, and cartoonists, to name a few.

392
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,460
And radio show volunteer hosts.

393
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,420
The catalog is pretty short, but that's the true nature of work for you.

394
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,340
I'm reminded of the famous fable of the grasshopper and the ant.

395
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:42,260
You know, where it's summer or fall or something, and the grasshopper's kicking back, so to speak, in the weeds, drinking beer,

396
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:51,660
watching an ant dragging fragments of stale taco chips 900 times his own weight back to his hole in the dirt,

397
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,980
hoarding them for hard times.

398
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,420
This goes on for hours.

399
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:06,900
The ant only takes two 15-30 minute breaks and throws himself right back into his mindless toil when these brief rest periods end.

400
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:16,240
Finally, the sweaty ant notices his fellow insect having a good time goofing off and can't resist stopping by the grasshopper to give him attitude.

401
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:22,220
Like the busybody ants figured out a way to be both Catholic and Protestant at the same time.

402
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,400
The ants being a real cretin balancing this boulder of junk.

403
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:34,140
The ant's got some junk food on his back, going on and on about welfare bums and how he's been slaving all his life, being a productive member of bug society,

404
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,300
and how he'll be damned if he's gonna support lazy bums who haven't done anything better than sit on their green sternums,

405
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:48,640
rubbing their back legs together when all of a sudden, a huge shadow falls over both of them there by the side of the road.

406
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,240
It's a colossal imported running shoe coming down fast.

407
00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:03,900
The orthopterid fully rested books, springing away to safety while the exhausted ant, weighed down by his load, slowly tries to move out of the way.

408
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:13,800
The unaware jogger mashes the slow moving ant and the corn chip to an acidic paste and carries the bitter goo away, stuck to her rubber tread.

409
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:22,960
The grasshopper, not being one to ignore a free gift, moves into the dead ant's condo and lives off the stash until spring,

410
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,060
throwing big parties for his friends all winter long.

411
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,040
Anyway, that's the way I heard it. I'm not sure what the moral of this pithy little tale is.

412
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:38,600
It's too much work to figure it out. Don't expect me to do the hard part for you.

413
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,260
I didn't even write this piece. I hired a ghostwriter for a fraction of what I'm being paid for it to write it for me,

414
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,460
and my own personal ghost editor so that I don't have to read this drivel before turning it into the hour of slack.

415
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:52,940
I don't have to read this drivel before turning it into the hour of slack.

416
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,960
The only thing I personally have to do is sign the check, and I've got a rubber stamp for that.

417
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:03,140
All I know is, I'm not working, and you are.

418
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,000
Paul Mavridis, Tahiti, 1989

419
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,280
And then there's the payments due on the car.

420
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,840
Oh no.

421
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,720
Well, I'm just telling you, I sometimes wonder if it's worth it.

422
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,200
I mean, really, I wonder if it's worth even trying.

423
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,640
What am I killing myself for like this? What am I...

424
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,600
I don't know.

425
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Oh, if I had any brains.

426
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,100
It's a trouble.

427
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,660
I've got the brains, but I don't know, maybe it's my attitude.

428
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,880
It's wrong or something.

429
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,920
Nothing happens.

430
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,720
I figured I'd be...

431
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,880
something in the office by this time.

432
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,600
But everybody gets pushed up ahead of me.

433
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,260
And that proportion, and there's...

434
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,260
the wife, and the...

435
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,640
the kids...

436
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,220
the trouble...

437
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,820
the car...

438
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,440
Yeah, there's...

439
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
Yeah, there's...

440
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
I don't know.

441
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,200
Let's have another drink.

442
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,380
Forget the whole thing.

443
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,460
Oh, stop it! You're killing me!

444
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,340
See, it makes me feel much better...

445
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,720
just talking to you.

446
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,920
Anytime, baby, anytime.

447
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,720
Oh!

448
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,440
Well, I wish we could say the same.

449
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,080
Doesn't make us feel much better because we're not talking to you.

450
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,140
You're not talking to us. You're not talking back.

451
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,240
You're not giving us money.

452
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,700
No, we're not...

453
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,880
We're not getting the money.

454
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,820
We ain't getting the calls.

455
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,180
So far, we've made...

456
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,220
$30.

457
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,740
$30 and 30 minutes. Huh.

458
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,140
A dollar a minute.

459
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,480
That's how much slack is worth to you, huh?

460
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,360
Well, actually, that's not bad.

461
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,940
I'm used to paying a lot less than that, actually.

462
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:29,980
But one person was still ready to come into our stillborn, ruined place...

463
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,300
our station.

464
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,480
Call this place.

465
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,620
Actually, two.

466
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,280
Um...

467
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,800
But, uh...

468
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,640
32...

469
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes?

470
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,100
Bob still loves you.

471
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,620
I'm going to give the name of this...

472
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,940
this child of Bob...

473
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,480
the one pledger.

474
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,300
It looks like we're getting one other one over there.

475
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,100
Yes?

476
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,460
The same guy.

477
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,180
Same...

478
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,400
Still the same fella.

479
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,900
He's so incredibly vain that he's doubling it.

480
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,980
He's gonna double it?

481
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,660
He's heard the same ones and it wasn't good enough.

482
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,980
Oh, he hadn't heard it yet.

483
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,320
We haven't read it through the punishment tube yet.

484
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,040
Oh, the punishment tube.

485
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,780
Alright.

486
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,140
Okay.

487
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,600
I mean, this is how low we've had to stoop, dear friend.

488
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:21,540
And this guy still won't hear his name read over the punishment tube because he's talking to...

489
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,160
Oh, no.

490
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,900
He just hung up.

491
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,460
Alright.

492
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,140
Are you still listening?

493
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,720
No, no.

494
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,620
And the name of our hero is...

495
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,280
Robert Still.

496
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,320
Robert Still.

497
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,760
No, no.

498
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,940
And it's leaving...

499
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,600
Please.

500
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:44,880
Please.

501
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:44,880


502
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,020
This thing will stiff already.

503
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,240
Too bad.

504
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,540
It's sad, but true.

505
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,940
And friend, we can torture Willa Dobbs with the punishment cone.

506
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,620
If you will just call in.

507
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,120
And we'll hurt Reverend Trickster Shimon here, too.

508
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,220
If you will please just call in.

509
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,580
We desperately, desperately need pledges.

510
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,500
This is no joke.

511
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,740
Last week, I mean, we did this last week.

512
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,460
I figure some of you are listening, missed it last time.

513
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,440
You're listening this time.

514
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,420
Maybe you listened last time and laughed to yourself, thinking,

515
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,460
oh yeah, I'm just going to keep getting it for free.

516
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,560
Well, I don't blame you.

517
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,760
But how can you, how can you sleep?

518
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,380
Oh yeah, that was Ken Nordean.

519
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,780
And that's, that's how the conspiracies made me feel too, friends.

520
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,320
I don't know why I keep calling you friends.

521
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,360
I don't have any friends.

522
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,300
Nobody has any friends.

523
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,620
All we have are bosses and customers.

524
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,800
All the rest of it's bluff.

525
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,960
Pure bluff.

526
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,500
It's like on that Fireside Theater record.

527
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We're all just faking being interested in each other as human beings.

528
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,920
All we're interested in is finding people we can hate for making less money than us.

529
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,340
Because we already hate those that make more money than us,

530
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,920
but at least we feel like they're justified.

531
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,680
The other day I read about this guard that was driving a money truck,

532
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,300
one of those big armored trucks loaded with money.

533
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,620
And he had to put on the, this is a true story,

534
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,360
he had to put on the brakes real fast.

535
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,760
And this giant sack of quarters, $25,000 in quarters,

536
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,960
bust loose when he put on the brakes and slammed against him

537
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,360
and crashed.

538
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,360


539
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,580
Crushed him to death.

540
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,100
Crushed under quarters.

541
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,580
Slack friends.

542
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,100
Friends.

543
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,000
That guy got them.

544
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
Not as close to slack as any of us are going to get.

545
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,220
God's got to know where I can't even hate the conspiracy anymore.

546
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,380
At least they make money.

547
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,800
I can hate myself.

548
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,200
My money ran out and I haven't gotten any more yet.

549
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,020
Since I can't make any money when I hate myself this much,

550
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,980
I guess that means I'm out of money for good, huh?

551
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,360
The only thing that could make me laugh,

552
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:09,960
like myself,

553
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,820
would be money.

554
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,400
That doesn't mean I'll like you if you have money.

555
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,440
I'll hate you even more,

556
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,760
but at least I'll respect you.

557
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,380
Because I knew you could bluff better than I could.

558
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,900
So you can call 823-7490

559
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,840
and let the Willa Dobbs bluff you.

560
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,960
You can bluff the Willa Dobbs.

561
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,560
I don't care.

562
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,620
I don't care.

Remember, if you don't support this show,

573
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,420
two weeks from now, you could be listening to a brand new show.

574
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:18,020
Dial 823-7490, make your pledge, and make it count.

575
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,520
Listen to this.

576
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
God has told me.

577
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Now, friends, I'm the person you're hearing talking here.

578
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,860
I'm Reverend Stang.

579
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,160
Now, you may say, this man doesn't sound religious.

580
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,560
What kind of a pope or preacher swears and drinks on camera

581
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,120
while he's asking for pledges?

582
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
I'll tell you what kind, friends.

583
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:56,900
A priest.

584
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:56,900


585
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,640
A subgenius preacher does.

586
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,220
And I want $10,000 pledges.

587
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,860
We are not fooling around here.

588
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:09,520
I mean, the transmitter, these tape decks, these tapes, these people,

589
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,780
these things cost.

590
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,180
And so don't call in with these little teeny weeny pledges.

591
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,520
Now, that $10,000 that we've got so far, we know how to spend it.

592
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,140
We'll spend it on fancy clothes and air-conditioned dog houses.

593
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,400
You don't want to see your preacher, Reverend Ivan Stang,

594
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,840
preaching in tennis shoes.

595
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,380
Do you?

596
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,140
You want to see me in a snake-skin suit?

597
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,300
Because you don't want a stupid preacher.

598
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,720
You don't want a preacher that doesn't abuse your money.

599
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,520
You want one who abuses it, smart enough to abuse it,

600
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,960
but honest enough to tell you.

601
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,620
And I need that air-conditioned dog house, my friends,

602
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,780
because my own house isn't air-conditioned.

603
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,220
I mean, I'd set up my office in that dog house.

604
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,720
The hour of slack original tapes wouldn't melt in the heat anymore.

605
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,900
And I'd still share...

606
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,720
I'd still share that dog house with my dog friends.

607
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,520
That's the difference between a subgenius preacher and one of these more famous-like preachers.

608
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,900
So I want you to get on there and call that 823-7490.

609
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,240
The calls are beginning to come in.

610
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,400
But you...

611
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,540
And the children's home in Manila is gonna go...

612
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,400
The children's...

613
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,800
The home for slackless children, that thing's gonna go down unless we have your money.

614
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,440
So you have been challenged.

615
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,300
You've got to meet this pledge.

616
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,780
And I know that you will because miracles are happening.

617
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,280
And all over Dallas, friends, miracles are happening.

618
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,680
I mean, here's one miracle.

619
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,360
I want to reach out especially to the sisters of Connie out there.

620
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,260
It's time that you all got on the stick, you know what I mean?

621
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah, gotta have slack.

622
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,360
Gotta.

623
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,120
You gotta have...

624
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,680
Gotta have slack, friends.

625
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,840
Yeah.

626
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,960
I got a big old bob.

627
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,740
I got a big old bob.

628
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,820
He's right inside my pocket.

629
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,640
Got my big old bob.

630
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,720
Just reach inside my pocket.

631
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,560
I just washed him off.

632
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,820
He ain't too stinky this time.

633
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,220
You got to try my bob.

634
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,700
He really wants to meet you.

635
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,840
He's got a big old bob.

636
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:28,840


637
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,960
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

638
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

639
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,100
Boom, boom.

640
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,000
Hi, this is Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo.

641
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,060
Give every cent you got to KNON at least tithe 10%.

642
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:53,580
If not, all worldly goods, my friend, could mean your very soul.

643
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,160
Your very soul.

644
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,580
he speaks the truth

645
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,780
and if you believe that you'll believe anything

646
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,500
and that's what we want you to do

647
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,860
we want you to believe the bible

648
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,540
we want you to believe marvel comics

649
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,300
we want you to believe Pee Wee Harmon

650
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,220
cheapness friends

651
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,240
cheapness counts

652
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,140
it's the only hope for many of us

653
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,660
and this footage you're seeing from Slackville

654
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,520
Celebration shows the drawing

655
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,940
power that Bob can have

656
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,120
now we've got to get that

657
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,820
Slack TV network on 24 hours a day

658
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,660
7 days a week

659
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,160
it's going to be all violence and sex

660
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,300
dear friends except when we're raising money

661
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,160
because

662
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,900
we love you and we love your children

663
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,460
and we want to take your children

664
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,660
and teach them how to fight the good fight

665
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,560
and how to work in our factories

666
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,940
and to bring Slack to themselves

667
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,220
and kids I want you to go to your parents

668
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,640
purses and wallets right now

669
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,280
and pull out whatever you can and send that money to us

670
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,580
because it's a miracle

671
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,840
it's a miracle friends

672
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,500
looky here here's a letter from somebody

673
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,400
he says

674
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
I am a fan

675
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,600
and I don't mind if the preacher drinks beer on camera

676
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,500
when the fundraiser began I had a hangover and a headache

677
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:04,980
he says

678
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,020
but I took Maalox, Aspirin and I watched the pledge drive

679
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,060
and slept half a day

680
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,820
when I woke up the headache friends was gone

681
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,920
hallelujah friends the headache was gone

682
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,260
what more proof do you need

683
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,180
but others call in and they go what is this

684
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,940
what is this thing

685
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,200
what are you trying to prove is this supposed to be

686
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,560
comedy

687
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
hell I heard this whole rant in Chicago

688
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,140
Pope Floris wrote half of this rant

689
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,660
but friends Bob wants

690
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,580
he doesn't just want us to be rich

691
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,600
he actually wants you to be rich

692
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,700
but rich without working

693
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,280
because this is the church for abnormals

694
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,100
the church for non-joiners

695
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,500
so it's hard to get people to join

696
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,580
it ain't a joke friends

697
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,740
you sometimes you're wondering

698
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,920
what is it

699
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,140
what is this thing

700
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,920
well well it ain't collaborative

701
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,420
it's not collaborative art

702
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,120
no it's not subversive either

703
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,360
and it's not just a bunch of drunk guys

704
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,200
nay nay

705
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,660
you'll pay

706
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,100
you will pay

707
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,360
and then friends

708
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
then at that moment

709
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,280
you will know

710
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,300
what you really think

711
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,920
I was born in Dallas in 1952

712
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,660
the Harvey moved across the street on Beckley Avenue

713
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,540
I was born in Dallas in 1952

714
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,540


715
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,480
he used to throw the ball to me

716
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,540
when I was just a kid

717
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,580
they say he shot the president

718
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,320
I don't think he did

719
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,120
and Lee Harvey was a friend of mine

720
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:55,020
he used to take me fishing all the time

721
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,680
he used to throw the ball to me

722
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,880
when I was just a kid

723
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,900
they say he shot the president

724
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I don't think he did

725
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,180
say hallelujah

726
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,300
hallelujah

727
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400

794
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,620
great

795
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:29,660
and interesting

796
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,740
whenever I get the chance

797
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:48,360
and you can just tell me

798
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:56,960
and you can call 823-7490 to have your name read through the punishment tune.

799
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:07,380
But, you know, in the news lately we've been deluged with the approved government media's

800
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:11,280
gloating reports of the collapse of communist countries such as East Germany,

801
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,240
whose citizens have gotten their first taste of slack

802
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,260
and are hence going full goose loony with it,

803
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,820
running back and forth across the borders, mainly across,

804
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,520
and buying and buying the fruits of capitalism,

805
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,220
which are, after all, the things which make the trials of capitalism all so worthwhile.

806
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,940
And we have a special song to play as a salute to those ex-East Germans.

807
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,820
This one by an ex-East German herself,

808
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
now a rich Hollywood New Age kook who channels stupid alien entities.

809
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,140
Nina Hagen.

810
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,040
Nina Hagen.

811
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,120
êm

812
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,480
Well, it's a vik vik vik secret

813
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,220
Fam

814
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,880
No, no, no

815
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,960
And this dance except you I own

816
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,020
And one day

817
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,940
We'll be free

818
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,460
Just free

819
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,840
One day we'll be free

820
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,600
We will be free

821
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,540
One day

822
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,760
One day we'll be free

823
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,560
We will be free

824
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,780
One day

825
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,820
One day we'll be free

826
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,100
We will be free

827
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,280
While I'm a-lifin'

828
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,020
I'm not so close to start

829
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,640
Don't check the yellow auto

830
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,900
I say so by me alone

831
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,620
Well, get a cinder, Gary, mom

832
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,700
Get a new

833
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,760
It's gonna be a big disaster

834
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,820
It's gonna be World War No. 3

835
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,340
It's gonna be a war or something

836
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,240
I know it now already

837
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,100
We don't know already

838
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,680
Moscow's gonna be

839
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,080
It's gonna be

840
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,080


841
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:13,360
Fuck!

842
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:13,360


843
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,680
It's gonna be

844
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:27,740
Looks like Mr. Breshner

845
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
is planning on a funeral

846
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:32,880
ador

847
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,080
Hello!

848
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,300
Hello!

849
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,480
Don't be cute!

850
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,120
I won't make it

851
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,880
I don't make me come

852
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,020
Yeah, no kidding, baby.

853
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:55,800
Well, we're going to, oh, lest we forget, people who gave money during the week.

854
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:08,600
Thanks to Reverend St. Bob Rakotensky and the Swag.

855
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,380
Also in the news, angels storm hell.

856
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,440
Angels claiming to be sent from heaven stormed hell today in a mind-reeling display of blood and violence.

857
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:29,780
The band of guerrilla celestials attacked Satan's stronghold, bashing demons, sinners, lost souls, and other beings trapped in the blazing inferno.

858
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:36,800
We're getting pretty darn tired of hell existing, said one self-proclaimed angel, and we were determined to do something about it, by God.

859
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,580
So we came here and bopped some...

860
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,220
...some heads, smashed some devils, set some fires, and basically kicked some unholy posterior.

861
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,560
Maybe these sinners will get the message now.

862
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:51,100
Although some inhabitants of hell celebrated the attack, others were left distraught and confused.

863
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,940
Quote, the reason I was here to begin with is because I was doing what they're doing.

864
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:00,760
I don't get it. Now how do I get out of here? Do I bash some heads or what? Unquote.

865
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,120
Officer number one used a special agent to contact God regarding the recent invasion.

866
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,400
Hey.

867
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,080
I didn't send them, said God.

868
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,820
I don't act like that. My ways are different.

869
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,560
They may have stormed hell, but that's exactly where they are now, and I'm not taking the rap for this one.

870
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,340
They did what they did, not me.

871
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,640
I'm here, and they're there, thank goodness.

872
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,540
When asked what he planned to do about it, the Supreme Commander merely asked,

873
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,020
Where are you?

874
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,480
That news report from office number one.

875
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:36,920
A little magazine out of Austin, which you can get from...

876
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,520
...from...

877
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,000
...uh...

878
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,160
...1709 San Antonio Street in Austin, Texas.

879
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,540
Yes, office number one from San Antonio Street.

880
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,980
1709 San Antonio Street, Austin, Texas.

881
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,800
78701.

882
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,920
And we have two new names here to give out.

883
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,920
Shut up!

884
00:47:59,340 --> 00:47:59,960
Okay.

885
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:01,960
And that's...

886
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,820
...are two deer...

887
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,180
How deer are they?

888
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,440
Well, one's real deer, one's about half deer.

889
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,020
Uh...

890
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,080
Sort of a goat, you might say.

891
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:18,960
Dear friends, praise be, and let there be slack for...

892
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,120
Scott Miller.

893
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,920
And...

894
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,000
Mark Clarkson.

895
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,560
Mark Clarkson.

896
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,340
Mark Clarkson, you sinned in life.

897
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,980
Now we are going to...

898
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:48,440
Scott Miller and Mark Clarkson, in life you sinned.

899
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:53,200
Now we are going to play the tape of all your sins.

900
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:00,200
And you must sit and watch and think how you could have earned true slack

901
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,180
by not sending money to K-N-O-N.

902
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,060
But you, in your infinite...

903
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,060
Infinite gullibility, decided instead to send the money.

904
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,780
Oh, abandoned hope, all ye who enter here.

905
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,840
Can I not send money now?

906
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,400
Oh, yeah.

907
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,520
Too late to not...

908
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,280
Now they start saying, well, can I not send money now, Lord?

909
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,120
Oh, well, uh...

910
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,120
Well, what should I do now?

911
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,160

914
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,620
There's Zug's Rift and Greater Than One that I played before.

915
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,120

You can top the night.

1023
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:12,020
away our hard-earned slack. True, for many the city is not worth saving. So why does he do it?

1024
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:22,620
Because no one else can. Or can they? Can you be like Bob? Can you be like Bob? He gave us a signal.

1025
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:31,080
Delivering slacked the slackless and meeting out our special brand of sub-justice to those conspiracy

1026
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:40,680
mediocratons and cheapskate non-pledgers. Those intent on subverting all the liberties that America

1027
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:50,100
and KNON stand for. Eh? Yes, it's true. On this very night you can don the pipe and special

1028
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,220
ketchup-proof suit and become

1029
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:02,600
Bob. You can fight crime just like your hero and mine. Have you ever danced with the devil in the

1030
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:09,620
pale moonlight, my friends? And there's a lot of crime to fight. The crimes against

1031
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:19,860
mindless human ears. The criminal acts of radio abuse, such as the pre-programmed,

1032
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,240
canned, overplayed,

1033
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:29,380
tap rock of repetitious, narrowly marketed, fashion-enslaved copycat, quote,

1034
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:36,360
new music, unquote, masquerading as alternative or quote, progressive radio.

1035
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:51,340
Yes, dear friends, and uh, I believe we played the tail end of that, uh, head rant last week?

1036
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,560
Okay.

1037
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,700
We have to leave now.

1038
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,140
The American Music Party is coming in

1039
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:05,460
to give your ears a rest from the horror of slack.

1040
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,000
Funny how slack can be horrible.

1041
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,540
Yeah, funny.

1042
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,040
Yeah, real funny.

1043
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:18,540
Well, friends, we thank those of you who pledged in,

1044
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,740
and especially our very last pledger that we got tonight.

1045
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:30,900
O.S. Cecilia, get well soon.

1046
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,900
And it's worked.

1047
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,300
Yes, you may sit back and relax, friends.

1048
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,820
We managed to do it.

1049
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,860
Did we not, Will?

1050
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,920
Reverend Trickster, we've got...

1051
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,080
I believe we made our goal,

1052
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:09,560
our little measly goal of $700,000

1053
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,820
thanks to your...

1054
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,660
No?

1055
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,280
No? Yes, no?

1056
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,440
Just barely.

1057
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,480
Just barely.

1058
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,560
Well, I...

1059
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,160
The...

1060
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,380
I, the Martyr Stang,

1061
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,420
will make up the...

1062
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,400
No, I won't.

1063
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:25,860
I'm lying.

1064
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,800
You better believe I'm lying.

1065
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,740
Okay, because you think you...

1066
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,280
You've got religion here today.

1067
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,700
But you don't need Bob, right?

1068
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,460
I don't need God.

1069
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,880
You now take control of your life.

1070
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,480
Oh, yeah.

1071
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,460
Oh, oh, oh.

1072
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,480
Video, hit news, buzz, audio,

1073
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,340
and videos,

1074
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:59,720
You can't...

1075
01:01:59,720 --> 01:01:59,720


1076
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,140
You can't...

1077
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,140
You can't...

1078
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:05,600
You can't...

1079
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,440
You can't...

1080
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:07,740
You can't...

1081
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:07,780
You can't...

1082
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:07,780


1083
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:07,780


1084
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:07,780


1085
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:07,780


1086
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:07,780


1087
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:07,780


1088
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:13,560
How do we win this game?

1089
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,660
You can ask them to open it, you know?

1090
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,420
You can ask them to open it, you know?
