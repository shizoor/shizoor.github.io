1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
So, Bob, what religion are you converting to now?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,360
The subgenius.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,920
The all-power-less genius of the subgenius.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,380
Bob, Bob.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,180
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,040
Ah, yes, dear friends.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,760
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1041,

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,740
which is going to be a cheat,

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,980
because I'm going to play a 20-year-old rerun

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,960
from 1986 of Hour of Slack number 83.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,720
And it was recorded at the KNON station in Dallas,

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,680
which later kicked us off the air for not being something enough.

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,840
And anyway, it's a wonderful show, though.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,300
The theme of this one was creationism.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
And something about it makes it seem perverse.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,880
Perfectly fresh today, as if it were recorded just this very morning in the year of 2006.

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,920
Oh, this background music is by The Cosmix.

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,780
The Cosmix.

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,240
The Cosmix.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,600
The Cosmix.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,080
Your mind is so vividly red,

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,200
and become pure,

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,960
and become pure,

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,680
and become pure,

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,220
and it gives itself in complete serenity

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,900
to a positive new pattern

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,580
of perfect happiness and restoration.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,740
Day by day, you will become more and more relaxed.

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,960
Each day, you will experience a new delightful sense of quiet peace

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,180
and perfect contentment.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,960
This is the Cosmix.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,860
This enjoyable sensation will launch you into a quiet sea of heavenly peace and harmony,

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,460
where you will float in a pleasant rhythm.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,440
This is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,620
here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas.

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,680
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

37
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,140
And, uh, friends, this is one to keep those headphones on,

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,420
keep those tape decks recording and bootlegging,

39
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,180
because this show, this particular one, is going to be filled with music.

40
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,840
Of all kinds.

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,880
You'll see this right now is a great new Subgenius,

42
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,820
Zug's Rift.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,520
And you can actually find this one at the record store.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,280
Strangely enough, almost everything else here played tonight on the Hour of Slack.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,380
Sponsored by CanaLena, the church of the Subgenius.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,820
Uh, these aren't things that you can buy in the stores, generally.

47
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,620
Oh.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,440
But you can call the Willa Dobbs here

49
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,160
at 823-

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,900
9-0-

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,840
828-

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,400
9-0-

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,920
9-0-

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
And find out where to find out that information,

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
because we can't tell you tonight,

56
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,820
but, uh, you can write the post office box.

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,060
It comes at the end of the broadcast.

58
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,580
And, dear friends, oh, yeah.

59
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,160
Happiness is security.

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,000
We pray and gloriously alive with a firm conviction

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
that each day will bring forth

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,100
a definite change for the better within you.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,500
Yeah, well, that's what they all say.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,560
And in all of your affairs.

65
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,980
But I've got this great new theme music.

66
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,800
Actually, we've used...

67
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,000
used this...

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,900
this stuff before a long time ago.

69
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,380
Some of y'all might remember this.

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,900
We have no idea where it comes from,

71
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,440
but I think you'll agree that this is the perfect opening music

72
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,600
for the hour of Slack.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,680
You know that it is showtime

74
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,640
And it is your time

75
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,100
And the show must go on, baby

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,020
Come with me and you will see

77
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,800
We are stepping high

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,720
What is the name of our show?

79
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,780
Stepping high, stepping high, high, high

80
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,720
Now, boys and girls

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's see if we can dance

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,420
To the rhythm of stepping high

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,400
If you are ready

84
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
Let's go and dance

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,300
Let's do that time step and dance

86
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,060
Dance to the music of stepping high

87
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,000
Stepping high

88
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,940
High in the sky

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,880
We will dance

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,840
We will sing to please you

91
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,800
You are stepping high, high, baby

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,840
But don't forget that I am here

93
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,380
Yes, dear friends, that man is driven by Bob Dobbs.

94
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,260
He's gotta be.

95
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,980
He's gotta be.

96
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,640
This is Ken Nordean.

97
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,560
Sometimes I wonder if I know where I'm going.

98
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,300
I go for a walk like this.

99
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,780
It's a little bit of a struggle.

100
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,140
And it seems I have been walking for years and years and years.

101
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,680
And I don't know where I'm going.

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,420
I hear the sound leading me on.

103
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,900
And I don't know where it is taking me.

104
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,220
I see people rushing some place.

105
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,360
They seem to know where they're going.

106
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,100
And they're getting there in such a hurry.

107
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,500
But where am I going?

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,260
You know where you're going.

109
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,000
Maybe you could tell me.

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,780
And then I could go along with you.

111
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,040
What's the matter with you, bud?

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,700
You in a fog?

113
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,600
Sorry.

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,640
Why the hell are you following me on the emailed map again?

116
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,120
Oh, I could tell you what I was doing earlier.

117
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,720
You was sleeping over there.

118
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:36,720


119
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,820
Oh, no!

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry!

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000


129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,040
So I don't know if I know where I am, but I think that just fine.

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,340
I have no idea.

131
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,040
I think that you're probably getting healthier.

132
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,100
I know you're always worried.

133
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,960
Yes, I totally am.

134
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,180
And maybe there's a couple times I'll have to hurt you into zigzags for a day,

135
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,120
You hear?

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,660
The sound is getting louder.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,080
Yes.

138
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,380
But it's getting blacker.

139
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,160
And blacker.

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,080
And blacker.

141
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,880
And blacker.

142
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,060
Help!

143
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,060
Help!

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,320
Help!

145
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,380
Help!

146
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,100
Help!

147
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,240
Help!

148
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,400
When you're lost, you're not new.

149
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,380
You may be rich, a big business man with a big company,

150
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,040
and everyone kowtows to you when you come around,

151
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,920
but when you're lost, you're a nobody.

152
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,860
You're just a lost person, that's all.

153
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,040
And unless and until someone or something gets you straightened around

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,160
so that you know you're not alone,

155
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,940
you just don't amount to very much.

156
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,100
You're not worth anything to yourself,

157
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,400
and you're not worth anything to anybody else.

158
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,340
Tonight's podcasting is powered by the Northern Venus.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Tonight's podcasting is powered by the Northern Venus.

160
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,620
Tonight's podcasting is powered by the Northern Venus.

161
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,080
And and.

162
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:50,760
Britain, there is none righteous, no not one.

163
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,120
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,220
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable.

165
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,300
There is none that doeth good, no not one.

166
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,760
Verse 14, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood.

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,180
Destruction and misery are in their way, and the way of peace have they not known.

168
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,740
There is no fear of God before their eyes.

169
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,920
These verses, whether we admit it or not, are a description of all of us before we came

170
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,100
to the knowledge of God.

171
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,880
The word of the Lord Jesus Christ, and these are for all of us.

172
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,560
And when Paul wrote here to the Colossians, he was saying to them, that's your past.

173
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,960
He said in verse 21, and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked

174
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:48,060
works, yet now have be reconciled and we were all alienated in our minds by wicked works.

175
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,660
That's our past.

176
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,980
That was their past.

177
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,620
And that's our past tonight.

178
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,720
That's the past.

179
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,080
But the second thing.

180
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,160
The second thing we see is the present.

181
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,500
We must endeavor to permeate every facet of American society.

182
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,700
It got crowded in the closet so we're finally coming out.

183
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,060
We're finally coming out.

184
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,060


185
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,060


186
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,140
We're thumping on our Bibles and building up our clout.

187
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,980
We're all the Lord's lieutenants and there's nothing we can't do to prove it.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,920
We're now making our political debut.

189
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,280
Oh, we're the moral majority.

190
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,620
We're holier than thou.

191
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,960
By God we're here to tell you what we will and won't allow.

192
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,640
We're out to purge the nation of its humanistic bent.

193
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,840
A separate church and state.

194
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,040
We're out to purge the nation of its humanistic bent.

195
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
We've simply given up for less.

196
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,740
Don't get us wrong.

197
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,740
We still believe that prayers will save our souls.

198
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,120
But when we want them answered, we'll say them apropos.

199
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
And talk about successes.

200
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,520
We're as pleased as we can be.

201
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
We've sent Jimmy back to Georgia.

202
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,960
We've moved Bonzo to D.C.

203
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,700
We socked it to McGovern and to Culver Church and Pye.

204
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,140
We'll stack them up like cordwood.

205
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,020
Cause God wants to see us.

206
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


207
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


208
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


209
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


210
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


211
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


212
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


213
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


214
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,020


215
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,040
God's life is on our side.

216
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,020
And that was just a preview of 1982.

217
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,860
What we've got planned sure to put the fear of God in you.

218
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,380
Cause we're the moral majority.

219
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,540
You'd better mend your ways.

220
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,140
When we get done with liberals we're going after gays.

221
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,300
And once they see the light, we'll have to concentrate on Jews.

222
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,860
But what with all these commies?

223
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,880
It'll be so hard to choose.

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,000
And maybe you don't get it.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000


226
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000


227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000


228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000


229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000


230
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,120
I want to talk to you about heaven.

231
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,940
You know, some of us are going to get there, and some of us are going to get there rich.

232
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,960
But no one's going anywhere on a skimpy budget.

233
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:16,120
You are my sheep, and as your shepherd, I want to please increase your odds for salvation.

234
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,420
As the good book says in Philodendron 713, you ain't going to get nothing for nothing.

235
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,540
It takes money to run this church, the TV programs, and my Cadillac.

236
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,600
You have any idea what just one of these little pinky rings cost me?

237
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,940
We never seem to get good press. It's always filthy lies.

238
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
Why, you can call my wife right now. I never proselytize.

239
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,960
And if we burn a book or two, it's because they're so obscene.

240
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,760
And heading up our list right now is Penthouse Magazine.

241
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,240
Because we're the moral majority.

242
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,560
We're launching our attack.

243
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,040
We'll ride the train to glory, because we've got the inside track.

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,360
We've got the goods on ERA, so two has got to go.

245
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,380
There never was the slightest doubt the Bible tells us so.

246
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,020
I don't care if it rains or rains.

247
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,460
Just keep looking in your windows, looking under your bed.

248
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,520
You're searching in your closet, so the wire's up to your head.

249
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,120
You're checking out your urine, you're checking it twice.

250
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,360
So there ain't no doubt.

251
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:06,520
We'll see you next time.

252
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,600
We'll see you next time.

253
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,540
We'll see you next time.

254
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,340
We'll see you next time.

255
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,720
We'll see you next time.

256
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,640
We'll see you next time.

257
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,720
We'll see you next time.

258
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,740
We'll see you next time.

259
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,980
We'll see you next time.

260
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,240
We'll see you next time.

261
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,020
We'll see you next time.

262
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,380
We'll see you next time.

263
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,240
We'll see you next time.

264
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,900
We'll see you next time.

265
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,020
We'll see you next time.

266
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,120
We'll see you next time.

267
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,360
of the greenhouse effect.

268
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,020
I don't think any of us looks forward

269
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,100
to people being executed.

270
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,580
I wish there never had to be one.

271
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,740
Remember Ballad of the Green Berets?

272
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,060
This is by Pink Bob.

273
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,800
Pink Bob, he calls himself.

274
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,840
Finding soldiers from the sky

275
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,760
Fearless men who jump and die

276
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,160
Men who mean just what they say

277
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,640
The brave men of the Green Beret

278
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,620
Silver wings upon their chests

279
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,620
These are men, America's best

280
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,300
One hundred men we'll test today

281
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,460
But only three win the Green Beret

282
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,480
Trained to live off nature's land

283
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,320
Trained in combat

284
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,400
Hand to hand

285
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,460
Men who fight

286
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,720
By night and day

287
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,320
Courage beat

288
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,220
From the Green Beret

289
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,260
Silver wings upon their chests

290
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,140
These are men, America's best

291
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,940
One hundred men we'll test today

292
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,060
But only three win the Green Beret

293
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,260
Back at home, a young white place

294
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,980
Her Green Beret has met his fate

295
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,940
He has died for those oppressed

296
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,700
Leaving her this last request

297
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,780
He has died for those oppressed

298
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:03,780


299
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:03,780


300
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:03,780


301
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,460
He's dead for those oppressed

302
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,960
But Silver Wings on my son's chest

303
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,740
But Silver Wings on my son's chest

304
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,900
Make him one of America's best

305
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:14,960
Make him one of America's best

306
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,380
Make him one of America's best

307
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,980
He'll be a man

308
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,900
He'll pass one day

309
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,700
And he'll win the Green Beret

310
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,720
And he'll win the Green Beret

311
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,820
Cha-cha-cha

312
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:31,900
Cha-cha-cha

313
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,000
Cha-cha-cha

314
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Cha-cha-cha

315
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,400
Would you like to be drafted?

316
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,940
I wouldn't mind. I plan on serving in the service anyway.

317
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,920
Well, you could probably handle a rifle or carry one of those automatic rifles very well.

318
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,540
How much do you weigh?

319
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,520
About 125.

320
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,340
You'll gain a little weight and probably make a fine soldier.

321
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,400
Actually, there's nothing wrong with women serving in the armed forces.

322
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,560
The women of many nations have fought alongside their men.

323
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,540
Nigeria, for example.

324
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,500
Well, I don't know.

325
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:08,020
I think that even if you're not big enough to carry a rifle and fight,

326
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
you could serve in desk jobs.

327
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,400
It takes up the men's time that they could be fighting.

328
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,580
Did you help celebrate the women's lib movement here in Dallas recently?

329
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,800
No, sir, I didn't, because the women that want to be liberated don't want to be drafted.

330
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,060
Well, I've seen a few of these women who want to be liberated,

331
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,980
and I guarantee you that they have their problems there.

332
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,060
It will take a national movement for a man to get close to them.

333
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,160
I may say that.

334
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,660
It's going to take something.

335
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,300
Really?

336
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,900
It is.

337
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,960
All right.

338
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,040
Thank you very much, sweetheart.

339
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,900
Yes, sir.

340
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,140
Bye.

341
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,020
Have you seen my girlfriend?

342
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,380
She lives in a pig pen.

343
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
Have you seen my girlfriend?

344
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,780
I can't seem to find her.

345
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,000
Perhaps she is hiding underneath a plate of grass.

346
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,060
Let's take a look at her.

347
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,220
Let's take a look at her.

348
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,480
Let's take a look at her.

349
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:11,720
Let's take a look at her.

350
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:12,980
Let's take a look at her.

351
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:12,980


352
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:12,980


353
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:12,980


354
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:12,980


355
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,560
His wife was a spent piece of used jet trash.

356
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,600
She made good Bloody Marys, kept her mouth shut most of the time.

357
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,460
A little chihuahua named Carlos that had some kind of skin disease

358
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,440
and was totally blind.

359
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,760
They had a thoroughly modern kitchen,

360
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,460
self-cleaning oven the whole bit.

361
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,660
Frank drove a little sedan.

362
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,840
They were so happy.

363
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,280
We've encountered so much hassle from the police.

364
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,020
Attention, Earth people.

365
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,520

367
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,540
Beware, Earth people.

368
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,040
Beware.

369
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,620
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Music

on

speakers tonight so

407
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,420
I had to.

408
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,760
I never forget.

409
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,740
Better than me.

410
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,080
Yesterday, a blind cat's assaulting a blind electrical engineer who was arrested on a

411
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,460
four-counted attempted murder and illegal possession of a gun.

412
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,180
Take a letter.

413
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,960
Take a letter.

414
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,520
Take a letter.

415
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,760
Take a letter.

416
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:58,760


417
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,600
Take a letter.

418
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
Take a letter.

419
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,340
Take a letter.

420
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,740
Take a letter.

421
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,680
Take a letter.

422
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,260
Take a letter.

423
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,260


424
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,260


425
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:29,800
Hi.

426
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,920
Take a round.

427
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,020
Take a round.

428
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,940
Take a round.

429
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,180
Take a round.

430
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:41,140
Take it home, boys.

431
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:12,420
Oh, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Don Truby you're listening to off his post-hip

432
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,040
Gnosis album.

433
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,660
And while I'm at it, I ought to, well, no, I'll get to that later.

434
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,100
This song won't last long enough for me to get to it now.

435
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,520
So we'll just go straight to the guest testimonial here, testimonial from a dear friend.

436
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,640
Around this time, a kindly reverend came along.

437
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,720
He asked me if I knew Bob as my personal savior.

438
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,280
Of course, I recoiled at such a thing.

439
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,260
Oh, no, I said, I gave at the office.

440
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,740
Well, he patiently told me he knew of my inner turmoil.

441
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,660
He gave me a phone number, just a phone number.

442
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,100
Counselors will be available day and night, he told me.

443
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,260
I prepared to toss it away.

444
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,820
After all, I could make it on my own.

445
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,220
I didn't need Bob.

446
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,240
But having the number begin to pull at me,

447
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,460
I, one lonely night, went over to the computer and with shaky fingers,

448
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,920
dialed the number of Bulldada BBS.

449
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,340
Somehow, I made it to the subgenius files.

450
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,400
Reading through them, I knew I had arrived home.

451
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,660
They were talking about me.

452
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,720
I just had to join.

453
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,500
I knelt down and said in a loud cry,

454
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,260
Oh, Bob, I know now!

455
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,240
A heavenly sound tinkled in my ears.

456
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,220
The sound of being logged in.

457
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,360
I moved off for no more time.

458
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,880
Since then, the going has been rough.

459
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,580
All my friends look at me with the evil eye.

460
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,320
Look as they quickly cover themselves with wolfbane to arm themselves against me.

461
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:51,880
And horror of horrors, I have lost my access to that wonderful Christian BBS, The Ark.

462
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,480
But I am happy in the knowledge of I now know it all.

463
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,180
And Bob is responsible.

464
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,080
Bob is so neat, because I tell him,

465
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,040
what his will is, and he lets me do it.

466
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,200
And if I want something, I just put in an order with him.

467
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,800
Oh, thank you, dear Reverend Frank.

468
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,380
Now friends, I gotta talk to you.

469
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,400
This is the swinging love corpses running in the background here.

470
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,020
And I need to, I need to...

471
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,580
Bray, this is a project I'm working on, personally.

472
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,500
But I need help. I need the help from y'all.

473
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,940
And that's help with drugs, dear friends. I need help with drugs.

474
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:44,360
Drugs are of interest to some of our Slack listeners, I think, for four different kinds of reasons.

475
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,380
I hope this next music coming up here is okay.

476
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,860
One reason is, of course, a lot of subgeniuses just plain like to get high,

477
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,620
and those are the hedonites, you know, the hedonistic type subgeniuses.

478
00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,000
The second group are people with a sincere interest in altered states,

479
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,120
the kind of misto-scientific interest.

480
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,560
The third group is people who probably almost got killed,

481
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,740
or at any rate got in terrible trouble with drugs and want to prevent it happening to others.

482
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,840
And, of course, the fourth kind is the people who hate all drugs without really knowing what's going on.

483
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,640
Now, I want to put together a book. I just finished my second book, so this is for real.

484
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,500
I want to put together a book of collected bad trip anecdotes, dear friend.

485
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,720
In your own words, or your friend's own words.

486
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,020
I guess the only logical name for a book like this would be Bummer.

487
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,200
But it'd be a collection of bummer tales, folks.

488
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,960
And I want you to start sending those in.

489
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,100
I'm going to mention this every now and then on the Hour of Slack.

490
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,760
Because it's a socially redeemable sort of cause.

491
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,940
In other words, for the youth of America,

492
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,200
who are...

493
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,960
might be considering a heavy psychedelic dose,

494
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,320
this is the kind of thing that just might make them go,

495
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,340
maybe I'll wait.

496
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,400
Maybe I'll wait until I'm about 50 or so.

497
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,080
And for those for whom it's just too late to be helped,

498
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,160
boy, it would be a barrel of laughs.

499
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,900
So, do send those in, too.

500
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,060
And I'm going to read this box number again at the end of the broadcast.

501
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,320
This is also where to write for information about any of the stuff we're playing.

502
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,860
And that's right to Bob.

503
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,220
Either Will or I'll probably actually open the envelope.

504
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,120
But you never know.

505
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,680
You never know.

506
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,380
That's Bob at P.O. Box...

507
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:43,260
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

508
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,220
Once again, that's P.O. Box...

509
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:52,000
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

510
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,520
And friends, even though this show you're listening to,

511
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,200
is from 1986, that deal is still on.

512
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,500
The reason I'm running an ancient rerun is because we're working on our fifth book,

513
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,040
The Bobliographon, a subgenius cyclopedia of slack.

514
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,560
And it's kind of a tight deadline.

515
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,680
Anyway, after that, why not?

516
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,160
We got a lot of great stuff for the original Bummers project,

517
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,420
which then never flew,

518
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,600
although I did give some of the material to Paul Krasnick,

519
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,820
listener for his book about similar things.

520
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,580
And friends, so yes,

521
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,140
you can check out our current modern day information at www.subgenius.com

522
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,700
or email stang at subgenius.com.

523
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,540
Thank you.

524
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,160
Thank you.

525
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,120
body aches

526
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,320
Bumper

527
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,880
That's the Bumper.

528
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,220
Bumper

529
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,720
I don't know.

530
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,780
I don't know.

531
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:37,140
I don't know.

532
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,320
I don't know.

533
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,560
I don't know.

534
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,060
We're going to nail these guys, let me tell you.

535
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,440
I think so.

536
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,280
We've got enough lawyers.

537
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,180
We've got enough money.

538
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:33,740
We've got time.

539
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,120
We've got press releases, I think.

540
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,700
That's right.

541
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,720
We have the sponsors.

542
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,040
The listeners are going to sponsor this.

543
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,900
Yes, we've got to keep the sponsors happy, PM.

544
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,480
Now, I've got a great new program in mind.

545
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,020
If you can just sit down in the conference room and we'll review it.

546
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,640
Okay, well, show it to us.

547
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,520
Plug it into the VCR here.

548
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,880
Yes, let's put it on the stand and see who testifies.

549
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,240
What to do if you are confronted with excessive show.

550
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,440
Okay, we can spin off.

551
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,320
We can have a spin off.

552
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:06,880
There's a lift.

553
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm not sure having a computer-generated Robbins there is a two-derivative.

554
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,580
Good afternoon, sir.

555
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,640
I am a Hound 1000 computer.

556
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm Chris.

557
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,080
I'm Chris.

558
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,020
One of the ICOs in those jobs for the design captain research teams is

559
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,340
my email address, Taylaieza.com.

560
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,340


561
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,340


562
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,440
Well, one.

563
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,160
They've always been kind to me and V féčo.

564
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,260
The give and take ties to us and say that we need to be kind

565
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,840
to these guys at V féčo.

566
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,280
We're very friends.

567
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,300
I'm noticed that about my name and somebody he's learned hence the

568
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,040
on raft business, and I wanted to get a job, because I'm the V féčo,

569
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,260
and I just want another job, because I want to be kind to them and

570
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,260


571
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,260

573
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:55,600
Part one.

574
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,200
Hello, this is Dr. Chris, and your turn to...

575
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:10,920
...cephalodically speaking, where I will try to educate the public on everything you've always wanted to know about prairie squids, but were afraid to ask.

576
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:24,580
Most people today, whether they are single, married, divorced, monogamous, gregarious, or even downright slutty, are unaware of the importance of the nearly instinct prairie squid.

577
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:31,460
This widespread ignorance is the cause of much dissatisfaction with regards to our slippery habits.

578
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:50,860
So, first you should know that the prairie squid is an intelligent, albeit wild, crazy, and unpredictable mollusk, possessed of a long, tubular body, two cardal fins, many suckers on its myriad tentacles, and highly developed eyes.

579
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,300
Or should I say eyes?

580
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,560
When the prairie squid is excited...

581
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:01,780
...such as in the instance of being engaged in the act of social intercourse, they emit a copious amount of black ink.

582
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:12,000
It is this ink that is used to enhance the sensations inherent in what the teenagers of today anachronistically call squidding.

583
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:20,520
It is sad to note that our friend, the prairie squid, is no longer an integral part of our modern relationships.

584
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,160
They have been shunned by the puritanical segment of society.

585
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,560
...and by the social media.

586
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,540
And have been herded into these so-called prairie squid reservations.

587
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:39,940
It is on these reservations that the prairie squid is harassed, abused, and what have you, by the neo-Nazi groups who even go so far as to lynch these creatures.

588
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:53,080
They become self-pitying, fourth-class citizen mollusks, suffering from such psychological problems as alcoholism, drug abuse, gambling, depression, and most tragically, suicide.

589
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,480
There is a hopeful future for the prairie squids, thanks to the efforts of the subgenius foundation.

590
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:09,680
They are establishing Save Our Prairie Squid centers all across the U.S. to combat the malicious neglect and prejudice against the prairie squid.

591
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:21,580
Food, shelter, and recreation programs utilizing purient, underground adult comic books are just the beginning for our struggle to reinstate the prairie squids...

592
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,060
...to the rightful home of the prairie squid.

593
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,160
And to the rightful place in the master bedrooms of the world.

594
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,640
But this requires money.

595
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,680
And the subgenius foundation's funds for the SOPS programs are dwindling to dangerous levels.

596
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:40,120
So please, would you find it in your heart to give to the Save Our Prairie Squid program?

597
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,800

00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,400
a zircon from Mount Naria in Australia that's 4 billion years old. Show them these fossilized

613
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,580
skeletons of proconsul Africanus from 18 million years ago that just turned up in Lake Victoria

614
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,120
and may really be the missing link, and they just say, fine, fine, just fine. Well, if

615
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,580
this creator could produce the heavens and the earth and the whole shebang in just six

616
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:12,440
days, well, he'd certainly be able to produce a really interesting history to go along with

617
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,300
it, now wouldn't he? They'll point to a billion-year-old pre-Cambrian rocks on top of Cretaceous shale

618
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,540
to disprove geological sequence and lump the whole thing into the flood, and God destroyed

619
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,720
the earth's inhabitants with water because of man's wickedness, and Noah only remained

620
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,740
alive and they that were with him in the ark. And the whole geological record goes down

621
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:39,580
into 40 days of rain. They go on and on about how we've been brainwashed by evolution theory,

622
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,380
but we can't produce the missing link. And then they jump on the Piltdown fraud and the

623
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,200
Nebraska man that turned out to be a pig stew. So the missing link is a fraud.

624
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,500
Evolution is all a fraud. Geology, astronomy, physics, all of it's a fraud. But there's

625
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,440
nothing in there about the fossil fragments of the Samburu hills where the stratus is

626
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,000
15 million years old. Nothing about those fossil bones and three million years of volcanic

627
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,160
ash up in the Afar triangle. Nothing about all those hominid fossils at that site in

628
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,900
the Gregory Rift. No, they wanted the missing link produced right now. And you know, the

629
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,180
whole time it was standing up there in front of them, braying about the powers of the universe,

630
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,420
the darkness. It's not my word is like into the fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer

631
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,220
that breaketh the rock. Well, yes, stupidity is like that. You put a hammer in its hand

632
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,940
and everything looks like a nail. It's the same thing you're up to out there on the television

633
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,140
channels. That video freak show telling the ignorant that this full gospel witnessing

634
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:43,200
is the only weapon we've got against the spread of Marxism, even under darkest Africa, fighting

635
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,680
those forces of evil that want to stop their glorious mission of spreading stupidity from

636
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,560
one end of the dark continent to the other. And I'm not talking about ignorance, friends.

637
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,920
I'm talking about stupidity. If you want ignorance, you can find it right there at that site on

638
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,680
Lake Rudolph, right up there in the Gregory Rift. Hominid fossils, stone tools, hippo

639
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,020
bones, all of it caught in a volcanic burst two or three million years ago. That was ignorance.

640
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,180
But that was also the dawn of intelligence. And what we have here and now is its eclipse.

641
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:17,340
Stupidity is the deliberate cultivation of ignorance. That's what we've got here. These

642
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,820
smug, born-again idiots with their pious smiles, they just can't stand the idea that

643
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,040
they're descended from that gang at Lake Rudolph banging around with their stone hammers trying

644
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,660
to learn something. No, no, they think God put them here in their cheap suits and their

645
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:36,800
bad neckties in his own image. Did you know that almost half the damn people in this country

646
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,240
believe that man was created about eight or 10,000 years ago, pretty much like he is today?

647
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,320
That's right. They believe that. All of this despite the fossil record going back billions

648
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,160
of years. And of course, the record is full of gaps, full of arguments as to how evolution

649
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,780
really happened. And so they use those to say that it never did happen. We have the

650
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:03,280
questions and they have all the answers. They dress up Genesis and call it science. They

651
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,820
go back from Malachi counting up all those begats and begats and begats, and the creation

652
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:15,360
took place on October 26, 4004 B.C. at 9 a.m. bingo. Now that's what they call the scientific

653
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,960
myth. Did anybody see it? No.

654
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,060
It's revealed. Yes, friends, it's revealed right here in the first couple of pages of

655
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:27,700
Genesis. It's what you call revealed wisdom. We talk about having business with the Bible.

656
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,600
Walk down any street and smack over Georgia, somebody you've never seen in your life comes

657
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,320
right up and asks you if you've been saved. It's any of his damn business. But he thinks

658
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:42,040
it is. The prevailing IQ in this country is about 100 or slightly lower. Great dogs talk

659
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,780
about Africa, the dark continent. This is the dark continent. And I'll tell you something.

660
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:54,140
This revelation, revelation is the last refuge ignorance finds for reason. Revealed truth

661
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,240
is the one weapon stupidity's got against intelligence. And that's what the whole damn

662
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,440
thing is all about. Look at that judge down in Georgia who said that until textbooks were

663
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,580
changed to the Christian ethic, there was no possibility that crime, violence, venereal

664
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,600
disease, and abortion rates would decrease. And what about those charming literary hit

665
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,020
squads right here in Texas?

666
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,620
Vigilant, in the world of the American

667
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:27,620


668
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,020
Money wins.

669
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,020


670
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,020


671
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,020


672
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,020


673
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,540
The practitioners don't care about what you understand in our minds. You don't have to

674
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,200
ask questions in front of a

675
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,340
man just like me.

676
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,600
Nothing do, weakness, arrogance.

677
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,600


678
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,600


679
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:38,760
Fake.

680
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:38,760


681
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:47,300
There's much ice in this town, a cloth, believe it. But the money can't keep you

682
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,760
states of the union where school boards cannot buy textbooks that have not been selected by the

683
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,460
state committee well you think texas want one that talks about land distribution in central america

684
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:03,860
or any place else you talk about censorship and they'll howl like stuck pigs no no no they don't

685
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:09,020
censor they let the publisher do it for them 60 70 million dollars a year that's what texas spends

686
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,700
on school books and with that kind of money the addition is so big it waits on anything else

687
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:26,760
oh dear friends that was uh the amazing and startling g gordon gordon uh you know i'm not

extinction of all existing life forms you haven't even tasted it yet what do you ask you know

696
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,920
how silly is like a psychic boomerang i can't believe this planet fried eggs

it is the code key it will activate the laser spectroscope when i use it tonight to bring down the other dark overlords the others now he's got a whole gang well screw him then he thought to himself our timing will be perfect the eggs will hatch at the exact moment we land no one in the shining world suspects what is about to happen not even doggone the rest will be history

699
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,840

00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,720
it's a horrible thing this show

702
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,140
yeah

703
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:28,040
if ignorant isn't bliss i don't know what it is

704
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,300
well maybe it's not bliss

705
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,820
it's easy

706
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,980
all over you will be awake soon okay

707
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:42,860
what we'd like to do now of course is remember the uh which uh a lot of people would miss

708
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,340
i'm not going to do that

709
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:48,640
and uh their bus plus bridge and into the island now i can comprehend now i genuinely understand

710
00:50:48,640 --> 00:51:07,080
but what's that button before wise one lost at this particular time that's what it really happens as we learned how to do that some years ago and now look at us we are here successfully on the air youtube caller can have this show if you want just come on down and don't play stuff like that you better listen up general public because

711
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:13,320
if you obey society's rules you will be society's rules

712
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,320


713
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:13,320


714
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,500
you will be

715
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,280
then disobey

716
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,200
you disobey

717
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,720
but then you'll obey

718
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,320
it's kind of a relative thing and so we got to expand

719
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,260
sooner or later the church of the subgenius will be able to have food outreaches and

720
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,680
you know deliver pieces of bob's body to all those starving people out there

721
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,240
first i'll have to praise bob first

722
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,460
um reverend standing with us i could slack letzte działia and the third world

723
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:54,720
over in let's see some girls emerging african nations are over in southeast asia

724
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,120
mind particularly around i will be and they also in china

725
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:08,560
then most of weeks old car corn

726
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,520
people

727
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,320
you know what's like crossing something is it's you know it's

728
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:13,320


729
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,580
It's something you're born with, friends.

730
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,620
All of you, all of you were born with original slack.

731
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,880
But the conspiracy comes and takes it away.

732
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,880
And in the third world, the conspiracy is stronger, but slack is also stronger.

733
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,900
So when Bob gets into the third world, which is happening now,

734
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:35,200
of course, in China he's called Bong, and in Africa he looks different.

735
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,620
But it's still the same. It's the same Bob.

736
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,540
The same Bob, friends, because Bob does not change.

737
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,280
He's ever changing, but it's the same Bob.

738
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,040
Praise Bob.

739
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,440
There you go. Get along, little Bobbies.

740
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,300
Praise Bob.

741
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,060
We're coming nearer to the harvest, dear friends.

742
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,640
If you would like to call here at the radio station,

743
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,340
once again, you can talk to the Reverend Ivan Stang

744
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,520
or the Reverend D.K. Jones or Sister Cress,

745
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,000
the high priestess of slack here at 201-266-79.

746
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,040
What a lie.

747
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,840
What a lie.

748
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,520
And we should mention...

749
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,140
Yeah, we should mention that that's actually not the...

750
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,760
That wasn't even the station you were listening to.

751
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,060
And that wasn't the right phone number, neither.

752
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,260
And it doesn't matter because this is Screaming Jay Hawkins.

753
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,080
Ladies and gentlemen, most people record songs about love,

754
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,420
heartbreak, loneliness, being broke.

755
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,520
Nobody's actually went out and recorded a song about real life.

756
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,200
Ain't no pain.

757
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:45,420
The band and I have just returned from the general hospital

758
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,460
where we caught a man in the right position.

759
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,480
We named this song Constipation Blues.

760
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,760
Constipation Blues

761
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:56,760


762
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,380
Constipation Blues

763
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,420
Constipation Blues

764
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,780
Constipation Blues

765
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:02,780


766
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:02,780


767
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:02,780


768
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:02,780


769
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:02,780


770
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:02,780


771
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,300
Constipation Blues

772
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,100
Constipation Blues

773
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,360
Constipation Blues

774
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:35,580
Oh, my God.

775
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,600
Oh, my God.

776
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,780
Oh, my God.

777
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,140
Let it go.

778
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,740
This pain I'm in.

779
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,540
Just won't let me be satisfied.

780
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,500
Let it go.

781
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:18,400
Let it go.

782
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:50,380
