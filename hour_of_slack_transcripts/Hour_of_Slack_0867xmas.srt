1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
I need you here.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,180
I need you here.

3
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:55,340
I need you here.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,020
I need you here.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,280
Ah, yes, dear friends!

6
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,920
It is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know

7
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,220
that we're not gonna dis-do the same old three

8
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,240
Christmas hour of Slack show reruns in a row.

9
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,640
No, I'm going to compress it

10
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:29,980
and send you some links.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,580
all into just this one intensive total rerun show.

12
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,780
Except that actually it's not.

13
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,380
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

14
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,740
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

15
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,120
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.

16
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,100
Selling.

17
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,580
Yes, oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

18
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,400
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

19
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

21
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,840
It's cool, man, cool.

22
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,740
And, uh,

23
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,520
Praise Bob and who...

24
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,640
And stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,580
Who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

27
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,240
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

28
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,160
Who stuck the wood where I poop-sheep-poop-sheep-poop

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,680
Who was that man?

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,340
He shoved it up my can

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,080
And left me alone with a little bit of a grudge

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,760
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

34
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,200
Yeah

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,060
Will you stop it?

36
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,600
Woo!

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,960
Chop-a-pa-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,220
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

40
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,180
Those pine-tree needles sting me

41
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,440
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-rim-a-ding-dong

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,060
You'll never know how much they sting me

43
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,060


44
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,060


45
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,680
That's smart

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the slump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

48
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,440
Who stuck the wood where I poop-sheep-poop-sheep-poop

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,200
Who put the stick up my hip-day-dip-day-dip

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,880
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,640
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

52
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,400
No!

53
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,020
I might squeeze him too tight

54
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,020
It's that psychedelic time!

55
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,660
Well, it's the time of the year

56
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,480
Do you know where your brain cells are?

57
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,200
It's already 9pm

58
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,660
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

59
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,620
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

61
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,240
I mean, the apartment store

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,540
Stand to the right

63
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,720
Paul, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

64
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,240
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw

65
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,280
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use your brain cells

66
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,480
Till I get the damn chainsaw fixed

67
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,040
And back in my arm the way I want to!

68
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, it was Tuesday

69
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,400
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,460
Apple mango pie

71
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,560
Ain't no good of a child

72
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells

73
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,040
Can you do something about that, boy?

74
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,320
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

76
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,160
Nooooooo

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,240
Wha ?

78
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,140
Eric Brasburg!

79
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,720
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun

80
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,760
The faith of a child.

81
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got.

82
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,920
Spend all the money you've got.

83
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,480
The Christmas truck.

84
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,740
I've lost my freaking mind.

85
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,520
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

86
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,920
He's like a cowboy Santa.

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,500
How jolly.

88
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,240
Oh, Jazz is giving Dave the show pills.

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,160
Boy, I really need one of those.

90
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,840
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit?

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

92
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

93
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,940
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

94
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,060
That's enough of that.

95
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,120
Oh, he's got headphones now.

96
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,380
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

97
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,040
It's been increased in size.

98
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,400
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,440
Look, it's swelling.

100
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,580
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

101
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,040
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

102
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

103
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

104
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,900
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

105
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,260
I'm shocked by you.

106
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,320
The red pills are really good.

107
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,040
I like to take the red pills.

108
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,040


109
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,040


110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,040


111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,040


112
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,040


113
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,800
The red one and the blue one.

114
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,220
Yes, the red one and the blue one.

115
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,600
At the same time.

116
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,720
That way you go in and out.

117
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,220
The warp mix is easy.

118
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,860
It's so high, you can't go over it.

119
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,480
We're high, singing about mountains.

120
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,600
And those mountains, in reply,

121
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,580
Sang we wish we had some, too.

122
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

123
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,040
Wario in excelsis Deo

124
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,900
Wario in excelsis Deo

125
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,480
Barbie Dog

126
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,120
Women raping me more with their lives by role-playing with Barbie

127
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
Barbie Dog

128
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:53,140
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

129
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,540
It will empower this resistance.

130
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,040
You will use the marketing scheme to get the best quality toys for your children.

131
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,880
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

132
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,720
It will be a BOMBER FOR KIDS.

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:22,760
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

134
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,220
Good has lots of muscles.

135
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,420
Good.

136
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,420
Good!

137
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,640
Good!

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,160
Good.

139
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,320


140
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:29,900


141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000


142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000


143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000


144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,860
Both human and human beings will value good at the same rate.

145
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:44,960
Good will have pre-physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires latent in

146
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,600
children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called

147
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
So Farmer told me this boy said church

148
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,060
batteries know the bike's not crucial

149
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,480
She's new from Kenner.

150
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,620
We must buy our toys.

152
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,540
Yes.

153
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,020
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

154
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,960
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

155
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,920
And me and Palmer Freedies.

156
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,840
Angels We Have Heard on High was by The Philistines.

157
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,980
The collage called All the Money You've Got.

158
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,240
Is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album.

159
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
Which you can get for free.

160
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,720
Check out this website.

161
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,260
Obtuse.iuma.com

162
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,580
That's Obtuse.

163
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,480
Excuse me.

164
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,660
Ah yes.

165
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,380
And next up.

166
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,420
The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

167
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,280
Once upon a time.

168
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
There was the baby Jesus.

169
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,900
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

170
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,120
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

171
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,760
And he wanted his two front teeth.

172
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,880
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

173
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,320
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

174
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,420
And he took all the presents.

175
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,600
From Hoover.

176
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,620
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

177
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,360
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

178
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't.

179
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,580
He wanted 10s and 20s.

180
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,020
10s and 20s.

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,520
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

182
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,260
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

183
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,860
And that's the real story of Christmas.

At

199
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,060
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

200
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,220
He wanted an electric train.

201
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,340
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.

202
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,600
He had a picture of the whole thing, and he would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.

203
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,560
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

204
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,360
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars,

205
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,460
and a station and a gateman,

206
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,360
the water tower, and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

207
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,320
So grand that you might think Tommy was wishing for something that just didn't exist.

208
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,380
I wish he hasn't.

209
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,880
Like me.

210
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,380
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

211
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,980
So sympathy, so sympathy...

212
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,840
Now you are in my clutches, Bob!

213
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,300
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you straight.

214
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,600
Shut up pinkboy!

215
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,500
No way!

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,160
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

217
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,740

223
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,700

Santa Claus.

228
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,800
It is turnover. The time of the year when all things sell. The end of the year sale.

229
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,380
So come and get it everyone and just buy our products.

230
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,220
Now are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

231
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

233
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,200
But the present subgenie,

234
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,580
try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

235
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,500
Oh yes, once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

236
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:41,680
And it was something else in between there, but before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

237
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,440
I think they started a war over it.

238
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,800
Yeah.

239
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh dear.

240
00:15:51,320 --> 00:16:01,360
I also like playing with these Bernardels.

241
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,420
The ones who work in state normale now.

242
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:05,940
Yeah.

243
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:15,920
I didn't know they were selling something or something in particular.

244
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:45,880
Thanks for watching!

Oh, it's a great day, all right.

267

A salute to Mr. and Mrs. America.

268
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,780
Shop as usual.

269
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,060
Shop as usual.

270
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,360
Shop as usual.

271
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,640
And avoid panic buying.

272
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,800
That's two days old Christmas.

273
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,100
A million things to do.

274
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,620
You can't do that.

275
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:15,620


276
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,720
In the house, put on tea, company is due.

277
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Where are my relatives?

278
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,420
Why haven't they showed up?

279
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,720
I bet they're at the airport.

280
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
I forgot to pick them up.

281
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,320
Christmas is almost here

282
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,620
going to people to mold I'm very pretty.

283
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
You get me?

284
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,280
Oh, I haven't seen you as a girl in quite

285
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,280


286
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,280


287
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,280


288
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,280


289
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,060
Oh, I had a few words yesterday, like I said,

290
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,040
I saw you last night, and you're like,

291
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,700
I thought you were asking about myself.

292
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:43,700


293
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,260
I'm very happy.

294
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,260


295
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,520
sometimes i think all that santa craps just bull

296
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,120
Who's the head man?

297
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,580
Santa Claus.

298
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,460
Santa Claus.

299
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,260
He was a huge, beastly,

300
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,020
bulging man.

301
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,060
He was so real,

302
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,020
how come we didn't get squat last year?

303
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,900
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan

304
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,260

305
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,140

309
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,740
Told by various authors

310
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,980
and eclectic scholars from around the

311
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,880
globular unit. Including that

312
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,040
announcer. This announcement

313
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,000
has not been a perfunctory announcement,

314
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,720
an announcement of the blessed

315
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,200

316
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,580

Praise Zin.

321
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,980
Zin.

322
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,520
Was born in a cradle.

The rave Jesus.

324
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,560
To a rich man's family.

325
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,100
The rave Jesus.

326
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,800
Oh, I know the rave Jesus.

327
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,660
I'm partying with the rave Jesus.

328
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,340

Let your

334
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,980
side be light.

335
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,360
Let your side be light.

And have yourself a merry little Christmas.

338
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,540
From now on we're miles away.

339
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,020
Hey!

Let your heart

351
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,220
be

352
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,360
out of sight.

353
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,400
be out of sight.

354
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,040
Out of sight.

355
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,800
The Jackson 5.

356
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,020
Wanna wish everybody

357
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,460
a merry little Christmas.

358
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,960
Merry Christmas.

359
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
Hey, see what I've got here.

360
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,740
Perhaps you can catch it.

361
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,640
Your appeal says you'll show immortality.

362
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,640
I've been drinking heavy

363
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,320
frozen comedy wine.

364
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,320


365
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,360
I am just tasty.

366
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,360


367
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,500
In a moment,

368
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,060
a Mus bleed.

369
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,060

00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,060


372
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,940
my across.

373
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,580
Here it is.

374
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,700
Oh,

375
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,840
I once saw a moth.

376
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:51,920
I saw a moth.

377
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:51,940

Oh

393
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,860
And

394
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:48,520
Amazing a more from corporal blossom. I am really impressed by their editing work and that's on corporal blossom and the mutated

395
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,000
Christmas is

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,800
I

404
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,100
do

405
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,480
Is

406
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,760
This

407
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,200
Stuff

408
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,200


409
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,380
Out

410
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:39,660
To

411
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:39,980
Bye

412
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,220
Me

413
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,480
And

414
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,940
Ho

415
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,000
Now you're blaming Jesus.

416
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
You're blaming our Lord.

417
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,520
I sort of understand because...

418
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,820
I understood the way any old fool would understand.

419
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,980
There was no Jesus.

420
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,180
No flatulent old woman waving her panties on the hill.

421
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,320
It's not that you don't want to.

422
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,740
It's that they won't let you.

423
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,680
No, there's just a crime in wilderness.

424
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,580
They're ashamed.

425
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,100
And the hot pursuit of wolves.

426
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,020
Wolves everywhere in the background.

427
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,560
I'm ashamed of them.

428
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,860
It's cold.

429
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,620
I'm leaving that city life behind.

430
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,860
I can't get my finger off the paper.

431
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,060
I can't get my needle back in the pan, Jan.

432
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,160
Come on, cowboy.

433
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,420
No, man, I was trying to hear a can against this here tree,

434
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,680
and it started whispering to me, man.

435
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,160
No, you've been drinking.

436
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,280
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

437
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,740
There's the face of Virgin Mary.

438
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,840
I swear to God, look at it.

439
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,700
It is.

440
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,140
What?

441
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,060
It's her Christmas.

442
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,320
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

443
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:55,860
Wow.

444
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,920
A Christmas witch?

445
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,920
I'll be whole.

446
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,840
Oh, my God.

447
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,880
Yeah, I guess it does look a little bit more.

448
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,100
Her breasts are so cold.

449
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,300
I know she must be a true witch.

450
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,440
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing down for real.

451
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
She's running by hovering Christmas ornaments.

452
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,080
It looks like a radar device.

453
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,620
What?

454
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,780
Yo.

455
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,860
Yo?

456
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,320
It's her.

457
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,180
What up?

458
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,080
Nothing.

459
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,060
What's up?

460
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,840
What a deep voice.

461
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,600
The first Christmas witch.

462
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,300
Ha, ha, ha.

463
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,960
Hmm.

464
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,380
Here we go.

465
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,280
Mm-hmm.

466
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,600
Here she goes.

467
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:12,640


468
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,080
I know.

469
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,080


470
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,700
Oh, shit.

471
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,040
Oh, shit.

472
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,420
Oh, shit.

473
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:15,500
Oh, shit.

474
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:15,660
Oh, yeah.

475
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,400
Oh, yeah.

476
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,800
Oh, my God.

477
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,060
Oh, yeah.

478
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,580
Oh, my God.

479
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,060
Oh, my God.

480
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,080
Oh, my God.

481
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,200
Thank you.

482
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,600
Hey, Mother Mary, your blessed lady.

483
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
Hey, Mother Mary, I fell in love with your son.

484
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,740
Hey, Mother Mary, turn me on and on and on.

485
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,980
Hey, Mother Mary, thank God for you and your son.

486
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,840
Right on, right on, right on, right on.

487
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,740
Right on.

488
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,420
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

489
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,080
Baby, I want to talk to you.

490
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,820
This Christmas, because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

491
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,800
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmastime.

492
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,400
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

493
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,340
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,

494
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,420
and the health department made us take them down.

495
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,320
I remember my father well, you know.

496
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,120
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

497
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,340
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?

498
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,800
He used to.

499
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,360
Put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.

500
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,840
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.

501
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,780
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

502
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,880
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas,

503
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
but he's going to bring you something.

504
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,280
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air

505
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,240
and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.

506
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,300
He said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

507
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,020
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new season?

508
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,560
Century?

509
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,500
They even come to questioning now.

510
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,080
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

511
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,080
Oh my God.

512
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,040
Dang, come on.

513
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,320
His father, Paul Bunyan, and his mother, Big Sister,

514
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,580
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?

515
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,700
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas?

516
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,080
Yes.

517
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,920
The Pilgrims for Babies?

518
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,820
There was a down-home Norman Rockwell style,

519
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,860
it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

520
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
It was a...

521
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,080
It was a...

522
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,160
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,

523
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,580
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

524
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,660
It was a...

525
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,460
When your little brother broke through the hole,

526
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,000
it fell through a hole in the ice,

527
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,460
and you went and saved him.

528
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,220
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

529
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,560
It was a wonderful life back then.

530
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,400
I remember when Uncle Bud would come in with a key and candles,

531
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,480
like most people have to do at Christmas.

532
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,960
He would have that smile on his face and a big red nose.

533
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,140
But today, Christmas is lost its meaning.

534
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,180
He'd have beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.

535
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,460
He would have...

536
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,300
Scott, you made your choice.

537
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,680
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

538
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,300
And to your eternal soul,

539
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,700
you have found that all that could you afford

540
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,660
to give to God that which was his,

541
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,620
you have been so...

542
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,380
You have been so...

543
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,380


544
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,380


545
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,380


546
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:50,380


547
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,440
You have been so...

548
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:52,740
You have been so...

549
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,840
The Senate still stands.

550
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,820
As promised,

551
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,420
he knew outer darkness,

552
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,260
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

553
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,580
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

554
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,840
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

555
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,060
Sir, no.

556
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,200
I don't want to go to hell.

557
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,580
No.

558
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:16,340


559
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,600
No.

560
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,200
No.

561
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


562
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


563
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


564
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


565
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


566
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


567
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


568
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


569
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


570
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


571
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,340


572
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,300
The

573
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:22,900
The

574
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,320
The

575
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,340
The

576
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,640
The

577
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,460
The

578
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:29,680
The

579
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:29,780
The

580
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:29,780


581
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:29,780


582
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:29,780


583
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,580
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

584
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,380
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

585
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,520
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

586
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,440
Dare I ask it?

587
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,260
Yes.

588
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,000
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

589
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,600
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

590
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:35,980
The answer?

591
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,600
Yes, definitely.

592
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,200
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty

593
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,300
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

594
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,740
Merry Christmas to all!

595
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,580
Now you're all gonna die!

596
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,040
The night Santa went crazy

597
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,240
The night Saint Nick went insane

598
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,120
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

599
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,560
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

600
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,640
Well the workshop is gone now

601
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,220
He decided to vomit

602
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,560
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet

603
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,260
And he tied up his helpers

604
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,500
And he held the elves hostage

605
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,300
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage

606
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,520
He got desert francer

607
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,640
With an old German luger

608
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,240
And his friends were all dead

609
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,600
He slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

610
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,640
And he picked up a flamethrower

611
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,220
And a barbecue blitzer

612
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,280
And he took a big bite to say it tastes just like chicken

613
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,580
The night Santa went crazy

614
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,260
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

615
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,500
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole

616
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,980
Without stepping in reindeer guts

617
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,800
There's a National Garden

618
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,420
And a party in the FBI

619
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,520
There's a van from the eye

620
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,700
We're just loose

621
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,480
And helicopters circling round in the sky

622
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,380
And the bullets are flying

623
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,640
The bodyguards rising

624
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,200
And everyone's dying to know

625
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,060
Who's Santa why?

626
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,200
My, my, my, my, my, my

627
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,180
You used to be such a jolly guy

628
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,160
Your ?!

629
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,920
Ah!

630
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,640
He knows when you're sleeping

631
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,840
He knows when you're awake

632
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,620
He knows when you can do good

633
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,940
So be good, for goodness sake

634
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out

635
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,100
You better not cry

636
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,520
You better not pout

637
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:01,080
I'm telling you why Santa Claus is coming to town.

638
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,520
Santa Claus is coming to town.

639
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,700
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called

640
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:22,380
Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coote.

641
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,920
ElectricElf at loop.com can tell you more about that.

642
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,560
But now...

643
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,200
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?

644
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,680
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

645
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,620
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

646
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,400
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

647
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,720
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...

648
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
How many before you reach your limit?

649
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:48,640
Jesuses?

650
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,980
Yeah, how many can you bag?

651
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,880
How many messiahs can you bag?

652
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,120
Mail.

653
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,000
Jesuses.

654
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,720
If you're doing it in season, if you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

655
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,560
Oh, you never do one.

656
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,300
And you can only take one.

657
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,820
You never bag the Lord in C.

658
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,600
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

659
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,140
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

660
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,420
This is the season for the fighting Jesus, obviously.

661
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,260
We are between a rock and a hard place.

662
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:18,200
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?

663
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,460
And he got elephantages of the rectum.

664
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,000
You know, it's not...

665
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,740
It's not something well known by many Christian scholars.

666
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,600
Messy, messy, messy disease.

667
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,300
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

668
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,180
Well, I like the story.

669
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:36,940
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.

670
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,760
I like when he moves into a trailer park and...

671
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,540
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

672
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,020
The ranger.

673
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,700
I like the...

674
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,640
The Texas ranger.

675
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,180
Jesus, Texas ranger.

676
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,400
Johnny Ripple was a Jesus.

677
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,620
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.

678
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,040
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

679
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,560
He was the white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

680
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,340
Well, what about old Peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois, who was actually Huron?

681
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,960
A Huron.

682
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,400
You didn't know that, did you?

683
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,000
See, I got you.

684
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,360
Thin rod.

685
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:12,900
Jesus.

686
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,100
Elrond.

687
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,140
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.

688
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,660
Oh, it tastes like butter.

689
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,060
It's a different Jesus.

690
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:21,900
It tastes like...

691
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,680
A future Jesus.

692
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,420
A future pie, children.

693
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:23,800
A future Jesus.

694
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,280
A pipe smoking Jesus.

695
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,500
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.

696
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,160
Go kick that window open.

697
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,400
I already kicked it.

698
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,480
I'll kick it again, though.

699
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,980
Kick it good this time.

700
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,220
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

701
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,060
We hope that...

702
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,040
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

703
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,440
Clapping.

704
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,040
We appreciate all that.

705
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,960
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.

706
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,560
That's all.

707
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,680
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

708
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,680
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

709
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,140
Right.

710
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,420
I could hear him say that.

711
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,000
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

712
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,960
Next topic.

713
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,120
Next topic.

714
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,400
Terrorist insurance.

715
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,380
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

716
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,420
And science.

717
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,120
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

718
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,560
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

719
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,900
Listen to the sounds of hell.

720
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:19,540
Jingle, jangle, jingle.

721
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,540
We're on the road.

722
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,100
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

723
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,300
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

724
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,720
Wrapped in wrapping paper.

725
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,060
We're gonna break our necks.

726
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,760
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

727
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,360
Sleigh ride to heck.

728
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,520
Sleigh ride to heck.

729
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,840
Sleigh ride to heck.

730
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,800
Sleigh ride to heck.

731
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,180
The elves are full of cheer.

732
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,780
The kids are tucked in bed.

733
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,240
Santa ain't coming.

734
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,640
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

735
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,160
Their dreams are filled with toys.

736
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,740
But they're out of luck.

737
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,520
Because Satan is coming.

738
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,520


739
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,660
Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to f**k.

740
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,960
Sleigh ride to heck.

741
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,720
Sleigh ride to heck.

742
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,600
Sleigh ride to heck.

743
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:47,800
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey, James

744
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,280
Kochalka, Superstar.

745
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,720
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making

746
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,240
fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

747
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,660
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

748
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,380
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

749
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,020
Now we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

750
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,260
but we subgeni may be bad.

751
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,260


752
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,260


753
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,800
But our way of bad is holy.

754
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,940
Is holy compared to the evil of so, not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists,

755
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,180
charismatics, evangelicals, etc. in general.

756
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:40,960
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,

757
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,920
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

758
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,000
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

759
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,600
I'm...

760
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,480
We're...

761
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,960
Jesus and Bob, like we say, our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus.

762
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,880
It's just his fan club.

763
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,160
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

764
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,620
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

765
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,660
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

766
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,240
Uh-uh, no.

767
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,800
Because God's perfect.

768
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,560
He doesn't even sneeze.

769
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,700
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us and we

770
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,160
have to go in the secret.

771
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,760
The secret room.

772
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,220
The bathroom.

773
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,140
To do awful things.

774
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,660
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

775
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,500
Oh, and he's male.

776
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,200
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

777
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,340
Because we sinned.

778
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:36,640
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.

779
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,380
We're bad.

780
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,200
We're worthless.

781
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,080
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

782
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,220
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

783
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:47,900
We turn.

784
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,140
Bob and the bastards of Israel.

785
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,140


786
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,900
The universe will be back after this message.

787
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:52,560
Santa Fe.

788
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,440
Thank you.

789
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,460
See you next time.

790
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:01,240
All right.

791
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,240


792
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,240


793
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,520
Bye.

794
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,580
Bye.

795
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,140
Bye.

796
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:06,560
Bye.

797
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,440
Bye.

798
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:09,440


799
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,060
Bye.

800
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,160
Bye.

801
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,780
Bye.

802
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,300
Bye.

803
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:12,300


804
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,340


805
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:12,340


806
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,380
Bye.

807
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,580
Bye.

808
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:15,660
Bye.

809
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:15,660


810
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:15,660


811
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,040
Bye.

812
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,560
Bye.

813
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,180
Incessantly

814
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,900
Overconfusioned, God-spread

815
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:55,160
Just like the ones I used to know

816
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,900
When she stops smoking

817
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:13,260
And she'll be the same to me

818
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,140
But I'm so

819
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,480
I'm so

820
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,680
I'm so

821
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,760
I'm

822
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm dreaming

823
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,640
of a

824
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,680
I'm dreaming of a Caucasian

825
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,880
I'm dreaming of a Caucasian God-spread

826
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,000
God-spread

827
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,600
And everyone

828
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,440
And everyone can

829
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,020
And everyone can call

830
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,460
And everyone can call that

831
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,380
And everyone can call that right

832
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,000
And everyone can call that right away

833
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,520
And everyone can call that right away

834
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,800
And you guys

835
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,300

836
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:52,380
Could be

837
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:52,620
Could be

838
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,860
Could be

839
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,820
We need you guys

840
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:55,820


841
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:55,820


842
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:55,820

Fernanda Nande-Lemore.

849
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,080
Oh no!

850
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,300
Divine!

851
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,420
Have yourselves

852
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,380
a groovy little solstice.

853
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,420
Mithras won his fight.

854
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,240
Ho ho ho!

855
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,780
Ho ho ho!

856
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,400
Come one, come all!

857
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,520
It's He-Bomb!

858
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,360
Hey kids, you can help the mighty subdued!

859
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,360


860
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,360


861
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:48,900
Demon Rice overthrew the evil normals with new Bob-Dob's action figure with Rocket Pie.

862
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,280
What I wouldn't do from Bob-Dob.

863
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,700
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you, no?

864
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,140
Ooh!

865
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,360
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

866
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,640
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

867
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,100
Feeling space free.

868
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,280
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

869
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,020
Now so chocolatey.

870
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,400
Ooh, smells cocoa-ness-ous.

871
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,980
Nice cocoa-little-ness.

872
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,420
Whoa.

873
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,060
Well friends, what do you, what do you think?

874
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:19,200
Is, is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

875
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:28,240
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

876
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,360
It's so separate, it's so separate.

877
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,440
The great joke is...

878
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,960
Remember the black-and-white

879
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:05,960


880
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,220
sight of Santa Claus!

881
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:06,720
If you want to see more clips of Santa and Bob doing it...

882
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,180
You can see all the smeared Harry residential areas with Santa, she'll surprise everyone next time.

883
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,180

and Christmassy lights

911
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,980

smell that cinnamon

922
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,940
open the door all the way

923
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:45,520
so we can see if he comes in

924
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,420
and those sugar plums

925
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,520

gosh

931
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,140

00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,380
till Santa comes Dave

933
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,080
our beloved Santa

934
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,900
I have wanted to

935
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,420
put your bag down for a minute

936
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:04,040
this side

937
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,320
is always so ready to like

938
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,700
big red sack

939
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,200
what?

940
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,460
for so long

941
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,160
Hi Bob and Mary

942
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Merry X-mas

943
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:13,320
influenza

944
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,720
everybody

945
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,080
that's right

946
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,980
that will start

947
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:30,760
Christmas

948
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:30,800
as seen

949
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:30,800


950
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,180
and we will disown

951
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,860
in the 잡아

952
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:38,500
assuming you're singing

953
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:38,500


954
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,120
Narcissistic

955
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,140


956
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,280
LoneCowDave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

957
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,620
Chocolate is my good day.

958
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,160
What happened?

959
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,200
What happened?

960
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:54,600
What happened?

961
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,780
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house.

962
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,900
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

963
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,140
The stockings were hung by the tree.

964
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,580
Merry fucking Christmas.

965
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,180
Merry fucking Christmas.

966
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,080
Merry fucking Christmas.

967
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,820
Merry fucking Christmas.

968
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:40,120
formations and Certainly you're still going to remain

969
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


970
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


971
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


972
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


973
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


974
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


975
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:40,120


976
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,060
Merry fucking Christmas!

977
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:52,800
Merry Christmas!

978
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:52,800


979
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,800
Merry Christmas!

980
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,520
Merry Christmas!

981
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,200
Merry Christmas!

982
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,080
Merry Christmas!

983
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,060
Merry Christmas!

984
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,480
Merry Christmas!

985
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,360
Merry Christmas!

986
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:07,060
Merry Christmas!

987
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,540
Children there are so gay at Christmas

988
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,640
All the children on the street

989
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,460
Hope they get something good to eat

990
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,600
But for me it's not so great

991
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,500
Fuck Christmas!
