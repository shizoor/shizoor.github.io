1
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,200
The Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,280
The Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,940
Next up, you saw Andrew the Impaled last night and his pain, his toolbox, his fire.

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,400
And last night he tended to hurt himself.

5
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,160
Well, in a few moments we'll change that.

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,180
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,180


8
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,180


9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
And he'll hurt you instead.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, we'll totally hurt you.

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,220
I saw you looking me up and down.

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,680
Then I saw you looking all around.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,400
That cool guy at the bar, yeah, his name is Jim.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,560
But he's got good taste so you ain't leaving with him.

15
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,280
And either guy's gonna make you feel good.

16
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,180
Not dwell upon the past.

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,680
Not dwell upon your faults like the other guys would.

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,480
Like your green teeth and your knobby ass knees.

19
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,000
What you really need is a fella like me.

20
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,460
Cause I got low standards.

21
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,980
I got low standards.

22
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,300
I got low standards.

23
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,620
Yeah, so why don't you get with me.

24
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
Now you might think that I'm very refined.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,100
But I'm just looking for a kind of good time.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,400
So what if you're bald and missing an eye?

27
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,800
I can look past it.

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,940
I'm that kind of guy.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,460
A big old wart and you forgot your makeup kit.

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,620
Well, I'll just dim the lights a bit.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,020
Wear diseases from your previous bows.

32
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,300
Don't bother me.

33
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,680
I got some of my own.

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,860
Cause I got low standards.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,180
I got low standards.

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,440
I got low standards.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,560
Yeah, so why don't you get with me.

38
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,400
That was good enough.

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,380
You got a lisp with every letter but N.

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,980
You say who and I say when.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,640
You say most of you is starting to sag.

42
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,080
I say grab that colostomy bag and get into my car.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,160
It's a piece of crap and just toss a Burger King wrap.

44
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,400
It's right in the back and we'll head off to your place or mine.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,060
Or just find some parking lot shit that'd be fine.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,160
Cause I got low standards.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,160


48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,200
I got low standards.

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,480
I got low standards.

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,840
I got low standards.

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,060
Yeah, so why don't you get with me.

52
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,400
I got low standards.

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,520
I got low, low, low, low standards.

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,700
I got low standards.

55
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,720
I almost forgot the last verse.

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,120
I'll chalk it up to a poor choice of words.

57
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,780
When you say that the Holocaust never occurred.

58
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,140
I'll chalk it up to a poor choice of words.

59
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,460
You think stem cells are part of your phone.

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,780
And that bathing is for those too cheap for cologne.

61
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,660
Well, I've got a can of Spray here.

62
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,340
To cover the smell and some ear plugs cause your voice is grating as hell.

63
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,660
Besides, the things you say

64
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,780
you must be out of your mind.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
You make the guest on spring or sound like fucking Einstein.

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,480
But I don't mind, no, cause I got.

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,160
Low standards.

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,000
I got low standards.

69
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,180
I got low standards.

70
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,420
Yeah, so why don't you get with me.

71
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:59,600
I got low standards, I got low standards, I got low standards, yes.

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,840
What do you get with, what do you get with, what do you get with me?

73
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,220
Attention subgeniuses, attention subgeniuses.

74
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,600
The mutant mountain boys are in the house.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:30,800
These mountain boys came from rough backgrounds in very poor Appalachian towns, and they were mutants.

76
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,840
Make more mutants.

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,780
Make love to your sister.

78
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,200
That was a new slogan given to us just the other day.

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,280
Is that what happened to you guys?

80
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:49,420
Anyway, friends, the mutant mountain boys have traveled between the worlds of the devos

81
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,580
and the church of devos.

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,180
They've been with the subgenius and the terrible wretched coal mines and salt mines of Appalachia

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,860
and Cleveland and even New York City.

84
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,000
And so, my friends, we are so glad that one more year they have survived the travails

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,200
and managed to get here and bring us yet another concert from the mutant mountain boys.

86
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,560
Hey, I heard you.

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:20,580
I heard you.

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,580


89
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Rarr, rarr, rarr, rarr.

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,560
A hookah.

91
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,160
A hookah.

92
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:37,720
Rarr, rarr, rarr, rarr, a hookah.

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,160
You better pray holy Bob when you see those flying saucers.

94
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,020
Yes, I say.

95
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,400
Amen.

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,560
Amen.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


99
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


101
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


106
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,560


109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,340
You better start to pray

110
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,860
It's a sign there's no doubt

111
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,140
Of the trouble that's about

112
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,780
It may be the coming of the judgment day

113
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,100
They're a psychotronic sight

114
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,660
As they fly on day and night

115
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,260
It's a warning that we'd better mend our ways

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,340
Better pray, holy Bob

117
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,940
When you see those flying saucers

118
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,200
It may be the coming of the judgment day

119
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,360
Many people think the saucers

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,460
May be someone's foolish dream

121
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,020
But really they were sent from Planet X

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,180
If you like the music

123
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,180


124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,260
You'll just stop and pray you've realized

125
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,760
Just what it means

126
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,240
To haze us with their sacred mutant sex

127
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,580
Though the war may be through

128
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,940
There's unrest and trouble brewing

129
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,620
And those flying saucers may be just a sign

130
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,880
That if Bob doesn't come

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,160
It will be the end of some

132
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,580
Most lack of today

133
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,640
You're running out of time

134
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,920
When you see a saucer fly

135
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,120
Like a comet

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
Through the sky

137
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,860
You'll realize the price you'll have to pay

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,040
Though the world may end tomorrow

139
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,500
And you may up and die

140
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,960
It may be the coming of the judgment day

141
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,420
But really they're not the end of the world

142
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,020
It's a warning that we'd better mend our ways

143
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,440
Better pray, holy Bob

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,020
When you see those flying saucers

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,520
Yes, I say, my friend

146
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,120
Better start to pray

147
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,520
When it hits the sun

148
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,800
There's no doubt of the trouble that's about

149
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,340
It may be the coming of the judgment day

150
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,100
We can take the next ranter.

151
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,980
Thank you.

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,640
Well, the next ranter can't be here tonight.

153
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,600
The good Reverend Roger, that poor son of a bitch,

154
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,060
is stuck in Tucson.

155
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,660
I think.

156
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,460
But he posted some notes on an inconvenient universe.

157
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,080
By the way, friends,

158
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not doing my old-timey hate rants much anymore,

159
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,280
partly because I have really good recordings of them

160
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,020
that they're most hateful.

161
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,960
And the main thing is I got slack.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,040
And I write.

163
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,040


164
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,960
I write rants.

165
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,760
And they're really heartfelt.

166
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:27,540
But I don't share them because they're brags

167
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,500
about how much slack I got.

168
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,000
And I don't want everybody else to feel bad.

169
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,820
And I don't want to sound like I'm bragging exactly.

170
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
But at the same time, let me assure you,

171
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,200
if you ever wondered,

172
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,080
yes, it's true that when I was preaching about slack at my most heated,

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,380
I wasn't getting any slack.

174
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,820
And I wasn't totally sure if I ever would.

175
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,500
But I did!

176
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,840
Because I lucked out.

177
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:05,380
And so the moral of that story is there is such a thing as slack.

178
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,360
And every now and some, even an undeserving loudmouth

179
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,460
might end up getting it just by lucking out.

180
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,900
So don't kill yourself yet.

181
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,360
Even if you don't get it,

182
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,680
don't get the slack until the last five minutes of your life.

183
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,960
If you get five minutes of slack,

184
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
you'll be doing way better than most people ever do.

185
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,700
Praise Bob!

186
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,520
Praise Bob!

187
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,700
Meanwhile, thankfully,

188
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,760
there's lots of people that haven't really quite landed that golden ring of slack.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
And they're still as full of hate as I used to be.

190
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,820
And their punctuation is at least as good as mine.

191
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,040
And one of those is the good Reverend Roger.

192
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,880
And I'm going to read this.

193
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,280
It's in three parts.

194
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,800
And I may just do part one and then see what happens

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,420
and come back and do part two.

196
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,620
But part one is like this.

197
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,300
So, let's say the dominant ideologues out there aren't flipping your wig.

198
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,920
You say it's because you think the parties are the same.

199
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,420
Equally corrupt, etc.

200
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,080
And that you'd like to see a third party.

201
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,220
In reality, of course,

202
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,320
most of what you're really saying is,

203
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,040
Look at me, sheeple!

204
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,800
A couple of points of order.

205
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,400
One, everybody thinks they are the sole conscious human in a world full of sheeple.

206
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,000
This is the same sort of egomania that makes people think they're the main character.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,780
In both cases, everyone is wrong.

208
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:55,780
Two, everyone assumes that a third party would be the one that represents their interests.

209
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,440
Again, not going to happen.

210
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,980
Both because the people hollering about it are crazier than a shithouse rat.

211
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,140
And because any party with a high enough profile to get elected

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,500
has already been bought and sold by the same people that own the existing parties.

213
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,700
Given that,

214
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,520
why would they pay for three parties when you can get the illusion of choice with two?

215
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,400
You'll notice that the Green Party and the Reform Party mysteriously flew to pieces

216
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,580
when they became large enough to show up on the ballot.

217
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,900
Not that either of these points will stop or even slow down your average libertarian.

218
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,980
This is because the average libertarian has no motives in actually being successful in raising a party.

219
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:45,560
No, the average libertarian is out to score with chicks

220
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,400
and can't figure out why it isn't working no matter how much he talks about going galt.

221
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:58,980
Hence, it's because being a radical only works on women if you're a radical leftist

222
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
and only then for a very narrow window.

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Radical rightists are boring.

224
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,980
For the rest of us, of course, this state of affairs is hilarious.

225
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,540
Is there anything funnier than a man making a great big show of reading Atlas Shrugged at Starbucks

226
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,240
quite obviously wondering why none of the women in the shop have chatted him up?

227
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,620
But the funniest thing about third party people is that they invariably turn into conspiracy freaks.

228
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,620
Chemtrails, HAARP, 911 truthers, FEMA camps, etc.

229
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,840
I think this has to do with the fact that when you make yourself believe one great whacking lie,

230
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,360
for instance, the existence of a free market, etc.,

231
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,540
it's suddenly easier to believe just about anything.

232
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,280
So you go to parties and tell everyone about the danger they're in

233
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,060
until it gradually dawns on you one day that none of your friends seem to throw parties anymore.

234
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,720
Silly sheeple.

235
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,500
From there, it's usually an alcohol-fueled ride to crazy town population U.

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,960
I gotta say it.

237
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,220
It must be rough living in a universe in which your flawless ideology,

238
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,960
whether that be communism or unrestrained capitalism,

239
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,260
doesn't work even though it makes perfect sense to you and ought to work and would work

240
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,000
if only people weren't such sheeple.

241
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,500
But it doesn't work, does it?

242
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,380
And yet here you are trying to explain it to people for the umpteenth time.

243
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,800
Rinse. Repeat.

244
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,600
Hey, wait a minute. Is he talking about me?

245
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,260
I'm the robot program to tell you that you're all a bunch of robots.

246
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,220
I like Princess Wee's phrase,

247
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,200
Wake up, sleeple.

248
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,220
And my phrase, quit snoring, sleeple.

249
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,320
It's more important.

250
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,960
So what now? Do I do part two?

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,220
I want a cookie.

252
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,900
tiver

253
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,900
What are you driving, breed?

254
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:30,800
Do you do Google Most追',

255
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,580
thingamabobies or what?

256
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:35,580


257
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,700
all your friends and all your co-workers?

258
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,180
Chances are, all of this behavior

259
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,440
is a symptom of the fact that

260
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,280
you're not expressing your anger.

261
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,760
We can assertively express our anger

262
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,420
if we handle our anger assertively.

263
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,060
We complain and complain and complain.

264
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,100
I'm angry.

265
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,760
So what do we do?

266
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,660
Wow!

267
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,220
I want rain.

268
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,320
I want to go home.

269
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,000
I want a cookie.

270
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,680
I want rain.

271
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,460
I want a cookie.

272
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,400
I want a cookie.

273
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,880
I want a cookie.

274
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,040
I want a cookie.

275
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,780
I want a cookie.

276
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,100
Am I really sorry?

277
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,720
Did I really do something bad?

278
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,840
Why am I apologizing?

279
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,440
I don't think I'm always wrong.

280
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,080
Do you?

281
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,340
Do people push your button?

282
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,460
Are they telling you that you're too fat,

283
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,660
too aggressive,

284
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,120
not nice enough,

285
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,020
or just hard to get along with?

286
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,240
Are they telling you that people

287
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,960
who grew up in Connecticut are stupid?

288
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,360
Do they tell you that you're weak?

289
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,760
Are you simply the person who gets the sand kicked in their face?

290
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,260
Negative, negative, negative.

291
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,480
Now you're angry, and now you have something to say.

292
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,760
I want a raise.

293
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,420
I want to go home.

294
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,960
I want sex.

295
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,240
I want a cookie.

296
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,040
I want a raise.

297
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,900
I want to go home.

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,360
I want sex.

299
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,980
I want a cookie.

300
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,600
I want a raise.

301
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,700
I want sex.

302
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,560
I want a cookie.

303
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,460
I want a raise.

304
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,540
I want sex.

305
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,440
I want a cookie.

306
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,380
I want a raise.

307
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,240
I want to go home.

308
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,660
I want sex.

309
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,420
I want a cookie.

310
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,080
I want a raise.

311
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,100
I want to go home.

312
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,640
I want sex.

313
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,380
I want a cookie.

314
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,880
I want to go home.

315
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,300
I want to go home.

316
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:13,040
I want sex. I want a cookie. I want a raise. I want to go home. I want sex. I want a cookie.

317
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:30,700
Jacob had 11 sons when he knocked up his secretary. He named the bastard Benjamin.

318
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:38,900
Of all the sons of his other sons, he hated them all. Rotten bastards. All except for Joseph.

319
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,120
Jacob tolerated Joseph because he'd snitch on his brothers and let Jacob read his porn magazines

320
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,800
and keep the kids off his lawn. So Jacob gave Joseph a really wild looking zoot suit. It was

321
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,980
all the colors of the rainbow. One day, Jacob sent Joseph out to find his older brothers who

322
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,680
were supposed to be tending the flocks in Hackensack. Joseph was to tell him that he

323
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:07,680
wanted to stop fucking the sheep so much. So Joseph went and on the way, he met a strangely

324
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:16,800
dressed man smoking a pipe. It was J.R. Bob Dobbs. Bob asked Joseph if he wanted some magic beans,

325
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:22,160
but Joseph said no. Bob then asked Joseph if he wanted to buy a bridge in Brooklyn

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,680
or some land in Florida. And again, Joseph didn't fall for the bait.

327
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,680
Finally, Bob offered Joseph a drink. He said, I don't want to drink. I don't want to drink. I don't

328
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:30,780
want to drink. I don't want to drink. I don't want to drink. I don't want to drink. I don't want to drink.

329
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,900
Joseph offered Joseph a small square of paper with a small printed drawing of a star on it.

330
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:44,680
What is that? Asked Joseph. Why? It's the amazing Technicolor micro dot, replied Bob.

331
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:52,500
It'll get you tripping. Well, I am in for a long trip, said Joseph. Maybe this micro doc thing will

332
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,620
help me get there faster. Giving Bob 30 shekels, Joseph placed the micro dot under his tongue

333
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,680
and was soon transported to the hospital. He was then taken to the hospital. He was taken to the

334
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:00,860
hospital. He was taken to the hospital. He was taken to the hospital. He was taken to the hospital.

335
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,560
Joseph was taken to another world, a world of color and sound and lights and giant goats and talking

336
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,360
hedgehogs. And as he continued down the road, Joseph was amazed by all the colors he heard and the

337
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:20,360
sounds he saw. He had a vision of everyone bowing to him as king. And as king, he lived in Graceland

338
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,220
and would die on a toilet. This made Joseph hungry for a hunk of hunk of bucket of fried chicken.

339
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,680
Joseph's 10 brothers saw him coming down the road and his colorless,

340
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,660
colorful zoot suit visible miles away. Joseph's oldest brother, Glenn, said, shit, here comes a

341
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,480
rainbow boy. The next brother, Rush, said, I know, let's mug him and blame it on the Jews and the

342
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,040
blacks. So all the brothers hid behind a rock and Joseph came out stumbling down the road singing

343
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Hendrix tunes. As he passed a rock, the brothers jumped out. Joseph, seeing 10 and large, fat,

344
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,980
in Papa John's uniforms, tried to run, but was soon on the ground getting the shit beat out of him.

345
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,980
The brothers took Joseph and sold him to a nearby pig farm. Later that day, they went home and told

346
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,960
Jacob how Joseph was mugged and raped over and over by bands of Mexicans for seven years.

347
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:25,900
Jacob shrugged. Big deal. I gotta got tired of his little kiss ass anyway. Hey, who wants Scrapple?

348
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,440
The end.

349
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,660
Mama Rachel has something to say.

350
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:38,800
Come on and wobble up here. Everybody give Mama Rachel a round of applause.

351
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:57,100
Hello to all those people I cannot see. I was encouraged by Reverend Suds to entertain you

352
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,640
with one of my many skills.

353
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes, yeah.

354
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,660
Non-sexual at this point.

355
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,700
I'll give you a touch of that.

356
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,040
Yes!

357
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,860
I'll tell you what's sexual.

358
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,040
So here's one of my many performance pieces. I'm a little teapot.

359
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,960
It's already sexy.

360
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:20,440
Yeah.

361
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm a little teapot, short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout.

362
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,580
When I get all steamed up.

363
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,200
Hear me shout. Tip me over and paw me out.

364
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,800
I also take requests.

365
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,280
Get me in more.

366
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,060
I think her real conspiracy name may be Rosemary.

367
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:54,680
Smirnoff.

368
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,760
He's a Smirnoff.

369
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,060
No!

370
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,480
No!

371
00:22:59,780 --> 00:22:59,780


372
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,060
No!

373
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:00,700


374
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,220
It's Stang!

375
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,540
She's another Mercedes McCambridge. We can remake The Exorcist now.

376
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:24,300
Your hoods don't match, your work has in 1492.

377
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,680
I wake up screaming at the three minute mark.

378
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,680


379
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,680


380
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,680


381
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,680


382
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,980
I'm dreaming of you.

383
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,760
Your teeth have twins, your growing fins.

384
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,900
They love you at the zoo.

385
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,440
I wake up screaming at the dreaming of you.

386
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,580
Your ears are much too oversized.

387
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,760
Your nose is quite the riddle.

388
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,660
Your eyes are too big.

389
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


390
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:00,660


391
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,440
But I'll confess.

392
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,600
I love your eyes, especially the one in the middle.

393
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,320
You're not so hot with what you've got.

394
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,340
Your parents you should sue.

395
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,200
I wake up screaming at the dreaming of you.

396
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,980
I wake up screaming after dreaming of you.

397
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,020
I wake up screaming after dreaming of you.

398
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,920
I don't know why I'm so scared.

399
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,060
I'm not even in the mood.

400
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm not scared.

401
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,460
Thank you.

402
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,740
Thank you.

403
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,240
Thank you.

404
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,180
Thank you.

405
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,260
Thank you.

406
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,900
Thank you.

407
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,500
Thank you.

408
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,760
Thank you.

409
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,760
Thank you.

410
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,420
Thank you.

411
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,120
Thank you.

412
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,080
Thank you.

413
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,080


414
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,080


415
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,080


416
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,080


417
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,080


418
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,040
And hopefully that's what we've been doing for the last 35 years.

419
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,820
Praise Bob.

420
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,740
Praise Bob.

421
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,020
Praise Bob.

422
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,520
Praise Bob.

423
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,980
Praise Bob.

424
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,140
Everybody give Fight Sataj a round of applause.

425
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,640
Thank you.

426
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,840
La, la, la, la, la, la.

427
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,700
Dear friends

428
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,000
And dear Princess Wee

429
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,600
That was Reverend Feit C. Taj

430
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,580
Before that, of course, it was Fat Man D

431
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,780
Spelled P-H-A-T, Man D

432
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,580
Before that, Reverend Rachel Wierdigan

433
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,960
Before that, Priestess Pisces reading

434
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,820
The Technicolor Microdot

435
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,720
By Reverend Richard Scull

436
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,360
And before that, Evolution Control Committee

437
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,560
That was the cut-up one about I Want a Cookie

438
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,060
All recorded at 17X Day

439
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,340
Ah, yes, and there'll be

440
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,840
Next week we'll play yet more

441
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,640
Those are all bands that played at 17X Day

442
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,780
And great recordings there

443
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,440
Reverend Suds Pasha did the

444
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,260
The

445
00:30:59,260 --> 00:30:59,800
The

446
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,000
The bands and I recorded the ranters, usually

447
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,120
It's the way that generally works

448
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,980
So, ah, yes, yes, yes

449
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,000
Um, oh, I have a little rant here

450
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,340
About the internet that I got from the internet

451
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,240
It's short

452
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,440
Reverend Irazu wrote this originally

453
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,680
And it's called The Blog of the Subgenius

454
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,800
And it goes like this

455
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,640
In fact, I'll turn the music down

456
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,220
I picked the damn lunch of the gods off a menu

457
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,120
I post images I didn't even make myself

458
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,260
Step aside, all you butt-lipped, neurotic, insecure

459
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,320
Be-spectacle members of the opposing political party

460
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,200
I capture photons reflected off of my children

461
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,600
And I upload those imprisoned wave particles

462
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,600
I drink beers

463
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,780
I drink beers

464
00:31:59,780 --> 00:31:59,780


465
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm frustrated

466
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,680
I sit with soup and nothing else

467
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,680


468
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,680


469
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,680


470
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,680


471
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:14,900
I drink it

472
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:14,900


473
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,180
Don't you drink it

474
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


475
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,180


476
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,420
I swear on my mother's nainental

477
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,480
I have good president

478
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,480


479
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:19,480


480
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:26,700
than Aphrodite and more duck lips than Daisy Duck's panties. I bend the entire digital

481
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,640
information infrastructure to my whims to let you know I was at a place.

482
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:44,160
Law. I define myself with quizzes. I whiz myself when I see a cute kitten. Now get...

483
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:51,700
And that's where the character limit runs out. Sorry, Princess Wee, I had to keep you potted down

484
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:57,560
so that they could hear the rant. I can't help it. Erazu really got me on that one.

485
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:06,100
Yeah, that's the internet, folks. A beautiful, beautiful sentiment there, actually.

486
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:13,680
Yes, indeed. I'm staying off the internet for a month, I've decided. Of course, it helps that

487
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,020
we're...

488
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,880
Going to be traveling and also that we're in the middle of moving. We're moving Princess Wee's...

489
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:32,540
Well, the Queen Mum's space apartment. And we're moving our own fannies to far, far away.

490
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,960
Beautiful, beautiful Germany.

491
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,040
Yes, beautiful, beautiful Germany.

492
00:33:53,780 --> 00:34:00,980
I'm not sure what is going to happen there, but I will no doubt be German and have lots of drinking songs.

493
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,900
The stuff in the background I'm going to be playing for the next half hour.

494
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:19,940
Kunz sings German university songs. However, these aren't from modern universities from the year of 1955, round about that time.

495
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:32,800
You know, I really should know better than to be playing foreign language stuff that I don't understand the words of.

496
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,940
Every time I've ever done that on the Hour of Slack...

497
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,640
I've gotten in trouble.

498
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:50,380
Once it was Hitler and somebody complained they didn't get it. They thought we were Nazis and we were actually making a point about Nazis, of course, as you know.

499
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:02,580
And then there was a time I had a guy... I wrote a piece for a Vietnamese dude to read and it really upset the South Vietnamese people in Dallas.

500
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,420
Because to them the war was still on.

501
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:05,860
Oh.

502
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,540
And likewise, if you were Lonesome Cowboy Dave, the war would still be on for you too.

503
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,300
I think.

504
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,260
I think.

505
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,960
It's my nasal passages once again reverence.

506
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Oh, your nasal passages?

507
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,520
I think they've embedded something in there.

508
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,080
You know, more than like a malodorous cag from the hinterlands.

509
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,760
It's an actual plumbing job that I don't want to go into.

510
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,020
I think my whole forehead's involved.

511
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,600
Are you blaming this on me, Dave?

512
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,000
Pardon?

513
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,260
Did you just say you're blaming your forehead on me?

514
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,920
No, I didn't mean to personally blame you on my forehead.

515
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:53,640
I was blaming my forehead for what I just want you to be aware and everyone else to be aware that my forehead is very strange right now.

516
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,560
Dave, I'm afraid I have news for you, man.

517
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
Afraid you have to what?

518
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,660
That's not news to us.

519
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,080
That your forehead is strange.

520
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:11,840
In fact, Dave, you'll be glad to know I've got kind of a fan, well, it was a fan review of you.

521
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,720
Who did?

522
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,560
I fa-

523
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:14,960
What did?

524
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,360
Your hearing is getting worse than mine, isn't it?

525
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,660
No, it's the reception is very bad. You sound cold.

526
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,480
Oh, no. Well, that's your phone's fault. You sound fine to us.

527
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:27,920
Yes.

528
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,200
Anyway, I was looking at the famous subgenius internet.

529
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:41,200
And there was a post from Paternostril that said LCD versus...

530
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,680
Oh, no.

531
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,040
What happened to Dave?

532
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,160
I don't know. Dave just hung up.

533
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,760
He just couldn't bear the idea of hearing anything nice said about him.

534
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,660
I guess I'll drop that line and maybe he'll call back in a second.

535
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,240
I hope he calls back.

536
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,240
We'll just kick back and...

537
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,180
Would you think that that forehead problem that Dave was talking about...

538
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,600
That he was having was a real forehead problem or a prosthetic forehead problem?

539
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,820
Oh, well, here he is back again. Let's find out.

540
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,560
Dave?

541
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,900
Yes?

542
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,620
Dave, did you...

543
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,240
I'm sorry about that.

544
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,180
Your forehead is acting up again.

545
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:23,800
That, see, that's... Now, there's the connection between all forms of telecommunications in people's foreheads.

546
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,880
But I don't know what it is. And I'm sure you don't either, do you?

547
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,600
Actually, I do because I saw a great movie called...

548
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,360
The Case of the... No, what was it?

549
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,780
The Screaming Forehead movie.

550
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,060
No, the...

551
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:39,960
The...

552
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,480
The Screaming?

553
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,680
The something... Well, something about the screaming forehead.

554
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,540
Something about the screaming forehead, yes.

555
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,020
Trail. Trail of the screaming forehead.

556
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,680
Oh, yeah, yeah. I've heard that, yeah.

557
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,560
Yeah, it's a movie about foreheads that take over the world.

558
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,840
It turns out that the seat of intelligence is in the forehead.

559
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,240
And the foreheads can go crawling around on the ground.

560
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,660
The movie opens with a guy discovering a crawling forehead.

561
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,800
You mean a forehead on itself crawling on the ground.

562
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:19,900
He discovers it, takes it to Washington, files a patent claim, and develops an arterious sclerosis of the brain.

563
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,440
Something like that.

564
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,640
Something like that.

565
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,420
To some small degree.

566
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,220
Well, now, I was... Just when you rudely hung up on us on purpose...

567
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,420
I was in the middle of trying to read to you a...

568
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,320
Well, it's not exactly a fan letter, but some people said nice things about you, Dave...

569
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,680
Well, let...

570
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,880
...in subgenius land.

571
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,600
Would you like to hear them?

572
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,100
Yeah, rather than seemingly angrily hang up right at the point where, you know...

573
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,840
Yeah, right when we were about to say something nice, finally.

574
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,460
Okay, here's... First, it's a quote from, I guess, from Dangerous Minds.

575
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,180
Neil Young said of Charles Manson, okay...

576
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,300
He had this kind of music that nobody else was doing.

577
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,600
He would sit down with a guitar and start playing and making up stuff different each time.

578
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,140
It just kept coming out, coming out.

579
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,120
Then he would stop and you'd never hear that one again.

580
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,440
Musically, I thought he was very unique.

581
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,880
I thought he had something crazy, something great.

582
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,080
He was like a living poet.

583
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,020
Well, that did describe Charlie Manson.

584
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,000
But as Potter Nostril said, this could easily describe Lone Cow Dave.

585
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,540
Well, not since I got back from Vacaville.

586
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,280
I was still, you know, held up there for a while.

587
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,800
But you learned under Charles.

588
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,140
You know, with the sex change operation.

589
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:58,800
Well, then after Potter Nostril pointed out the obvious similarities between you and Charlie Manson...

590
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:08,460
...and the jailed killer and cult leader, Reverend Louie Louie chimed in and said...

591
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:16,080
...I've always thought of Lonesome Cowboy Dave as the Church of the Subgenius' own personal Jonathan Winters.

592
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,860
Isn't that nice?

593
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,160
Who's dead, by the way.

594
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,460
Yes, after hanging himself from a flagpole.

595
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,240
Ever since Jonathan Winters died...

596
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,560
...there's been this similarity to you in the minds of Reverend Louie Louie, I guess.

597
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,820
Well, I've tried to set sail in nude many times.

598
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,260
With scant clothing, anyway.

599
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,640
Much like he did.

600
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,840
Now you're not turning me on.

601
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,620
At all.

602
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,960
No, I'm not happy either, at all.

603
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,220
Eh. Oh. Eh. Oh.

604
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,920
Eh. Oh. Eh. Oh.

605
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,720
What?

606
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,320
So, yeah, Dave, yeah. I just don't know what to tell you, man.

607
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:10,500
Well, tell him thank you very much, or I'll just say it publically right now, without a frown on my face, as happy as I can...

608
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,020
...thanks, guys and girls, for...

609
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,780
...supporting the efforts of these small, feeble-minded...

610
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,660
...adults...

611
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,880
...who scour up the airways every very sunny night and...

612
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,720
meh.

613
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:25,880
Meh.

614
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,280
Meh.

615
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:26,900
Meh.

616
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,420
Kapooey.

617
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
That's what I feel about society, and I'm sure you do as well.

618
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,000
No.

619
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,680
Kapooey.

620
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,260
No.

621
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,460
Well, yeah, actually, yeah.

622
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,500
Yeah, I really, I just assume be killing monsters.

623
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,200
And not to help society.

624
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,540
It's just because I like to kill monsters.

625
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,120
I don't even dislike monsters.

626
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,080
I love them.

627
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,880
But they're monsters.

628
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,980
It's so fun to kill them.

629
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,720
And there's more where they came from, you know.

630
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,520
Every time.

631
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,600
And where love grows, staying is there with a sword, ready to disconnect it like a vowel sound.

632
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:10,900
Now, by monster, we could, it could be assumed that perhaps we really mean, oh, I don't know,

633
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:19,380
human beings or the subset pink boys, normals, normally warmly worms, you know, little mediocre

634
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,180
Barbie Dallas people.

635
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,120
Barbie Dallas.

636
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,660
Barbie Dallas milfs.

637
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,100
For sorority milfs that you really don't want to.

638
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,340
No, you don't even want to be in the same room with them because it causes a gag and revulsion reaction so quickly.

639
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,060
They're mean.

640
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,280
Don't tell me about it.

641
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:48,780
I had to videotape their Deb balls and coming out parties and stuff for weeks.

642
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,260
The let them eat Twinkies crowd.

643
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,080
Yeah.

644
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:52,960
Yeah.

645
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,280
Yeah.

646
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,580
Yeah.

647
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,640
Yeah.

648
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:54,660


649
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:54,960
Yeah.

650
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah.

651
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


652
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


653
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


654
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


655
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


656
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


657
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


658
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


659
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


660
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


661
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


662
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


663
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


664
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


665
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


666
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


667
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


668
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


669
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


670
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


671
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:55,860


672
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,540
Yeah.

673
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,320
Yeah.

674
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,520
Yeah.

675
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


676
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


677
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


678
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


679
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


680
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


681
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


682
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


683
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


684
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


685
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


686
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


687
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


688
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


689
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,520


690
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
And so you had to show your disdain by urinating on her tire.

691
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,620
How did you just you're just guessing.

692
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,380
You just guessed that.

693
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,320
That was a good guess.

694
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,000
I got to admit.

695
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,480
There's no shortwave radio.

696
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,820
She's not listening.

697
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,320
I think.

698
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:25,520
Well,

699
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,720
Sheetzes may be a pronunciation that you got just from me.

700
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,160
I don't know that the sheets gasp.

701
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,440
I like to say that.

702
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,820
I know it's just called sheets with a Z.

703
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,140
I think they do call it sheets.

704
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,040
But I like to say Sheetzes.

705
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,740
Sheetzes.

706
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,560
Didn't that what you used to say when you were a kid?

707
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:41,980
Yes.

708
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,560
Well, that's from my Pennsylvanian friends.

709
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:44,940
Right.

710
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,860
Sheetzes don't exist all over the whole country, so many people wouldn't want to know.

711
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,040
No, it's Eastern Ohio and Pottsville, Dorphea, I think.

712
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:52,700
Yeah.

713
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,340
Yeah.

714
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,600
They had pretty good sandwiches in there, though.

715
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,540
Yeah, but they have to make all those, you know, noises.

716
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,540
I know.

717
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,300
Just say their name is embarrassing.

718
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,840
Yeah.

719
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,280
Yeah.

720
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,920
Especially if you're Hispanic or something.

721
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,260
People could take you out.

722
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,840
But tonight at the Blue Room Ballroom, there is nothing more and nothing less than a fine

723
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,240
selection of silverware from Herman's Weldon Lighter.

724
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,720
Herman's Weldon Lighter has been making fine furniture and used carcasses for the last

725
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,280
75,000 years.

726
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,300
And if you want to come down, ladies, you can try it right now.

727
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,780
This is the...

728
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:28,760
This is the best thing I've ever seen.

729
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,620
Because I thought you were doing commercial radio show.

730
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:31,820
Yeah, right.

731
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,700
So we got to do commercials every now and then.

732
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,680
Yeah.

733
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,160
Oh, actually, it's...

734
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Princess Wee and I can't wait for this hour to be over because then we can go home and

735
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,460
go to bed because we've been working, believe it or not.

736
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:50,800
I know that's an unusual thing to hear from subgeniuses, but we've been trying to pack

737
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,480
up everything that the queen mom owns on her...

738
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:03,080
Space apartment in Rabbiton in preparation for hauling it all to Cleveland Bluffs, where

739
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,060
we have to set it all up so we can keep an eye on the old gal, you know, because they

740
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,580
get kind of feisty, these space queens, queens of outer space and stuff.

741
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,000
They get weird as they get older.

742
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,400
Yeah, they like to walk around 3 a.m. in the morning and I think it's 3 in the afternoon

743
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,880
and get confused and stuff.

744
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,660
Yes, she's through her power years.

745
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,040
The power years were between 50 and...

746
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,520
I think 70.

747
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,180
Those were power years?

748
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,580
Yes, those were her power years.

749
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,120
Oh, my God.

750
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,600
Yes, yes.

751
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,860
That means those are my power years.

752
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,080
Now she's sort of in the...

753
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,040
What I guess you would call the floaty years.

754
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:38,760
Floaty?

755
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:39,740
Float.

756
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,220
With an F. Float.

757
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,760
Sort of just floating through life.

758
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:50,280
Yeah, well, when you're 85, that's kind of a good approach, I guess.

759
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,040
I think so.

760
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,860
Yeah, rise, inflate, float above it all.

761
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,080
Oh, man.

762
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Relax and kill monsters.

763
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,360
Maximum desert nose, man.

764
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,820
Remember the aroma.

765
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,160
Like, you know, Minerva lives...

766
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,780
You know what I mean, man.

767
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,460
I remember the aroma.

768
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,480
I found a dirty book that your mom and dad had, Princess Wee.

769
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,860
And I brought it.

770
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,300
I stole it from the apartment.

771
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,060
I brought it here.

772
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,160
It's called The Sexual Relations of Mankind by Montegaza.

773
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:22,800
Ooh.

774
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:23,820
Ooh.

775
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:24,840
Yes, my parents.

776
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,800
My parents were quite authorities on such subjects.

777
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,800
Here, I'm going to open it at random and read it.

778
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,220
Well, you wouldn't be here right now, neither would your brothers.

779
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:32,560
That's right.

780
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,060
Actually, this is about all of the...

781
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,520
That's all the expertise you need.

782
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:36,840
I'm sorry.

783
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,580
Change.

784
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,860
Well, this is...

785
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,840
Okay.

786
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:43,640
This is written for space queens and princesses.

787
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:47,160
So that's why it's called The Sexual Relations of Mankind.

788
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,120
So that they'll know how the humans do it.

790
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,880
But here's a sentence I just picked at random.

791
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,220
Hmm.

792
00:46:53,740 --> 00:47:00,400
Christ came into the world a second time to redeem humanity and to teach castration.

793
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,120
What?

794
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
Yeah, that's what I said.

795
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,180
What?

796
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,000
That's what he's reading it from the book.

797
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,700
Have you ever heard of a Russian sect called the Skopts?

798
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,580
S-K-O-P-T-S.

799
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,320
The Skopts.

800
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:15,940
Skopts.

801
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,980
Well, do they go back to Leninist days or the drink of water theory?

802
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,100
I know if you know of Skopts, you've probably heard of the drink of water.

803
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,400
That was going around.

804
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,380
This goes back to the time of Catherine the Great.

805
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:29,300
Oh.

806
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,580
And Alexander I.

807
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,280
So they were sexual.

808
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,860
They were Russian.

809
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:43,580
They were really, really devoted type of extreme Greek Orthodox who would chop off their wee-wees

810
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:53,200
and have the ladies mutilate their breastages in order to become pure, the just, the full.

811
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,160
The white doves.

812
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,660
The whitewashed, they called themselves.

813
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,360
Yeah.

814
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,300
Well, this is what led to the communist drink of water theory in the early days of the revolution.

815
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:09,960
Apparently, repression was so bad that they concluded that sex is so normal that, you know,

816
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,120
it's like breathing or something.

817
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,160
You need a drink of water.

818
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,100
You should do it right there.

819
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:19,440
And people were allowed to have sex on the bus and publicly in other places because they

820
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,560
needed a drink of water.

821
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,760
But sex was scientific.

822
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,440
Socialist thinking in the day.

823
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,520
Today.

824
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,340
This was way different from that.

825
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,680
Yeah.

826
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,540
Let's see.

827
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,660
The fact, however, cannot be denied.

828
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,380
It'll be a little easier to explain when we reflect that the Scots are in control of enormous

829
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:47,240
wealth and they employ all manner of seduction in attracting to themselves the poor in spirit

830
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,700
and even more the poor in pocketbook who, by mutilating a single organ.

831
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:58,380
However important it may be, thereby assure themselves of a lifelong competence.

832
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,060
Competence?

833
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:02,500
Yeah.

834
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,040
A poor competence, it said.

835
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,840
Well, they used a little lead thing in their urethra to control their wee wee.

836
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:17,280
A poor peasant was once lamenting the fact that he did not have the price of a drink when someone remarked to him,

837
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,680
go see two scoptics and let them castrate you and you will have all the money.

838
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:22,680


839
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,420
You want.

840
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,580
So I guess Russia is a strange place.

841
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,760
Where eunuchs are capitalist entrepreneurs.

842
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,120
We can all go there tomorrow.

843
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,380
I mean, sometimes real soon and take pictures and stuff.

844
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,620
We get the story because that's kind of weird.

845
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,240
Don't you think?

846
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,020
Very well.

847
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,600
Listen to these screaming scoptics in the background.

848
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,360
It obviously hurts.

849
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,900
And here's some good statistics.

850
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,680
As to the degree of mutilation, the fact is that the only way to do that is to have

851
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


852
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


853
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


854
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


855
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


856
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


857
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


858
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:52,680


859
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,740
a mutilation determinable in individuals.

860
00:49:55,140 --> 00:50:04,980
Of the men, 588 had everything amputated, 833 the testicles only, and 62 had mutilations of various sorts.

861
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:17,600
Among the women, 99 were found with amputation of the breast and pudenda, 306 had their breasts missing, 182 were lacking in nipples,

862
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,740
251 had only their genitals mutilated,

863
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,500
and 108 showed mutilations of various sorts.

864
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,100
So you can let your imagination just run wild there, Dave.

865
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,040
But these were things people did.

866
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,920
You're already killing me over here.

867
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,000
It's just not the kind of thing that my imagination likes to go run wild with.

868
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,560
Yeah, really.

869
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,620
Well, it allowed them to concentrate.

870
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,960
You hide under a bridge somewhere and, like, get into the fetal position is what you do

871
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,160
when you hear this stuff.

872
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,620
Well, apparently it helped them concentrate on making money

873
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,400
and it made them better Christians.

874
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,600
Some rap guy did that to himself a couple of months ago.

875
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,320
He was tripping balls, but he can't do that anymore.

876
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,140
Because he doesn't have any?

877
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,120
Yeah.

878
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,760
Do you remember the art of Schwarzkogler in the early 80s?

879
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,380
The artist who was in one of his performance pieces,

880
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,600
he was falling down 20 flights of stairs.

881
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,880
He also chopped off his penis.

882
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,700
And then what?

883
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,520
When his art career was over, he was, like, going,

884
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,180
what the...

885
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,800
Yeah, kids, kids, stay off the straw,

886
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,240
because it'll just make you do terrible things.

887
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,000
Yeah, don't get those lead implants.

888
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:46,000
I learned a whole bunch of new youth culture terms at X Day, 17X Day,

889
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,900
because there was so much youth there.

890
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:49,680
Youth.

891
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,680
Which one of them?

892
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,760
I heard you and Priestess Pisces talking about the straw,

893
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,200
but I don't know anything about it.

894
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,320
I'm not cool enough to know that.

895
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,900
Don't worry about it.

896
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:02,420
Live by the straw, die by the straw, what does that mean then?

897
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,180
Because I've heard that and I don't know what it means.

898
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,740
Because I'm, you know...

899
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,400
I don't know nothing either.

900
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,300
Well, what is the straw, man?

901
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:12,960
Straw man, no.

902
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,660
Right, exactly. Now you got it.

903
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,760
Well, at the campground, they were telling us to stay,

904
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,620
stay off of the straw with our cars, is what it came down to.

905
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,460
And it turned into a, you know, a meme, one of those memes,

906
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,140
where you go, yeah, man, stay.

907
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,220
Hey, man, stay off the straw.

908
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,740
But we already did this on a show you didn't hear, Dave.

909
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,400
So we're repeating ourselves.

910
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:45,800
Well, blame my vocal cords and my earlobes for the great thunder that's passing through.

911
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,700
Not, I didn't mean to.

912
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,020
The great thunder?

913
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,000
You didn't meme to?

914
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,380
No, I certainly did not mean to.

915
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,940
And you can just take back everything you, everything you,

916
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,240
everything you've been saying about everyone.

917
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,540
Because it's not right.

918
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,820
Uh, yes. Yes and no.

919
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,000
Cool.

920
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:17,300
Well, so what do you think about current events, Dave?

921
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,460
I think, uh...

922
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,080
Boy, you're...

923
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,920
Uh-huh, that's what I thought.

924
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:22,380
Uh-huh.

925
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,440
See, they bleeped it.

926
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,520
See, you can't, they will not let Lonesome, because he's so much like Charlie Manson,

927
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:33,340
they, they being Obabo, the preseserp, won't let Dave speak.

928
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:33,800
Right.

929
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,140
And in fact, this show ends pretty soon, and you'll have to stop speaking then again.

930
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,460
But I can go on snorting the straw or collecting my wits about me.

931
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,460
Like in a little pile.

932
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:59,640
Although, although, Dave, uh, we're, we just got word that this show is going to continue

933
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:06,380
after 10 o'clock, because the replacement for Dr. Sinister has not been manufactured yet.

934
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,240
So we're gonna have to, we're gonna have to, to, uh, I'm gonna pretend to end this show

935
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,780
in four or five minutes, and then we will continue recording.

936
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,960
And just do whatever we want to with it.

937
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:31,560
So let me try to do a thing here, Dave, where I play about three and a half minutes of a

938
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:37,100
rant, and, well, actually two and a half minutes of a rant by a first-time ranter.

939
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:44,700
Then we'll come back and play a little bit of that terrible band, Arm, the, uh, Arm,

940
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,440
Arm...

941
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,540
Arm Jenny.

942
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:46,920
Arm Neji.

943
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,760
Arm Neji.

944
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,480
Arm Neji front.

945
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,500
Arm Neji.

946
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,340
I keep wanting to say Arm Menji, but it's the Arm Neji front, and they're amazingly

947
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,200
practically bad.

948
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,460
But first, let us play this rant.

949
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,400
So serendipitous.

950
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,200
And I'll push drop on Dave, and I'll drop this audio here, and then I have to make sure

951
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,620
and push the right, just the right button to hear the rant of...

952
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,000
I like it when you push that button.

953
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,320
...Reverend Scapegoat.

954
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,480
Settle down, Princess Wee.

955
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,480
...with Mama Rachel that if she would come up here and do her thing, that I would do it.

956
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,060
I would have to do it.

957
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,540
So...

958
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:20,700
Oh, yeah.

959
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,140
At the very least, that's what this was worth, whatever comes out of my mouth right

960
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,520
now, and...

961
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,560
Good, yeah.

962
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:34,520
So I was told by the young'un on this side of the stage to rant about something that

963
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,360
makes me angry.

964
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,100
And...

965
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,980
What makes you angry?

966
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,220
What are you feeling?

967
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,700
Why are you so angry?

968
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,620
I'm not angry.

969
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,120
That's the problem.

970
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,140
I'm not angry right now.

971
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:45,580
Why not?

972
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,280
You sound angry.

973
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:47,880
I'm disappointed.

974
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,380
Can you be that angry?

975
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:49,460
I'm disappointed.

976
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,460


977
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:49,460


978
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:49,780
You're angry here?

979
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,460
Really?

980
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,560
Yeah.

981
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:53,740
I could keep eating the balls if you want, Bob.

982
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,120
Don't give me a reason, goddammit!

983
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,040
You sound angry.

984
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,380
That's what I'm saying.

985
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,060
It's a good...

986
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,320
This is my first X Day.

987
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,400
This is a great time.

988
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,520
There we go.

989
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,460
Tear it from the newbie.

990
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,120
Anyway.

991
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,260
Now you know why we're angry.

992
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,060
What?

993
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,400
Get angry again, dammit.

994
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:09,940
Ah!

995
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,700
What are you?

996
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,280
What are you, this young dipshit trying to rant?

997
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:13,940
Holy sh...

998
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:14,560
Can't you just...

999
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:14,560


1000
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,840
...for a walk in the woods, boy?

1001
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:18,800
Hey, my...

1002
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,380
My...

1003
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,420
My...

1004
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,440
My...

1005
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,440


1006
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,440


1007
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,440


1008
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:19,860
Oh, really?

1009
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,060
Blah, blah, blah.

1010
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,960
You know, if you want to talk and get in line, that's how fucking easy it is.

1011
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,620
You just stand in line, they let you up there.

1012
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:30,080
There was no, you know, background check of what I was going to say when I got up here.

1013
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,080
They just let me up.

1014
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,020
I got more...

1015
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,420
Great Bob!

1016
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,920
I can walk and they're like, oh, yes, totally, come out and talk.

1017
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,660
That was all the way over there when I got a text that, hey, just come up and rant.

1018
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,860
No, I shouldn't.

1019
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,040
Get in, Rick!

1020
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:42,620
What?

1021
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:43,940
Do it!

1022
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:44,760
Fine!

1023
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,760
Whatever you want to say, just say.

1024
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,040
Use the satisfaction.

1025
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,460
What do you mean, you want to say?

1026
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:49,460


1027
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,100
I'm here with my boss, my boss, my boss.

1028
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,100


1029
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,100


1030
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,100


1031
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,120
You know, this is the last one.

1032
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,940
I'm here with my boss.

1033
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:50,940


1034
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:50,940


1035
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:50,940


1036
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,800
Goddamn it!

1037
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,460
What's the last one to piss you off?

1038
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,640
This is not worse.

1039
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,180
This is not worse.

1040
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,560
I come in here trying to be nice and talking about how good of a time I'm having, how everyone's

1041
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,560
so accepting, and you started yelling.

1042
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,240
And he's not putting you down.

1043
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,760
Yes, it does.

1044
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,340
Which I guess is the point.

1045
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,720
So good work, everybody.

1046
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,140
You've got to apologize, mate.

1047
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,120
Fart to the mud.

1048
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,760
That was nice.

1049
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,020
flexible. I don't think it goes down that far.

1050
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,980
Oh, you look pretty

1051
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,320
flexible. Yes, yes.

1052
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,420
We've got a couple of guys.

1053
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,240
Jeez.

1054
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,280
You know, you can take your

1055
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,340
sass and bring it up here, and you can

1056
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,180
deal with this shit.

1057
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,380
Because it's pretty fun.

1058
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:30,720
Yeah.

1059
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,140
That's a good noise. I probably shouldn't break this.

1060
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,500
It's still not mine, but you know.

1061
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,480
It's good to sit.

1062
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,180
There's a bunch of them growing around. Yeah, this is a really nice

1063
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,120
one, though. It's got character.

1064
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,320
It's a fan.

1065
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,020
It really is.

1066
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,160
I should totally steal it from him when he dies.

1067
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,100
But that's not...

1068
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,060
Anyway!

1069
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:54,860
What's the fucking point?

1070
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,800
What's the point?

1071
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,100
The stick is out of here.

1072
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,780
Praise fucking Bob!

1073
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,860

have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months

1111
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:40,240
not just this show but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites

1112
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,660
but if you truly love bob

1115
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:57,620
or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages and help out financially as best

01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:03,320
you can now we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want

1117
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:10,240
any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse but some of you still have jobs even

1118
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,740

50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1123
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,660
All we're saying is that

1124
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,080
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1125
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:27,120
if you don't pay Dobbs.
