1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,040
Make this a G minor!

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,660
No, like this!

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,980
That's great, let's go!

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,100
This is what a disappeared

5
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,860
Ortega kit would look like in black night...

6
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,200
look nice, isn't it?

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,620
Let's see...

8
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,760
Thank you.

9
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,580
Thank you.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:01:59,800
Thank you.

11
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
Thank you.

12
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,440
Thank you.

13
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,660
Thank you.

14
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,580
Thank you.

15
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:40,620
Thank you.

16
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
Thank you.

17
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,920
Thank you.

18
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Thank you.

19
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,120
Thank you.

20
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,060


21
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,300
Thank you.

22
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,720
Thank you.

23
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,660
Thank you.

24
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:39,740
Thank you.

25
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:39,940
Thank you.

26
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:39,980
Thank you.

27
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:39,980


28
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,240
Oh, yeah.

29
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
That guy.

30
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,260
That Bob guy.

31
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:47,940
Huh.

32
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Well, that collage there was collected by Reverend Cool Hand Chris,

33
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,040
and the lovely instrumental right after Lee Murr's titles

34
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,180
was,

35
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:08,540
Strange World by the Rudy Schwartz Project from their CD called Postal Code of Ham.

36
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:16,920
This episode, like the last two, will be a multiple subgenius show collision, but not

37
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
using my show, as it were.

38
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,980
We'll hear some really insane time for the show and some brouhaha from Anna Mall.

39
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:34,060
And, uh, another stuff, but let's start with those old pros from the puzzling evidence

40
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,620
shows.

41
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:41,920
Dr. Howell and Dr. Drummond, in this case, brought together with my recording gear for

42
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,240
last summer's 23rd X-Day drill, more commonly known as 21X Day.

43
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,940
We're not broadcasting live, but recording in front of a live audience of subgeniuses

44
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,760
in an outdoor cafe.

45
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,220
In a campground in deepest, darkest Ohio.

46
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,020
Now you can hear it, Al.

47
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,560
There it is.

48
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,280
And the music stops.

49
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
But continues.

50
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,520
I hear the music, baby, so go, baby, go.

51
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,180
That's true.

52
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,860
We want to stimulate industry and energy.

53
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,960
Activity not necessarily meaningful in the town.

54
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,800
The old curmudgeon.

55
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Who's that fellow?

56
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,740
There's an old curmudgeon around here?

57
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,220
Get him.

58
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:47,780
Yeah.

59
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,200
We don't need such backsliders in the church of subgenius.

60
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,660
False socialism.

61
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Useless featherbedders.

62
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,680
And parasites damaging our forward-thinking mission.

63
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Okay, we're recording.

64
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,140
And everything's going fine.

65
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,200
Everything's fine.

66
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,740
Here at the Stangless X-Day.

67
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,780
The Stangless X-Day.

68
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,960
Yes, without the stang of understanding or approval.

69
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,140
In the incredible...

70
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,400
Yeah, so the crowd is whipping up this morning.

71
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,760
I think we've got like at least 50% larger crowd than normal.

72
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,740
True.

73
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:43,300
Great changes in the world of the church of the subgenius are monumentally occurring while we sit here.

74
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,340
It was amazing how many people walked out when they knew Reverend Stang wasn't going to be here.

75
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,440
They just walked away.

76
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,220
Well, you see, were they evangelicals or rewardians?

77
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,520
It seems that their behavior has identified.

78
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,080
They're not going to be able to deny their place on the chart.

79
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,680
On the ascending graph.

80
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,820
I notice we've got a lot of really super awesome items for the Bulldada auction coming up here soon.

81
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,240
That is correct.

82
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,660
And let me explain that the Bulldada auction is not listed in the schedule.

83
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,380
But will take place today nonetheless.

84
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,660
And we hope that...

85
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,700
Everyone can be informed of this.

86
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:34,000
But those who are not informed will simply have to suffer the result of their ignorance.

87
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:41,120
We heard there was a guy who had a speaker on top of his car who could go trundling through the camp.

88
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,880
With the announcement that the Bulldada auction would transpire after this current sequence.

89
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,340
Well, I don't believe that's been done yet.

90
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,820
But given the luck of the draw and the shuffling of the card.

91
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:07,980
It's quite possible that a significant enough number will arrive to benefit from this first episode of the Bulldada auction.

92
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,160
Whose next iteration will be on Saturday.

93
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,540
Just as it says in the schedule.

94
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,060
But my God, we've got incredible stuff.

95
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,760
Because it's not just anybody's old discarded junk.

96
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,460
It's subgenius' discarded junk.

97
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,280
Some of it's even your old discarded junk.

98
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,220
Some of it maybe.

99
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,180
You don't have to get that.

100
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,220
But I mean, for example, who supplied a tube of nihilist toothpaste?

101
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,180
That's the sort of thing we've got.

102
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,980
No color, no flavor.

103
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,100
No color, no flavor, no nothing.

104
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:49,720
In a black and white box that is handsome enough to fit any decor.

105
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,900
Toothpaste which does not attempt to tempt the palate illogically.

106
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,940
Since it is not a...

107
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,220
It's not a food and should not be swallowed.

108
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,040
Instead is a neutral substance which is only for the care of one's teeth.

109
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:12,220
And such novel ideas are hardly scarce among the panoply of things that we have.

110
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,520
Now it's true that in some cases you might need special top rated equipment.

111
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,920
In that case, if you don't possess the equipment, we recommend you don't bid on the item.

112
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,320
But for the most part,

113
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,520
they are universally applicable and will provide immediate joy.

114
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,780
However, this is not the place...

115
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,680
Hours and hours of fun and joy as well.

116
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,440
Yeah, but we're not talking about the Boldado auction now or we shouldn't be.

117
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,600
Rather, we should be doing our resolute Bobcast up until that time.

118
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,320
Yes.

119
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
And so it begins.

120
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,060
Yes.

121
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,220
Well, you've been here for many X days, of course.

122
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,300
Remembering their high expectations.

123
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,400
Their highs, their lows.

124
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,360
The pratfalls.

125
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,900
Their ups, their downs.

126
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,300
The tears.

127
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,920
Yes, the hidden resentments.

128
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,700
Yeah, the...

129
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,000
The singing in the kitchen and the footsteps in the corridor.

130
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,340
The moment of sudden loathing and the season of stifled sorrow.

131
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:23,100
The sudden realization of an idea never before born which suddenly dies from over exhaustion.

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,740
Yes.

133
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:30,900
The last heaving sighs and gasps and the over-humidified air.

134
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,400
And the blushes of profound embarrassment.

135
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,900
That public flopperooze.

136
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,020
All these things have occurred.

137
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,480
And more is heard than is spoken.

138
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,400
And more remains in the room.

139
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,560
And whatever happened started in the past and presses hard on the future.

140
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,380
This is going to be a commercial.

141
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,700
We're going to have some commercial interruptions in this particular session here.

142
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,160
It's true.

143
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:09,540
We have many products to advertise and would like to direct you how to use your money.

144
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,320
Somebody ought to do something obscene with this bag of frozen peas.

145
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,920
The frozen peas.

146
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,480
Yes, that is a different matter.

147
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,100
We'll come to the mushy bag of frozen peas later.

148
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,720
And it will make its needs unanswered.

149
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,700
They were formerly frozen peas.

150
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,020
Now they're well unfrozen.

151
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,460
They are now, of course, thawed peas.

152
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:37,200
Because what stays frozen in such an environment of superheated interaction?

153
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,660
Uh, yes, peas.

154
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,020
We don't have reverend peas here.

155
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:53,680
But we do, in compensation, have this bag of thawed peas that we understand will figure prominently

156
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,260
at some portion of this presentation.

157
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,220
You understand, Philo.

158
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,180
Sure, I understand.

159
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,900
With great reservation and...

160
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Yes, we understand high concept things.

161
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,060
Always to be respected.

162
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,800
And yet...

163
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,480
The people that made a big deal about wanting to abuse that bag of unfrozen peas are not here right now.

164
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:18,960
Hmm.

165
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,140
Now you see they lack follow through.

166
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,660
They lack get up and go.

167
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,300
Who's gonna fight the next war?

168
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,320
But on the other hand, let's give them a pass and allow them to come at the appropriate time

169
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,040
and perform their obscene, formerly frozen pea ritual.

170
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,560
Wow, I'm getting no bars but I'm 4G.

171
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,940
What does that mean?

172
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,780
Well, it's better than being 4F.

173
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,460
One letter better.

174
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,400
No bars but 4G.

175
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,640
Four government transponders locked on you.

176
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,280
Your current position.

177
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,640
Four gladiolus bulbs sprouting nearby.

178
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,980
So I'm gonna prepare my liquid here.

179
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,440
Liquid chicken?

180
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,060
Oh, that liquid.

181
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:11,960
Yeah, right.

182
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,900
Liquid chicken?

183
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,020
I've got two different kinds of liquid.

184
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,640
Though we don't have liquid chicken here today but you could try super chemical speed up juice.

185
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,360
Do you remember when you could get the...

186
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,260
Oh, no thanks.

187
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,820
No thanks?

188
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,080
But I might go get some coffee.

189
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
It does taste ghastly.

190
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:26,820
Coffee.

191
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,740
What about, yeah, the liquid chicken?

192
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,860
Do you ever remember getting that chicken in a can?

193
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,720
Um, uh...

194
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,780
Swanson's canned chicken?

195
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,040
There is liquid.

196
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,820
You can pour it off and use it for cooking or you can suck it right out of the can,

197
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,620
depending upon your predilection.

198
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,340
And thus, liquid chicken will literally become part of your diet.

199
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,260
You are what you eat, you know.

200
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,780
This was not what we intended to discuss, of course.

201
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,040
At X Day, one has the opportunity.

202
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,260
So you are what you eat.

203
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,040
You were what you have eaten.

204
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,080
And you will be what you will have eaten.

205
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,580
Yes, but you see the eating goes on and on.

206
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,980
Just like in Child's Fairy Tales where somebody or other is gonna get et up by somebody else.

207
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,240
That's actually an absolutely accurate picture of the universe and the way it's set up.

208
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,120
Dr. Howell, do you know anything about how many cells a human loses each day and has to replenish himself with?

209
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,420
I know I have trouble finding out what happened to mine.

210
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,460
Billions and billions, I think.

211
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:42,840
Yes, that's true.

212
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,540
It's a huge number.

213
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,540
Every day.

214
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,900
And fortunately, we are constantly generating cells.

215
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,720
During the process of anabolism, this is fast.

216
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,880
And that's when you can take all the indignities they throw at you.

217
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,340
You know, junk food that you buy at a carnival.

218
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,080
You can digest it.

219
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,040
Over in that area, there's a stack of odd items.

220
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,680
But when anabolism gives way to catabolism, the same cycle is occurring at a slower and slower rate.

221
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:21,640
In particular, the replication of all elements of one's personal composition on a seven-year cycle.

222
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,920
It becomes a longer cycle.

223
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,460
How much longer depends upon the individual.

224
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
Since everyone is different.

225
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,560
Just as everyone has a different nose or face, people are slightly chemically different.

226
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,440
Look at that green beverage he's holding up.

227
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,680
Their nerves are different.

228
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,100
In the sky.

229
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,000
They're whatchamacallit different.

230
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Oh, thank you very much.

231
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,740
What is this?

232
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,100
Mouthwash?

233
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,860
It looks like scope.

234
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,260
Absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.

235
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,940
Well, they say you shouldn't mix drinks, but in this case, this is a special occasion.

236
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:56,820
Oh, that's good.

237
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,600
That's good.

238
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,360
That's good.

239
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,040
That's good.

240
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,060
Oh, what's that, Bunky?

241
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,260
You say you just wanted things to slow down?

242
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,880
Not change so fast?

243
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,340
You feel like America is passing you by in favor of cheaper and more reliable Mexican models?

244
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,240
You're not racist, but you feel as if our culture is a game changer.

245
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,720
You're not racist, but you feel as if our culture is eroding.

246
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,560
You're not racist, but they should fill out the paperwork.

247
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,300
You didn't expect things to get quite this crazy.

248
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,880
You just wanted to tell those damn liberals a thing or two.

249
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:42,360
You were, in fact, concerned about her emails and maybe she'd get us in a war or something.

250
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,280
So you maggered or Brexited or ran off and attended Milo Yopalopoulos rallies.

251
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,220
Why is it that you're not racist?

252
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,220


253
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,740
Why is it, Bunky, that every time you screw the world up you come to me for absolution?

254
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,560
I can't give you that and I wouldn't even if I could.

255
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,080
I don't like you, Bunky.

256
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
You're a bad person.

257
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:11,540
Besides, you have to repent to get absolution and you can't seem to actually bring yourself to do that.

258
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:19,440
You're mush-mouthing excuses for kiddie concentration camps and trade wars and breaking up NATO and...

259
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,940
No, Bunky.

260
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,080
This time I can't tell you that it's going to be okay.

261
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,640
It is, in fact, against my religion to tell people it's okay when you know that they're doomed.

262
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,920
I didn't catch that last bit, Bunky.

263
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,660
You say that out-of-campaign political rallies are making you just a little bit nervous?

264
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:51,200
That weird rant about Elton John's organ made you feel like maybe the president might be losing his grip on you?

265
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,180
Just a little bit?

266
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,500
Oh, don't worry, Bunky.

267
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,080
He was technically correct.

268
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,120
Elton John has an organ, but he plays a piano.

269
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:08,860
As for the rest of that speech, if his cocaine-fueled 3 a.m. tweets didn't bother you,

270
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,040
why would a minute or two of absolute word salad at the podium?

271
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,580
This is what you asked for, Bunky.

272
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,440
This is, in fact, what you demanded.

273
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,280
What you screamed for in 2016.

274
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,700
And now you're upset because he's doing exactly what he said he was going to do?

275
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,000
You think that your friends are dodging you because they somehow got it into their heads that you're a racist?

276
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,400
And you're not a racist, but...

277
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,140
Oh, fuck you, Bunky.

278
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,160
Fuck you right in the heart.

279
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,780
In your rage that a black president got elected and re-elected,

280
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,420
you've moved us back to the past.

281
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,840
Back to 1930.

282
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,740
And not just those darn dirty liberals, either.

283
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,020
But also your mom, your sister, your wife, your daughters,

284
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,580
that one Hispanic guy you know at work,

285
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
your token black friend.

286
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,520
This is what you have done.

287
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,880
Now, piss off, Bunky, and stop bothering me.

288
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,660
The next time I see you, I'm gonna beat you with a piece of rebar and throw you into traffic, asshole.

289
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,560
Reverend Roger, dear friends, that was only read by me.

290
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,520
It was called,

291
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,580
Son of a Bitch, Bunky, What Is It Now?

292
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,740
Yes, friends.

293
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,460
The Church of the Subgenius isn't political.

294
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,340
But I am, and I'm doing the hour of slack.

295
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,700
You know, it's weird, because I have friends and loved ones who voted for Trump.

296
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,460
And some of them would probably do it again.

297
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:00,700
When I think about my friends, okay, and loved ones that did that,

298
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:10,040
and then when I look at Trump and his vocal supporters on TV or the Internet,

299
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,120
I just can't put those together.

300
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,660
They don't fit in the same box, and yet there it is.

301
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,800
To me, Trump fans are kind of like Howard Stern fans.

302
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,100
He is their testicles.

303
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
And now this.

304
00:23:45,120 --> 00:24:15,120


305
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,720
You know the doctors and the rockers and the heads of state

306
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,620
Are all beating their eagles at a million a flea

307
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,980
Another way they cause peace, so know

308
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,900
All the greats is running in the big silo

309
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,640
Crank up the noise, rock with the boys

310
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,060
Come on, jam with the band, blow the horn of plenty

311
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,740
And the big ones are the ones that are the best

312
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,200
Well, I went to bed drunk and I woke up merry

313
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,900
I slept through the church and I woke up merry

314
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,120
Stay on your guard, don't explain

315
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,840
They're all being blind in the quick of a wank, wank, wank, wank

316
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,120
I'm a young man, I'm a young man, I'm a young man

317
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,440
Now that I've become a rich man, how much will I give?

318
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,080
How much will I keep, like the other half-lives?

319
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,780
To fill the Grand Canyon's good intentions

320
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,460
We've got but the gaps that are wide between the heaven and us

321
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,060
Crank up the noise, rock with the boys

322
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,940
Let's go jam with the band

323
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,720
Blow the horn of plenty

324
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:43,620
Let's go jam with the band

325
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,120
That was The Rainmakers

326
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,080
from their old album

327
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,240
The Good News and the Bad News.

328
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,740
Still timely after 140 years.

329
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,780
Unfortunately though,

330
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,060
now it's time for the show.

331
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,240
Just be glad it's not the whole time

332
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,700
of time for the show

333
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,940
because they're often over two hours long.

334
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,100
They take me three weeks to listen to.

335
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,180
I've been milking this one old episode of theirs,

336
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,960
number 32,

337
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,600
for three of my shows

338
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,280
and they do their show every week

339
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,840
for two hours.

340
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,400
So be glad Bob is letting us keep the suffering

341
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,760
down to this 20 minute excerpt.

342
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,180
Well, I promised everybody

343
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,640
we were going to get to viewer mails

344
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,380
when we came out of the break

345
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,400
and look at that.

346
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,720
We're hitting it before 1030.

347
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,000
So this is great.

348
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,420
We're making a great pace.

349
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,020
Blind eye.

350
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:40,820
Let's do it.

351
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,080
Who's your blind eye?

352
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,460
Are we going to do blind eyes now

353
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,260
or viewer mails?

354
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,980
You're just saying.

355
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,820
Blind eyes because you don't have a viewer mail,

356
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,160
peas.

357
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,760
That is an outrageous accusation.

358
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,360
And you didn't have a blind eye either.

359
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,160
So I guess you made one of those up.

360
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,580
I have a very good blind eye.

361
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,720
I have the winner blind eye tonight.

362
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,640
It's not a competition, peas.

363
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,100
Well, not with that.

364
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,580
But is it a band is.

365
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,400
That'll be coming up.

366
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,980
It is.

367
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,100
Is it?

368
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,520
It is.

369
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,800
How about this?

370
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,840
We'll do is it a band after the hour break.

371
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,440
We're going to.

372
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
We'll just hit it hot.

373
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,720
We're going to come hot off of that break.

374
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,960
And we're going to butter that bread with butter.

375
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,540
With is it a band, which is always fun.

376
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,900
But right now, I guess.

377
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,640
So hot.

378
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,340
Good toast.

379
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,600
The bread when it touches it.

380
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,100
Peas didn't do his homework.

381
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
He didn't write a blind eye or a viewer mail.

382
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,460
By the time the show started.

383
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:34,900
That's a lie.

384
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,820
But he has seemed to have written a viewer mail now.

385
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,340
I mean, a blind eye now.

386
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,300
So I guess one of them.

387
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,280
We'll just do the blind.

388
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:44,820
I segments.

389
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,860
I thought we were doing.

390
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Viewer mail blind.

391
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,940
I need that queued up.

392
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,060
Yeah, we do need the sting for the blind eye segment.

393
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:12,680
But because this is such a controversial segment, I am required by the Federal Aviation Administration to give a public service announcement before this highly, highly controversial, racially charged bit that we do every week called the blind eye.

394
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,120
So I do the.

395
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,780
The PSA.

396
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,000
I guess a legal require come out smelling like a rose.

397
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,480
Dr.

398
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,420
Fox Lee smelling like a really want these things to.

399
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,840
All right.

400
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,280
Well, let me just say some stuff, but don't listen to me.

401
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,940
Just get it out of the way so that we can do the blind eyes because I can't wait to hear what pieces.

402
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,360
All right.

403
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,840
This this week's required PSA.

404
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,020
Remember, kids, if you don't do drugs.

405
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,140
Drugs.

406
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,640
They won't do.

407
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,420
We'll do you.

408
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:47,960
All right.

409
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,580
I think we're good.

410
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:48,900
Everybody.

411
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,700
All right.

412
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,180
That was it.

413
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,520
All right.

414
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
Are you ready for my blind eye?

415
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,740
Yeah.

416
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,520
Who's your blind eye?

417
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:53,780
Pete?

418
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,700
Wait, but wait.

419
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
What is the blind eye?

420
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,120
What is the blind eye?

421
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,420
Yes.

422
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:58,980
I die.

423
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,380
Let's go over what the boy.

424
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,920
It's been 17 minutes talking about what this segment is.

425
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,340
Everyone understand that is everyone here.

426
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,160
Have you you?

427
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,640
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

428
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,980
I said, have you heard this show before?

429
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,000


430
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,520
That's right.

431
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,940
Per the time you show Geneva Convention.

432
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,280
You even know what this is.

433
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,000
It's the blind eye segment.

434
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,060
We're excited to get into it for you.

435
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,400
You're like, wow, what have I been missing out on?

436
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,580
Well, I'll tell you what you've been missing out on.

437
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,980
Tell him.

438
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,460
Well, this is this is where we give each of the three of us give a blind eye to ISIS.

439
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:42,780
And we say we tell ISIS who are a very big demographic of of our listeners.

440
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:49,100
Our viewership about it makes about like sixty nine percent of our viewers.

441
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,040
Hey, right, guys.

442
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,680
Up top.

443
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:57,140
So we tell ISIS every week each one of us gets one target and we tell ISIS you fly a

444
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,120
plane to this MF right here.

445
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,280
And guess what?

446
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,280
We'll turn over.

447
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:02,560
Good.

448
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,180
You got one week.

449
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,880
So listen up, ISIS.

450
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,340
Here's who you can fly a plane into.

451
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,420
And you won't get any resistance from us.

452
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,760
The host of Time for the Show.

453
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,620
You might get some from the U.S. military, but but not us.

454
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,020
Little known fact.

455
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,360
One out of every three Canadians is an ISIS member.

456
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
That is a true fact.

457
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,340
Is is your blind eye the the Canadian ISIS member?

458
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,220
No, my blind eye is very apropos.

459
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,000
It's nearing.

460
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,500
You were doing a Segway.

461
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,680
I thought you were doing good radio.

462
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,460
Segway into my blind eye.

463
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,000
All right.

464
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Let's let's see a buttery smooth Segway.

465
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,800
Okay.

466
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,980
So it's the end of summer, which is we all know is almost the end of the festival season,

467
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,980
which is we also know festival is where are you in fucking Rio?

468
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,380
Hippie crack in 31.

469
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,500
I said here and becomes more valuable.

470
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,180
Now, here's my problem.

471
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:10,380
Whenever I partake in pieces problems, I like to buy a couple of cases of whippets to have

472
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:15,200
on hand in case I need to do some dental work or any other kind of thing.

473
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,220
And I bit peas.

474
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,420
Isn't that like a small?

475
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,100
It's a little.

476
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,920
Now, here's the thing.

477
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,160
I'm going to get to that because this is why I'm blind.

478
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,220
I don't know what it is.

479
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,300
I'm going to explain it.

480
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,100
I'm going to explain why I'm blind.

481
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,700
I in the good people at the whippet nitrous oxide.

482
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,080
I thought you like a nice dirt company.

483
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:39,000
Now, many people use these little containers to whip up cream or to make deliciously delicious

484
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,480
culinary concoctions.

485
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,960
But the peas, the peas has found other uses for nitrous oxide capsules.

486
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
And he's noticed a disturbing trend.

487
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,240
And it's not just the whippet people, but they're going to take the brunt of my wrath.

488
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:59,460
Cereal boxes used to be 12 ounces.

489
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,520
Now they're 11 and a half ounces.

490
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,840
Ice cream used to be a half gallon.

491
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,340
Now it's one quart and three pints.

492
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:08,680
Okay.

493
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,940
Here's the thing.

494
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:17,660
I think that the whippet people are putting less and less nitrous oxide in the actual

495
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,480
canisters and charging the same price.

496
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:26,260
And I think that they've done this through these following methods of subterfuge.

497
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:26,720
Okay.

498
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,360
One is.

499
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay.

500
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,180
Just to be clear.

501
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,760
You believe this is how they do it through these means.

502
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,440
Correct?

503
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,020
That's correct.

504
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,300
This is how they lure me in.

505
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,560
As a good consumer.

506
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,160
All right.

507
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,560
Just to be clear.

508
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,200
Okay.

509
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,200
I must have 50 or 60 of these empty whippet boxes and each one holds 24 cream cartridges.

510
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,320
And how many is that?

511
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,500
It's enough for half of the problem.

512
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,220
How many is 24 times 50 cartridges times boxes?

513
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,100
It's a lot, dude.

514
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:05,560
It's way more than one little Irish man should have in his house at 6428 Dolby Peak Drive,

515
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,300
Las Vegas, Nevada.

516
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:06,880
Come on.

517
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,940
What did this handsome man do?

518
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,980
His blind eye so we don't have to be here until 11 o'clock?

519
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:11,740
Absolutely not.

520
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,180
I need to know.

521
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,100
That's why I asked so I can know.

522
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,240
They changed the color of the things.

523
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,860
You don't want to know, Fox.

524
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,120
You don't want to know.

525
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,120
From green to this like metallic-y, tinty looking green.

526
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,560
And the canisters looked smaller.

527
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,880
But I, being a good customer, said, no, no, no.

528
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,560
It's okay.

529
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,360
They were cold.

530
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,040
This is fine.

531
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,240
Whatever.

532
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,040
So I do my three little canisters, which usually gets me enjoying my whipped cream.

533
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,880
And I get nothing.

534
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,160
I'm like, what the hell?

535
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,280
So I found out it takes four now.

536
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,180
So I'm like, all right, well, maybe it's just me.

537
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,340
You know, there is a tolerance for things.

538
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,840
And I am old.

539
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,020
Maybe just I don't take oxygen with nitrous in it as well as I used to.

540
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,920
So I'm like, okay, I'm fine.

541
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,440
I start doing four when I'm doing my problems.

542
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,220
Everything's great.

543
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:12,160
Even at four divided into 24 is like six episodes of my hippie crack.

544
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,320
And if I get two boxes, I got like 12 episodes.

545
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,780
I'm good to go for the whole experience of having a problem.

546
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,020
But then I go and I get another couple of boxes.

547
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,120
And this time the boxes, they're no longer silver green.

548
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,760
They're back to being that weird lime green.

549
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,540
And they look even smaller.

550
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:40,980
And now my four canisters of nitrous oxide whippets from the Whippet company is not doing the trick anymore.

551
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,920
I'm very somber.

552
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,040
So I have to do five.

553
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,540
So I suspect that you know, blind eye and the Whippet people is that you have changed the color of your product.

554
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:00,440
And while you did that, made the canister slightly smaller and put slightly less nitrous oxide into it.

555
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,300
And by the whole thing.

556
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,680
This is an environmental disaster.

557
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,080
Your whole packaging.

558
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,060
Are you also manufacturing those canisters?

559
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,240
Yeah, they're just taking orders.

560
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,900
Bees don't fly the plane.

561
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,540
But if somebody is, it's because they love America.

562
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,200
Whippet factory and empty it of all these canisters before they burn it to the ground because you want to take the kids.

563
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,580
There's no sense wasting the canisters.

564
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,200
So take all the canisters out and mail them to me.

565
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,840
Peas.

566
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:37,820
6428 Dobie Peak Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada, 891 away and then burn the shit out of the factory.

567
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,260
And then next year festivals.

568
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,820
I'll be making like 12 bucks a fucking canister.

569
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,500
So that's why blind on.

570
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,220
All right, Dr. Fox is here.

571
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,960
Blending the church air right now.

572
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,020
That is the sound that you're hearing.

573
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,720
So that people, you know, hey, don't you edit the show?

574
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,380
What was that horrendous noise?

575
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,080
Yeah, what was it?

576
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,980
That was that was a container of church.

577
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,080
Oh, God, he made it a double.

578
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,140
That's what it sounds like when you breathe real deep.

579
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:11,880
All right, everybody.

580
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,500
The bottom of your ball sack.

581
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:20,600
It's the it's the peas and fit show because Dr. Engineer Dr. Fox is just doing it.

582
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,020
The Whippet people are screwing all of us.

583
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,420
Don't stand for it up to.

584
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,680
You know, how about this?

585
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,100
I'm half tempted to blind.

586
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,040
I you, Dr. Fox and you, Reverend Pease.

587
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,200
I'm tempted.

588
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,860
I'm half tempted because look, look at you.

589
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh, yeah.

590
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,500
I had to when it comes to it.

591
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,900
And again, kids, you know, if you don't do drugs, drugs will do you.

592
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,880
So do drugs, especially now, because you're listening to this show.

593
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,760
You you really better start doing your drugs now.

594
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,560
Or the way.

595
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,080
Just a little bit.

596
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,300
You know, you're going to start managing your expectations.

597
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,480
Audience has already spoken.

598
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:12,680
But this is the best blind eye they've ever heard in the in the whole history of blind eyes and all 37 shows over six seasons.

599
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,040
I know.

600
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,680
This has been the best blind eye.

601
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,980
You know, I like I like the drugs that don't involve hypoxia.

602
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,420
I like the drugs that just work because of the drug.

603
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,440
You're not going to you know, you can't hurt yourself too badly from Whippets.

604
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,380
Well, it's not if you if you're not that smart to begin with.

605
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,620
Too badly.

606
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,220
You might fall down.

607
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,740
Well, you you couldn't.

608
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,740
I mean, there ain't a lot.

609
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,220
Oh, no.

610
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,660
Oh, no.

611
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,720
I'm an experienced.

612
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,160
I listen, kids.

613
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,480
You know, when you're talking to Uncle Pease, he knows his way around.

614
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Oh, he's OK.

615
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,660
You know, wow.

616
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,340
All right.

617
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,680
The last thing you hear on a trip.

618
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,940
Breathe this tears.

619
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,560
Read this, Timmy.

620
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,420
Let's let's read the Catholic Bible together.

621
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,020
Speaking to read this to me.

622
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,840
Who's your blind?

623
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,040
Who's your blind eyepiece?

624
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,860
That was my blind eye.

625
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,180
The Whippet Company for screwing me out of my little.

626
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

627
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm sorry.

628
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,980
I was high on nitrous.

629
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,140
I must have totally forgot.

630
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,060
I heard it five more times.

631
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,440
Yeah.

632
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,680
Who's your boy?

633
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,300
I wrote it down.

634
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,200
You want me to repeat it?

635
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:18,640
Argus Fox.

636
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,080
Hey, who's your blind eye?

637
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,500
Fox?

638
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,360
Who's mine?

639
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,820
Yeah.

640
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,440
Well, what's the blind eye?

641
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,040
I forget.

642
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,080
This is a weasel.

643
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,920
It's a mystery.

644
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh, Dr. Pease.

645
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,840
Fox.

646
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,760
He did the Whippet.

647
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,920
That's why I can't remember.

648
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,360
You know what?

649
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,880
All right.

650
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,560
I'll do mine.

651
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,340
How about this?

652
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,920
Yeah, dude.

653
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,600
He did a big church chair.

654
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,480
He did a big one.

655
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,380
How many?

656
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:47,280
And then his forehead collided very affectionately with the desk in front of him.

657
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:56,100
And so I'll do my blind eye first while I let him regain his bearings.

658
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
Who's your blind eye?

659
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,560
My blind eye?

660
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,240
I got mine.

661
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,840
Dude, that was pretty bad.

662
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,200
I'll wait, though.

663
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,980
No, go right ahead.

664
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,480
That was pretty bad.

665
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:04,640
Yeah.

666
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,860
All right.

667
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,760
So my blind eye is...

668
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,940
You know, I'll be honest.

669
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,120
I didn't write a blind eye this week.

670
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,360
What?

671
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,500
I wrote everything but a blind eye.

672
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,620
You didn't.

673
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,140
You have no viewer mail either.

674
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,140
I have a viewer mail.

675
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm looking at it right now.

676
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,340
But I'm going to go with my backup blind eye, my donut blind eye.

677
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:25,640
Okay.

678
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,740
The one that's only good for 50% of the time.

679
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:27,740


680
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:27,740


681
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:27,740


682
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:27,740


683
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:27,740


684
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,220
Okay.

685
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


686
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


687
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


688
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


689
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


690
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


691
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


692
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,520
You're going to take 40 miles, which is all it should take, Isis, because I'm talking

693
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,420
about a big, big, big, big target right here.

694
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,060
Like Canada.

695
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,600
It's just about everybody.

696
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,840
That's who I'm...

697
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,820
Just about everybody.

698
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,460
And why just about everybody?

699
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,600
And why not everybody?

700
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,760
Because just about everybody...

701
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,840
It's almost everybody.

702
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,700
They engage in this behavior.

703
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,580
Have you ever noticed...

704
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:53,960
Yes.

705
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,580
Masturbation.

706
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,640
Have you ever noticed...

707
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,720
If you carry, like, a crank that'sливy or something like that, they'll get stuck

708
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:57,720


709
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:57,720


710
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,580
a plate of food into a room,

711
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,460
whether you're in someone's house

712
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,840
or whether you're at Chuck E. Cheese

713
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,780
or whether you're at space camp

714
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,880
or whether you're in prison

715
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,960
or whether you're in the air traffic controlling tower

716
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,180
at an airport

717
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:24,860
or whether you're at the casting couch

718
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,000
for Nickelodeon Guts,

719
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,460
or whether you're at the White House lawn

720
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:36,320
or whether you're inside the whale.

721
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,660
The point is,

722
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,840
if you have a plate of food

723
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,580
and you walk into any of the aforementioned places,

724
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,480
not even limited to those,

725
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,100
everybody else that's in the room

726
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,260
will eye fuck.

727
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
And yeah, I know we were supposed to be clean,

728
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,580
Doc.

729
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,020
Mr. Fox.

730
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,400
But there's no other way to put this.

731
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,060
You walk into a room with other people in it.

732
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,880
There's many other ways to put it, dude.

733
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,780
Be it a courtroom.

734
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,040
Be it the command center of a submarine.

735
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,400
I mean, I can list many, many, many rooms

736
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,080
where there could possibly be people

737
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,760
when you walk into it.

738
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,520
And you have a plate of food in your hands

739
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,760
and you walk into a room,

740
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,020
everybody in that room eye fucks the shit.

741
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,740
Out of your plate of food.

742
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,640
And you might say,

743
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,240
well, you know, they're hungry.

744
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,260
But no, it's not even that.

745
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,680
It's just people are just wired.

746
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,820
They gotta eye fuck your food.

747
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,480
And, you know, my neurosis

748
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,000
is that once my food gets eye fucked,

749
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,920
it's not gonna be as good.

750
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,040
Did we mention earlier in the show

751
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,920
how Fit has a problem with food in general?

752
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:52,900
Well...

753
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,040
I just want to read back to the earlier part of the show.

754
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,360
Go ahead.

755
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,460
Good blind eye, Fit.

756
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,060
Oh, yeah.

757
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,320
Blind eye and food.

758
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,140
No, you're...

759
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,060
Eye fucking my food.

760
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,260
People that eye fuck my food, I blind eye you.

761
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,360
Everybody does it.

762
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,220
No, wait, how come?

763
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,180
How come you can't just walk into a room?

764
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,080
Like, I can walk into a room with a...

765
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,700
With like a...

766
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,340
I can walk into a room with a gun.

767
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,060
With a gun.

768
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,160
I can walk into a room with a beretta

769
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
and less people would look at it

770
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,700
than if I walked into a room with a gun.

771
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,780
I walked into a room with a...

772
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,120
With a hot dog.

773
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,720
With like...

774
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,680
Yeah, a hot dog.

775
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,260
Exactly, Dr. Fox.

776
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,820
Thank you.

777
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,280
I just find it to be a bizarre human behavior

778
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,080
that I've observed over the years

779
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,400
and I attempted to turn it into a blind eye.

780
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,460
But you know what?

781
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,840
It really didn't go anywhere.

782
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,460
I just kind of said what I was

783
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,900
and I didn't do anything with it.

784
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,300
It most certainly didn't.

785
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,680
Well, I told you I didn't have one this week, Peace.

786
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,440
Well, let's hear what Argus doesn't have.

787
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,860
Yeah, let's...

788
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,300
Well, I don't have one like Pease's,

789
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,540
which isn't like...

790
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,520
Dude, mine was the best one ever spoken on the radio.

791
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,940
This is the worst blind eye we've ever done.

792
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,040
Oh, my blind eye.

793
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,360
Come on, bail us out, Fox.

794
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
My blind eye was people that say

795
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,660
that they bet on their mother's lives.

796
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,360
Because it's such a cop-out.

797
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,200
Nobody likes your mom to begin with.

798
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,720
And I doubt if you're willing to bet on her life,

799
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,720
you probably don't like her that much either.

800
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,000
It's a sure sign you're a liar.

801
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,120
Yeah, come on.

802
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,960
Yeah, plus half of those people's moms are...

803
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,220
I swear, my mother's life.

804
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,240
You're a liar.

805
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:34,980
I hate you.

806
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,360
But you know what?

807
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,340
That was my spare.

808
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,680
That's a good blind eye, Argus Fox.

809
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,980
That's a solid blind eye.

810
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,560
We have a guest blind eye.

811
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,560
That is absolutely out of the three blind eyes given tonight.

812
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,240
That is the second best.

813
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,300
But we have one more blind eye.

814
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,300
It's impossible.

815
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,560
There's just three of us.

816
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,700
It's from our hypercube head of...

817
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,640
What department were you in charge of again?

818
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,640
Is this Kuru Drew's?

819
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,640
Don't make me say it.

820
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,020
Don't make me say it.

821
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,040
That would be the department of...

822
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,480
Where is my shit?

823
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,940
It's okay.

824
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,280
I already cussed.

825
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,700
So I set a precedent that you can...

826
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,540
No syndication for this show.

827
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,360
Is it?

828
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,380
Is it?

829
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,720
Yeah.

830
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,340
Yeah.

831
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:27,800
I...

832
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,040
All right.

833
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,580
So Aster Six, queen of hypercube, who's your blind eye?

834
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:43,020
My blind eye is food packaging and advertising people who can't really figure out how to

835
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,600
make things distinctive, like speaking into the microphone.

836
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,820
But yeah, I often find myself out shopping at the last minute.

837
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,680
And I'm kind of an absent-minded individual.

838
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,580
I don't always read the labels super closely.

839
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,780
And I've been on a spree lately of buying things in diet or other flavors that I did

840
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,720
not intend to buy.

841
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,540
Oh, that'll kill you.

842
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:09,540


843
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,520
And I don't want to drink them.

844
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,260
And now I've got this shit that I don't want to drink, but I bought it.

845
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,960
That's how you get Adderall on your system, drinking them diet drinks.

846
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,080
That's how you do a blind eye.

847
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,280
Go!

848
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,160
Go!

849
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,360
Yeah.

850
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,920
So fuck those people who make their life difficult.

851
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,040
Blind eye.

852
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,360
Who labels mint in beige packaging?

853
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,580
It should be green, right?

854
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,160
It should be green or white.

855
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,480
Right.

856
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,320
You know, something associated with mint.

857
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,560
It's diet mint.

858
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,180
Yeah, diet mint.

859
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:46,020
And like a green package with maybe little crystal-y things so you can imagine the minty

860
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,280
goodness.

861
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,100
You know, things like that and the wrong kind of salsa.

862
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,480
That would be good marketing.

863
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,700
We wouldn't blind eye those guys.

864
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,260
Because all the labels look the same.

865
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,920
But these beige mint dealing guys?

866
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,740
Blind eye.

867
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,940
Yeah, exactly.

868
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,360
You know, just, just, they don't need to be there.

869
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,180
They need to rethink their career.

870
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,120
Stupid.

871
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,420
Super stupid.

872
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,760
And you know what?

873
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,680
It's not just the diet because now there's a, you can do the same thing with not the

874
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,400
diet, but the zero sugar.

875
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,320
Oh yeah.

876
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:16,200
The zero sugar.

877
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:21,580
So you're like, you get, you get burned the first time that you go to the grocery store

878
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,420
and you accidentally get the diet one.

879
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,980
You're like, I'm not going to make this mistake again.

880
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm going to make this mistake again.

881
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,500
So next time you go back, you know what the diet one looks like.

882
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,760
You intentionally don't get that.

883
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,680
By the time you get back to the house from the second trip to the grocery store, you

884
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,480
got the wrong thing again.

885
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,120
Wait, I didn't get diet this time.

886
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,720
No, you got the zero sugar.

887
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,100
That's not diet.

888
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,820
It's another form of diet.

889
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:48,140
It's a system of signs or letters that could form into phonetic noises and sounds.

890
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,200
Man, I ain't got time for that.

891
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,500
I'm going to the grocery store at 10 o'clock at night.

892
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,640
That you could just look at the package and know what was in it by, I don't know, deciphering

893
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,980
this hieroglyphic, you know, thing.

894
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:55,980


895
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:55,980


896
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,580
That's the code that we could come up with.

897
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,140
The FDA.

898
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,520
If only we had such a system.

899
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:05,420
The FDA should require that all food packaging be in the form of emojis.

900
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,720
It's the only way people will understand.

901
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,700
We have to break it down for the lowest common denominator, people.

902
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,460
I'm not reading the label.

903
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:22,020
We have the greatest minds in the world bending our society to the least minds in the world.

904
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,820
It's a beautiful dance.

905
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:24,600
You know what?

906
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,760
That reminds me.

907
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,480
I want to know why this is difficult.

908
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,820
It's more dramatic, I guess.

909
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,160
It's kind of a Starsky and Hutch thing, isn't it?

910
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,800
I'm satisfied with it.

911
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,180
Good Lord.

912
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,780
Besides.

913
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,220
It would mean helping Helen with that experiment tonight.

914
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,940
Can't let her do it alone.

915
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,080
It would mean all night, which you're not very fond of.

916
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,280
Oh, my darling.

917
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,880
Oh, I love you so much.

918
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,740
I hope the experiment will be a great big success.

919
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


920
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


921
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


922
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


923
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


924
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


925
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


926
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


927
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


928
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


929
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


930
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


931
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:55,740


932
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,920
It will be.

933
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,700
You better be.

934
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:19,980
Nevertheless, in this intense struggle, we are unknowing poets.

935
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,920
Living on the riverside, taking it all in my stride.

936
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,380
Eric, wake up.

937
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,260
What is it?

938
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,620
Eric, wake up.

939
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,480
What is it?

940
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,680
You haven't figured that out?

941
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


942
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


943
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


944
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


945
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


946
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


947
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


948
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


949
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


950
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


951
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


952
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


953
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


954
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,680


955
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:43,040
still using all the muscles except the one that matters. I want exactly what you

956
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:50,180
want. I want everything. Would that include a bullet from this gun? Go ahead,

957
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,620
shoot. The best thing about being me, there's so many me's.

958
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:21,680
I've spoken it. Amen. Amen. Amen.

959
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:43,740
A lovely, if strangely random, respite there from time for the show, part of a huge audio

960
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:51,020
collage sent in by a new media barrager, Silas Jansen. I hope I'm pronouncing that name right.

961
00:50:51,720 --> 00:51:00,000
Now, a no-doubt welcome break from the male chorus of the old subgenius sausage party spouters,

962
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,660
the lilting femalian voices of the subgenius uberwomen,

963
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:12,580
of Austin. A chattering as is their wont, like pleasantly deranged magpies.

964
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,280
Anyway, but now that all the confederate monuments are properly noted as, hey, this was,

965
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,860
this was that guy, and this is why their statue is here, and don't do this.

966
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,040
Because this guy was a jerk. This guy's a real weenie.

967
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,980
Yeah, I think that's, I think that's, you know, now that that's all in place.

968
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,580
I think they took some down, actually. I, yeah, they get to go to the

969
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,940
the the you get to stay here museum, and and that museum full of like, you know,

970
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:50,600
all the not great people that are still somehow like, you know, cast into bronze and stone.

971
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,320
The museum of not great people.

972
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,500
Yeah, it's like, not the greatest.

973
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,960
These guys were ambitious and did things, but they just weren't the greatest.

974
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,260
You know, and everybody, I'm gonna say, I'm not comparing Genghis Khan,

975
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:13,500
to, to confederate war not heroes, anti-heroes, I guess.

976
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,460
Whatever they are.

977
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,800
I think it's an anti-hero at that point.

978
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,380
Jerks.

979
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:25,220
Jerks, yeah. Well, like, prominent people in their field of, of what they thought they were doing was

980
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:35,080
right, but they were wrong-ness. And, like, so Genghis Khan, you know, took over a lot of the, you know,

981
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,700
like, as far as he thought his continent, you know, far as he thought the earth went.

982
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,780
And then some, right?

983
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,160
Yeah.

984
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,020
He came to, he, there are a lot of, a lot of things happened because of Khan.

985
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,760
There's been a few people out there who've done things like that.

986
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,460
You know, and, and people are like, well, he killed a whole bunch of people. No,

987
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:56,720
he trained a bunch of killers. And he, he encouraged it. He didn't discourage it.

988
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,720
That's for darn sure. But also, he was such a nice boy to his mama.

989
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:00,660
Really?

990
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:05,700
Yeah. He was a real mama's boy. He did what, you know, to, to please her. So maybe

991
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:12,560
he wouldn't have been such an ambitious murderer if it weren't for his mama.

992
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,000
Anyway, Dr. Bruhaha, I will talk to you next time.

993
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,940
All right. It's great seeing you, animal.

994
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,900
Yes, I'd like you to come right up here and get on the microphone and let these good

995
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,540
people understand that story. That story that you want to tell about this beverage,

996
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:36,300
which supposedly causes madness, insanity, and death, and it's made from wormwood,

997
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,480
that dangerously psychedelic plant.

998
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:51,200
Ah, yeah. And it sure is tasty. Like super acidly strong licorice. Yes, that's what it tastes like.

999
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:58,780
Now, if you want to think of something that tastes bad, I would advise you to visualize

1000
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,520
the taste on the beverage.

1001
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:00,520


1002
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:00,520


1003
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:05,580
The tongue and the palate of Fernet Branca, the miracle liquid.

1004
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,100
That stuff is real bad. Real bad.

1005
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,200
They say it tastes like furniture polish, but who's been tasting furniture polish?

1006
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,580
Anyway, I agree. It tastes awful. But this, uh...

1007
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,860
This actually tastes good.

1008
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:22,060
Yeah, by comparison. This is the point I'm trying to make. Compared to that,

1009
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:29,420
to Fernet Branca, this powerful absinthe is refreshing. Besides, I have a chaser here.

1010
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,360
Several...

1011
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,160
In fact...

1012
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,660
So, there's a story...

1013
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,580
So tell the story.

1014
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,100
We need to hear that story right now.

1015
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,400
It's a very important story and it has a lot to do with subgenius history.

1016
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,160
Yes, it would, of course.

1017
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,840
This particular absinthe in this very bottle, this bottle that says smoking cat absinthe on the label...

1018
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,420
They call it the Green Fairy.

1019
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:58,420
We brought this to Ex Day back about...

1020
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,520
Oh, I'd say 12 years ago.

1021
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,660
And in the middle of the night, Doc Fudd...

1022
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:04,800
That's good.

1023
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:13,280
...and G. Gordon Gordon broke into our camp and purloined our bottle of absinthe.

1024
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,840
Well, sure, though, you would expect those two bad actors to...

1025
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,120
That means they swiped it.

1026
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,460
Yeah, they kiked it, see? They liberated it.

1027
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,980
Gave it the old five-finger discount.

1028
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,080
Yeah, right.

1029
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,520
They proceeded, then, to...

1030
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:30,520


1031
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:41,320
To rampage through the campsite, ending in a scene with all of the villagers chasing them with pitchforks and torches.

1032
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,380
Uncool, man, uncool.

1033
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,140
You can stir up problems like that.

1034
00:55:46,620 --> 00:56:00,500
At the end of the day, at the end of this night, St. Joyce and I come back into camp, and lo and behold, here was what started as a three-quarter full bottle of a hundred-year-old bottle of absinthe.

1035
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:00,500


1036
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:00,500


1037
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,040
A hundred and forty-proof absinthe.

1038
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,580
Uh...

1039
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,380
It was now totally empty.

1040
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:13,580
But at least it was used. It passed through some humans. It was not spilled on the ground like the seed of Onan.

1041
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,300
It passed through the intestines of subgenius saints.

1042
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,500
Well, there you go. And scoured them out, let's hope.

1043
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,320
But...

1044
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,680
As it is, I shall do my best to absorb this amount that I have been given.

1045
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,480
But the most important part to this story is G. Gordon Gordon.

1046
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,640
Gordon Gordon and Dr. Fropp were never seen again.

1047
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,420
Yes, he had to leave the country after this.

1048
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,980
Well, he lives in Portugal. He was visited there by staying last year.

1049
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,160
I haven't seen him.

1050
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,520
Well, he's there. He's in Porto. Yes, wandering the streets...

1051
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,580
Never seen by you again.

1052
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,140
...longing to come back, but of course, after this...

1053
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,000
You know, the story remains true.

1054
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:51,360
...not able to come back.

1055
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,940
Never seen by me again.

1056
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,380
Well, he disappeared, but on the other hand, you can just visualize...

1057
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:00,460
People are doing that to me all the time. They just go in and out of my vision, and I just don't know what to do.

1058
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:00,460


1059
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:05,340
But now that I'm here, I have a half a glass of Absinthe, so I'd like to say...

1060
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,700
Here's to Absinthe friends, both on this planet and off.

1061
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:12,760
Yes.

1062
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,620
Happy X-Day.

1063
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,940
All those who couldn't make it, who we wish were here.

1064
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,340
Okay, so...

1065
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,780
Whew, that's some stout stuff.

1066
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,660
This is coming with me.

1067
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,060
Don't see... Don't leave that here.

1068
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:33,540
...you can attract thieves and purloiners.

1069
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,500
Aren't you supposed to have a sugar cube about...

1070
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,320
Yeah, don't you like melt a sugar cube in it over a flame and...

1071
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,420
All this stuff...

1072
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,620
And then you inject some heroin along with it or something, is that right?

1073
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,700
I think a little...

1074
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,360
Famous French guys did that.

1075
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,440
Black smoke. Well, that's...

1076
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,660
Heroin and Absinthe.

1077
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,320
Right.

1078
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,940
Wasn't that a thing at one point? I think it was.

1079
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,400
Heroin was named for its...

1080
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,840
Heroic ability to end pain.

1081
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,600
And that's its primary function.

1082
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:14,600
Not just physical pain, which all instantly goes away, but also all psychological, emotional anguish.

1083
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,080
All the pain you were feeling that you didn't realize you were feeling until suddenly it's gone.

1084
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,560
So if you have any Bull Dada auction items, we're collecting those now.

1085
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,480
You can bring those to the front and put them...

1086
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,320
Oh yeah, we have here one...

1087
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,100
They're coming in all the time, folks.

1088
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,180
And I am here to assure you that this Bull Dada auction...

1089
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,440
Oh, this is kind of an interesting...

1090
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:46,820
...will be historic in collecting the valuable, unique, and even endearing cast-off junk of pure subgeniuses.

1091
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,080
This one has an interesting label on it.

1092
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:56,820
It says, caution, contents have been known to cause hallucinations and delusions in susceptible individuals.

1093
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,740
Well, of course that could be...

1094
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,240
And it's sealed.

1095
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,880
It's sealed. We don't know what's in it.

1096
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,300
Then we can unseal it.

1097
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,720
It says ugly on the outside, even uglier on the inside.

1098
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:16,560
Nonetheless, we must take it out into the light of day in order to flog it to its potential...

1099
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,900
It has a declaration of conformity on it and a bunch of UPC codes.

1100
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,380
Sounds serious.

1101
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,560
All of these things may be dealt with in the fullness of time.

1102
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,980
So X-Day's old enough to vote now.

1103
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,900
Now, Doctor Howe?

1104
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,760
That's because it's 21-year-old, Philo.

1105
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,520
Can buy liquor, firearms...

1106
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,960
It's a full major, and it can own property.

1107
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:45,820
In fact, all it can do is attempt to fulfill its objectives.

1108
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:54,080
But now, with maturity, some thought that those objectives would be fulfilled in one decisive stroke.

1109
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,060
Well, we thought wrong.

1110
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,880
Thank you.

1111
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,400
Thank you, Doctor Howe and Doctor Philodrummon for taking over the live show duties for me when I had to miss X-Day.

1112
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,840
But, friends, you need not miss the real X-Day, which will be the next one.

1113
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,540
July 1st through 7th of the year of 2019.

1114
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,180
Or what they want you to think is 2019.

1115
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,880
I prefer to think that this year is actually 1997.

1116
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,460
You can learn more.

1117
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,480
Such as...

1118
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,860
What planet this really is.

1119
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,880
That we're on.

1120
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,580
At the massive archival website subgenius.com.

1121
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,600
Everything on it besides this show is pretty old.

1122
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:46,100
But it points you to some Facebook pages and other internet forums that are fresh daily.

1123
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,860
In fact, they're just veritable faucets of bull data.

1124
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:58,720
And our beloved friends in prison can write to the Church of the Subgenius or me, Reverend Stang,

1125
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,900
or the dogs heard wrassling in the background.

1126
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:11,520
At Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1127
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:19,860
That's Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1128
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:28,840
And there's a GoFundMe for our poverty-stricken and near homeless friend, Lonesome Lone.

1129
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:28,840


1130
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,940
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1131
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,900
We talked about it last week.

1132
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,300
Dave said it was easy to Google his name and you'd find it.

1133
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,320
But he was wrong.

1134
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:48,060
You kind of have to do GoFundMe.com slash gm8su-dave.

1135
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,060
Isn't that handy?

1136
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,560
GoFundMe.com slash gm8su-dave.

1137
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:58,820
GoFundMe.com slash gm8su-dave.

1138
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:58,820


1139
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:58,820


1140
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:58,820


1141
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,560
And everything's lowercase.

1142
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,880
Thank you and praise God.
