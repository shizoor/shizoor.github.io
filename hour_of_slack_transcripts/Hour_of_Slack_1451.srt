1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Instead of making your dollars shrink by investing in United States savings bonds,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,240
why not make them grow with interest by spending needlessly when prices are high?

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,980
Here's the way it works.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,100
Seventy-five dollars invested now each month will in ten years turn into an income of one dollar

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,760
for as long a period as you forcibly bought forces of evil each month for a fact.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,660
But now...

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,480
The Soul of Genius!

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,640
Our Soul of Genius!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
Savings plans.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,240
Do you know your daughter well?

11
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,220
And do you know she's dreaming?

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,980
Do you know your daughter well?

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,660
Do you know your daughter well?

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,260
Talk to her soon.

16
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,280
Do you know your daughter well?

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,240
And do you know she's dreaming?

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,960
You know as well as I, she stays higher than the moon.

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,880
And do you know your sister well?

20
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,820
And did you know she's drinking?

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,980
Do you know your daughter well?

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


23
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,340
And do you know your sister well?

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,900
Talk to her soon.

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,840
Do you know your sister well?

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,760
You know I think she's losing.

27
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,460
You know as well as I, she stays higher than the moon.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,960
Thanks for the information.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,360
Thanks but no thanks for the information.

30
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,440
Thanks but no thanks for the information.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,300
Cause information's got your number too.

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,240
And do you know your brother well?

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,340
And the company he's keeping?

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,680
Do you know your brother well?

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,320
Talk to him tonight.

36
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,960
Talk to him tonight.

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,500
Talk to him tonight.

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,500


39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,500


40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,280
Do you know your brother well?

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,760
He's just a little strange, they tell.

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,140
Probably he'll go to hell unless you steer him right.

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,720
Thanks for the information.

44
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,300
Thanks but no thanks for the information.

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,900
Thanks but no thanks for the information.

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,100
Information, cause information's got your number too.

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,060
Well, yes, I know my daughter well, and yes, I know she's dreaming.

48
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,020
Said, yes, I know my sister well, that's the way it goes.

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,640
I know my sister all too well, yes, I know she's drinking.

50
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,880
How do I bitch at her for something she already knows?

51
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,020
And yes, I know my brother well, and the company he's keeping.

52
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, I know my brother well, he sings a different tune.

53
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,340
Yes, I know my brother well, I've heard it said he's queer as hell.

54
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,360
Pray that he's in love as well, higher than the moon.

55
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,700
Thanks for the information.

56
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,760
Thanks for the information.

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,700
Thanks for the information.

58
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,280
Cause information's got your number too.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,840
Thanks for the information.

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,880
Thanks, but no thanks for the information.

61
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,080
Thanks, but no thanks for the information.

62
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,840
Cause information's got your number too.

63
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,740
Yes, they do.

64
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Yes, they do.

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,080
Yes, they do.

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,080


67
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,080


68
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,080


69
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,080


70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,800
My boss would be rich too.

71
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,120
And you are boss too.

72
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,880
And his boss.

73
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,220
See that dame over there in the car?

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,040
Oh my God.

75
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,040
They keep on breaking my heart.

76
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,480
If only we could get out of this vile dog stout.

77
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,440
If we could only borrow business.

78
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,140
If only these vessels could get us out of here.

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
These tiny little boats.

80
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,940
A sponge raft.

81
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,420
Perhaps we can fashion some sort of crew device.

82
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,060
And maybe if we flap our arms very, very hard, we will go.

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,920
I can help keep you boiled up, old Davey.

84
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,460
You and thing.

85
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,320
I have some idea.

86
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,500
I think while some kind of craft that we can float on,

87
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,320
I think I know what we can use.

88
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
We'll make our own ship.

89
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,320
No, no, no, no.

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,060
There's no chance.

91
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,160
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,700
We'll make our own ship, yeah.

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,420
We have some mailing tubes and all kinds of marshmallow cream.

94
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,060
It will be good.

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,740
It will work.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,300
In order to sink, you have to lose your ship.

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,600
My friend.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,840
In order to fly, you have to lose your little poo-poo head.

99
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,940
Yeah, he flies all the way along because he lost his little poo-poo head.

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,460
They call this inappropriate laughter for those people confined in mental institutions.

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,500
Don't you know the walls around you have eyes and ears and nose and throat, doctors?

102
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,300
You must be aware that Dr. Ben no longer exists except for in your own face.

103
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,180
The cerebral sexual organs.

104
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,060
The what?

105
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,380
They're contaminated.

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,340
The Dr. Ben's no longer exist?

107
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,200
You're contaminated.

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,180
You call this?

109
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,540
He is contaminated.

110
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,820
And no one understands it.

111
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,160
It's a lie.

112
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,060
Ah, yes, it is the most contaminated music of all.

113
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,740
Music made by doctors.

114
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,560
True, enlightened doctors.

115
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,440
We're going to remove your hypothalamus with sound now.

116
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,320
Oh.

117
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:02,280
Now, Dr. Philodrum applies his saxophone to the patient's sacroiliac in this sacred act of love.

118
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,180
Yes, friends.

119
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,160
Surgery is a form of intimate love.

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,040
And the doctors of the airwaves will do this to your very inner mind and your inner brain.

121
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,740
Just trust a good doctor.

122
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,780
Now, he's going to take out your spleen and your hava pancus.

123
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,300
He's going to replace the soles of those ears.

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,440
He's going to replace those tired shoes with a brand new hardened belly button.

125
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,480
Just like the one you wanted to go.

126
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,600
I was here, but it's over, doctor.

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,780
Sit down here on this barbed wire seat.

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,400
Don't worry.

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,680
Don't wink and knobble about those little winkings in your eyes.

130
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,020
Now, they're just controlling your rapid eye movements.

131
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Those doctors have powers you don't know about yet, but you're going to find out.

132
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,020
Oh, you'll find out soon enough, my good fellow.

133
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,220
Oh, my good little nurse girl.

134
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,260
Yes, yes.

135
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,060
Come on into the operating room now.

136
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,980
The operating theater, we call it.

137
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,540
But on these rubber gloves.

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,840
Sit down, Dr. Cullens.

139
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,940
Pour this alcohol into your lap.

140
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,380
And here, drink some of this.

141
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,980
And have some of this gas.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,700
And take this pill.

143
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,980
And take this shot.

144
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,260
And then this night here, insert this deep into your chest cavity.

145
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,260
Now, take these pencils and work them gradually into your ears.

146
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,180
Now, put on these headphones.

147
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,040
And give me $20.

148
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,880
You notice the acrobatics we are doing now?

149
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,840
Look at me.

150
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,700
Look at me.

151
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,740
I am a monkey man.

152
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,480
Look at my strong forceps.

153
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,300
Look at my chin.

154
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

155
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,380
I bet you wish you could imitate this.

156
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,700
But no.

157
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,240
You need more.

158
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,920
More.

159
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,300
More.

160
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,160
Sound cut.

161
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,300
And more.

162
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,400
There will always be a need for more.

163
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,940
More slack.

164
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,660
And yet, more money.

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,060
More money.

166
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,780
More money.

167
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,600
And how, how, you ask me, Reverend Stang.

168
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,040
You say, how should I get this money?

169
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,440
With what you speak.

170
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,680
Because it's true.

171
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,900
Sure, slack is what you make of your imaginary, your dream.

172
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,420
But let's face it, we need money.

173
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,480
We don't need a bunch of this hoo-ha.

174
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,600
We don't need a bunch of new age gobbledygook.

175
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,440
We need money.

176
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,940
We need money coming into this radio station.

177
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,160
We need money coming into this radio station.

178
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,660
We need money coming into this church.

179
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,040
We need money coming into this wallet.

180
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,960
The one I'm sitting out of my butt.

181
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,080
Now I want you to get off your butt, my friends.

182
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,900
And get on down there to that sub.com thing.

183
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,120
And check out that because this is a prosperity ministry.

184
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,080
We are not going to sit here and just hope that some magical monkey's going to start crapping money out of its butt.

185
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,820
We want you to start crapping that money out of your butt.

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,540
So get with it, baby.

187
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,820
Oh, if only you understood.

188
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:05,900
If you were one of the brilliant shining lights of humanity, you would know that you can crap that money out of your butt.

189
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,240
Because these, these flying saucers make planets.

190
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:18,800
You know that you can create a better world for you and your mutant clones by simply following this.

191
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,080
Ow!

192
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,820
Ow!

193
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,200
Lugaaaa!

194
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,700
Oh, yeah.

195
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,100
It's not a big deal.

196
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,680
I was moving very close to some place I didn't want to go.

197
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,560
My head was throbbing, sure.

198
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,380
I had been knocked on the head three times by a bowling ball.

199
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,540
I didn't know what anybody expected.

200
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,440
Of course, the dame was no help either.

201
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,040
Sticking that strange substance down my pants.

202
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,860
I'm also trying to pick my donuts together with a safety belt.

203
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,360
I wasn't complaining though because I could still walk.

204
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,020
Unlike so many other Joes that passed this way before.

205
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Yeah, not only could I still crack.

206
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,300
I could still, I could still, I could still.

207
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,780
Walking.

208
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,480
Hey, you.

209
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,740
Hey, you there.

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,520
Well, lean on the corner.

211
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,680
Yeah, no, no.

212
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,040
You there.

213
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,720
Lean on the corner.

214
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,380
Singing man.

215
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,520
Singing man.

216
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,500
Yeah, what do you want, buddy?

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,440
I need a little help.

218
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:19,840
Hey, you got some money.

219
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,660
Let's go ahead and keep singing.

220
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,640
What, I'll attend to this, to this.

221
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,860
What, are you a cop?

222
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
You police or what?

223
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,700
No, no, I'm a, no, I'm a private dickhead.

224
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,940
Listen, buddy, I've been out of the car for the last five weeks.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,160
My pants are pretty shabby and, you know, I, I need a place to go if you catch my drift or.

226
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,180
Oh, you're looking for.

227
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,660
Huh?

228
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,220
You're, you're seeking something.

229
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm seeking something.

230
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:40,960
I see.

231
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,960
Here, here, here.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,300
Sit down, let me look into my crystal ball.

233
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,980
Thanks, I appreciate it, pal.

234
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,500
Close your eyes.

235
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,040
Let me look through this, the wallet of yours.

236
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,100
Oh, I see.

237
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,020
Hey, what you doing with my wallet?

238
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,560
I saw, I see.

239
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,240
Hey, now, just leave the wallet alone, hey.

240
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, I tell you what we're going to do.

241
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,840
We're going to go see.

242
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,120
Thanks.

243
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,780
Oh, we don't need to go see him at all.

244
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,060
Here he comes right now.

245
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,260
You gotta drink a lot of it.

246
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,380
Here comes the man I wanted you to meet.

247
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,080
His name is Bob.

248
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,160
And you're about to meet Cheo Bob Dobson.

249
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,500
Cheo, look, look at him.

250
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:08,960
Here he is.

251
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,900
What a, what a disgusting body.

252
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,680
What a, oh my God, I'm, I'm gonna pass out from the fumes.

253
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,020
I, I, I, I want to go.

254
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:18,020


255
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,900
Grotesque looking.

256
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,620
My pipe.

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,420
Where is my pipe?

258
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,980
Well, sure, it was the same pipe he'd been smoking all along.

259
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
Of course it was.

260
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,680
But Dr. Zoo Man also knew that there was something special inside that pipe.

261
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,940
Something beside the usual hamsopropolis that he had been smoking for the last five weeks.

262
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,340
Of course, it was the demon sperm itself.

263
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,240
Inseminated by his arch-feigned rifle.

264
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,800
Lawrence, could you please, could you please get your hand off me?

265
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,780
Demon sperm, my friend!

266
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,980
Are you a victim?

267
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,780
Or are you a user of the demon sperm?

268
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,340
Are you, are you addicted, my friend?

269
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,700
Are you, are you lost in bondage to the demon sperm?

270
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,220
I'm gonna smash some of them down by the riverfront.

271
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,040
Come on, now, you can, you can tell an old preacher.

272
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,880
They can't, they can't do it, and they can't move their limbs anymore.

273
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,100
What about this demon?

274
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
Their feet are all diseased.

275
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,300
Demon disease.

276
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,320


277
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,800
Most of them have eye problems.

278
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,560
Eye, eye, eye, eye, this.

279
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,520
You know, they're egocentric.

280
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Of course, they are the old wine of bums.

281
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Eye, eye, sir.

282
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,020
We make good use of them, yeah.

283
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,960
So Shanghai Willie, I mean, Shanghai Nelly.

284
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,540
Across America, medullary thyroid cancer, which may cause endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.

285
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,820
Swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat.

286
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,100
Fainting or dizziness.

287
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,640
Very rapid heartbeat.

288
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,660
Problems breathing or swallowing.

289
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,300
Swelling of the nose.

290
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,820
Severe rash or itching, which may cause a lump or swelling in your neck.

291
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,620
For a while, I took a pill, but it didn't get me to my goal.

292
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,620
Inflammation of the pancreas, pancreatitis.

293
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,800
Severe pain that will not go away in your abdomen or from your abdomen to your back.

294
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,200
Nausea, diarrhea, and headache.

295
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,660
Diet and exercise, with or without vomiting, may be fatal and should not be used.

296
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,740
Voids, chasms, and abysses.

297
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,160
Such phenomena have long exerted a pull on the human imagination.

298
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:26,320
Holes seem to resonate with us from the dizzying sense of standing on the edge of the world that one gets at the Grand Canyon.

299
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,860
To Alice's surreal experiences down the rabbit hole.

300
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:39,140
Metaphorically, we speak of emotional holes being left in our lives by bereavement.

301
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:47,840
But this is not only a human idiosyncrasy, perhaps an evolutionary hangover from our days as cave dwellers.

302
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,880
The truth is that holes are profound and important objects.

303
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:01,460
With the most famous examples being the black hole and lonesome cowboy Dave.

304
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,680
So, yeah, so what do you think I'm wearing the wrong headgear or what?

305
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,300
No, you've got the whole hole, Dave.

306
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,120
You're right.

307
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,240
Dave?

308
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,640
I've got the entire whole hole.

309
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,120
Yes.

310
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,640
Does that mean some kind of Gestalt thing or something?

311
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:26,760
You have the whole thing together regarding the holes in your personality and behavior.

312
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,180
You've got the whole Gestalt in your hand.

313
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,340
You've got the whole my Gestalt in your hand.

314
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,520
That's a lot of wind to be blowing.

315
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,980
That is a lot of wind.

316
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,080
Up someone's rectum like mine.

317
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,120
Which I'm not.

318
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,400
I claim to be very strong.

319
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,700
I have a lot of virtues.

320
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,100
I mean a few.

321
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,940
Are you bragging about?

322
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,620
What are you bragging about?

323
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm bragging about my own.

324
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,760
The hole.

325
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,440
Yeah, okay.

326
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,020
Your hole.

327
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,320
My own.

328
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,600
The hole between your ears.

329
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,420
Mm-hmm.

330
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,720
The hole.

331
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,360
That big vacuum right there with the curly noggin.

332
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,740
Have you been discussing the recent events in the.

333
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,100
Yes.

334
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,100


335
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:10,980
Sofalia?

336
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,400
Sofalia?

337
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:12,960
No.

338
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,440
I've been afraid to even know about those things.

339
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,420
But what about the events of Farfall?

340
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,620
Farfall is very highly balkanized and divided into many, many parts,

341
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,460
and that's why you have to cook it with chicken soup.

342
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,280
Ah.

343
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,640
But what about the country of Amerikey?

344
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,920
There was such one place.

345
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:48,500
And now it's denigrated into a pile of substandard ideas mixed about with cheese and fornication.

346
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,620
I hate to sound so rude.

347
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,620
Well.

348
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,600
But I believe it's the vast harlot of the billion.

349
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,180
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bobalon.

350
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,000
I'd like my American done medium, please.

351
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,860
Yes.

352
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
How do you like America?

353
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,300
Oh, sorry.

354
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,420
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:07,980
Rare.

356
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,680
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,240
Rare.

358
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,760
Not too many of them.

359
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
But one is enough.

360
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,640
Yes.

361
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,460
Ah, yes.

362
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,120
What if the world were filled with an equal number of competing Americans?

363
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,840
Well, that's what.

364
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,680
Eventually, that's what J.R. Bob Dobbs would like to see.

365
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,980
Everyone be a rich, fat, ugly American, but without working or struggling.

366
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,280
I mean.

367
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,280


368
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,960
Or hindering anyone else's slack.

369
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,820
Of course, that would be ideal.

370
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,820
But unfortunately, a certain group of very rich families got together one Thanksgiving

371
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,700
day and ate most of America for Thanksgiving dinner.

372
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,880
I thought I was going to say most of the inhabitants, which is true.

373
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,640
Well.

374
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,800
In many ways, the form of cannibal, social cannibalism they practice.

375
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,360
Hey, did a poor man ever give you a job?

376
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,560
No.

377
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,020
Nobody made a very, very moist, tender venison style shake.

378
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,640
Shake.

379
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,840
Smurf.

380
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,460
Shake.

381
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I read that phrase a lot.

382
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,800
Oh, you hate the rich.

383
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,780
Did a poor man ever give you a job?

384
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,960
There's all these.

385
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:32,740
I get the impression that a lot of unpaid people are working really hard for just a very few rich people.

386
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,780
And they're not even getting paid for it.

387
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,280
They're doing it out of love and out of hate.

388
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,220
Actually, more out of hate than love.

389
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,220
Their profits can keep going up.

390
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,740
So they don't want to stop growth.

391
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,460
You know what I mean?

392
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:54,880
That means nobody else can grow unless it's some sort of big, some two-meshed item coming out of the middle of their forehead, which doesn't pick up the signals right.

393
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,100
Which could be, you know, quite easily done nowadays.

394
00:19:59,460 --> 00:19:59,880
Oh.

395
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,360


396
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,740
Oh.

397
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,320
Well, yeah.

398
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,100
Well, yeah.

399
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,080
Yeah.

400
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,400
You mean like, yeah, of course.

401
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,040
So I wouldn't want to be one of the first ones to press the button.

402
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,260
And neither would I.

403
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,360
Oh, you're just trying to avoid responsibility.

404
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,160
Someone has to do those unpleasant jobs, my friend.

405
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,740
Someone has to push that button and carry that football, the silver football attached to the president's.

406
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,480
To the other world.

407
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:32,860
What?

408
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,480
Another one, anyway.

409
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,660
Yeah.

410
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:42,600
But, I mean, how do you think, I mean, what would you do if you were in Harry Truman's shoes?

411
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,420
He actually had the choice.

412
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,720
Should I push the button or not?

413
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,680
And he thought, well, it's going to be worse if I don't push the button, I guess.

414
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,140
Hard shot to call, ain't it, to commit genocidal stuff.

415
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,460
To thinking, well, maybe this will cause less horrible genocidal stuff.

416
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
Especially on our end.

417
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,760
Who knows?

418
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,940
I don't know.

419
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,660
I would hate to be in that position.

420
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,680
And only a madman would run for dog catcher, much less president.

421
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,280
But I guess that's what it takes.

422
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,940
A madman.

423
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,800
I'll second that.

424
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,420
Basically, one thing of this idea of, you know, there's too many people and we can't feed them.

425
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,720
The we who is going to, not Princess Weed, but the we who is going to feed them, just a few short while ago,

426
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,040
was the actual we who made them to give them back to the people who made them.

427
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Nowadays, you've got these genetically modified food industries.

428
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:46,440
I hate to sound like a normal idiot on the radio and stuff.

429
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,260
But they're taking away people's rights.

430
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,560
Don't worry about that, Dave.

431
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,300
I don't think you need to worry about sounding like a normal idiot on the radio.

432
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,560
Okay.

433
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,620
But yeah, what about this frankenfoods and gene monsters?

434
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,500
Well, they're screwing everything up pretty good.

435
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,060
Because all the frankenfood is frankenfood that has to be bought every year.

436
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,900
So you see, nobody can just go out and get some heirloom seeds and throw them and say,

437
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,980
Hey, here, I'm going to start a garden.

438
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,740
They've corporatized food production.

439
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,720
And they don't corporatize other things very good.

440
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,180
Imagine what they're going to do to the food and already have.

441
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,480
Well, I think Dr. Frankenstein got a bad.

442
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,820
Bad rap there because he grew his own.

443
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,020
Well, I mean, he raided a few graveyards for seed stock, but he basically built his own.

444
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:55,040
Well, they've gone and people who borrow genetics from one creature, you know, like from a wolf spider and they transplanted into a spider wolf and it turns into a wolf spider spider wolf.

445
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,260
And that would be cool.

446
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,340
That makes a good pet.

447
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,240
The problem is that if one.

448
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:09,240
Even one gets out into the wild, it will destroy the universe of all the smaller creatures nearby.

449
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,800
And then when it runs out of food, it's got to eat its own foot.

450
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,540
And after it's finished eating its foot, whose foot is it going to be sniffing at yours, my friend?

451
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,540
So you better watch those Frankenstein wolf spider computer gods.

452
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,460
They're everywhere and they are watching you.

453
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,060
Those aren't your neighbors.

454
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,300
Those are members of a gang out to get.

455
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,760
You Wolfgang.

456
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,920
Yeah.

457
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,520
They're all they're all Amadeus types and so forth.

458
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,020
They'll wear funny wigs and everything.

459
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:48,960
And that's that's one of the reasons why you have to be especially scared of them because they look so like, hey, look, man, it's like a guy doing Wolfgang Mozart and so forth.

460
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,680
Right.

461
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,600
Amadeus, you know, haircut and stuff.

462
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:59,700
Speaking of haircuts and credits, which I didn't give earlier, our collage titles were by Lemur.

463
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:11,440
The song, thanks for the information, is a newish live version of that Rainmakers song by the Rainmakers.

464
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,500
But it's from a DVD called 25 on.

465
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:22,500
And and for about eight minutes there, we heard some great old recordings from this radio station that I'm recording in now.

466
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,480
WCSB from an old hour of slack or maybe swamp radio from 2001.

467
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,680
But I can't understand.

468
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,860
I can't understand it because I don't think I was engineering in 2001.

469
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:41,680
And yet I was engineering that part that shows what it was like when Dave could still come to the station.

470
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,120
And his car still can't come to Cleveland.

471
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,520
I still drive home to Cleveland.

472
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,080
And and it was it was a little more.

473
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,780
It was fun having you in the station, Dave.

474
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,680
Even despite the well, the things that jump off of you.

475
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,900
And come with you into the station.

476
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,400
Oh, but the party before and after the show is even more fun.

477
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,620
Don't want it.

478
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,160
Oh, yeah.

479
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,800
When we put a guy in the fleet.

480
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,300
Yeah.

481
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:14,900
Yeah.

482
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,060
Blip burbit.

483
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,800
I just put some poundage into my car because of this awful winter weather.

484
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,620
Yeah.

485
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,340
Didn't want you.

486
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,540
But you have to constantly because you could freeze up any day.

487
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,620
Bear fat.

488
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,840
Buy a tire.

489
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,660
Because my tire was my.

490
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,940
I'm making my car shake violently.

491
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,580
Like I do sometimes.

492
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,820
Well, that's been going on for about 20 years now, hasn't it?

493
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,800
What did the seizures?

494
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,400
Yeah.

495
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,280
Well, your car and property and so-called liberty seizures.

496
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,160
Someone wants to take my property from my liberty or something.

497
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,500
Well, we were talking about trying to take Dave away from Ash Tabula and bring him to our X Day Festival event.

498
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,240
And oh, speaking of that.

499
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,040
Friends, for those of you with a computer or a phone that does like a computer, if you

500
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:11,960
look at subgenius.com, there's a whole new section about 17 X Day.

501
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,780
It may be important to some of you since it is the date that the world ends this year,

502
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,660
July 5th.

503
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:26,880
Anyway, there's a whole lot about our unfortunately yearly end of the world camp out.

504
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:36,480
If you go to subgenius.com and then look for either the word X Day or click on the events thing,

505
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,940
these are all on the front page.

506
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
People have trouble finding them though there.

507
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,960
I've had people go, I can't find where our slack is on your website.

508
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,260
Well, have you tried the second word in on the homepage?

509
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,400
I don't know what else I can.

510
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,860
So anyway.

511
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,900
Yeah.

512
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,820
I know there's a lot of, they're not Luddites like myself.

513
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,580
They're actually just a social rep.

514
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,260
They're lazy.

515
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,140
They're just, they're not Luddites.

516
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,460
They're lazy and they hate you.

517
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:14,680
And well, have you ever heard of the viscous fornicating machines that actually liquefying

518
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,340
with gel?

519
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,280
All the spasms these people had over say centuries, many, many centuries.

520
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:30,400
And some genetically they keep altering them more and more and more and more until all they can do is just liquefy the rock.

521
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,600
Wow.

522
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,520
No, I wasn't aware of those.

523
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,800
Well, you better cause they're sniffing around your underpants lady.

524
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,980
Viscous fornicating machines?

525
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,660
I wondered what that machine was.

526
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,760
Are we going to be genetically altered to the point where we'll also be cybernetic?

527
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,080
Well, I, uh, would you change?

528
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,740
I thought Bob was going to put it into all them guys.

529
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,660
The machine has done its work, played its part well.

530
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,720
So, unfortunately we're the cogs in the machine and must go under.

531
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,460
Yes.

532
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,620
Unless we can be greased properly.

533
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:17,020
My friend, if Bob Dobbs walked into your life today and said, you can ask me one question,

534
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,660
what would that question be?

535
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,460
What?

536
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,200
No.

537
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,420
No.

538
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,100
The question I just asked doesn't count.

539
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,320
I got that from the Slack Hole Facebook page.

540
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,460
I think Priestess Pisces asked that question.

541
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,800
What question would you ask Bob?

542
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,420
And a whole lot of people answered.

543
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:41,300
Most of them were the usual, you know, who put the ram and the ram-a-lam and ding-dong, that kind of thing.

544
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,780
But I instantly knew what I would ask Bob if he gave me the chance.

545
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,100
Can I go home now?

546
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,420
Yeah.

547
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,080
Home and do the work.

548
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,660
Can I go now, Bob?

549
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,120
Are you done with me?

550
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,020
Can I come back to what I was doing before?

551
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,580
Back in 1970.

552
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,320
So I could nurse my wound and put some cream back there, you know, some ointment back there

553
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,020
for everything you've done for me?

554
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah, Bob, can I go back to, can I get back to that comic book I was reading?

555
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,760
It's like a nurse, my wound is a bit too green.

556
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


557
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


558
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


559
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


560
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


561
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


562
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


563
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


564
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


565
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:16,760


566
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,520
Yeah, before you stuck your thumb in my eyes and made me see comic books that I didn't want to see.

567
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,380
Yeah, when you pulled your wool over my eyes.

568
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:26,900
Bob.

569
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,740
Can I go home now?

570
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,780
Should I, can I go home now?

571
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,120
Can I go to the bathroom now, Bob?

572
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,640
I really need to.

573
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,240
It's been 35 years.

574
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,140
It is sad though.

575
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,520
I know it's funny, but it's kind of bittersweet now.

576
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,240
It is kind of bittersweet.

577
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,540
Like a vacuum cleaner.

578
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:46,740
It is.

579
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


580
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


581
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


582
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


583
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


584
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


585
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


586
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


587
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


588
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


589
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,160
It has.

590
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,860
I'm sorry, guys.

591
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,120
It sucks.

592
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,720
It's sucks.

593
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,340
That was the word.

594
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,320
Speaking of sucking, back to the subject of holes.

595
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,380
This fascination with holes is also found in Outlet Mathematically, where curiosity about

596
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:14,540
shapes and the possible holes they may contain has given rise to an entire subject, topology,

597
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,740
emerging from radical research.

598
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:16,740


599
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,020
The research has led to several new approaches to geometry in the late 19th century.

600
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,980
Now, back to you, Dave.

601
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,680
Holy opening.

602
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,360
Well, I'm just saying the late 19th century was a time of great social turmoil and scientific

603
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,140
discovery, although if we go back and very critically look at it and examine it from the

604
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:38,420
viewpoint of a person living in the year 2014, we'd say, man, these people were sick.

605
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,360
Because even the coolest stuff they came up with was painted with this bizarre, I'm telling

606
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,740
you, their brains weren't functioning.

607
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:46,740


608
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,560
Luckily, we're so-

609
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,940
Most people who wrote the history books weren't too good at writing what really happened.

610
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:57,660
Oh, thank goodness we're so much better and more accurate and know exactly what's

611
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,320
going on.

612
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,320
What the hell is really going on?

613
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,760
That's what we know here in the early 21st century.

614
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:13,220
Yeah, you're absolutely right, and I want to back off in the form of a kind of a howling

615
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,820
retreating.

616
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:13,980
No, wait.

617
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,740
Monkeys retreat and let you know that what you know is not true.

618
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,980
I don't know what you said I believe is more true than the point I was trying to make.

619
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,400
Well, I don't know what I said, but if I said it, then you'd better pick up on it.

620
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,060
Well, you said once you ascend the height to see what has happened and what's going

621
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:32,280
on and all that stuff like that, you see a vast river that's going both ways, and so

622
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,900
you kind of-

623
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,540
There it goes.

624
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,360
Well, I'll let it rest on its own.

625
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,440


626
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:37,960
Ambevillent river.

627
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,600
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you-

628
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:39,840
Ambevillent river, yeah.

629
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,080
Dave, how are you able-

630
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,480
That moment, you, Princess Wee, are-

631
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,720
I'm sorry.

632
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:46,720


633
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:46,720


634
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:46,720


635
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:46,720


636
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,500
I forgot the word.

637
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,380
That was brilliant, but not almost.

638
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,980
Terranian, subterranean.

639
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,960
Subterfuge?

640
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,980
Subgoose?

641
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,180
Subinutia?

642
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,120
She subduced me.

643
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,600
Yeah.

644
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,980
The night we got married, she subduced me.

645
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,700
By the way, Dave, I've been meaning to ask you for about 25 years now, how has it made

646
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


647
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


648
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


649
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


650
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


651
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


652
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:16,700


653
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,600
you feel that you can play your guitar while you're on the phone like this, just chatting

654
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,980
away?

655
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,200
I've always been amazed when people could sing and play, but it's like you can play

656
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,960
and jam like this, and yet at the same time, you're just holding your conversation as if

657
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,000
you were paying attention.

658
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:33,960
It is amazing.

659
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:42,940
Well, it's actually a Wee guitar, or what's it called, guitar, that the chips can play

660
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,040
in the back of my skull.

661
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,000
Skull.

662
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,460
Skull.

663
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,280
So it's like Wi-Fi directly out of your brain and you're not having to use your fingers.

664
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:50,960
Cool.

665
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,780
For a long time, if you do remember in earlier shows and stuff, you'd hear some occasional

666
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,820
screw-ups between actually talking and actually playing and stuff.

667
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,420
Yeah.

668
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,860
Things would get weird there, but now I've got it, so I don't have to worry about it.

669
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,120
Whatever it's doing, it's doing.

670
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,620
Your synapses don't beat up on each other?

671
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,580
Well, they still do that, but that's not a contributing factor.

672
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,060
Ah.

673
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,920
The music still comes straight out of his brain, unfettered by taste or sense.

674
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,880
That is so awesome.

675
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,680
There's one moron who's saying I sound like a bad version of Hendrix.

676
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:40,780
Well, yeah, it is kind of bad version of ... I mean, even Hendrix couldn't be on all the time,

677
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,920
and they made him get up.

678
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,540
Yeah.

679
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,040


680
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:50,240
I mean, they'd be up at unearthly hours of the morning and go to work and play a concert

681
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,180
and then play another concert, then play another concert, and then they'd say, okay, you can

682
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,800
go to bed, but first you have to party with all the record executives until four in the

683
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,060
morning.

684
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,380
Then we need to get you up at eight for your photo shoot.

685
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,860
But I've noticed they never did that to us, Dave.

686
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,020
They never worked me to death or made me show up for photo shoots or anything.

687
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,020


688
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,600
Did they do that to you?

689
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,340
Did they make you do concert after concert?

690
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,340
Why you always ... I remember from all days of touring with the Church of Genius and various

691
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:36,360
bands and the electronic Einstein Orchestra and so forth, that thing is always missing

692
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,600
the buffet table, but the funny smell is coming out somewhere.

693
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't know exactly which room or part of the dressing room.

694
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,000


695
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,160
I think area where he keeps the salad, so to speak.

696
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,500
He liked the salad tongs.

697
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,180
Also, a big timer at the bar.

698
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,180
Yes.

699
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,440
A big timer at bar for anybody's business.

700
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:10,140
Dave's special times in the hotels and bars is one reason why the record companies don't

701
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,980
call us anymore.

702
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,900
In fact, I don't think they ever called us to begin with.

703
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,900
So don't blame it on Dave.

704
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:21,200
We can quit blaming everything on Dave as of now.

705
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah.

706
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,780
That should be a relief for you.

707
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm crying out loud for ...

708
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,500
I can relax for a while.

709
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,260
Yeah, I feel a little bit better myself right now.

710
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,680
Dave.

711
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,840
Hey, I guess I am gurgling a little bit as a telephone conspirator.

712
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,920
I think it must be the abominable monominal weather because it's the similar sound.

713
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,420
But I don't care.

714
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,800
I have another phone too.

715
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,820
It sounds okay.

716
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,240
I don't hear the drizzling.

717
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,760
I heard drizzling earlier.

718
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,220
My nozzle.

719
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,580
I heard your nozzle dribbling earlier, and I almost said something, but it went away.

720
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,460
Oh, wait.

721
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
I have to go fix it now.

722
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,840
And see, here's the thing.

723
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:06,860
I never know for sure if it's your nozzle that's drizzling or my nozzle because I can't

724
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,620
keep mine plugged up forever.

725
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,780
Well, if you've got a really, really functional third party, you can't keep mine plugged up

726
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


727
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


728
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


729
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


730
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


731
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


732
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


733
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


734
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


735
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


736
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


737
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


738
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:14,780


739
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:14,800


740
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:14,800


741
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,480
It's the third nostril.

742
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:22,300
It's the meta effect and the meta effort that creates a dew right up there.

743
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,360
Well, yeah, if you're really good, you can dribble out of your nozzle directly back into

744
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,080
your third nostril and you're done.

745
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,240
Yeah, like a mini horn cliers in Peru.

746
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,620
Without a neti pot?

747
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:44,020
No, the nasal cusp, the actual, the electronic breathing, the fire within, jolly old sleigh

748
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,780
rides and all that.

749
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,900
Did you say electronic breathing or electronic breathing?

750
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,980
Because one of those doesn't make sense.

751
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,620
Breathing is when you breathe in one nostril and blow out your nostril at the same time

752
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,560
you're blowing the double-reed instrument.

753
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:55,640
Oh, right, right.

754
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,080
Like the didge players do.

755
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,640
Like electronic circular breathing.

756
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,720
Yeah, or like double-reed players used to do back when they had analog instruments.

757
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,680
Or like Jabil's singing technique of an outside game where you'd sing, you are an alien.

758
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,480
But I won't do that again.

759
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,100
Yeah.

760
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,080
Exactly.

761
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:33,960
Fishingly, officially, not officially, strangely, unusually, I'm having a big trouble talking

762
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,640
to you.

763
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,580
Oh, I'm doing the Vincent van Gogh routine again, I see.

764
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,580
I think I drank too much coffee!

765
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,280
Keep your hands away from the mirror.

766
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,760
Because I drank too much coffee.

767
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:44,760


768
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:44,760


769
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,380
You're pretending to eat in the distance in the future.

770
00:37:52,540 --> 00:38:00,740
Maybe I should have gone to the b-b-b-b-b-b-bathroom first before I drank all that co-co-co-co-coffee!

771
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,180
No, no, no, no!

772
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,980
Oh, boy...

773
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,440
Oh, boy...

774
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,660
I feel better now.

775
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,740
See, that's, uh, why my humor is so funny.

776
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:14,740


777
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:14,740


778
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,100
a sophomoric and anal and child repentant

779
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,340
because you are his.

780
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,260
See, it's not all Dave's fault.

781
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,500
It's partly my fault.

782
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,460
Not his reflection of you, my dear.

783
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,040
And you are being quite toilety.

784
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,160
Yes, you made me cry.

785
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,280
Princess, well, you know,

786
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,740
I'm going to have to manually lower the volume

787
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,000
on each of those cackles.

788
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,640
He knows it's all an experiment.

789
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,680
Take no words.

790
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,160
It's just a fused cascade.

791
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,120
She can't keep her hand from the new, new, new fused cascade.

792
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,860
Yep, who the hell knows what that means?

793
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,520
I don't know.

794
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,540
I know I don't.

795
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm left out in the cold.

796
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,260
Well, I was going to let you and Dave

797
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,700
do the whole show tonight

798
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,640
because you had coffee.

799
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,280
And Dave, well, you know, so...

800
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,660
Coffee?

801
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,400
Yeah.

802
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,840
I had coffee.

803
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,360
You had coffee.

804
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,280
I was pretending that I...

805
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,660
I actually have had about 20 cups of coffee today.

806
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,460
That's normal.

807
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:34,980
After that first cup of coffee?

808
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,800
Yeah, the one you have when you're 16 years old.

809
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,400
After that, it's all downhill.

810
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,620
I remember my first cup of coffee.

811
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,560
All day long at school, I thought,

812
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,360
man, if I drink this stuff every day,

813
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,640
I'll be able to do anything forever.

814
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,940
You'll feel like an elephant or something, you know?

815
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,580
Yeah, yeah.

816
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,520
Now your nose will get real long

817
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,760
and you'll be able to pick up small trees with it.

818
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,620
But now it's more like I have a cup of coffee

819
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,320
and I go, okay, now I can go to bed.

820
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,480
But you see, I had a job

821
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,300
that when I was drinking the coffee,

822
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
I could really put a lot of people in danger.

823
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,660
By my vibrations of my hand.

824
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,260
So I had to stop drinking the coffee

825
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,100
and that lowered my tolerance, you see.

826
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,260
Well, you can't handle delicate instruments

827
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,380
when you're doing heart surgery.

828
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,340
That is correct.

829
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,100
After the 15th cup of espresso.

830
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,260
Now, because Princess Wee had a type of discipline

831
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,540
that I'll never know and didn't drink coffee for many years.

832
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,080
Now, when she has a sip of half-calf,

833
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,620
it's about like a line of...

834
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,500
It's about like an eight ball of meth

835
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,840
being injected into your collapsing veins

836
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,220
for a normal person.

837
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,940
But for her, she gets that effect

838
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,700
from a half cup of half-calf.

839
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,200
Right.

840
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,360
Go out and shovel the whole driveway.

841
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,880
Lucky her.

842
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,040
Do about 50,000 exercises.

843
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,320
I have to mainline hardcore coffee

844
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,940
just to go to sleep.

845
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,160
I'm telling you, everything's fine, man.

846
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,080
It's safe.

847
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,660
Are you all right, Dave?

848
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,960
Yes, there was, oh, an invisible thingy.

849
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,340
An invisible thingy?

850
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,580
On that part of my head that makes me angry.

851
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,960
Ooh.

852
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,720
Well, you know they have medicine for that, Dave.

853
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,900
Burry creature.

854
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,640
They can get some acupuncturists.

855
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,940
Electromagnetic fuzz of some kind.

856
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,240
Some sort of noise.

857
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,600
They can fix that with medicine.

858
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,080
Needles.

859
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,140
They have medicine for the invisible goo?

860
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,060
No, no, they do it with needles up your nose.

861
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,680
They put those acupuncture needles, but thicker.

862
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,420
They stick them up your sinuses right...

863
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,280
They can get behind your eye,

864
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,580
through the eye socket hole,

865
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,380
and into the brain pan,

866
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,900
and kind of wiggle it around a little bit

867
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,800
and stir it up,

868
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,660
and you'll forget your address.

869
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,740
I'm not quite sure I like this idea.

870
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,940
You'll forget your address to begin with.

871
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,760
That's the problem with a lot of times

872
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,560
is you...

873
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:13,860
You're not even remembering.

874
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,680
You're acting like...

875
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,500
Well, sometimes that'll stimulate lost memories

876
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,440
or even better, memories that never happened.

877
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,520
But sometimes you become confused

878
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,340
and you'll go to...

879
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,120
You'll walk into someone else's house

880
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,620
and sit down at the dinner table

881
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,100
and urinate in your pants

882
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,140
and start saying, you know,

883
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,260
some childish memory.

884
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,120
And you can't have that.

885
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,880
You can't have a...

886
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,020
And this is what the world's probably gonna come to.

887
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,640
There's just gonna be people wandering around

888
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,780
going in the wrong house,

889
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,780
the wrong hotel room.

890
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,180
Urinating in their pants.

891
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,260
Well,

892
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,940
I'm sorry I added that part.

893
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,100
It was for fun

894
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,440
and so forth and everything.

895
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,220
But you know what I'm saying?

896
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:48,600
I do.

897
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,040
Sitting down at your computer

898
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,740
and doing something

899
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,540
or eating your food

900
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,720
or arguing with you

901
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,400
about the species of supernatural beings,

902
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,260
whether they had me or not.

903
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,800
Are you talking about Super Bowl last week again?

904
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,200
Supernatural beings?

905
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,480
Supernatural beings?

906
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,060
What?

907
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,160
Was I talking about supernatural beings?

908
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,480
I don't...

909
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,320
The supernatural bowl?

910
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,040
Yeah.

911
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,500
What?

912
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,080
I got confused there.

913
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,080
For one second,

914
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,820
I got confused by what you're saying.

915
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,780
Fantasy beings?

916
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,580
I think I might have been influenced

917
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,300
by another histrionic paper

918
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,820
in the media

919
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,500
that analyzed the subliminal messages

920
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,240
of the entire Super Bowl,

921
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,860
including the on-field

922
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,700
as well as the commercial messages

923
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,520
and concluded that America's...

924
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,020
Well, a bowl is...

925
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,460
Party?

926
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


927
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


928
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


929
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


930
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


931
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


932
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


933
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


934
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


935
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


936
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:43,460


937
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,140
Party?

938
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,140


939
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,140


940
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,140


941
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,140


942
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,140


943
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,980
and perhaps the simplest observation

944
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,920
anyone can make about a shape

945
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,020
is whether it comes in one piece or more.

946
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,520
Yeah, and also if it's got

947
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,340
that omega shape...

948
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,440
That's the first thing

949
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,120
you got to ask yourself

950
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
about any shape.

951
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,900
How many pieces are there?

952
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,960
Is it truly one piece?

953
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,680
Or would you say,

954
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,580
well, this square part is one piece

955
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,320
and this round part is another piece?

956
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,680
And that's what they've known since the beginning of the first years of Zippy.

957
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,920
Since the days of occlusion, long back before people even had teeth.

958
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,100
That was the idea they used to like to bite into and stuff.

959
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,280
But the mind is just a piece of pudding or something.

960
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:39,040
The human mind once was like a hard leather you could chew on, but now it's like a flimsy little wafer, a little cracker, a dry cracker.

961
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:45,880
The Omega Bowl involves a hole. You couldn't have the Omega Bowl without a hole.

962
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,120
In technical terms, a shape comprising just a single piece is connected.

963
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:05,160
A description that applies to triangles, spheres, straight line segments, pyramids, the bagel-like torus, and many other more exotic shapes.

964
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,740
But if we were to take two triangles...

965
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,660
Two triangles with a hairy gap between them. Get it?

966
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,120
Two triangles with a gap between them, and then treat that pair as a single object.

967
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,320
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha-oo-ha-ha-oo.

968
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,780
As above, so below. Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ha-oo.

969
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,660
I think Levin's saying is being rather obtuse.

970
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,620
No, no, I'm actually...

971
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,300
It's esoteric.

972
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:35,680
I was...

973
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,140
It's a former esoteric.

974
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,300
Yes, esoteric.

975
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,020
Yes, esoteric.

976
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,020


977
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,580
Esoteric also.

978
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,300
I'm reading from a math book called Chaotic Fish Ponds.

979
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,540
That sounds like a good name for a day.

980
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,520
Chaotic Fish Ponds.

981
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:53,320
I guess if they can read Hawking, Steve Hawking, you know, the physicist guys, Hawking.

982
00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:02,180
If they can read Hawking's brain enough for him to talk like a really artificial sounding thing, then...

983
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,140
What's the matter?

984
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,000
Have you ever heard a man with stroke cancer before?

985
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,060
Well, there's none of that going on supposedly now.

986
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,620
He just...

987
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,000
He just...

988
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,580
It's just mostly his brain waves.

989
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,800
I mean, his thoughts.

990
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,140
You mushed his brain waves?

991
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:29,560
I read an interview with Stephen Hawking in Playboy, of all things, and they asked a question everybody wonders about.

992
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,260
So, do you...

993
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,280
Can you get your nut?

994
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,220
And he basically said...

995
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,040
And they said, are you normal or are you just...

996
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,960
Do you have some kind of freaky sex life?

997
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,400
Tell us about your sex life since you have this condition that keeps you paralyzed.

998
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:49,780
And he said, well, I'm basically a normal guy with normal needs.

999
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,920
So, take it from there.

1000
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,000
Oh, boy.

1001
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,820
So, in other words, yeah, it's probably a little frustrating.

1002
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,720
Yeah, but, you know, the impact...

1003
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,960
To not be able to move.

1004
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,720
From there, yes.

1005
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,260
You leave the imagination to...

1006
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,960
Why didn't you just come?

1007
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,440
Come out and explain the whole thing today.

1008
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,840
But, see, he can sit and just think.

1009
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,380
And sometimes I envy people who are crippled.

1010
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:19,980
But doesn't he have...

1011
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,460
Because it's like, well, then I wouldn't have to work.

1012
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,020
I could sit and just...

1013
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,240
You know how big our stack of unwatched yet movies are, Princess Wee?

1014
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,120
It's practically endless.

1015
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:37,240
Just think how wonderful it would be to be in an iron lung and have no choice beyond what movie you're going to watch.

1016
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:37,960
No.

1017
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,520
You could just...

1018
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,460
You don't like that idea?

1019
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:39,900
No.

1020
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:46,420
You could go to a social service agency and tell them you think you're losing your mind.

1021
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,860
And everybody would probably agree with that.

1022
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And then you get a special...

1023
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,400
You get to go on social...

1024
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,020
You get to go on a thing for crazy people.

1025
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,820
They give you money every month so that...

1026
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,500
But a lot of times you have to live where they tell you to so they can keep an eye on you.

1027
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,080
Right.

1028
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,420
It's easier than it sounds.

1029
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,360
I went to a doctor trying to get him to...

1030
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,080
To give me pills because I was crazy.

1031
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,160
And they gave me...

1032
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,040
They said, but sir, get this.

1033
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,600
I was told this by a doctor, but you're not crazy.

1034
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,800
So we're not going to give you those pills you want.

1035
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,300
And I said, well, can't you tell I'm crazy to get more pills?

1036
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,500
And they went, yeah, but that's not the kind of crazy we mean.

1037
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,380
It's like, oh, well.

1038
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,680
Oh, you get to pick and choose who deserves help for being what kind of crazy.

1039
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:36,800
Yeah, basically.

1040
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,940
Yeah.

1041
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,740
Yeah, like what brand of crazy did you want, doc?

1042
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,460
I can give you any brand you want.

1043
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:49,460
I'm telling you, McMurphy's rule is what's encompassing the entire United States.

1044
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,380
You would hope it was McMurphy's rule, but it's actually Nurse Ratched's rule that's running things.

1045
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:03,640
Unfortunately, she is the queen of the ward, but I think it's odd that we hear so many people talk about this in the last couple weeks for no reason.

1046
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,620
Just even in places like, you know, parks.

1047
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,600
Parks and public recreation halls.

1048
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,500
They were talking about this there?

1049
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:21,380
No, a bunch of people have been talking about, like, we're living in an insane asylum and we're all kind of like McMurphy or something.

1050
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,520
Like, we've got to pretend like, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,040
Oh, duh.

1052
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,740
Somebody's just now caught on to that.

1053
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:36,400
I guess somebody didn't read their kindergarten version of subgenius pamphlet number one.

1054
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,420
Page.

1055
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:41,180
One right under the first sentence, which I think is one dollar.

1056
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,980
I think that's what it says right there.

1057
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,360
You are being.

1058
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,440
Yeah.

1059
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,940
What you said.

1060
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,080
You are a being and you're in you're in big trouble.

1061
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,080
Well, that is probably the most.

1062
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,520
The first thing that comes to my mind is like a really tired chimpanzee.

1063
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,700
Somebody's trying to braid their armpit hair without getting beat up.

1064
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,220
You pull sometimes too hard.

1065
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,340
He speaks with the voice of experience when he does.

1066
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,180
He does.

1067
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,720
And it's terrifying.

1068
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:29,900
You think he'd been braiding chimpanzee armpit hairs of troublesome, irritated, large male pantroglodyte chimpanzees?

1069
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,820
Since he was knee high to a grasshopper.

1070
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:37,020
Not such little bonobo girls that, you know, want to do a bonobo handshake.

1071
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,800
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1072
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,680
We know what that means.

1073
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,920
No, no.

1074
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:53,640
It's arm hair, armpit, chimp armpit hair braiding all the way down for this particular radio show emanating from this particular world religion.

1075
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,380
The Church of the Subgenius.

1076
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:55,820
Right.

1077
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,500
Like, yeah, you can see Bob.

1078
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,160
It's not.

1079
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,480
You can see Bob as a lap dancer or a pole dancer.

1080
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,100
It's not like he's a male dominated figure.

1081
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,700
He's a man of any kind.

1082
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,760
Well, the way they say.

1083
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,780
But she's kind of a.

1084
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,940
Well, never mind.

1085
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,080
Between Bob and Connie, who were.

1086
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,360
Well, you know what they say.

1087
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,520
Well, I know Connie actually was a pole dancer for a while.

1088
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:31,300
But the illusion of Bob being a pole dancer and being able to, you know, put money in different parts of his body and have people come and earn that.

1089
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,060
Never mind.

1090
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:36,320
They say Bob's Bob's definitely the one wearing the panties in that family.

1091
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,240
Connie was a dancer in Poland.

1092
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,600
Yeah.

1093
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,400
I thought you knew that because you thought of that.

1094
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,940
No, I did not know that.

1095
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,300
I never knew that she was a Polish dancer.

1096
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,260
Well, you know what?

1097
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,440
What Gorski?

1098
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,080
Oh, crap.

1099
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,980
Whatever the hell they used to call in the pickles.

1100
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,600
You know what I mean?

1101
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,500
Both.

1102
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,320
Why Rob?

1103
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,040
Why Rob?

1104
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,660
Oh, yeah, that's it.

1105
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,320
I'll leave this conversation to you Yankees.

1106
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,400
I don't know.

1107
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,160
I'm from Texas.

1108
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:03,800
We don't.

1109
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,240
We don't see many people who are still.

1110
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:06,300
Yeah.

1111
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,300
I mean, I don't think they're still Polish enough to remember how to pronounce their names.

1112
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,900
It's not the name.

1113
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,780
It's the name of a type of pickle, which is very delightful.

1114
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,020
The Wolfkwitz pickle.

1115
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,160
I'm probably pronouncing it wrong.

1116
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:20,680
It may be.

1117
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,940
Is it pronounced more like?

1118
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,380
Yeah.

1119
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,060
I've never.

1120
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,720
You know, it's hard for me.

1121
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,260
I read a lot, but I don't.

1122
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,760
I don't listen to the radio or television being completely and utterly deaf.

1123
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,060
So I don't know how to pronounce things.

1124
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:41,600
You know, I made a big deal of what I earlier when I started this show.

1125
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,280
My fourth word was the word chasm.

1126
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:52,500
And I said that because to make up for the many times that I said chasm on Chaz's show.

1127
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:59,300
Of course, I really did that only because for Chaz's sake, I knew it was how to pronounce it.

1128
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,340
He meant to do that.

1129
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,440
Yeah, I meant to do that.

1130
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,180
He knew he was trying to start his own religion of Chazism.

1131
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,240
And he did feel threatened as a high.

1132
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,040
He popped it.

1133
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,260
He was going to be a Martin Luther.

1134
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,320
How's a little kid from Texas supposed to know how to pronounce chasm?

1135
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,800
It looks like it says be chasm or examine.

1136
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,480
How do you how are you supposed to spell out a word like examine?

1137
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:23,940
Or meant mizeled.

1138
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah, mizeled.

1139
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,940
I was mizeled by your crude pronunciation.

1140
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,840
But when I examine it closer, I got even more confused.

1141
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,820
Because of my frigilly ego.

1142
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,240
To use all of the cliches now.

1143
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,460
We chewed them up and spit them out.

1144
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Mowed the lawn of cliches.

1145
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,480
Where's the garbage?

1146
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,880
Where's our garbage bag?

1147
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,200
Our lawn bag for cliches.

1148
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,720
You took it right down to the dirt.

1149
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,260
Just tip it right down to the dirt.

1150
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,140
That's what I say.

1151
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:56,760
Let's do it.

1152
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,240
Toss them back in the recycle bag and mash them up some more.

1153
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,820
Maybe we'll find some even more weird words.

1154
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,520
I want it to be more funner.

1155
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,360
I want it to be more funner.

1156
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,940
I want it more funner.

1157
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:15,500
That's what that girl named who called herself Reverend Dildo Valerie said when she came to her first ex day.

1158
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,280
After about two hours, she walked up and said this should be more funner.

1159
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,840
What should be more funner?

1160
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,920
The act of self or the act of acting out the acting?

1161
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:33,800
I said, well, take off all of your clothes and get up on that stage and explain to us how it should be more funner.

1162
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:33,800


1163
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,160
And then she did.

1164
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,820
Well, no, she eventually did.

1165
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,760
She caught on.

1166
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,420
Oh, yeah, okay.

1167
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,080
We make our own laughs.

1168
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:56,580
And in fact, didn't she and Reverend Bunny Day appear at the costume party with no costume on except for a costume umbilical cord?

1169
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,480
Yes, that is correct.

1170
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,100
Connecting the two of them.

1171
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:00,680
Yes.

1172
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,880
As if they were each other's mother.

1173
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,920
Mm-hmm.

1174
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,020
And that's all they had on.

1175
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:18,740
Later, they appeared wearing nothing but black oil because it was a statement about the oil spill, the Gulf oil spill.

1176
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,340
Uh-huh.

1177
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,240
So these are the kinds of things you can expect to see.

1178
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:32,860
Creative costuming using minimal materials such as one long piece of red yarn or chocolate syrup.

1179
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,440
And imaginative beautiful young women.

1180
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:42,420
Well, one was skinny and one was kind of plump.

1181
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,780
And I believe you had dibs on the skinny one and I had dibs on the plump one.

1182
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,620
The way we had it worked out.

1183
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,920
But it was a moot point.

1184
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,840
It never came to.

1185
00:55:51,840 --> 00:56:00,100
The golden sausage lady and I guess she was dressed immaculately while she was born immaculately.

1186
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,860
And I can't conceive of that.

1187
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,660
I don't know what the next part was.

1188
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,620
But I think it was something like she was thankful for all that sausage.

1189
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:13,000
It grew on her body like a cabin boy grows on a werewolf.

1190
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,640
You know, you're actually, you're thinking of the X day before X day.

1191
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,220
The second drill in 1997 when that happened.

1192
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,660
Ah.

1193
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:28,060
The sausage grew all over that one really big woman that showed up and she said she was a sex goddess.

1194
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:28,520
Yes.

1195
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,440
And she had like organs of males and females all over.

1196
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:32,680
Ah.

1197
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,720
And she was in a costume of course.

1198
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:33,900
Ah.

1199
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,540
Underneath, who knows?

1200
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,240
Well, that's a question there.

1201
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,140
Underneath, who knows?

1202
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:42,840
Right.

1203
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:52,400
Because there could be nothing physical for us as humans as well, you know, whatever the heck we are, to actually say, well, there's a pancreas there.

1204
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,380
There's an idiosyncrasy over there.

1205
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,600
There's two valves and a hot cake here and stuff like that.

1206
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,480
They don't have, you know, organs and orifices like that.

1207
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:02,760
Right.

1208
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,200
They're different.

1209
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,680
They're trans-substantial and they're trans-functional.

1210
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:16,960
They could even like, if you think you're giving substance to an earthly body and all of a sudden you just want to disappear, you could change into another function.

1211
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:17,520
Right.

1212
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:24,660
All this cosmological conversation sounds a long way from experiments with a beach ball and a bagel.

1213
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:31,420
Yet, whether or not the textures of theoretical physics ultimately play a major role in our future understanding of the universe,

1214
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:45,100
the remarkable thing is that with the mathematics of holes now well developed, we can end this stinking hour of so-called slack and go home to our respective hidey holes.

1215
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:58,780
This has been the Hour of Slack number 1451 from the Church of the Subgenius broadcast in this particular rerun from WCSB in Cleveland.

1216
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:05,700
And if you want more information about this show, you can check subgenius.com.

1217
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:17,320
The music in the background is not really Lonesome Cowboy Dave playing over the phone, but some, a lot of really obscure Jimi Hendrix from obscure places.

1218
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,060
Mostly Dr. Drummond's hard drive.

1219
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,160
He probably got them from Bob and Bob probably recorded them with Hendrix.

1220
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,600
So don't ask me for copies.

1221
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,140
Oh.

1222
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,200
An O is a hole.

1223
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,660
I just thought I would add an O.

1224
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh.

1225
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:32,820
Okay.

1226
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,460
Well, we'll have to bring in Reverend Dennis Murphy to explain all about zeros, holes, and nothingness next week.

1227
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:46,600
And for now, Dave, I must thank you for calling in, but I must hate you for not hanging up.

1228
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

1229
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,980
Because it is nine.

1230
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,720
I'm doing outro.

1231
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,440
It's almost, oh, go ahead.

1232
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,680
Go ahead and outro your innie.

1233
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,320
Outro.

1234
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,120
Well, I was just going to say that I'd like to thank you.

1235
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,120


1236
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:07,760
I'd like to thank Reverend Dr. Ivan Stang, the Church of the Subgenius for the wonderful presentation, the faculty here.

1237
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:16,200
I noticed so many of the people that helped make the fresh fruit pies and the other kids who just helped along.

1238
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:16,860
Dr.

1239
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,000
