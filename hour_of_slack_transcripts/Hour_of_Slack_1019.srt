1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,400
Okay, I'm gonna get your money for you.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,780
But if you don't get the President of the United States on that phone, you know what's gonna happen to you?

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,140
What?

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,340
You're gonna have to answer to the...

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,840
Subgenius Power of Science.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:14,900
Bob?

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,520
We just turn our hearts to you.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,240
And we say right now...

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:00:59,980
Subgenius Power of Science

10
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,980
Subgenius Power of Science

11
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Subgenius Power of Science

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,080


13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,900
Subgenius Power of Science

14
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,360
Subgenius Power of Science

15
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,340
Subgenius Power of Science

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,980
And prettiness and all

17
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,520
So they stretched and they dressed and they made up

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,420
And put mirrors on every wall

19
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,160
Till they all went blind from ice cream

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,960
From the thing they wanted most

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Now everybody's so isolated

22
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,900
A good-looking bunch of ghosts

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,640
And the rainmaker came to town

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,060
And the people got what they wanted

25
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,260
The rainmaker came to town

26
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,360
And everybody got what they need

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,860
The rain came falling down

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,240
Cats and dogs and buckets

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,120
And the rainmaker sailed away

30
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,020
On a flood of relief

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
Hey, hey, hey

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,500
Well, the women just wanted their food too

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,160
Instant potatoes and rubber meat

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,180
The kids just wanted to watch TV

35
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,020
Now the girls can't spell and the boys can't read

36
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,020
The men just wanted a steady job

37
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,580
Now they got to pay the union mob

38
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,660
And everybody wanted to be free

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,140
Laws and rules should keep it that way

40
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,300
Hey, hey, hey

41
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,700
Hey, hey, hey

42
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,760
Well, everybody wants to be happy

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,000
Everybody wants to be warm

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,760
And be loved and liked and wanted

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,820
And have some kind of home

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,240
But getting it is work

47
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,420
And keeping it is tough

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,420
But destroying it's the easy bit

49
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,000
We all got the magic touch

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,480
And the rainmaker came to town

51
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,300
And the people got what they wanted

52
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,460
The rainmaker came to town

53
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,600
And everybody got what they need

54
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,180
The rain came falling down

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,460
Cats and dogs and buckets

56
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,420
And the rainmaker sailed away

57
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,300
On a flood of relief

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,480
A flood of relief

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
Now sail away on a flood of relief

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,160
Sail away, sail away

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,940
And the rainmaker came to town

62
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,000
And the rainmaker came to town

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,140
And the rainmaker came to town

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Webmaster Nigel Perry says the goal is to present a Palestinian perspective he believes is missing in mainstream media coverage.

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,580
That's the kind of thing that really disturbs you when you live there and you want to tell people about it

66
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,340
because what you're reading, the other people reading it said,

67
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,840
the country isn't even coming close to uncovering those realities.

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,200
Perry's page includes an in-depth look at the casualty figures for both Israelis and Palestinians.

69
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,020
Then there's another category of news sites that take aim at the media establishment,

70
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,140
using satire as their weapon.

71
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,240
From PR news in Washington, I'm struggling to find William Renquist on the island of Sumatra.

72
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,980
The hour of slack from the church of the subgenius regularly plays spoof newscasts,

73
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,600
like this fractured reworking of an NPR broadcast.

74
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,320
Thank you.

75
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:34,100
An Indonesian jetliner has launched a nationwide fundraising campaign to assist the people affected by PR news in Washington.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,440
Another satirical institution formerly based in Wisconsin lampoons the world's events with its own material.

77
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,420
Al-Qaeda vows to win the war on tourism.

78
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,860
It's the Onion Radio News. This is Doyle Redland reporting.

79
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,740
From PR news in Washington, I'm dangerously polluted.

80
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,600
The EPA has found high levels of toxic poisonous sewage.

81
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,940
Delta Airlines detonated a minivan near a crowd of day laborers, killing about half a million workers in the apparel and hospitality industry.

82
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,200
On Wall Street, 410-52912, President Bush is menacing North Carolina.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Meanwhile, the Senate Homeland Security Committee is considering ways to improve the nation's emergency complaints about the response to PR news in Washington.

84
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:41,080
That was Lee Murr doing PR news, and before that, NPR doing Lee Murr in a Wisconsin Public Radio report on the hour of slack, of which this is episode number 1019.

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,480
Exploring the conspiracy's weaknesses and avoiding our own.

86
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,500
Yes, dear friends.

87
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,720
The song that started this out was The Rain.

88
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:02,000
The Rainmakers doing the song The Rainmakers, a great song about the roots of the con, which is what we're on about tonight,

89
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,140
as demonstrated in upcoming clips by Reverend Norrell Preff, along with Fernand and Andy, and Joe.

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,460
The music in the background is Magi Cyclops.

91
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,780
Praise Bob.

92
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,740
Let me be real honest.

93
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm the kind of guy, when I go to a buffet, I hate to admit it.

94
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,460
I'm really being a pig.

95
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,580
Let me be real honest.

96
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,160
Around the buffet table.

97
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,580
I wonder if I'm the only one.

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,500
Yesterday, when I saw the buffet table.

99
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,440
Let me be real honest.

100
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,720
My first thought was, I'm the kind of scumbag always complaining.

101
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,880
Let me be real honest.

102
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,760
You know, it took me about a year to start hating talk radio.

103
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,860
Took me about a year.

104
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,940
You know, it's really sad.

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I could hate victims.

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm the only one that feels this way.

107
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,880
We're hearing 9-11 suckers.

108
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,340
Oh, shut up.

109
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,200
I mean, you know.

110
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,360
Let me be real honest.

111
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,840
Worst person in the world.

112
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,660
Dope smoking.

113
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,660
Rush Limbaugh.

114
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,240
I guess the painkillers wipe out your memory along with your ethics.

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,560
Rush Limbaugh.

116
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,060
Today's, today's worst person in the world.

117
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,520
Hey Rush.

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,160
Hey Rush.

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,980
Hey Rush.

120
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,740
Hey Rush.

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,580
Exploiting death.

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,180
Yeah.

123
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,440
Exploiting death.

124
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,460
And, and, you know, and, and, you know, dribble, dribble, dribble, dribble.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,380
Exploiting death.

126
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,660
Oh, that's, that's.

127
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,780
Oh, that's, that's, that's.

128
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,620
So as well as being a hysterical, paranoid ideologist,

129
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,920
or at least being manipulated by people who are,

130
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,680
turn this into camp fruit bat, camp not bag.

131
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,160
Fruit bat, camp not bag.

132
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,260
A person who was the victim of a personal tragedy

133
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,480
and who had gone over the bend as a result.

134
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,800
There's nothing about it that's real.

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,300
There's nothing about it that's real.

136
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Not real.

137
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,860
Not real.

138
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Just real.

139
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:22,860
It's...it's...

140
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,340
Poopoo this, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo, poopoo,

141
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,880
Y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y,

142
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,520
He was ugly! He was ugly! Ugly! Ugly! Ugly! Ugly!

143
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,860
HA! HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

144
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,200
Fat-ass drug addict, Rush doesn't know squat,

145
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,160
Fat-ass drug addict, that fat-ass drug addict,

146
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,160
Rush doesn't know squat.

147
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,360
From PR News in Washington, I'm carrying knives, razor blades, and scissors aboard planes,

148
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,160
making final preparations while clearing security checkpoints.

149
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,180
Several proposals are expected to become PR news later today.

150
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,280
Uh, uh, uh, but...

151
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,580
The United Serious Dog Agency tension.

152
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,200
Iraq's president says he is making Sunni Arabs accept PR news in Washington.

153
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,660
...very tension is fun.

154
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,180
Just you wait till our daddy hears about this!

155
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,420
He'll come and he'll blow up the whole castle!

156
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,860
Take them away! To the tower!

157
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,900
Enter the tower!

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
Nasty! Horribilig!

159
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,700
And very ugly!

160
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,060
Oh, she's going! She's going!

161
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,420
As we know, there are known knowns.

162
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,080
There are things we know we know.

163
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,960
We also know there are known unknowns.

164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,000
That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know.

165
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,100
But there are also unknown unknowns.

166
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,700
The ones we don't know, we don't know.

167
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,240
And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries,

168
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,800
it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.

169
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:05,840
...

170
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,180
...

171
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,680
...

172
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,260
...

173
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,480
Every name, every life,

174
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,080
is a loss to our military,

175
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,500
to our nation,

176
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,640
and to the loved ones who grieve.

177
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,740
There's no homecoming for these families.

178
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,300
Yet we pray in God's time,

179
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,640
their reunion will come.

180
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,080
...

181
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,760
...

182
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:35,800
...

183
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:35,880
...

184
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,920
...

185
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,360
...

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
...

187
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,520
...

188
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:49,880
...

189
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,060
...

190
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,100
...

191
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,200
...

192
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,220
You were born under the shadow of the bomb.

193
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,580
You were born under the shadow of the bomb.

194
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,000
You were born under the shadow of the bomb.

195
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,360
You were born under the shadow of the bomb.

196
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,180
Wings of Hell.

197
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,320
Wings of Hell.

198
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
You were born under the shadow of the bomb.

199
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,440
Wings of Hell.

200
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,320
Wings of Hell.

201
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,620
You are the first generation in the history of man

202
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,780
born under the shadow of the bomb.

203
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,020
You are the first generation in the history of man

204
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,180
to carry DDT in your face.

205
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,620
born under the shadow of the bomb.

206
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,640
Wings of Hell.

207
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,800
To touch and instill your confidence

208
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,640
sabe what those made for us.

209
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:48,740
Oh, 달려도는 ꇠ고 공通.

210
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,380
Which means living and knowing everything.

211
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:50,380


212
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,600
There is no estabanthis kalnya m�으로

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,540
That'd be some

214
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,220
Painting doll.

215
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,080
knowledge generates into an instrument of the classroom.

216
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,860
Your body will record in time the full effects

217
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,120
of the environmental destruction on mankind.

218
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,500
The elements of the environment are the

219
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,500


220
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,500


221
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:50,500


222
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,480
We are turning meadows into parking lots

223
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,060
and woods into houses.

224
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,440
We are building housing projects

225
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,100
at the rate of 3,000 acres a day.

226
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,940
There is only so much land to destroy

227
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,280
just as there is only so much air to pollute.

228
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,020
reasonable

229
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,020
Dial Us did that song by Devo, A Race of Doom.

230
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:10,460
And before that, before Dial Us, a Rumsfeld and Bush mix by Joe, who also did this.

231
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,220
We're not telling you the truth.

232
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,560
We're not telling you the truth.

233
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,220
We're not telling you the truth.

234
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,660
Jack off.

235
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,280
Jack off.

236
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,260
Disagree, disagree, disagree.

237
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,820
Bottom line, mass confusion.

238
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,020
Mass confusion.

239
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,080
Mass confusion.

240
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,760
We're not telling you the truth.

241
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,280
We're not telling you the truth.

242
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,640
We're not telling you the truth.

243
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:46,780
Bye.

244
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,100
Bye.

245
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,580
Bye.

246
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,880
Jack off.

247
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,540
Jack off.

248
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,320
Can you agree?

249
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,340
Jack off.

250
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,980
Intelligence. Intelligence. Intelligence.

251
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,540
You mean, what does Jesus think about what's going on right now?

252
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,620
Well, it depends on what kind of Jesus you would like to imagine.

253
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,420
I think if you think of Jesus as a guy who probably had some good ideas,

254
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,640
who died a few thousand years ago, he isn't thinking about anything.

255
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,180
But if, on the other hand, you think of this all-powerful figure

256
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,380
who squats on a cloud above your head and is waiting for you to be dead

257
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,900
so you can come up there and sit next to him,

258
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,160
I think that a guy like that obviously has a very perverse sense of humor

259
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,040
because if he made everything, heaven and hell and all business,

260
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,560
he also made the situation in the Persian Gulf.

261
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,460
He made that guy who works for Claiborne Pell hear the backwards word in Bush's speech.

262
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,480
This guy has got a hell of a sense of humor, but he's dangerous.

263
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,940
Seems like the thing that he gets the most enjoyment out of

264
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,620
is seeing people being mutilated,

265
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,880
which appears to be most of what is going on.

266
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,860
What's going on today in the world?

267
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,760
Most of the world is in danger today.

268
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,720
There's only certain places where people have comfortable lives,

269
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,380
and every place else is nothing but imminent danger

270
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,160
and death and destruction and pestilence and just horrible stuff going on.

271
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,960
Well, who can we blame for that?

272
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,200
Because if you blame the devil, then you have to think that the devil

273
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,020
is more powerful than that guy on the cloud.

274
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,940
If the guy in the cloud is the boss, he's the boss.

275
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,880
He's making it happen.

276
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,860
So what does he think?

277
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't know.

278
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,500
If he likes what he has created, as it said at one point,

279
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,520
he's satisfied with what he built, and I'm sure he's...

280
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,040
He's delighted.

281
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,660
He's delighted.

282
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,740
He's probably doing a little breakdancing up there.

283
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,280
Yeah.

284
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,520
And he can do it to tunes written about him, the Medivai who?

285
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:42,980
Of course.

286
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,480
I just want to know what the hell is going on, Bob.

287
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,300
You don't even know who I am.

288
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Okay.

289
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,280
Okay.

290
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,780
I don't see where I'm going.

291
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,160
Pod's not a nice thing.

292
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,240
And do you think you can idiot me?

293
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,000
Chief?

294
00:18:59,700 --> 00:18:59,700


295
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,200
Do you know how stifling this whole medicalono who's food?

296
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,400
An35 y.

297
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,620
We're conceptualized as a universal society.

298
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,920
Since we started this illegal officers,

299
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,600
we have both sides of the Rhine Ede kommen aus.

300
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,200
He saw what he was doing wrong, though.

301
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,400
So when recently a pienion that Rey radiores back to him,

302
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,980
said,

303
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,600
Now my job is to make sure the other side keeps on fighting.

304
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,160
Whatever side. I mean, whatever side we're officially not on this year.

305
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,380
That's our tax dollars, how they work.

306
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
You know, good always triumphs over evil.

307
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,620
Folks, it's time to evolve ideas.

308
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,840
You know, evolution did not end with us growing thumbs. You do know that, right?

309
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Didn't end there.

310
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,340
We're at the point now where we're going to have to evolve ideas.

311
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,740
The reason the world's so fucked up is we're undergoing evolution.

312
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,460
And the reason our institutions, our traditional religions are all crumbling

313
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,980
is because they're no longer relevant.

314
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,140
They're no longer relevant.

315
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,140
So it's time for us to create a new philosophy and perhaps even a new religion, you see.

316
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,820
And that's okay, because that's our right.

317
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,700
Because we are free children of God with minds who can imagine anything.

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,200
And that's kind of our role.

319
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,200
How do you evolve ideas? I'll give you an example right here.

320
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,400
Why is the drug czar of this country...

321
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,380
Well, let's go back. Why do we have a drug czar in this country?

322
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,020
A.

323
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,580
B. Why is he a cop?

324
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,700
Why isn't he a guy in recovery who's had an alcohol and or drug addiction and overcome it?

325
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,200
And why doesn't he help people with the same problem?

326
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,460
Why doesn't he help people who are on drugs?

327
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,320
Why doesn't he help people who are on drugs?

328
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,320


329
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,240
In jail, they're sick. They're not criminals.

330
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,560
Sick people don't get healed in jail.

331
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,440
See, it makes no sense.

332
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,880
And if we evolve the idea, you see,

333
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,420
the planet might be more compassionate and something like heaven might dawn.

334
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,600
I want everyone here to take the five dried grams I taped under your all chairs.

335
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,100
right now.

336
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
Under your chairs.

337
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,460
Check them out.

338
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:19,700
Check them out.

339
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,240
Under your chair.

340
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,000
Let's go, man.

341
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,220
The fucking UFOs

342
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,580
are waiting

343
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,440
in the fifth dimension.

344
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,060
Let's go!

345
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,480
Let's go!

346
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,520
Let's go!

347
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,420
Let's go!

348
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:04,520
Let's go!

349
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,060
Let's go!

350
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,180
Let's go!

351
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,500
Eslactica

352
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,800
by DaBinchi.

353
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,360
A new person.

354
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,100
DaBinchi.

355
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:28,920
Amazing.

356
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,340
There were sure

357
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,840
a lot of new doctors

358
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,640
popping up

359
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,340
like mushrooms

360
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,280
this month.

361
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,680
lately. Anyway, before that, we heard the late, great Bill Hicks, and before that, a

362
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,940
puzzling evidence cut up. And before that, or sometime around that time, Frank Zappa

363
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:55,260
on God. But now, another great mix by Steve McQuillan. Remember that Katrina collage that

364
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:02,060
was so good? Well, this is that same artiste, Steve McQuillan, with You Can't Protest.

365
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,180
I just lost it. What happened? Well, the police have been chasing and shooting at people

366
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:19,080
for the last two hours, probably. The young folks and the workers were just standing there

367
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,320
looking at them, and they basically, with their shock equipment and shock weapons and

368
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,480
bullets and beanbags, basically attacked the crowd, in my opinion. That's what I saw.

369
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:34,280
My tenure in the Marine Corps, I'm a platoon sergeant from Desert Storm. That's what

370
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,400
I saw.

371
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,720
My eyewitness. That's what I saw.

372
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,260
Unarmed people, with their hands on their heads, not doing anything. Being water-cannoned,

373
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:48,540
rubber-bulleted, and, you know, pushed and pushed and pushed with ten deep, black-footed,

374
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,220
thug-like police. That, to me, is terrifying. Terrifying. That is my worst nightmare, really.

375
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,480
Not very. Tied to three.

376
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,100
Yeah!

377
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,040
Probably.

378
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,780
But, where was the peine?

379
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,220
What the fuck was the penitentiary actually?

380
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,280
And we're the two!

381
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,300


382
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,780
I'm on a Brownie.

383
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:28,900
Wait!

384
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,240


385
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,540
Uh, as I've said, it's on that.

386
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:31,540


387
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:31,560
Yeah.

388
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


389
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


390
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


391
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


392
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


393
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


394
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


395
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


396
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


397
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


398
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


399
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


400
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


401
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


402
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


403
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


404
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,560


405
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,440
Goodbye now, everybody!

406
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,040
Goodbye now!

407
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,040


408
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,040


409
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,040


410
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:51,360
There are thousands of union members, protesters, as the FTA ministerial meeting continues today.

411
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,300
It has been a rough and violent day today.

412
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,580
The police have attacked protesters.

413
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,080
They're using tasers, electric shock devices, against the protesters.

414
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,240
They've been firing concussion grenades and tear gas at people.

415
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,400
They also are carrying guns loaded with rubber bullets.

416
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,860
And tear gas has been fired on a number of occasions.

417
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,860
And in several locations around the city, there are protesters that are pinned in by the police.

418
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,000
Well, he just shot a journalist in front of me.

419
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
They're definitely shooting a journalist.

420
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,960
I just got shot.

421
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,340
You're shooting the press!

422
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,800
Where do you want me to go?

423
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,140
Weird, man. You're hurting me.

424
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,340
Help! Help!

425
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,700
I'm going!

426
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,340
I can't believe they shot me.

427
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,580
They stole my 1290 WJN on microphones.

428
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,760
They stole my press pass.

429
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,000
They shot me twice.

430
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,840
They shot me in the hand, and I can't move my hand anymore.

431
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,560
And they shot me.

432
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,020
And they shot me.

433
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,020


434
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,520
And they shot me in the breast.

435
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,340
Oh my gosh.

436
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,100
I don't know where it begins all over again.

437
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,140
And it's on.

438
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,580
It's on.

439
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,440
And if you think you're free, then you better believe that it's on.

440
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,040
And it's on.

441
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,000
We'll forget everything.

442
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,820
Every band's in a strong.

443
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,800
Cause it's on.

444
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,160
And it's on.

445
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,060
And the crap, all the cream, they gotta fuck with me.

446
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,160
Cause it's on.

447
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,680
And it's on.

448
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,220
And we ain't gonna pop out.

449
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,300
Cause fuck you.

450
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,020
Cause it's on.

451
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,720
And it's on.

452
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,760
And you're gonna cut me.

453
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,580
You're not gonna take a kill.

454
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,860
Cause it's on.

455
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,420
And it's on.

456
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,220
Here we go.

457
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,840
Here we go.

458
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,220
North North Planet.

459
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,500
We are the place in the map.

460
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,240
We're gonna sign our riots.

461
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,780
We'll get the bull out my ass.

462
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,600
We're gonna sign our riots.

463
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,100
We are the place in the map.

464
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,960
We're gonna sign our riots.

465
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,200
We're gonna sign our riots.

466
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,860
We're gonna sign our riots.

467
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,320
They had paint bullets.

468
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,420
You name it.

469
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,000
There was no escaping from them.

470
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,760
Why did they do that?

471
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,100
We've got the news reporting that there's anarchists here.

472
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,600
And that's all they're talking about.

473
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,940
They're not talking about us people from North Dakota that are here to be the voice of people in North Dakota.

474
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,520
We represent family farmers, communication workers.

475
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,740
We've got neighbors involved.

476
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,920
We're all about grass roots.

477
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,440
That's all they're talking about.

478
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,980
That there's anarchists here.

479
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,800
We're gonna start a riot

480
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,640
We're starting might

481
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,100
We're gonna start a riot

482
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,460
You got all of that in there

483
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,520
We're gonna start a riot

484
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,440
We're starting might

485
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,740
We're gonna start a riot

486
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,180
You got all of that in there

487
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,020
We're gonna start a riot

488
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:55,220
Yesterday, everything came together.

489
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,460
Actually, it was a very successful day for the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department.

490
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,720
The police people are firing on people.

491
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,440
There's gas everywhere.

492
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,640
This lady right here has been hit with something.

493
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,640
She's crying.

494
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,940
Nothing happened that we didn't expect.

495
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,780
There's a battalion of stormtrooper guys and then there's the horse guys.

496
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,040
If anything, there were fewer actors than we had anticipated.

497
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:26,500
And then there's another line of police officers that are charging towards the protesters, really unprovoked.

498
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,720
I mean, not enough to fire a bullet at.

499
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,000
We knew there would be just a small percentage of people.

500
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
The percentage of the overall protesters to be anarchists.

501
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,400
Anarchists.

502
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,320
Anarchists.

503
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,180
Anarchists.

504
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,000
They're aiming again at everybody.

505
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,320
The only reason they're stopping is a camera crew just walked right in front of them.

506
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
There were fewer anarchists than we had anticipated.

507
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,360
They shot at a lady in a red suit.

508
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,400
She looked like a Republican.

509
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,840
She was just holding a sign and they shot at her.

510
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,900
They shot at her.

511
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,080
A smaller percentage showed up than we expected.

512
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:59,060
All they were doing is holding their hands up in the air and the police started shooting at them with the rubber bullet guns.

513
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,620
And we very quickly took care of them.

514
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,840
I mean, it was just like naming a booboo and then they got shot.

515
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,020
I don't get what's provoking these people to do this.

516
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,060
Why did they do that?

517
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:18,460
The reason that the police were so active in confronting the protesters was because there was a huge budget for security and they had to justify it.

518
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,260
Eight million dollars was available for security yesterday.

519
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,180
And why?

520
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,780
To protect 34 trade ministers.

521
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,980
All of that happened to protect 34 businesses.

522
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:53,600
And the powers that be, meaning Jeb Bush and his administration, used these heavy-handed riot gear tactics in order to send a message to anybody that might consider a protest for his brother if he comes down and campaigns here, that if you do exercise your First Amendment right to assemble peaceably, they will attack you.

523
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
So who did kill Bob?

524
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,960
How do you know that?

525
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:00,960


526
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:00,960


527
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,700
I don't know if someone killed him.

528
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,460
They only said he was dead.

529
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,820
Well, how did you die, then?

530
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,780
Suicide.

531
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,600
Look, you don't have to be straight with me.

532
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,860
It's okay.

533
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,760
But it doesn't lend itself to intimacy.

534
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,360
Are you looking for some answers?

535
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,140
Well, you've come to the wrong place.

536
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,940
You might be looking for a new place.

537
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:30,940


538
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,760
I find lines but no valentines written all over my face.

539
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,760
I bear no grudge.

540
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,540
I wear no crown.

541
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,960
I just come with calloused hands.

542
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,060
And I don't mean to bring you down, but there is no romance.

543
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:18,980
I've spent too much of my life waiting, hoping, dreaming, wishing, believing, and way too little of it living, smashing it up and taking and giving.

544
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:30,940
I wish someone had warned me while I was still a young man and saved me lots of time and energy.

545
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,640
Mother of a man

546
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,200
don't make me feelzurave.

547
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,220
Come to me.

548
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:40,220


549
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:50,240
No lie, my child, you don't feel very much.

550
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,340
Though I do feel hurt.

551
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,340


552
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:58,780
For the Lawdomme toe, or not the Lawdomo to toe,

553
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,060
And your poems and your diary pages

554
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:07,820
To kill some time in your old age

555
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,620
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

556
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:21,000
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

557
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,100
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

558
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,700
There may be gods who hear your prayers

559
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,820
And honest men who, men who care

560
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,000
And young lovers who say they will wait forever

561
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Lives that look like movies and books

562
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,600
But the sooner that you learn this

563
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,120
The sooner you free your hands

564
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,480
To get on with things that

565
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,080
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

566
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,120
It really matters

567
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,180
There is no romance

568
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,160
No romance

569
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,560
No romance

570
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,660
No romance

571
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,880
No romance

572
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,940
No romance

573
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,100
No romance

574
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,160
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

575
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,580
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

576
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,080
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

577
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,160
I'm a rocker

578
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,020
I'm a rocker

579
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,040
When Paul Krasner, St. Paul Krasner we call him,

580
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,840
was speaking earlier,

581
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,540
at the end, it was like a question and answer thing,

582
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,260
and somebody said,

583
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,920
well, Mr. Krasner, what are we going to do about this Iraq thing?

584
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,900
I liked his answer because basically what he did was not answer the question.

585
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,120
He put it back on the questioner.

586
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,620
We can't tell you what to do about this Iraq thing because we don't know you.

587
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,540
We don't know what you do best.

588
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,340
Ken Kesey said, put your good where it'll do the best.

589
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,440
Well your good might be serial killing.

590
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,100
I don't know.

591
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,040
You might be a good soldier that should be in Iraq.

592
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,340
I don't know.

593
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:32,820
And the thing is the conspiracy is bigger than you think.

594
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,420
Unless you're pretty old then you probably got a handle on it.

595
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,320
The reason I say that is because, and I was the same way, you know when you're young you

596
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,940
see that everything's messed up and you want to change it and that's great.

597
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,140
Well the conspiracy already thought of that.

598
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,680
They knew you were going to think that.

599
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:58,140
They knew exactly which type you were and which type of rebellion you were going to

600
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,100
do and they have a commercial for it.

601
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,920
They have a product for it.

602
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,380
Remember the hippies, remember the punks, we all thought oh man the music's going to

603
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,140
beat the man.

604
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,300
They always think that and it always turns into a beer commercial.

605
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,920
History is doomed to repeat itself.

606
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:16,920


607
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:16,920


608
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:16,920


609
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,440
History is doomed to repeat itself until next day.

610
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,540
Now in the meantime however, what I'm saying is, I'm not saying don't fight the conspiracy

611
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:32,720
but what I am saying is that you will not defeat it because even if somehow you became

612
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,760
world overlord like Bob already is, overthrew Bob and forced peace on earth, which is kind

613
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
of a funny concept to begin with.

614
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,680
You know?

615
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,880
It's still the conspiracy.

616
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:46,920
It's still the conspiracy.

617
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,500
The conspiracy still lives inside your head.

618
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:59,220
So I guess the point would be, sure go ahead and fight whatever it is that you consider

619
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:06,200
to be the machine or the combine or the conspiracy or the establishment or whatever is, or the

620
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,060
damn liberals or pagans or whatever it is that's bothering you.

621
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,460
You can't beat them but you can make yourself stronger.

622
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,900
You can give yourself a chance.

623
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,780
You can give yourself more true slack.

624
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,220
And when that happens oddly enough you have slack to share.

625
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:38,960
I've been walking in a deep sleep, sleepwalking but I just woke up from a deep sleep, a very

626
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,740
deep sleep.

627
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,280
I've been running under remote control in a deep sleep, a very deep sleep.

628
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,880
I'm a little too much, I'm a little too much.

629
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:46,880


630
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:46,880


631
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:46,880


632
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:46,880


633
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,600
I woke the moment I was told

634
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,260
That a smile is just a frown

635
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,240
Turned around on the face of a clown

636
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,440
With a mean sleep

637
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,460
It was a deep sleep, a very deep sleep

638
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,880
I can't remember what I used to know

639
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,920
In my deep sleep, a very deep sleep

640
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
Somebody help me now, let me go

641
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,660
Into a deep sleep

642
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,880
Now I just woke up from a deep sleep

643
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,940
Somebody push me back, now let me go

644
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,080
Into a dream again

645
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,240
To a sleep I like before

646
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,680
So deep it never ends

647
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,040
I've been caught inside a deep sleep

648
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,260
I've been caught inside a deep sleep

649
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:45,260


650
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,080
Sinking deeper after I forgot

651
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,160
That a smile is just a frown

652
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,120
Turned around on the face of a clown

653
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,240
With a mean sleep

654
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,440
In my deep sleep, a very deep sleep

655
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,660
Sleepwalking as I watch myself

656
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,780
In a deep sleep, an endless deep sleep

657
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,280
I keep pretending that it's someone else

658
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,560
In a deep sleep

659
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,460
Now I can't get out

660
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,740
Of a deep sleep

661
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:18,780
I've been a

662
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
Deep sleep

663
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,960
But I just woke up

664
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,200
From a deep sleep

665
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,940
Somebody

666
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:34,300
A lot of you, I'm sure, are into conspiracy theory, or at least are amused by it.

667
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Or maybe you're really seriously into, yeah, Bush caused 9-1-1.

668
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,380
Bush had those planes crash into the building.

669
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,800
Yeah, Kennedy was assassinated by the Republicans, not the mafia.

670
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,900
Uh, yeah.

671
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,440
They were hiding those UFOs.

672
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,180
That's fine.

673
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,560
Friend, it's your conspiracy.

674
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,960
You can make it as big or small as you want.

675
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,220
And that is the truth.

676
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,360
How much control do they really have over you?

677
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,900
You can repent and quit your job and slack off.

678
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,200
You may have to give up a few things like your home.

679
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,920
You know, but the conspiracy is only as big as you let it.

680
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,660
How big is it?

681
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,880
It could be bigger than any of the conspiracy theories.

682
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:25,480
Friends, for all we know, and in fact I happen to believe this, in 1940s, in the 1940s, World

683
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,720
War II was just a cover for what they were really doing.

684
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,620
That was just a blind so that we wouldn't notice when they switched the planets Earth

685
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,340
and Mars.

686
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,520
Now, is that a coot theory or what?

687
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,860
And yet, if you stop and think about it, even some of the theories that are out there, even

688
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,360
if you don't believe them, you can find proof for it.

689
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,080
Doesn't it seem like everything takes a little longer than it should?

690
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,700
Yeah, well, days were a little longer on our other planet.

691
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,200
Doesn't everything seem kind of heavier and you get more tired each day?

692
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,940
You feel a little heavier and older?

693
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,540
Yeah, well, on the old planet, we were a lot lighter.

694
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,500
Why do you think astrology doesn't work right?

695
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,260
The stars look different from there.

696
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,280
So, we don't know how big the conspiracy is.

697
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,740
There are those who think the conspiracy is really one of the sexes.

698
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,560
Is it, well, in the church of the subgenius, there's a women's brigade called the Connie

699
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,360
Yikes, named after Bob's primary wife, Connie Dobbs.

700
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,600
The mafia, we like to call her.

701
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,840
And then, by the same token, they have a lot of money.

702
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:44,840


703
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,860
They're going, oh, no, it's all patriarchy's fault.

704
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,600
Patriarchy did everything bad.

705
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,500
Women are all good.

706
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,760
Patriarchy's all evil.

707
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,840
Hey, man, we're all evil.

708
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,800
We've all got the conspiracy inside of us.

709
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:06,500
You have to cast the monster out of your own guts before you can start telling somebody else how to live their life.

710
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:11,300
It's like, yes, stop the war in Iraq.

711
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,860
End homelessness.

712
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,540
Do everything you can, whatever.

713
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,260
But can you mow your yard first?

714
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,600
Then tell the rest of us how to keep our gardens, okay?

715
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,040
Whee!

716
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,980
Boy, it's not a whatchamacallit.

717
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,880
It's a whirl in the jigger.

718
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,920
It's a human thing from up there.

719
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,520
All right, what'll it be, boys?

720
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,500
The leather britches.

721
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,540
The leather britches.

722
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,880
Bust down.

723
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,820
Her dance is tongue-in-cheek.

724
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:44,820


725
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,860
And with two tails.

726
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,560
Tails that spin and bend like mine could never do.

727
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,900
That's a human girl doing some kind of human dance.

728
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:57,380
Whee!

729
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,860
Please, no dogs.

730
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
At least there's no humans around.

731
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,860
Well, well, well.

732
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:10,760
Someday I'm gonna dance just like this human girl.

733
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,860
Whatcha gonna pray, Mr. Gray?

734
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,100
Gray is bucking mule.

735
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,120
Watch your buck.

736
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,460
Whee!

737
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,860
What's wrong?

738
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,120
I...

739
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,400
I don't have two tails.

740
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:33,800
Whee!

741
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,820
Oh, I thought you did, old...

742
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,140
Grrrr.

743
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm Trouble.

744
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:48,040
Iraqi leaders have given themselves another Jewish settlement yesterday, apparently pushing back their cars.

745
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,100
Around ten Jewish-stinians are leaving ahead of the government deadline to do so.

746
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,380
On Wall Street 21061-1016.

747
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,520
Spain's Defense Ministry says this is PR News.

748
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,020
Spanish national radio was another tragedy.

749
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,580
PR's more.

750
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:06,920
ARP drugs.

751
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,380
Four. Five.

752
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,640
Pfft. Pfft.

753
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,600
ARP drug. ARP shh shh shh shh shh.

754
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,720
ARP shh drugs. Government drugs.

755
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,500
PR News.

756
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:21,560
Israel says a new analysis shows a dramatic rise in the cost of PR News in Washington.

757
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,040
Hello there. There's been a lot going on in the London area, and there's been some pretty nasty Central and Northern Britain.

758
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,180
My, you're a boy!

759
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:37,560
Now the worst of it will still be pretty nasty, but to start with, it should be London in the morning to Lincolnshire, Norfolk and maybe Suffolk.

760
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:43,040
Further south and west, parts of Cornwall, Devon, maybe Pembrokeshire and Anglesey should peter out fairly quickly.

761
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,880
The main area in the east, especially across central parts of Britain, and possibly in the London area.

762
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:53,100
The next west-southeast with pretty miserable Scotland starts to nudge its way into the south.

763
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,100
I wish I could do my voice like that, yeah?

764
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,540
Thanks to Leigh-Murr.

765
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,280
And before that, Human Tales was by Vailor Trucks.

766
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,300
And before that, Devo did that song Deep Sleep.

767
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,160
And the song No Romance was by The Rainmakers.

768
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:20,580
All of that interspersed with yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, ranting at the 25th Starwood Festival last July.

769
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,040
But for now, let's look in on the American astronaut as he makes a trade.

770
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:32,460
Tam!

771
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,780
Hey, there he is.

772
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,280
Hi, Devo.

773
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:36,560
How's it going, buddy?

774
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:37,740
Fine.

775
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,980
What's the matter with him?

776
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,420
Ah, you know how kids are.

777
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,880
You sell them to a shitty planet and they think you're the bad guy.

778
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Yeah, well, I'm here to make it up to the little guy.

779
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,440
What do you mean?

780
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:52,900
I came here to take him.

781
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,160
Ah, nah, nah, nah.

782
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,080
That boy holds the only memory we got.

783
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,000
Mr. Valensky, you give me back the boy and I'll give you the chance to create your own memories.

784
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,120
What the hell is that?

785
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,100
It's a real live girl.

786
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:16,000
You take this, you grow her in private, you raise her, you teach her, you marry her.

787
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:22,160
All for a kid whose brief fleeting encounter pales in comparison to the experiences that await you.

788
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:25,180
Let's say I was gonna show her to somebody right now.

789
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:29,460
My daughter or wife or whatever the hell she is.

790
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,460
She looks bad.

791
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,840
Why would you want to show her to anybody?

792
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,640
What if I wanted to?

793
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,120
Yeah, you're right.

794
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,620
Hey, kid.

795
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,320
Take a hike.

796
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,140
When we first saw it, we knew there was just one thing to be done.

797
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,500
It was scientific.

798
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,740
And sociological.

799
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,480
That's right.

800
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,240
A lot of fun.

801
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,780
We knew in this world there could only be one.

802
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,240
The baby in the jar with glasses on and a gun.

803
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,460
Glasses on.

804
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,740
I'm not a doctor.

805
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:33,820
I don't know what you're talking about.

806
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:33,820


807
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:33,820


808
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:33,820


809
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:39,980
The boy who saw a woman's breast has left our planet.

810
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,900
Allow me to explain.

811
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:52,420
In this simple black case, I hold the dawning of a new day.

812
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,640
The dawning of a new era.

813
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:01,600
An era of sexually explicit conversation.

814
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:14,280
For here in my hand, I hold the case that contains a real, live girl.

815
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:22,400
She shall be raised in private.

816
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,020
She shall be taught all there is to know of our work ethic.

817
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,460
And on a daily basis,

818
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:38,200
she will be notified of the triumphs made by each and every one of your selfless efforts.

819
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,420
When she is fifteen and a half,

820
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,260
she will become my bride and your queen.

821
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,500
You will all partake in fresh fruit.

822
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,680
Brought here by the blueberry pirate himself.

823
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,260
And I will partake in fresh fruit.

824
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,440
And so,

825
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,940
I shall find a way to put an end to this sexual intercourse.

826
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,780
An act in which we are all a stranger.

827
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,940
But which,

828
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,360
upon my return,

829
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,100
I will describe to you

830
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,480
in great detail.

831
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,660
A ghetto.

832
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,160
Let's have a party.

833
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,860
I think we'll have a party now.

834
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,380
Let's have a party.

835
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,140
It's great when you get started out.

836
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,940
We'll throw our hands up and shout party.

837
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:54,600
We'll throw our heads back and say party, party, party.

838
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,540
Oh, won't you come and join our party?

839
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,980
Let's have a party.

840
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,580
I think we'll have a party now.

841
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,220
Let's have a party.

842
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,880
It's great when you get started out.

843
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,800
We'll throw our hands up and shout party.

844
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,580
We'll throw our heads back and say party, party, party.

845
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,460
Party, party.

846
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,720
Oh, won't you come and join our..

847
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,920
Oh, won't you come and join.

848
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,760
Oh, won't you come and join our..

849
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,820
Oh, won't you come and join our..

850
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,940
Oh, won't you come and join our..

851
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh, won't you come and join our..

852
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,540
Thank you.

853
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,120
Thank you.

854
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,180
Thank you.

855
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,460
Thank you.

856
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,040
Thank you.

857
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,440
Thank you.

858
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,500
Thank you.

859
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,520
Thank you.

860
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:30,820
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

861
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:02,940
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

862
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,360
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

863
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,880
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

864
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,560
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

865
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,340
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

866
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:24,580
I'll sing you a song about Bob.

867
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,580


868
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:24,580


869
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,700
About Bob

870
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,180
I'll sing you a song

871
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,540
About Bob

872
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,260
The Psychoskeletons, friends.

873
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,160
And before that, some me at the Starwood Festival.

874
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,020
And now, Reverend Circlemaker of Wales.

875
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:52,100
Reverend Circlemaker who is a circlemaker in the crops late at night

876
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,800
to baffle the pundits and please the gods of mirth and art

877
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,920
with this new rock opera.

878
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,440
Rock opera.

879
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,100
Rock, punk, punk, punk, punk

880
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:27,380
Bob

881
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,560
Rock, punk, punk, punk, punk

882
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,760
Bob

883
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,360
Rock, punk, punk, punk, punk harness

884
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,520
Bob

885
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,000
Bob

886
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:44,060
Bob

887
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,780
Bob

888
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,840
Bob

889
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,260
Bob

890
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,940
Bob

891
00:57:52,100 --> 00:58:05,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

892
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

893
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:03,520
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

894
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
