1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:10,780
Around Dard City and in the Territory on West, there's just one way to handle the killers and the spoilers, and that's with a U.S. Marshal and the spell of...

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,200
The Self-Genius Power of Swatch!

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,340
I gotta say, I'm having a better time here than I think I've ever had in any devotional.

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,860
Thanks so much to everybody who's brought us out here, this is great.

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,120
For people who wanted to bring us out, we love playing for Stang.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,880
Everybody here is laid back.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,600
Oh no, this is a much cooler crowd than we've been with in a long time.

9
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,560
I tell you.

10
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,700
They're actually smeared.

11
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,460
It's not great.

12
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,460


13
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,020
At that little protective world you're in, maybe somehow the Sudanese orriancraft may be

14
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,340
a bigger threat.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,440
Yeah.

16
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,340
For sure.

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:21,680
Oh no.

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,000
All right.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,540
from within that glowing cloud.

20
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,660
Radiation slack out, fall everywhere.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,160
Radiation slack out, last for a year.

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,380
Radiation slack out, it's already here

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,680
in this beautiful music world.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Get ready, ping-pong, they're coming after you.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,020
Get ready, ping-pong, they're coming after you.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,280
Get ready, ping-pong, they're coming after you.

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,620
From that big glowing cloud to that cloud.

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Radiation slack out, fall everywhere.

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,040
Radiation slack out, last for a year.

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,280
Radiation slack out, it's already here

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,560
in that beautiful music world.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,320
Get ready, false one, they're coming after you.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,380
Get ready, false one, they're coming after you.

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,720
Get ready, false one, they're coming after you.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,880
From that big glowing cloud to that cloud.

36
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,980
Radiation slack out, fall everywhere.

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,420
Radiation slack out, last for a year.

38
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,700
Radiation slack out, it's already here

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,940
in this beautiful music world.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Get ready, normal's coming after you.

41
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,920
Get ready, normal's coming after you.

42
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,980
Get ready, normal's coming after you.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,320
The normal's coming after you in that beautiful mutant world.

44
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,300
Radiation slack outs fall everywhere.

45
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,700
Radiation slack outs last for a year.

46
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:16,060
Radiation slack outs already here in this beautiful mutant world.

47
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,020
Radiation slack outs fall everywhere.

48
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,540
Radiation slack outs last for a year.

49
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,020
Radiation slack outs already here in this beautiful mutant world.

50
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,380
Woo!

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,460
That was, of course, the Mutant Mountain Boys live at 50 Next Day.

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
Another song by them will close this show,

53
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,000
which explains...

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,520
The concept for PR News by Lemur is entirely composed of an hour of slack delivered in the wind

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,400
before a live audience of the undead at Wisteria Campground on July 4th during 50 Next Day.

56
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,540
The panel participants include Dr. Howell, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon, Priestess Pisces,

57
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,860
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, all heard here fighting over seating at Tarzan's radio studio.

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,320
You don't have to... I mean, we don't want you to sit directly in front of that.

59
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not sitting...

60
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,420
I'm not sitting directly in front of it, you twiddlehead.

61
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm sitting... I'm almost in Dr. Howell's lap, man.

62
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:26,680
What's wrong?

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
What if you sit over here?

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,200
And what do you want for Christmas, little man?

65
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,620
Well, I don't know if he's even going to show up.

66
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,360
Then we'll be all over that.

67
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, he does one show.

68
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,040
Why don't you move over here?

69
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,420
He does one show in the sweltering oven, and we have to do two.

70
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,200
Move over.

71
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,420
Oh, thank you so much, Ivan Stang.

72
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,200
Sit next to Stang.

73
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,380
On the left hand of Stang.

74
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,380
I'm so pissed I bit the shell off my tooth.

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,080
Ah!

76
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,740
Well, welcome to our next segment of the Hour of Slack,

77
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,480
Bobcast live from the...

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,500
Live and in color, Dr. Howell.

79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:04,920
I mean, sorry.

80
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,420
Hello, am I there?

81
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,420
Hello, can you hear me?

82
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,700
The hysteria stage.

83
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,960
Yeah, right, right.

84
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,140
I am not enjoying this.

85
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,920
Are you Reverend A.P. O'Stacy?

86
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,580
Good to meet you.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
I thought that might be you.

88
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,080
Yeah.

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,660
Yeah.

90
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,700
Well, look at you.

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,000
It's almost human, except for the third nostril there.

92
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,780
That's quite nice.

93
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Well, friends, it's another live Hour of Slack here at Wisteria at 15X Day.

94
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,840
This is the last show we'll have to do.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,620
Thank goodness.

96
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,380
The world ends tomorrow at 7 a.m.

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,580
And you may die.

98
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,080
We don't do any shows en route, on board the...

99
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,720
Is that all?

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,300
Oh, yeah.

101
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,060
We'll continue partying on board the sauce.

102
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,840
Alien karaoke and so on.

103
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,760
Do we have to do a show from the sauce?

104
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,260
There's two.

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
Well, it's all voluntary.

106
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,560
You can have Muam be you on the show.

107
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,480
Oh.

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,880
It already knows what you're going to say anyway.

109
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,780
It's like God.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,260
Yeah.

111
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm glad somebody does.

112
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:02,940
God.

113
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,300
I'm going to change the slideshow in the background to subgenius art pretty soon.

114
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:15,680
But I've been having a bit of a psychological struggle.

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,240
Oh.

116
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,400
Those who've been following the Scrub Genius Forum may have noticed that...

117
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:30,720
Sometimes when I become anxious, this character named Stangor, who's much more confident, takes over.

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,520
The bane of subgenius art.

119
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,160
Stangor is a vicious virus.

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm so old that I didn't actually start playing video games until this year.

121
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,600
Somebody gave us a Wii console, which is the game platform for old people and babies.

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,420
Hey, hey!

123
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,580
What are you guys talking about?

124
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,400
Oh, nothing.

125
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,980
Why not?

126
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,220
Nothing.

127
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,600
Nothing at all.

128
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh, no.

129
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,040
We were just talking about aged things like whiskey and stuff like that.

130
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah.

131
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,260
Yeah.

132
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:56,580
No problem.

133
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,980
Gee, I wanted G. Gordon Gordon to see some screenshots of this game.

134
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,100
It's called Monster Hunter Tri.

135
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,060
That's Stangor, you see.

136
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,540
Ah!

137
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,380
Uncure.

138
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,620
He's not a naked barbarian.

139
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,780
I'm having an anxiety attack.

140
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,460
That lance he's carrying costs thousands of zenies and the lives of many slaves and dinosaurs.

141
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
It's worse than I thought.

142
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,900
There's the village as seen from the hill.

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
He really believes it.

144
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,140
There's a little...

145
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,680
He has...

146
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,540
Oh, there's Weedor.

147
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,400
Notice Weedor does not wear armor.

148
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,180
She looks a hell of a lot better than Stangor.

149
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:41,480
Yes, I've been keeping Weedor naked and ignorant as much as I can because when she's covered up with armor, what's the point?

150
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,700
Barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.

151
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,600
What?

152
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,180
Weedor is...

153
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,940
He doesn't have a kitchen.

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,240
He keeps her pregnant and in the swamp or something like that.

155
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,860
She's not really as vicious as Stangor.

156
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,720
He's got a nice set up.

157
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
Stangor loves to kill.

158
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,500
Now, I've been criticized a lot by this old man here for being into this video game thing.

159
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,860
Who are you calling old?

160
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,220
I never said a single thing about your pathetic obsession with that game.

161
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:19,220
Princess Wee and my little sister, Priestess Pisces, have both observed that I seem to be a lot easier going now that I'm able to kill a hundred demons.

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,660
I've been told that I'm better than dinosaurs every night.

163
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,160
Do you remember what they said in Georgia?

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,800
I go to bed every night wishing that I could take that sword and kill a hundred bobbies.

165
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,300
I can let my bloodlust drain.

166
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,040
Even more than a hundred bobbies, what I'd really love to kill is only about a dozen or so old doctors.

167
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,280
Oh no.

168
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,320
Elderly subgeniuses.

169
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,860
How can you talk to us like that?

170
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,560
Why did you assume I was talking about you?

171
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,340
Well, you're always talking about me.

172
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,000
No, I'm always talking about Philo.

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
And where is Philo?

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,640
I don't know.

175
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,900
Where is Philo?

176
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,120
You're conveniently missing.

177
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,700
When did you join the church? 1980?

178
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,580
Yes.

179
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah, well we joined, Philo and I were in there in 1978.

180
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,200
Hey, who paid for the first issue of the Bleeding Stark Fist of Dobbs?

181
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,960
That's your fault, not mine.

182
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,380
Okay, okay.

183
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,140
This is all being recorded on thermo-magnetic recording wire.

184
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:11,540
It's being recorded?

185
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,460
Yes, it is.

186
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,440
Every utterance that proceedeth from thy lips.

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,840
I take it all back.

188
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,980
No, I had nothing to do with it.

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,960
I had nothing to do with paying for anything.

190
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,800
Too late.

191
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
I've never given, I've never paid my $35.

192
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,240
What is said cannot be unspoken.

193
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,140
Never, and I never will.

194
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,680
I will never give you $35.

195
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,480
I might give you a few thousand Paraguayan pesos or something.

196
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,840
It should have been $33.

197
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,500
No, we got $10 out of you.

198
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,900
To approach the golden mean.

199
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Well, yeah, that's true.

200
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,560
But it's not because I felt sorry for you.

201
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,180
We're like shuffling around in the gutter finding empty wine bottles and emptying them.

202
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,100
You know, I know how it goes.

203
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,360
But there might have been a genie in one of those bottles.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,760
A genie in one of the wine bottles?

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah, that's why he was looking for them.

206
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,520
A wine-soaked rummy of a genie.

207
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,000
If I may say, I know my voice sounds rough, but I would like to recount what happened to me last night,

208
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,240
which was the kind of thing you read in a cheap novel or something.

209
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,800
Move a little closer to the microphone.

210
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,080
Okay, how about this?

211
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,520
All right.

212
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay, so what happened was I went down to visit a minister whose name was unknown,

213
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,340
and being generally a beer drinker in my later years,

214
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,780
my golden years, my autumn years, if you will,

215
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,900
I went under his suggestion and had a margarita.

216
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,360
And it was a very good margarita.

217
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,440
I hadn't had one in years.

218
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,760
And then he made me a second one.

219
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,700
And I think he was like a friend I had who was a bartender.

220
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,100
He came in, he'd mix you a drink, and he'd put four shots in it because he was your buddy.

221
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,460
And you went in for a quick one, and next thing you know, you're shit-faced.

222
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,600
So anyway, I did get shit-faced.

223
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,340
And I stumbled up the hill.

224
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,440
Crawling my way back to at least a bed.

225
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,020
And being a drunken married man away from his woman,

226
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,340
I had a surge of weakness.

227
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,760
And I must confess, noting that I had a small vial of antidote pudding in my pocket,

228
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,340
I went to a wide open upper level place,

229
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,660
opened my mouth with my head back and concentrated.

230
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,560
And yes, a face.

231
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,360
Something bat got me immediately.

232
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,320
You can go ahead and say.

233
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,780
A face fucking bat hit me right away.

234
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,540
And it was ecstatically painfully good.

235
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,040
They grow them big out here.

236
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,600
And I applied the antidote pudding.

237
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,060
But it was a young bat.

238
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,240
And they're inexperienced and it's too quick.

239
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,440
And when he would withdraw, he hurt my throat.

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,340
Which is why my voice sounds like this today.

241
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,540
And I apologize.

242
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,820
It's the kind of thing, you know.

243
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,040
A drunken sailor goes out and finds a hooker.

244
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,680
Well, you know.

245
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,340
It was nice.

246
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,820
But I feel very ashamed.

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
And that's why I'm confessing it to this whole congregation.

248
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,500
Very well.

249
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,080
You are absolved.

250
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,720
Thank you.

251
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,740
I feel no more shame.

252
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
You were hoping to turn them on.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,480
What?

254
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,240
They don't even know what a face fucking bat is.

255
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,560
I've got news for you, Dr. Gordon.

256
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,100
Your voice always sounds this way.

257
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,700
No, it doesn't.

258
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,540
So I have to assume that you've had face fucking bat dicks pulled out of your face.

259
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,040
No.

260
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,340
I've had like a half a head of them pulled out of my throat too soon every day for decades

261
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,920
now.

262
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,320
Come on.

263
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,080
You couldn't confess?

264
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,440
If you're going to confess, confess to the whole thing.

265
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,680
Well, I just thought they were like out of body experiences the whole time.

266
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,780
Most of us only do that for the antidote pudding.

267
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,600
Well, of course.

268
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,340
You'll die if you do the antidote pudding alone or the bat alone.

269
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:35,440
Well, yeah.

270
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,080
Well, I told you.

271
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,820
I was up here and I was ready for it.

272
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:37,920
You have to have the bat.

273
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,920
I had my antidote pudding.

274
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,040
The minute he withdrew, squonk, you know.

275
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,640
And it was okay.

276
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,500
But he hurt me.

277
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,400
I didn't like that.

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,280
Some people don't like face-fucking bats.

279
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,320
Folks, face-fucking bats are not what they used to be.

280
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,880
Well, if it weren't for them, there'd be a lot more mosquitoes than there are.

281
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,320
They do help keep the mosquitoes down.

282
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,960
Yeah, but now they're so used to going around finding people drunk like me on a hilltop,

283
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,300
they're not even chasing mosquitoes.

284
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,040
They're looking for throat.

285
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,460
Perhaps the slight miasma of alcohol made you a prime choice.

286
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,180
Well, sure.

287
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,240
There's a drunken throat.

288
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,120
Go for it.

289
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,900
Yes, but they have difficulty detu-messing when the alcohol molecules affect the back of their brains.

290
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,800
But I can remember when a dear friend was so terribly drunk he got gang-raped by...

291
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,360
We had to truck antidote pudding into him so he wouldn't die.

292
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,580
And that can happen anyway.

293
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,760
And that was disguised as a teabagging session, I seem to remember.

294
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,540
I thought that was a political party.

295
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,020
All historical moments.

296
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,860
Water under the bridge.

297
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,340
Driven by...

298
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,900
A resistless current of time.

299
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,400
It's lust and libido that does it.

300
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,880
But now here we are.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,100
And after all, you've been given a throaty Tom Waits-like voice by your experience.

302
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,980
So really, there's no reason to complain?

303
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,460
And I've just remembered, I have a divine excuse.

304
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,020
That's right.

305
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,500
We all have a divine excuse.

306
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,420
I take it all back.

307
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,780
Nothing of that happened.

308
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,240
As a holy man, I declare that you can do anything you want to from now on.

309
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Now, that...

310
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,040
Doesn't mean the cops can't do anything they want to do back to you from now on as well.

311
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,860
But, you know, just as far as Dobbs is concerned, I promise you...

312
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,760
So, Dr. Howell, have you ever gone out for a little...

313
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,860
You've got a get-out-of-jail-free card as far as Bob goes.

314
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,560
Good Lord.

315
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,300
How did that get in there?

316
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,640
How did what get in there?

317
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,480
It's one of those pictures that shot by.

318
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,500
It was something Nenslow sent.

319
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,940
Oh, look, there's Dr. Howell with his pets.

320
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,760
You must be looking at a little mirror.

321
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,880
Because I can't see a thing unless I swivel completely around.

322
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,380
So, I thought Nenslow was dead.

323
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,340
Is Nenslow alive?

324
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,300
Nenslow is alive and hated.

325
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,980
Very much alive.

326
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,480
Hate keeps him alive.

327
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,480
Many subgeniuses live on hate alone.

328
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,320
What's wrong with that?

329
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,400
But it's not the wimpy hate.

330
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,560
I hate my job.

331
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,100
I hate my hair today.

332
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,280
This guy is stealing my rent right now.

333
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,580
This old fart here is...

334
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,840
Stealing my rent.

335
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,000
What?

336
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,840
Shut up, Stang.

337
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,680
I'm not even going to talk.

338
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,020
We don't...

339
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,040
Who remembers who did what rent?

340
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,860
Give me a break.

341
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:19,780
Oh.

342
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,220
Somewhere...

343
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,040
Actually, it's funny.

344
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,660
There are types of most of this stuff crumbling in a closet.

345
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,200
Somewhere.

346
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,780
Where we could prove one way or the other for one of the sets.

347
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,800
Which one of us said it first?

348
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,540
And listen to ourselves being drunk for hours and hours in some Chicago hotel room.

349
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,360
But it's an ecstatic church.

350
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,340
It's a church of ecstatic freedom.

351
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,960
Well, now, there's...

352
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,740
See, there's my truly...

353
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:40,900
True love.

354
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,220
There was...

355
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,600
What they...

356
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,180
That was a large...

357
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,300
Female paramecium.

358
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,100
Paramecium, yeah.

359
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,460
Oh, yeah.

360
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:47,940
I thought that...

361
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,040
Yeah, of course it was a female.

362
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,900
There's nothing queer about old Stang.

363
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,260
Actually...

364
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,600
Wow.

365
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,840
The paramecium's are...

366
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,140
Aren't they unisexual?

367
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,040
They're pretty much.

368
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,980
No, actually...

369
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,620
Basically, they commit syzygy, right?

370
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,000
They hook up and...

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,060
They do trade DNA.

372
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,540
Yeah.

373
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,460
Genetic material.

374
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:04,900
Yes.

375
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,220
Well, don't we?

376
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,460
Yeah, but in a more fun way.

377
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,320
Well, how do you...

378
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,700
They just come in.

379
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:10,700


380
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:10,700


381
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:10,720
They just come in.

382
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,620
Do you know if it's fun for a paramecium?

383
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,920
You'll see.

384
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,580
Okay.

385
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,400
I've got porn.

386
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,120
I've got shots of them.

387
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,680
Doing it?

388
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,420
Showing at it, yeah.

389
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,300
He's got bug porn.

390
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,440
I've got bug porn.

391
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,540
Yeah, later on...

392
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,360
In fact, I'm gonna try to supply an actual narration track.

393
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:36,300
We've got about 35 minutes of live dude, single-celled animals and micro animals.

394
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,900
Bug porn, bug porn.

395
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,100
Oh, sorry.

396
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,300
It's about...

397
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,220
Would you rather have the Doug porn?

398
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

399
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,660
I didn't think so.

400
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm sorry.

401
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,000
I was just being funny.

402
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:46,600
The micro...

403
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,620
Are we supposed to be funny?

404
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,620
I know we're not, but we're supposed to be, okay?

405
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,740
I can't tell you how much better I feel since I got a good Mexican beer in my fist.

406
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,460
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

407
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,680
Thank you, Doctor.

408
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,400
I don't drink on the job yet.

409
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
How can you go to a job...

410
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,580
My jetty down here, but I thought the coffee set me up.

411
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,120
I have something for you people.

412
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,280
Reverend Stang, the...

413
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
He does not drink beer.

414
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,180
He drinks fermented apple juice.

415
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,360
He drinks hard cider.

416
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,200
Ha!

417
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,600
I drink hard about that.

418
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,400
It was not enough for the Continental Congress.

419
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:18,680
I drink beer.

420
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,760
There's nothing hard about that cider.

421
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,480
And James Madison.

422
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,500
Don't limit my options.

423
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,020
What...

424
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,900
Let me ask you this.

425
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,340
Does cider give you brewer's droop?

426
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,280
Brewer's droop?

427
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,820
That's not...

428
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,760
The man doesn't know anything about anatomy.

429
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,760
Terrifying.

430
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,620
Look, your sugar's bad enough.

431
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,860
I'm trying to avoid the yeast.

432
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,440
That stuff grows all over...

433
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,620
Brewer's droop, Stang, is a term...

434
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,720
It's hard in places under the monitor.

435
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,080
...used in the...

436
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,940
...in the UK and other places in the world where English is spoken to imply that a large

437
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,620
imbibing of certain malted beverages can let you not be able to get it up.

438
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,080
Hest, brewer's droop.

439
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,680
So you're blaming the cider for that.

440
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:54,760
I've never had...

441
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,600
I've never heard that.

442
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,060
Maybe it never came up in my case, as it were, so to speak.

443
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,920
Well, in your case, it would be brewer's droops.

444
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,680
Right.

445
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,280
Yes.

446
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,520
Or at least one of them usually works.

447
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,280
I mean, if I'm really drunk, sure, most of my peckers...

448
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,460
Hey!

449
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,740
...are useless.

450
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,400
Did you ever get that ad on?

451
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,580
Did you ever get that ad on?

452
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,600
There's always one that is up for the job that's a little more sober than the other

453
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:15,880
ones.

454
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,720
Now...

455
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
That's his story and it's sticking to his foot.

456
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,500
But let's...

457
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,120
I don't want to make the one penis feel inadequate.

458
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,740
Well, it's...

459
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,920
You know, that comes up enough.

460
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,900
This subject comes up all too often.

461
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,960
Only because you bring it up, Stang.

462
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,560
It keeps me awake at night.

463
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:35,060
A man, just a tiny genetic mutation gave him multiple peni, okay?

464
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:35,900
Okay.

465
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,760
Well, what's the big deal?

466
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,700
They have fish born with extra fins.

467
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,820
And people born with extra fingers.

468
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,060
You had extra penises.

469
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,680
Why are you so proud?

470
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,420
God compensates the Stumpy.

471
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,720
There we go.

472
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,040
God...

473
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,180
One time, one time, jokingly, I called this man Stumpy.

474
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,920
And he has never, never forgiven me for it.

475
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,300
And I don't understand why, because he's not Stumpy.

476
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,640
Stumpy can hide in small places.

477
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,040
Stumpy could climb into Stangor's backpack.

478
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,980
And he could get up inside Stangor's...

479
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,120
He's killed.

480
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,520
You know, now I think about it, maybe starting a Stumpy thing might have turned into the

481
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,540
Stangor thing.

482
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,160
Like a tiny parasitic organism.

483
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,160


484
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,040
Let me think about this for a minute.

485
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,620
Stumpy, Stangor...

486
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,040
Stumpy can do these things.

487
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,740
Stangor killed a dragon.

488
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,820
Wait until Dr. Philo Drummond gets here.

489
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,980
It'll really be bad.

490
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,520
Oh, yeah.

491
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,540
Philo's gonna change the equation.

492
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,920
But before he comes, perhaps we should outline for our listeners the sequence of events to

493
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,220
follow.

494
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,660
It's pretty simple, really.

495
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,220
Uh...

496
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,080
We're going to sit here yakking until four o'clock.

497
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,800
And then I guess there's Bulldada auction?

498
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,820
No, they've canceled the Bulldada...

499
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,580
I believe the Bulldada action...

500
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,220
Auction...

501
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,640
Action...

502
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,460
It's canceled.

503
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,880
My main job is performing a wedding this evening.

504
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,200
That's right.

505
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,600
That's right.

506
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,440
And of course the feasting of the...

507
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,860
Mmm.

508
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,340
Yeah, the eating and drinking.

509
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,720
And the Mutant Mountain Boys are playing tonight.

510
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,940
They're new to X Day, but not new to me.

511
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,000
I've seen them every year at the Devotional.

512
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh, yeah.

513
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,800
I've seen them every year at the Devotional.

514
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,540
And I hope they'll be doing their Devo songs and their Subgenius hymns.

515
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,300
They have three...

516
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,620
At least three Subgenius hymns that are tearjerkers.

517
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,620
And there are some very lovely...

518
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm going to try really hard to make people cry at the wedding, just so you know.

519
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,360
You can laugh, but hopefully you will be crying at the same time because it's also touching

520
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,060
and sweet.

521
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,160
And it is, too.

522
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm gonna boycott it.

523
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,160
Okay.

524
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,640
Well, and we've got another wedding on Friday.

525
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,280
Reverend Millar.

526
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
Oh, that must be Princess Girlfax.

527
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,100
You know, this church is getting so cutesy, feely, touchy, sweetie pie.

528
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,120
You don't live up to your name.

529
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,200
I mean, it's like we're gonna have what?

530
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,880
Bake sales?

531
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,520
What is this?

532
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,340
The PC Church of Bob?

533
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,720
I mean, a wedding dinner?

534
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,340
You get bake sales.

535
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,340
We decided yesterday we are going to start having bake sales.

536
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:02,860
Oh, oatmeal cookies.

537
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,380
Yeah.

538
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,040
And we are gonna do everything all the other churches do.

539
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,120
Oh, I'd have a...

540
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,100
We're gonna have a slice of lady Connie tea cake, please, with my cup of...

541
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,720
And bingo, Sting.

542
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,780
Are we going to have bingo?

543
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,020
Yeah, bingo.

544
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,860
And I go, well, everything I get.

545
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
Sometimes I think I've lived too long.

546
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,780
Everything every religion does.

547
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
The Sundance of the Lakota will be later on today.

548
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,760
Well, we have a lot of sun here, so...

549
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,180
All of the males will be expected to pierce their chest with an eagle claw and be suspected.

550
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,500
And hang on the top of one of the port-a-potties.

551
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,120
No, no, no.

552
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,960
Jim's already done that.

553
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,020
We use the port-a-potties as the sacred sweat lodge.

554
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm sure...

555
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,220
You mean the jinkum fermentation.

556
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,820
You pass out from waves of pain, which take you to the new transcendent level.

557
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,580
That happens when you use the outhouses, Doctor.

558
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,040
I see someone I'd love to have on stage with us.

559
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,200
Why?

560
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,680
Because she's not wearing anything, Stang?

561
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,460
Is that it?

562
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,760
Yeah, we've never had Pantiera up here on the...

563
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,700
Well, she...

564
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,380
We have some cheesecake of her posing while we talk, but...

565
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,980
Why did you talk?

566
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,820
Pantiera, you're welcome to come up here and block the screen any time you want.

567
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,880
Oh, you are so...

568
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,660
Or Susie, although Susie has lost her voice completely.

569
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,760
You think...

570
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,720
You were bragging about how you were raped by one face-raping bat.

571
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,400
Susie pulled the entire train of face-raping bats.

572
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,680
Late last year...

573
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,040
I was.

574
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,040


575
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,100
I've got video...

576
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,540
Yeah, but I can't afford two gallons of antidote pudding, man.

577
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,160
All I had was a small vial I could carry with me.

578
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,780
Yeah, you're still enjoying it, aren't you, Susie, you...

579
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,680
You faithless, faithless woman.

580
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:58,720
Susie is actually one of the more coherent and clever radio personalities, and she always

581
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,460
manages to deliberately screw up her voice at X-Day.

582
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,680
So as...

583
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,880
She's trying to save herself, the situation we find ourselves in.

584
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,800
Did you see how Susie responded to that Dr. Stang reverence thing?

585
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,380
Well, the same way she responds to everything.

586
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,100
No, she just turned around and walked away.

587
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,320
You scared Susie off by being so mean.

588
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,540
You drove her away, you uncouth fellow.

589
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,260
You are.

590
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,000
You're a brute, Stang.

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,240
But we need a girl up here.

592
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,680
How come...

593
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
We need some gentleman...

594
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,740
Not you, Teeters.

595
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,000
Poor Princess Wee has run away.

596
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,940
I bet I know what she's doing.

597
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,260
What would she be doing?

598
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,700
Well, it's a hope that that may be remedied in the fullness of time.

599
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:46,860
Another thing.

600
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,320
The pockets of Pisces can...

601
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,820
You told me...

602
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,160
You told me there was not only going to be lots of naked, lithe bodies here, but there's

603
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,740
going to be wall-to-wall fropping.

604
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,120
Yeah.

605
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,140
And I've seen like one frop stick, two pipes, and a bag of ditch weed since I've been here.

606
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,460
I was talking about Starwood.

607
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,420
Oh.

608
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,180
Never mind.

609
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,120
Aren't you going to stick...

610
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,340
That's...

611
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,640
Starwood's cheap.

612
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,360
It's only, what, 160 bucks or something like that?

613
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,320
People pay to go to Starwood?

614
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,820
No, they pay through the nose.

615
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,760
Through their nose rings.

616
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,120
But they have more options than we offer.

617
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,640
Well, yeah, obviously they got some frop, if you...

618
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,480
The way you're talking about it.

619
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,660
And they pay the preachers.

620
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,120
Do you preach at Starwood?

621
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,260
Do you preach at Starwood?

622
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,740
Yes, I do.

623
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,740
I preach my ass off at Starwood.

624
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,620
I saved my...

625
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,400
I saved my really good stuff.

626
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,400


627
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,400


628
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,060
I saved my really good sermon for Starwood because then I'm not preaching to the saved.

629
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,520
I know what happens if I start preaching here.

630
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,780
Everybody will get up and leave.

631
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,000
Watch, they're already starting.

632
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,300
They'll...

633
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,560
It's like, oh, I've heard Stang a million times.

634
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
He's always saying the same thing.

635
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,000
Bob's...

636
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,700
Boy, I have heard a cheap cop-out for giving a second-rate sermon.

637
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,240
You know, you really just...

638
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
You have contempt for us, Stang.

639
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,120
Now we got a pretty voice.

640
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,800
Something in contrast to...

641
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,760
She's trained in the arts of telephone seduction.

642
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,200
Don't listen to her, people.

643
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,620
I'm...

644
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,420
I do get accused sometimes.

645
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,720
Some of the old dirty men who call and say things like, you have such a sweet voice.

646
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,540
Where are you located?

647
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,220
Do you give them a PayPal?

648
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,760
Yeah, honey, just send $100 to this and we'll call you back tomorrow.

649
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,500
I should.

650
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:24,500


651
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,080
I should, but most of my clients where I work in my con job are lawyers.

652
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,580
Ah.

653
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,280
So I'm not really...

654
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,080
You don't want to keep them unhappy.

655
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,740
You work in a nest of...

656
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,680
A nest of serpents?

657
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,720
I do, I do.

658
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,380
I will...

659
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,460
Well, Pisces, you have my sympathy.

660
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,100
Sympathy.

661
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,600
I've known a couple of subgenius ladies who were telephone sex performers.

662
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:50,780
One of them was Reverend Thea, who I married to Pope S. Lilith at an ex-date several years

663
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,140
ago.

664
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,640
They subsequently broke up.

665
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,080
But Thea...

666
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,420
I was on the phone with Thea once, not on her job, on my job.

667
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,360
Oh, no, of course not.

668
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,100
You just happened to call her.

669
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,660
We were talking about a church thing.

670
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,100
A church thing.

671
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,580
Oh, yes, yes.

672
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,900
She was going to run a revival in Columbus.

673
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,180
I would like to talk to you about a revival.

674
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,660
And she goes, oh, oh, Stang, I'm going to have to hang up.

675
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,680
I've got a client calling, but I know this guy real well.

676
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,060
He'll be done in five minutes.

677
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,840
And sure enough, she called me back in almost exactly five minutes.

678
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,140
I guess she knew exactly what this guy wanted.

679
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,740
I don't think I could do it.

680
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,460
I mean, I've talked to these people...

681
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,160
Maybe she knew he was a quickie.

682
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
Yeah, he was real quickie.

683
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,340


684
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,500
But see, it costs them by the minute.

685
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,100
Right.

686
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,260
Ah, now that is a clever idea.

687
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,900
I would...

688
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,580
There's so...

689
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,320
From everything I've heard from people who've done it, these pink sexual fantasies are really

690
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,740
boring.

691
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,280
They're just...

692
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:49,980
It's so vanilla.

693
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,280
Baby, tell me, what color is your underwear?

694
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,200
And you say, why?

695
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,440
Talk to me in baby talk.

696
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,040
They're black and lacy, and they're a little bit damp.

697
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,320
They're black and lacy, and they're a little bit damp.

698
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,320


699
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm excited that you've been calling.

700
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,420
Stop it.

701
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,060
Stop it.

702
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,860
I might have to get off the stage if you don't stop that.

703
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,120
Tell me where little yetis come from.

704
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,280
Actually, I'll be explaining that tonight at the wedding.

705
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,220
That's a complicated procedure.

706
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,800
It is.

707
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,940
Really, it's more complicated than...

708
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,160
It's not as easy to understand as you might think.

709
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, yes, 16 different stages before ejaculation and fertilization.

710
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
I mean, it takes a week.

711
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,800
What do you want?

712
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,360
Yeah, most of you all aren't parents.

713
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,740
And...

714
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,140
I see quite a few parents.

715
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,920
So you don't know the facts of life yet.

716
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,380
You think you do, but...

717
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,020
You're practicing.

718
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:49,200
Not until the infant goes into its eighth stage of development and starts having sex with you do you know how rough parenthood really is.

719
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:56,820
We sanded off some of the rough edges and made it more palatable for PG-rated audiences.

720
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,000
Pregnant audiences?

721
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,100
PG.

722
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,500
Well, to tell the truth, I was worried about shocking...

723
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,500


724
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,660
Sonny Gordon.

725
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,500
No, no, but when I was in...

726
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,060
Tender sensibilities of such nice daughters.

727
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,680
Oh, yeah, that was a long...

728
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,260
No, that was an expression for pregnant.

729
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,000
She's PG.

730
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,520
Then I met them.

731
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,540
Hey, you know Cynthia?

732
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,360
Yeah.

733
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,960
She's PG, man.

734
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,300
No.

735
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Who got her?

736
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,100
I think it was Tom.

737
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,160
So you're going to go back to the totally raw version then when you perform that...

738
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,660
No, no, I like the cleaned up one better.

739
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,380
It's funnier.

740
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,300
Why would it be funnier?

741
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,740
Does it have monkey noises in it?

742
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,480
It's funnier when you talk real dirty in a polite way, I think.

743
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,720
I think so.

744
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:29,720


745
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,020
I think it's funnier when you talk about Miss Kitty and Mr. Snake.

746
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,900
One day Miss Kitty met Mr. Snake and they went playing in the bushes together.

747
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,440
And Miss Kitty and Mr. Snake rolled and wrestled and rolled and wrestled and then one day a

748
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,600
baby came out.

749
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,880
And that's the birds and the bees, or the kitties and the snakes.

750
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,140
Some people don't have snakes, though they have fish and worms, and some people don't

751
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,500
have kitties, they have jaguars.

752
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,440
Oh, yeah.

753
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,700
But you know, it's just the same story they told me when I was in school.

754
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,880
Yeah, it's exactly the same.

755
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,720
It hasn't changed a bit.

756
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,140
They just rotate the animals.

757
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,140
Amazing.

758
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,480
My entire education from my wonderful mother about the birds and the bees was essentially

759
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,980
I could sum it up like this.

760
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,980
No experience.

761
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,860
Slot A, tab B, don't do it or I'll kill you.

762
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,460
And that's all I was told.

763
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,340
Pretty much the very...

764
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:28,440
Yeah.

765
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,460
They're gonna try to put that in your hole and if they do, I'm gonna beat your tush.

766
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,960
And that was about it.

767
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,340
And then you grow up and you find that it's not just slot A and...

768
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:50,160
Sometimes it's slot A and slot A and sometimes it's tab B and tab B and sometimes it's slot

769
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:56,900
A and slot A and tab B and sometimes it's tab B, tab B and slot A. And then sometimes

770
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,940
there's this little...

771
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,840
It's a little corner piece that is like a slot A and a tab B.

772
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:11,080
And the slot A and the tab B plays with the A and the B and it gets very complicated at

773
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,560
that point.

774
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,320
But they don't tell you that at first.

775
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,960
And they don't tell you the variations of slot A and tab B. And sometimes slot A is

776
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,920
really hard for tab B to get into.

777
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,760
And sometimes tab B is...

778
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,080
Yeah.

779
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,340
It's been bent around a little bit.

780
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,900
It's a little floppy and doesn't seem to stay just right to go into slot A.

781
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,940
Man, I'm getting so hot over here, man.

782
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,680
Now that she's explained it that way, I've just realized that Bob has been raping me

783
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,260
for years.

784
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,060
You didn't know that?

785
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,360
No.

786
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,680
I thought that was just...

787
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,980
You thought it was slot A and slot B.

788
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,620
Slot A and slot B.

789
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,560
You know how Bob is.

790
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,940
Well, he told me he was raising...

791
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,080
He'll do anything.

792
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,980
He told me it was me he was pumping slack in to raise my levels.

793
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,920
So you know what I mean?

794
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


795
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


796
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


797
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


798
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


799
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


800
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


801
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


802
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


803
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


804
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


805
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


806
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:57,920


807
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,120
You didn't even get that, huh?

808
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,280
That's the slack injection.

809
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,340
We've done that.

810
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:00,820
Yeah, slack injection.

811
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,160
Yeah, you get it.

812
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,500
Bob gives you a slack injection and it protects you from anti-slack.

813
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:04,980
That's right.

814
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,340
We've been making fun of the Catholics all this time and turns out I've been the altar

815
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,040
boy for Bob all these years.

816
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,340
Well, we've known that, Stang.

817
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,540
Everybody knows that.

818
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,780
Bob's little bitch.

819
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,380
That's right.

820
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,240
Everybody...

821
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,840
Didn't they have that on the Facebook page, the hate page?

822
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,020
Stang's just Bob's bitch.

823
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,760
You know that?

824
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, you're right.

825
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,380
He just bends over.

826
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:24,420
No.

827
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,920
If that had been on that page, it would have been funny.

828
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,900
Well, that's true.

829
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,520
It was not funny was the problem.

830
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:37,400
You can talk bad about us all you want as long as you're funny about us.

831
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,300
Funny is the key, yes.

832
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,200
That is the key word.

833
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,780
You have to have a sense of humor.

834
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,300
And basically, if you don't get the joke, fuck you.

835
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:49,240
And if you don't have a really good sense of humor, you'll find that the tab B is actually

836
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,720
a lot stiffer and sharper than you remember.

837
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,020
And the tab B will sneak up behind you.

838
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,660
Because the other thing is...

839
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:04,560
There is a slot A and a tab B, but there's also a slot C that everyone has.

840
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,160
Ouch.

841
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,680
Ouch.

842
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,840
I was trying to forget about that.

843
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,840
And sometimes, the tab A and the slot C happen.

844
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,600
And some people enjoy that, but some people call that butt hurt.

845
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,440
Excuse me, but did you help the Marquis de Sade write 120 Journeys of Sodom?

846
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,900
Only 97.

847
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,880
Oh, wow.

848
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:27,880


849
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:35,240
Well, folks, I got to say that's one of the most stimulating and exciting pieces of whatever

850
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
that was that I've heard in a long time.

851
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,640
I may not be able to...

852
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,680
The best part is that it was completely radio safe until Stang talked.

853
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,980
Oh, yes, of course.

854
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,600
Don't bite me, G. Gordon Gordon.

855
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,520
Yeah, but now if I have to stand up now, I'm going to have to hold my notebook in front

856
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,840
of my crotch so I can get out of the classroom.

857
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,700
Man, geez.

858
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,920
The tabs with the slots and the slots with tabs, those occur.

859
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,620
And then sometimes switch.

860
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:57,880
I'm sorry.

861
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,600
Sometimes people switch their tabs to a slot and their slot to a tab.

862
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,620
I can't believe we're talking about this on the radio.

863
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:10,320
And actually, the great thing is that for some of us, we can get pseudo tabs that are

864
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,860
temporary tabs that we can use so that we can have a tab to insert into a slot.

865
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,700
Just put it on my tab.

866
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,700
I'm totally slotted out after that one.

867
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,180
That's all there is to it, man.

868
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,020
Well, I think...

869
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,340
That was...

870
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,580
I suggest we get...

871
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,620
I think we should give the good priestess a round of applause for a most

872
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,940
aggravating sexual lesson.

873
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,280
Yeah, this is the first time I've realized how sexually abused I've been all these years

874
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,120
by JR Bob Dobbs.

875
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,320
He never lets me see his face, and he always uses slot C.

876
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,620
Does he at least play with your tab?

877
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,480
No.

878
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,100
Well, that's not fair at all.

879
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,320
No.

880
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,600
No.

881
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,080
He didn't give you the courtesy of a tab.

882
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,180
No.

883
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:56,500
He didn't give you the courtesy of a tab.

884
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,140
No, reach around for old Reverend Stang.

885
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:58,960
That's a shame.

886
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,700
But I'm up for one.

887
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,340
If anybody wants to offer...

888
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,840
I'll take you up on that, Stang.

889
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,780
Gordon, you don't want to make up for what Bob left out?

890
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,460
That's okay.

891
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,180
I was just kidding.

892
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:17,040
Now, the key to remember is when the saucers arrive, these sex goddesses have any configurations

893
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,020
of slots and tabs that you desire.

894
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:19,780
Right.

895
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,920
You do have to...

896
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,420
You know, they...

897
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,720
Sometimes they will go in your mind and see some of your past dreams or perhaps the things

898
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,440
that you were wanking to those lonely nights when you really just didn't feel like going

899
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,820
out on the town and you typed a few words into the internet.

900
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:47,640
So if your thing happens to be, for example, a goat tab, the goddesses can provide you

901
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,280
with goat tabs.

902
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,760
They can also provide you with squid slots.

903
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,620
Tabs.

904
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,100
And they can provide you with multiple slots and tabs.

905
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,060
And in fact, just because they're called a sex goddess does not mean that they are...

906
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,960
Particularly have a configuration.

907
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,580
The configuration is entirely up to you.

908
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:12,980
However you would like your sex goddess configured, they will do that for you.

909
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:20,280
Tomorrow, I have to get up at 6 o'clock and I'll meet everybody else who's awake at the

910
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,640
Stone Circle down there.

911
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,420
We'll wait for the saucers.

912
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,600
And by 7.15, I will look just like Kim Kardashian.

913
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,240
That's my immediate...

914
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,360
Why?

915
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:32,820
Huh?

916
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,560
Why?

917
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,900
So I just want to feel myself up.

918
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,060
I think she's really pretty.

919
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,940
Okay.

920
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,140
And I always wondered what it'd be like to be Kim Kardashian and feel yourself up.

921
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,260
I have a question.

922
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,020
Always hanging around the Kardashian embassy.

923
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,520
I'll say it again.

924
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,640
As Bob said, watch two girls making it.

925
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,260
Hell, I'd rather be two girls.

926
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:50,260


927
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,840
Two girls making it.

928
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,320
Agreed.

929
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,260
Well, who wouldn't?

930
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,320
But that'll be temporary, probably.

931
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,360
Who knows?

932
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,900
I might enjoy it.

933
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,320
Reverend Stang or Priestess Spices, I have a question about the sex goddesses because

934
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm not really into...

935
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,640
If you wanted one of them to be like SpongeBob SquarePants, would they?

936
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,400
Absolutely.

937
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,760
Okay.

938
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,340
All right.

939
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,700
You realize SpongeBob is very porous so you don't have to get a cleanup rag?

940
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,040
If you wanted.

941
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,460
Well, of course I wanted.

942
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,260
Why would I want to have a SpongeBob SquarePants?

943
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


944
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


945
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


946
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


947
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


948
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


949
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


950
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


951
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,260


952
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,840
I'd ask the question if I didn't want it.

953
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,920
Yeah, SpongeBob SquarePants.

954
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,220
Mm, mm, mm.

955
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,080
He does have a lot of pores.

956
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,060
Yeah, a lot of holes there, man.

957
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,460
Jeez.

958
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,960
And he's absorbent.

959
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,580
Mm-hmm.

960
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,240
No mess.

961
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,940
No strain.

962
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,380
No mess.

963
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:34,860
Wow.

964
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,020
You know, I never thought of that.

965
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,680
Ha, ha.

966
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,920
Yeah, no, you didn't, Stang.

967
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,620
That's why I am the mind behind...

968
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:40,700
That's why he's gory.

969
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,960
He's a germicidal sponge.

970
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,840
I'm sure.

971
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,240
Well, and he may be a spermicidal sponge too just to be on the safe side.

972
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


973
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


974
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


975
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


976
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


977
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


978
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,240


979
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,400
You know, and that could be, you know, you could get some of the foam and...

980
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,760
Anyway, we're giving Gordon ideas.

981
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,160
Oh, yeah, I'm getting a lot of ideas.

982
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,840
This is the most fun I've had since I used to go on rat shoots with Bob and, you know,

983
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,120
SpongeBob.

984
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,240
Well, we're also going to venture into microbiology.

985
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:11,560
Bob and SpongeBob.

986
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:12,880
Microbiology.

987
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,700
Yes, Stang, could you tell us about the tabs and slots of the micro world?

988
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,460
Well, we're...

989
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,220
Bob and SpongeBob.

990
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,300
We're going to be looking at some movies.

991
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,940
I could put those on right now, I suppose.

992
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,900
Do they have tabs and slots?

993
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,980
Actually, several types of micro animals only have slots.

994
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,940
They are...

995
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,740
What's the word?

996
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,700
Slotted?

997
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,160
No, the...

998
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,100
Parthenogenetic.

999
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,860
All female all the time.

1000
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,780
Parthenogenetic.

1001
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,920
Yeah, parthenogenetic.

1002
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,380
Yeah, my favorite...

1003
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,660
I thought that was a song back in the day.

1004
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:49,920
Rotofer.

1005
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,520
Rotofer.

1006
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,880
I think that was Rotofer.

1007
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,500
Yeah.

1008
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,620
You know, Rotofer feels like a walking

1009
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,000
girl.

1010
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:04,580


1011
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:04,840
A

1012
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,080
women will find a way to not need

1013
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,460
the tab.

1014
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,380
Well, that's the thing.

1015
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,240
I mean, that's some of the

1016
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,220
idea. Nature

1017
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,780
will try anything.

1018
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,320
And the

1019
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,700
reproduction methods

1020
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,180
of some of the so-called

1021
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,720
lower life forms are

1022
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,400
remarkably complicated.

1023
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,420
They are inventive and elegant.

1024
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,620
I raised a mosquito

1025
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,460
from an egg.

1026
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,060
Man, not too long ago.

1027
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,660
Eternal enemy.

1028
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,720
Bloodsuckers of a feather flock together.

1029
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:54,700
First

1030
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,660
he was a little invisible

1031
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,940
egg. Then he

1032
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,620
became something that looked like a

1033
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,020
robot biplane.

1034
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,640
Still microscopic.

1035
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,940
You can see him with the naked eye

1036
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,180
twitching in the water.

1037
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,720
They're the little things going like this.

1038
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,140
You don't want to drink them.

1039
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,640
Nice porn, Stang. I like that.

1040
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,060
Then they turn into a face-hugger

1041
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,440
phase.

1042
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,980
They turn

1043
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,040
into a face-hugger phase.

1044
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,120
They turn into an enormous,

1045
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,480
jointed, vigorous thing

1046
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,660
that's larger than the adult mosquito.

1047
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,600
Right.

1048
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,820
Finally, one day I looked in the Petri dish

1049
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,920
and my little face-hugger

1050
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,680
had magically turned into a

1051
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,780
full-grown mosquito.

1052
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,300
And I took the Petri dish outside

1053
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,940
and I released him into the air

1054
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,700
and he landed on my hand

1055
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,980
and I killed him.

1056
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,720
Because I'm not an idiot

1057
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,540
and I don't need more mosquitoes

1058
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,620
sucking my blood or putting

1059
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,000
their hair

1060
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,740
parasites in me.

1061
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
You saw the light of sanity

1062
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,960
at the last moment.

1063
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,200
And avoided the light of malaria.

1064
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:54,960
I think it's interesting

1065
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,140
that a preacher

1066
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,840
and a minister in a church

1067
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,620
would raise a blood sucker.

1068
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,140
There's a big old

1069
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,260
wasp right behind me.

1070
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,480
There is an extremely large wasp

1071
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,400
hovering around

1072
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,440
to punish those who are

1073
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,140
not as ardent

1074
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,960
as they should be.

1075
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,380
Yes, anyone who's not laughing,

1076
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,820
that wasp is going to sting you.

1077
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
It's a big one.

1078
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,480
I thought it was a kid with glasses.

1079
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,300
But anyway,

1080
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,620
friends, some of you probably

1081
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,620
unlike me, attract

1082
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,920
mosquitoes because you're somehow

1083
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,040
edible. Some of us just

1084
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,300
happen to taste better than others of us.

1085
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,040
This should make you feel

1086
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,880
better. They have

1087
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,920
their own parasites

1088
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,940
and mosquitoes and blood

1089
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,560
suckers and diarrhea.

1090
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,300
Every creature

1091
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,820
has more creatures inside

1092
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,240
of them. In fact,

1093
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,680
the vast majority of animals

1094
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,800
in the world are parasites

1095
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,220
living inside of other animals.

1096
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,700
We free living creatures,

1097
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,800
so to speak,

1098
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,240
are in the minority.

1099
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,060
It's like that poem saying,

1100
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,800
they say that fleas have little fleas

1101
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,620
upon their backs to bite them

1102
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,440
and little fleas have smaller fleas

1103
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,660
and so ad infinitum.

1104
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,760
Jonathan Swift.

1105
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,540
That's right.

1106
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,040
Thank you, Dr. Howell, for your literary prowess.

1107
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,980
You know,

1108
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,920
the only reason I didn't quote that was I wanted

1109
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
you to be able to feel smart for a minute.

1110
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,360
Well, that was sweet of you.

1111
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,820
That was nice, Stang, and I'm not used to that kind of thing.

1112
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,120
I'm not a bad guy all the time.

1113
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,560
Just some.

1114
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,180
Yeah, most.

1115
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,840
Furthermore, parasites are a driving engine

1116
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,800
of evolution.

1117
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,500
Parasites cause

1118
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,800
evolutionary development to take place.

1119
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,960
Which brings up a question of

1120
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,780
why are we as subgeniuses

1121
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,460
not looking into becoming

1122
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,620
better parasites for the

1123
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,400
conspiracy?

1124
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,240
In my opinion, the conspiracy is an enormous bloated

1125
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,440
parasite with a grossly swollen body

1126
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,680
draining the tiny subgeniuses.

1127
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,800
Not the other way around.

1128
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,360
Actually, I think that we have ascertained

1129
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,220
that we are officially trying to be parasites.

1130
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,760
We're not very good at it.

1131
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,760
On the body of the conspiracy.

1132
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,000
In fact, Father Joe Mama did an interview

1133
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:18,980


1134
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,600
with a very inspired sermon about that

1135
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,340
that I know I've played on our Slack a few times.

1136
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,380
If he was here, he could probably recite it from memory.

1137
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:25,740
He could fill it in.

1138
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,320
Because unlike most of us, he never smoked pot.

1139
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,560
What's that?

1140
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,040
Papa Joe Mama has been a straight edge guy.

1141
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Actually, we did find out that he would drink,

1142
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,040
but not what we were drinking.

1143
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,220
Because he had better taste.

1144
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,780
He's very ship-shaped and squared away.

1145
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,760
And some can see this.

1146
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,040
This noble idiot running up and down the road

1147
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,680
in the hot sun for exercise.

1148
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,100
To be fair, though...

1149
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,300
He keeps himself fit.

1150
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,820
He is very fit.

1151
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,180
And I've got to say, he's probably going to be

1152
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:06,040
the first one to get the best saucer with the best guns.

1153
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,580
Knowing the way the world works,

1154
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,220
he'll be the first of us to die.

1155
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,540
That's what I was about to say.

1156
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,200
It's always the joggers and health nuts that kick off first.

1157
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,660
The ones who are so healthy that don't take pills

1158
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,740
and don't have to get a shot.

1159
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,780
The ones who get things stuck in their heart or in their ear

1160
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,140
or in their knee or in their leg.

1161
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,120
The most desirable specimens.

1162
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,460
Who have all their glands.

1163
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:25,260
You know what I mean?

1164
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,160
Why do you think the people who work at health food stores

1165
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,480
are so pasty and sickly looking?

1166
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,520
My dad always used to say,

1167
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,700
how come when you go to health food stores,

1168
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,800
they look like the most shriveled,

1169
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,500
shrunken-chested,

1170
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,940
pale-faced,

1171
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,080
straggly, bearded,

1172
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,980
concentration camp survivors?

1173
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,080
If they're so healthy...

1174
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

1175
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,320
I thought he was talking about you, Stang.

1176
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:47,660
I'm...

1177
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,600
No, you can also look at the prime example of someone

1178
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,520
who seems to be absolutely not healthy

1179
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,160
but cannot seem to die,

1180
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,180
which would be Dr. Legume.

1181
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,880
Um, you know, I could never imagine Dr. Legume saying,

1182
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,340
you know, I really should take my vitamins today.

1183
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,080
Perhaps death didn't want to embrace Dr. Legume.

1184
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,120
Perhaps. Maybe. We don't know.

1185
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,740
I mean, it could be a situation of they're afraid that

1186
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,940
if there is an infernal afterlife available,

1187
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,520
that Legume will take over.

1188
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,420
And, you know,

1189
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,760
we know how he is here.

1190
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,140
Can you imagine if he was placed into the depths of

1191
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,520
a Dante's Inferno-type hell?

1192
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,300
What circle of hell would be able to

1193
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,920
just withstand the pure power of what is Dr. Legume?

1194
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,940
I think the place would run a lot more efficiently

1195
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,980
if Legume was in charge.

1196
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,740
Amen.

1197
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,620
Thank you, thank you. I mean...

1198
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,220
Well, somebody pointed out during the two hours

1199
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,420
that Legume ran the Church of the Subgeniuses,

1200
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,120
by God, the trains did run on time.

1201
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:50,700
That's right.

1202
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,280
And the airplanes, too.

1203
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:52,660
Backwards.

1204
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,520
That was amazing.

1205
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,900
They were backwards?

1206
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,480
They ran backwards and forwards.

1207
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,020
You know, it's funny, I don't recognize half of this artwork

1208
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,040
that's being projected.

1209
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,600
I mean, I downloaded it.

1210
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,340
I did see it at one point.

1211
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Didn't you set up this slideshow?

1212
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,200
Huh?

1213
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,980
Didn't you set up this slideshow?

1214
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,740
Well, yeah, but that doesn't mean I remember most of it.

1215
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,480
I thought you were just streaming forward.

1216
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:17,620
When I did, I was just on my phone,

1217
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1218
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1219
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1220
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1221
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1222
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1223
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1224
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,620


1225
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:17,820
I think it's something called the Foo-Kung.

1226
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,320
Foo-Kung or whatever,

1227
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,320
that stupid pile of stupid pictures

1228
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,340
is that people are so enamored.

1229
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,920
Oh, I fell in the Foo-Kung hole!

1230
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,880
I can tell which one's in for 18 hours!

1231
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,240
I couldn't get out for 18 hours!

1232
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,340
It's so funny!

1233
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,220
Oh, my God!

1234
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,220
The Foo-Kung hole?

1235
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:29,640
Yeah.

1236
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,700
The only good thing I've seen on the internet lately

1237
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,640
is tits and bacon, my God.

1238
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,820
That was a good place to be.

1239
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,840
Was it bacon on tits?

1240
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,480
No, it was little pictures of wonderful breasts,

1241
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,020
little gifts being unveiled and veiled and wiggled and jiggled,

1242
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,600
alternating with little pictures of sizzling bacon.

1243
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,360
Doesn't get better than that.

1244
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,180
Tits and bacon.

1245
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,900
Come on, man.

1246
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,060
There's a pattern out there for a bra made out of bacon.

1247
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,180
Good God.

1248
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,860
With a matching panty.

1249
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,540
Well, I found bacon you can cook in a toaster.

1250
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,820
There you go.

1251
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,460
I wouldn't recommend wearing, at this particular junction,

1252
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,580
in this particular campground, a bacon bra or undies.

1253
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,780
Yeah, I don't think a bacon thong would do very well.

1254
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,740
I do know that, as Hal and I were discussing,

1255
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,000
that certain yellow jackets and wasps are attracted to bacon.

1256
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,500
Is that true?

1257
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,420
They eat meat.

1258
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,740
And I can't imagine that having a wasp

1259
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,540
attempting to eat a bacon bra.

1260
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,860
A bacon bra or thong would be pleasant.

1261
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,240
You better let him eat it.

1262
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,800
Not attempt to dissuade him.

1263
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,820
And then he'll fly off and get some sugars for dessert.

1264
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,080
Unlike bees, bees only want the sweetness.

1265
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,000
But the wasp wants the meat and then the sweetness.

1266
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,140
I thought wasps wanted complete control of the American judicial and government system.

1267
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,220
They own it already.

1268
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,260
That's our...

1269
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,080
No, not anymore.

1270
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,860
We've got that Arab guy for president.

1271
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,800
What's the matter with that?

1272
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,200
That's right.

1273
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,480
The Kenyan traitor.

1274
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:05,820
The Kenyan traitor.

1275
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,000
Kenyan tree?

1276
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,420
I got to tell you, though, folks,

1277
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,320
watching the politics these last few years

1278
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,780
has been one of the most entertaining monkey show

1279
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,720
that I have seen since Ringling Brothers went into bankruptcy.

1280
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,960
Stick around. It's going to get better.

1281
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,240
Well, I really miss Herman Cain.

1282
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,860
Yeah, I do, too.

1283
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,660
Susie pointed out that we really...

1284
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,800
that we should have planned to vote for Herman Cain,

1285
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,620
because then it would be like,

1286
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,500
okay, let's just go straight to the point.

1287
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,720
Let's finish the job.

1288
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,540
You know?

1289
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,420
If we're going to turn America into a circus,

1290
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,160
let's do it to the max.

1291
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,580
It's already been turned into a circus.

1292
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,120
And it's not even a very good circus.

1293
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,800
Even the wild animals aren't very good.

1294
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,660
They're not wild enough.

1295
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,680
There's not enough blood.

1296
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,080
I mean, it's so tame.

1297
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,560
Think of the children, GGG.

1298
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,900
Think of the children.

1299
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,580
I'm thinking of the children.

1300
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,240
I would like to...

1301
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,640
Don't get me started on children, okay?

1302
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,380
Eventually.

1303
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,140
Okay, you want G. Gordon Gordon's take on children?

1304
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,300
A new child, that's a $300,000 diarrhea machine

1305
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,240
you've just brought into the world.

1306
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,460
And that's the way I think of children.

1307
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,600
It's a miracle of life.

1308
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,820
Yeah, so is being able to go to the bathroom regularly every morning.

1309
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,440
That's a miracle of life, too.

1310
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,940
That doesn't make it pleasant or not messy.

1311
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,960
You know what I'm saying?

1312
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,700
These people are throwing their sperms and eggs,

1313
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,680
and you've got this world full of little shitty kids everywhere.

1314
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,000
Little children, midgets, tiny people with little bitty hands, little feet.

1315
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,080
They won't listen to you.

1316
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:44,180
Like, you've had a good comeback for people who...

1317
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,380
I'm sorry.

1318
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,820
The medication is kicking in a little slowly.

1319
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,680
The child is father to the man.

1320
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,680
People who brag about conditions of their birth,

1321
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,900
such as their looks or their wealth that they inherited.

1322
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,940
As if they had anything to do with it.

1323
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,640
There's one now.

1324
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,520
You just gave it.

1325
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,040
Legumes' comeback for them was,

1326
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,040
congratulations on falling out of a cunt,

1327
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,840
which is actually their only achievement.

1328
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,800
I thought they got squirted out.

1329
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,080
They happened to do the same thing all the rest of us did.

1330
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,940
They just fell out of one that was rich.

1331
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,400
Well, they didn't do anything.

1332
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,580
They got squirted out.

1333
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,680
They didn't even have to work their way out.

1334
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,560
That was the reason for the bad language and the bluntness of it.

1335
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,620
Dr. Legume, bad language and bluntness?

1336
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,360
Yeah, that's why we're...

1337
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,340
The tape is being changed.

1338
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,660
Everyone stop being funny or trying to be funny.

1339
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,860
You don't need to videotape things.

1340
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,680
It's the same as yesterday.

1341
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,340
I really don't have to have tape videotape for four of us sitting here.

1342
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,680
I can use the footage from last year and use this year's sound.

1343
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,900
But you get the ambiance.

1344
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,620
You get the ambiance, dang.

1345
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,340
The ambiance.

1346
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,380
From PR News in Washington,

1347
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,380
I'm forbidden from opening a bank account.

1348
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,340
President Obama was relieved.

1349
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,340


1350
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,340


1351
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,340


1352
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,400
Released from jail today after posting a $1 bond.

1353
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,300
Because not.

1354
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,820
PR's reports that this is PR.

1355
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,640
Tennis in four sets since 1938.

1356
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,260
We have details from PR's club.

1357
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,260
76-3-6-4-3-6-7-5-8-4-36.

1358
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,120
PR News.

1359
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,480
This is PR.

1360
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,360
I can't complain.

1361
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,300
Because here I've been handed three cans of octopus.

1362
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,180
It's labeled pulpo in Spanish.

1363
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:30,500
Of course.

1364
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,400
It's goya.

1365
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,540
The very good stuff.

1366
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,560
They've got wonderful products.

1367
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,420
I have to tell the truth.

1368
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,680
I kind of swore off eating cephalopods

1369
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,940
because there's so much that has been discovered

1370
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,680
about their level of intelligence.

1371
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,280
They are.

1372
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,720
They're intelligent and have a sense of humor

1373
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,580
and are clever.

1374
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,860
And they build houses.

1375
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,520
Yeah, I kind of got to the point where I felt like...

1376
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,020
I mean, there's the crappy little prawns.

1377
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,980
I mean, really small.

1378
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,920
Squid probably aren't that smart.

1379
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,220
Squid are not that smart.

1380
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,340
I kind of started feeling like every time I ate an octopus,

1381
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,820
it was like eating a chimpanzee or a dolphin.

1382
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,840
You don't want to eat chimpanzee.

1383
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,340
That can make you mighty sick.

1384
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,020
But the cephalopods are the highest intellects

1385
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,480
the invertebrates have managed to produce.

1386
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:29,700
And, Stang, did you hear about the giant triassic cephalopod monster

1387
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,340
that...

1388
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,700
The really were giant prairie squids?

1389
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,320
This thing is quite astonishing

1390
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,200
because they discovered that it had been killing ichthyosaurs

1391
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,000
and then making fake octopus tentacles

1392
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,100
out of their bones on the bottom of the then ocean

1393
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,620
in the triassic age.

1394
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,460
The creature itself was never found, but...

1395
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,180
Dr. Howell, they found fossils of cephalopods?

1396
00:52:59,460 --> 00:52:59,580
Yes.

1397
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,660
They found that...

1398
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:06,300
You know the ichthyosaur is not a dinosaur, but an archosaur.

1399
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,160
They grew their largest in the triassic,

1400
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,200
although in the jurassic they were fairly big.

1401
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,240
In the triassic they were whale-sized.

1402
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,860
Well, sir, the food of these ichthyosaurs

1403
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,960
was a kind of cephalopod called an ammonite.

1404
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,980
They had a coiling shell.

1405
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,600
But when certain ichthyosaurs pursued certain ammonites,

1406
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,180
into the very deepest part of the ocean,

1407
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,180
they were seized by enormous tentacles,

1408
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,480
crushed and torn apart,

1409
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,780
and then the possessor of these enormous tentacles,

1410
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,300
whatever it looked like,

1411
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,480
arranged the bones,

1412
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,300
particularly the vertebral bones,

1413
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,300
in patterns on the seafloor...

1414
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:50,500
They had art.

1415
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,720
You're saying they had art, Dr. Howell?

1416
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,380
This art is a picture of cephalopod tentacles,

1417
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,240
and that has fossilized.

1418
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,560
Also, the bones...

1419
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:03,860
The bones of the squashed ichthyosaurs laid in place.

1420
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,260
And it was speculated,

1421
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,880
though some scientists reacted angrily to this line of speculation,

1422
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,780
that a huge, intelligent, and probably lonely,

1423
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:19,180
giant cephalopod created these artworks.

1424
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,460
That's... I would think...

1425
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,320
Living in the black depths of a prehistoric ocean.

1426
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,480
Yeah, I think that's a very good postulate,

1427
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,720
but I was thinking maybe...

1428
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,720
Maybe it was kind of like the...

1429
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,540
What did they call those people in New Guinea

1430
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,660
who built the fake airplanes to try and...

1431
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,520
Oh, cargo culls.

1432
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,300
Yeah, maybe they were...

1433
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,240
But there are no people at this time.

1434
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,020
No, no, I think the cephalopods were

1435
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,640
building things out of bones

1436
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,620
to get the ichthyosaurs to come down.

1437
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,740
Well, whatever it is,

1438
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,240
it has to be large enough to crush a whale-sized animal,

1439
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,640
and large enough to take its bones out

1440
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,060
and...

1441
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:03,880
make a 40-foot-long tentacle-like things on the seafloor

1442
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,220
out of its bones, the vertebral bones.

1443
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:13,580
This song is dedicated to Princess Wee.

1444
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:15,740
Wee!

1445
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,400
That's it.

1446
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,600
Remix!

1447
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,660
this one is

1448
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,080
.

1449
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,100
.

1450
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,100


1451
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,120
.

1452
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,120


1453
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,400
.

1454
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:41,480
.

1455
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:41,480


1456
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:41,540
.

1457
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:41,540


1458
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,200
.

1459
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:42,480
.

1460
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:42,680
.

1461
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:42,740
.

1462
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:42,920
.

1463
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:42,920


1464
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:45,900
.

1465
00:55:45,900 --> 00:56:12,820
piano plays softly

1466
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:19,740
I was bound in sorrow by the mass conspiracy

1467
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:27,200
When the toilet beckoned kindly

1468
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,640
Then it drew me to come see

1469
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:39,200
And the sewage formed a message

1470
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,240
It said, one, three

1471
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,500
Oh, one, three

1472
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:51,220
I then heard a voice from Dovestown

1473
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:56,440
Gently saying, follow me

1474
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,040
There's a crop farm down the valley

1475
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,560
There's a crop farm past the rain

1476
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,220
There's a crop farm

1477
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,480
In your sorrows

1478
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:20,360
When your mind is going insane

1479
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,240
There's a crop farm

1480
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,880
When you're burdened

1481
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:32,380
There's a crop farm where you stray

1482
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,260
There's a crop farm

1483
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,460
Heavenly crop farm

1484
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,920
Crop or kill me

1485
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,200
He did say

1486
00:57:45,040 --> 00:58:08,040
piano plays softly

1487
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,200
Sometimes my friends say

1488
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,420
You can't even see me

1489
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:18,520
And I'm tempted to despair

1490
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,940
Then a son, my dear savior

1491
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,180
Of short duration and I care

1492
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,800
You would pay to know exactly

1493
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,200
What it is you really fear

1494
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,180
You would pay to know exactly what it is you really fear

1495
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,180


1496
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,640
And I'll guarantee you my brother

1497
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,880
You are probably a pink

1498
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,140
But there's a crop farm down the valley

1499
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,620
There's a crop farm past the rain

1500
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:11,280
There's a crop farm in your sorrows

1501
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,960
When your mind is going insane

1502
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,740
There's a frop farm

1503
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,020
When you're burdened

1504
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,420
There's a frop farm

1505
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,520
Where you stray

1506
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,180
There's a frop farm

1507
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,480
Heavenly frop farm

1508
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,820
Frop or kill me

1509
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,980
He did say

1510
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:46,080
He did say
